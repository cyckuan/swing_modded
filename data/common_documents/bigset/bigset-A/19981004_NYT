   PHOENIX - Picture this scenario: Metropolitan Denver residents
defeat a referendum next month to build the Denver Broncos a new
$360 million stadium, prompting team owner Pat Bowlen to announce
that the club is up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles super agent Michael Ovitz, rebuffed in his bid to
get the city an expansion team, buys the Broncos from Bowlen and
says he wants to move them to the nation's second-largest market,
where he has plans for a stadium-entertainment mall project he is
calling The Hacienda. It would be the only stadium in the world
with mission bells that toll after every home-team touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, frustrated
in his bid to get the team a new stadium in the Boston area, makes
a deal with the city of Providence, R.I., to get a stadium there.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Broncos and Patriots play in 2002, one team is based
in Los Angeles and playing in the Rose Bowl until the bells toll at
The Hacienda, and the other team is playing in a city that hasn't
had football since 1931 when the Providence Steam Rollers rolled
out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh. It's not that absurd because the NFL clearly is in
flux.
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland Raiders, who play the Cardinals today at Sun Devil
Stadium, again are talking about moving back to Los Angeles, the
city they left in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say there's a chance the Raiders could come back to LA,''
NFL attorney Frank Rothman told the ``Los Angeles Times.'' ``(It's)
about the same chance of me getting pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, meanwhile, still are trying to get a new stadium
as part of the $1.7 billion Rio Solado Crossing stadium and
convention center project and hope that residents of Gilbert, Mesa
and Queen Creek can vote on the issue in May.
</P>
<P>
   Seven NFL teams are scheduled to get new stadiums in the next
four years _ Detroit, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Seattle, Cleveland,
San Francisco and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Vikings want out of the 64,000-seat Metrodome in
downtown Minneapolis or at least re-work the lease team owners
maintain is the worst in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia Eagles owner Jeff Lurie is desperate to get his
team out of Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft is losing patience that his quest for a new stadium in
Boston has gone nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Bears owner Michael McCaskey was so frustrated a few
years ago by the inability to get a new stadium, he even considered
moving the team to Gary, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody you talk in the league wants to see stabilization,''
said Michael Bidwill, the Cardinals' vice president who has
spearheaded the stadium project. ``No one wants to move. It's not
good for teams, communities or the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   But team owners also think it's not good for their clubs to stay
in stadiums they consider antiquated. They don't think they can
compete financially or on the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The latest collective-bargaining agreement in this league
created a system in which teams that have control over local
revenue and stadiums have the ability to attract and maintain
marquee players much greater than teams that don't,'' Bidwill said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty NFL teams are playing in stadiums built in 1976 or
earlier, including the Cardinals, who play in the fifth-oldest
facility in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Devil Stadium was built in 1958. Only Green Bay's Lambeau
Field (built in 1957), Denver's Mile High Stadium (1948), Chicago's
Soldier Field (1923) and Jacksonville's Municipal Stadium (1920)
are older. The Jaguars' stadium, however, was razed and rebuilt
before the expansion team played its first game.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these stadiums are old and people expect more for
their entertainment dollar,'' said Bruce Allen, Raiders senior
assistant who formerly was general manager of the Arizona Wranglers
of the now-defunct United States Football League. ``I can envision
in 30 years people going to want to have interactive capabilities
in suites.''
</P>
<P>
   When St. Louis lost out to Carolina and Jacksonville for
expansion franchises, city leaders went out and lured away the Los
Angeles Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, Houston and Los Angeles will make one-hour
presentations to NFL owners in Kansas City for an expansion team,
the NFL's 32nd franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, which lost the Oilers to Tennessee two years ago, is
considered the front-runner because prospective owner Bob McNair, a
billionaire who owns Cogen Technologies, has been able to get the
city of Houston, Harris County, the Houston Livestock Show and
Rodeo and the Harris County/Houston Sports Authority working
together.
</P>
<P>
   There already are financial plans set to build a 70,000-seat,
all-glass, retractable dome stadium near the site of the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Houston Mayor Lee Brown, former police chief in Houston and New
York, will tell all who will listen that he went to college on a
football scholarship and knows what it's like to sack a
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston has a mayor who wants the NFL,'' said Brown, a shot at
former Houston Mayor Bob Lanier and at Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan, who has not gone out of his way to help his city's attempt
to get a team.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there are two Los Angeles groups trying to attract a
team _ Ovitz's and the New Coliseum Partners, which is trying to
attract a team back to Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, where the
Raiders played.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz has put together a star-studded group that includes actors
Tom Cruise and Kevin Costner, Los Angeles Lakers Executive Vice
President Jerry West, former Lakers star Magic Johnson and Lakers
center Shaquille O'Neal, who came on board last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love football; it's the first sport I ever played,'' O'Neal
said. ``I remember intercepting a pass my freshman year in high
school and returning it for a touchdown and then someone hitting me
in the knee late. That was it for my football career.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is impressed that glitz will get a team for Ovitz,
whose plans for The Hacienda include a 78,000-seat stadium in
Carson, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the owners weren't going to allow Don Shula and Jim Brown
in, I don't think they care about Jerry West and Shaq,'' the
Raiders' Allen said of failed Cleveland bids.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said much of the talk about the Raiders returning to Los
Angeles has quieted because the team is ``focusing on football.''
</P>
<P>
   But the team's problems in Oakland won't go away. The city of
Oakland and Alameda County (Calif.) have sued the team, and the
Raiders have countersued.
</P>
<P>
   The team sold only about 30,000 season tickets, the number of
personal seat licenses (one-time fee that gives a fan the right to
own a seat) has fallen to about 29,000 and the city of Oakland is
expected to lose $20 million as the result of their deal with the
Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   So even though longtime Raiders fans are trying to get Bay Area
fans excited about the team by promoting the theme ``Trek to
Football Mecca,'' it's realistic that the Raiders could return to
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes noises like he wants to come back to LA and all his
problems will go away, and we'll be lovers forever,'' Rothman said
of Raiders owner Al Davis. ``The only difference between these guys
_ the NFL and Jesse James _ is that James always had the personal
integrity to wear a mask.''
</P>
<P>
   Things haven't gotten as ugly in Denver, where voters are
expected to extend the 0.1 percent Coors Field sales tax to 2012,
which would pay for 75 percent of the cost of a new football
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But if they don't, Broncos owner Pat Bowlen said he likely will
sell the team, and that there is no guarantee that he would sell to
someone that would keep the Super Bowl champions in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be likely to keep the team until it's not competitive, and
that wouldn't be far down the line,'' Bowlen said. &QL;

MEDIOCRITY WOULD BE IMPROVEMENT FOR MANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The richest rookie in NFL history threw only 11 interceptions as
a senior at Tennessee. Now, Indianapolis'  &UR; Peyton Manning is on a
pace to finish with 44, which would break the NFL record of 42 that
 &UR; George
 &UR; Blanda threw for Houston of the American Football League in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   The second-richest rookie in NFL history, now being referred to
as Cryin' (instead of  &UR; Ryan) Leaf, &UR; is averaging $1 million per
turnover.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's offensive line, coached by former Cardinals assistant
 &UR; Carl
 &UR; Mauck, has given up 22 sacks in three games. If the Bills continue
at that pace, they'll finish with a league-record 117.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Bears have been outscored, 44-0, in the third
quarter this season. If that continues, they'll finish the season
allowing 176 points while scoring none in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   They say the meek shall inherit the earth. Maybe that explains
how at the quarter mark, the league's have-nots have engulfed the
rest of the league.
</P>
<P>
   There still are six winless teams, three more than at this time
last year.
</P>
<P>
   One of those six, the Washington Redskins, were the preseason
favorites to win the NFC East, a division in which three .500 teams
are tied for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Another winless club, Carolina, was in the NFC championship game
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's  &UR; Ray Rhodes, coach of the winless Philadelphia
Eagles, who is so frustrated that he stays up all night trying to
find solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm obsessed with it,'' he said. ``It's driving me crazy. It's
driving me up a wall. You can't sleep. How can you sleep when
you're getting your butt kicked? I can't close my eyes. My wife
thinks I'm out of my mind. She's right.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme are seven unbeaten teams, led by the San
Francisco 49ers, who are averaging 533 yards and 37 points, and the
Denver Broncos, who have scored 141 points in three games.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers are on a pace to finish with 8,528 yards and 597
points this season. They've had three consecutive 500-yard games.
They hadn't had two 500-yard games in a row since 1961.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the Broncos' impressive start,  &UR; Mike Shanahan,
coach of the defending Super Bowl champions, is our Coach of the
Year, barely edging  &UR; Mike Ditka, whose New Orleans Saints are 3-0
but have beaten teams that are a combined 1-10.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay quarterback  &UR; Brett Favre, who has won three
consecutive Most Valuable Player awards, again is the MVP after
four games. He has thrown a league-high 10 touchdown passes and is
completing 66.2 percent of his throws.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos running back  &UR; Terrell Davis, who has nearly 500 rushing
yards in four games, is the Offensive Player of the Year at this
point.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's  &UR; Jermaine Lewis, who has returned two punts for
touchdowns, is the Special Teams Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina defensive end  &UR; Kevin Greene, who has seven sacks, is
the Comeback Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   The Rookies of the Year are Minnesota wide receiver  &UR; Randy Moss
(17 catches for 273 yards and four scores) on offense, Green Bay
tackle
 &UR; Vonnie Holliday (four sacks) on defense and South Mountain High
School graduate  &UR; Terry Fair of Detroit (two kickoff returns for
touchdowns) on special teams. &QL; 
Reality check &QL; 
Manning, 0-4 this season, lost only six games in four years at
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot, Peyton hasn't lost four games in a row since he played
in the back yard against me,'' said Manning's older brother,
 &UR; Cooper, 24. &QL; 
 &UR; Terry Bradshaw, the Hall of Fame quarterback for the Pittsburgh
Steelers who works for FOX, thinks Manning has handled his
struggles much better than Leaf, who continues to battle the San
Diego media.
</P>
<P>
   Manning and Leaf will face each other today in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan Leaf is going to be a great quarterback in the NFL, but
right now he has to understand he is going to struggle,'' Bradshaw
said. ``Ryan, you have to grow up and learn to deal with the media
because no matter what you do, there's always going to be
criticism. You just have to accept it. It's all part of the
maturation process.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaf has thrown six interceptions and lost three fumbles in the
past two games and has a turnover-touchdown ratio of 11-1.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, he said, ``I feel like my heart's been ripped
out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradshaw added: ``One of the biggest reasons why Peyton Manning
was drafted ahead of Ryan Leaf was because Manning is much more
mature. Leaf has to learn how to deal with criticism. It's easy to
accept praise, but it's very difficult to live with people
criticizing you.'' &QL; 
Impeach Norv?
</P>
<P>
   The ``Washington Pos''t's Style section had a picture of
embattled Redskins Coach  &UR; Norv Turner this week next to a headline
that said, ``This Town's Other Scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   A subhead said, ``We've Tried Censure. What's next for Norv?''
</P>
<P>
   Writer  &UR; Frank Ahrens said: ``Forget about the other guy. It's
time to get rid of the man who's really an embarrassment to
Washington. Impeach Norv!''
</P>
<P>
   The story quoted a Washington TV personality as saying Turner
was the opposite of  &UR; President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a bad job rating but good personal character,'' said
 &UR; William Kristol, who is a regular on ABC-TV's ``This Week'' Sunday
news program. &QL; 
Friend of the president &QL; 
Saints offensive tackle  &UR; Willie Roaf, a page to Clinton when he was
Arkansas governor in the early 1980s, was an overnight guest in the
White House in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``What President Clinton did was wrong,'' Roaf said of Clinton's
acknowledged womanizing. ``But it's been known for years, even when
he was governor in Arkansas, that he chased skirts. I don't think
it's right what he did, but I don't think he should be impeached.''
</P>
<P>
   Roaf said he stayed in the Queen's Room on the second floor of
the north wing of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Did he meet  &UR; Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, by then they had broken it off,'' Roaf said. &QL; 
Quick kicks &QL; 
Lions safety  &UR; Mark Carrier said he didn't deserve to be suspended
for one game for his hit on Tampa Bay wide receiver  &UR; Brice Hunter.
``Because it was on ``Monday Night Football'' and everyone saw it,
they think they should do something,'' said Carrier, who broke his
silence on the incident in a Thursday interview on Phoenix radio
station KMVP-AM (860).
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis Rams Coach  &UR; Dick Vermeil, on suggestions from fans and
media that he is out of touch with the NFL game: ``If it was
 &UR; Bill Walsh, Jim Mora or  &UR; Bill Parcells . . . if it were the coaches
who felt I lost it, then I'd resign. But I feel good about the
progress we're making and think we're moving faster than what
people give us credit for.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle linebacker  &UR; Chad Brown still can't believe he was booed
by Steelers fans in his first time returning to Three Rivers
Stadium since he signed as a free agent with the Seahawks. ``Two
years ago, the fans loved me,'' he said. ``Now, they give me the
finger. Their $45 (ticket) doesn't obligate them to cuss at me. If
they saw me on the street and cussed at me, I'd beat their
(butts).'' &QL;

FOCUSED BRUINS DOMINATE WSU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The questions, the memories, the chatter
during practice _ everything was Washington State this, Washington
State that for the UCLA Bruins this week.
</P>
<P>
   But truth be told, what transpired Saturday at the Rose Bowl had
very little to do with Washington State and everything to do with
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Houston? UCLA's offensive linemen did. They remembered
quarterback Cade McNown getting knocked down 16 times. They
remembered the Bruins rushing for a meager 89 yards and looking
unusually mortal against a second-rate team in a third-rate
facility.
</P>
<P>
   And they did not forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were much more focused on what happened at Houston than we
were the (1997) Washington State game,'' UCLA guard Andy Meyers
said. ``We talked about it in practice. We had to shore up our
protection and get the running game going.''
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of action in UCLA's 49-17 victory Saturday in
front of 67,210. It had long runs and longer passes. It had blocked
punts, blocked kicks, fumbles and spirited defense. It had human
pinballs _ McNown impersonating, well, McNown _ and a dose of
redemption for a certain tailback from Lancaster.
</P>
<P>
   Just as they did last year, the No.4 Bruins took advantage of
opponent turnovers and the resulting short fields _ average
starting position: their 48-yard line _ to score early and score
often. They bolted to a 28-0 lead in the second quarter on scoring
drives of 42, 48, 54 and 6 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fumbled the ball (three) times and gave UCLA good field
position,'' Cougars coach Mike Price said. ``Anytime you give UCLA
a chance to score, they're going to score. They're a damn good
offensive football team.''
</P>
<P>
   And at the heart of the Bruins' 13th consecutive victory was a
dominating performance by their offensive line, which did not
confuse the Houston Cougars with the Wazu Cougars. Meyers, Shawn
Stuart and Kris Farris established their presence instantly,
knocking Washington State off the ball and carving huge holes for
Jermaine Lewis and Co.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA rushed for a season-high 256 yards, and did it against the
Pac-10's No.2 run defense. The Cougars had been allowing just 105.5
yards per game on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offensive line took command early in the game,'' offensive
coordinator Al Borges said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins rushed for 98 yards just in the first quarter,
beginning with Lewis' 15-yard charge on the first play and ending
with his 9-yard burst through the right side.
</P>
<P>
   The tailback finished with 94 yards and two touchdowns, finally
and completely exterminating the lingering demons from his failed
fourth-and-1 run last year at Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let it go last season, but it carried over for this game,''
Lewis said. ``People started bringing it up. It's good to finally
clear my name.... I have to give credit to the line. There were big
holes, and I just made the right reads.''
</P>
<P>
   If not Lewis, it was Keith Brown (two touchdowns) or impressive
freshman DeShaun Foster (77 yards). The Bruins rotated their
tailbacks seamlessly; each had plenty of running room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we could move the pile, and we moved the pile,'' coach
Bob Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Good thing, too, because McNown did not play to his lofty
standards. Yes, he completed 14 of 27 passes for 205 yards, but he
underthrew open receivers several times and was intercepted once.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he was rusty; the Bruins (3-0, 1-0) hadn't played in two
weeks because of the canceled game at Miami. Perhaps Washington
State's defense disrupted his rhythm; the Cougars are young but
swift. Either way, UCLA managed 49 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense played well enough to get yards and score
points,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   For once, in fact, the offense was UCLA's least-impressive unit.
The special teams blocked two punts: one by DuVal Hicks, which set
up a 6-yard touchdown drive, the other by Ali Azziz. And the
defense _ porous at Houston, riddled with injuries on the line _
played its most complete game of the season, holding Washington
State's sputtering offense to 314 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleased with the way we swarmed to the ball,'' Toledo
said. ``It was hard to tell who played well because we had so many
guys flying around.''

BRUINS BOW AS ALLISON RETURNS

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Pesky forward Esa Tikkanen scored at the 11-minute mark
of the third period, lifting the New York Rangers to a 3-1 victory
over the Bruins at the FleetCenter. It marked the exhibition debut
of center Jason Allison, who came to contract terms with the Bruins
Thursday, practiced for the first time Friday, and jumped right
into the lineup Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take him long to make his presence felt.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers drew first blood at 2:08 of the opening period when
former New Jersey Devil John MacLean banged in a rebound of a Scott
Fraser shot past goalie Byron Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two minutes later, the Bruins pulled even, with
Allison setting up the score on the power play. Allison,
maneuvering behind the net, dished a pass to Steve Heinze, who
fired a shot on goalie Mike Richter. The netminder stopped Heinze's
bid for one of his 34 saves, but rookie Peter Nordstrom was there
to bang home the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, who had outshot New York, 11-8, in the first period,
outshot the visitors in the second, 13-3. Neither team, however,
could score. Boston had a five-on-three advantage for 1:20 but
overpassed the puck and managed just two shots on Richter.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie defenseman Jonathan Girard, the Bruins' first pick
(second round) in last June's draft, showed some flair on the power
play as he manned the right point with Ray Bourque on the left. No
doubt, he will be urged to shoot more.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers decided the game midway through the third when
flashy Alexei Kovalev dished a pass to Wayne Gretzky. Gretzky, off
to Dafoe's right, fired a backhander into the left circle for
Tikkanen, who one-timed it past Dafoe, who faced a total of just 19
shots, at 11:00.
</P>
<P>
   Niklas Sundstrom added a shorthanded empty-net goal with 27
seconds left as Boston's exhibition record fell to 2-5-1 with one
game left, Sunday's 5 p.m. rematch Hartford.

FATHER FOLLOWING SHORTSTOP'S FOOTSTEPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He drove in 11 runs in four games, a record for any
Division Series, even those that have gone the maximum five games.
He drove in at least one run in all four games the Red Sox played
and hit home runs in three of them, accounting Saturday night for
Boston's only run.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Nomar Garciaparra had just finished one of the great
postseason performances by anyone. Would the time come when he
could look back on what he'd done and appreciate it for what it
was?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he said, ``when we win the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Red Sox clubhouse at Fenway Park, where family and
friends were gathered, Ramon Garciaparra, who had taken some time
off from his job as a high school coach in southern California, was
awaiting his son.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to the father and perhaps you will understand why Nomar
Garciaparra's career has known only an upward curve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell him, `Somebody always is better than you,''' said Ramon
Garciaparra, who is never more than a phone call away from his son,
who calls on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a satellite dish and we always go over his game, how
he's doing,'' added the elder Garciaparra, who can recall only one
week in which he did not see his son's games in the three sports in
which he excelled in high school: soccer, football, and of course,
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went as a family to Mexico,'' Ramon Garciaparra said.
``Nomar had some club soccer games and stayed home. Those are the
only games I missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why it was so hard for me when Nomar went to college. I
couldn't see any of his games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox shortstop gave his father an eyeful this weekend. On
Friday, his two-run home run in the bottom of the ninth drew the
Sox within a run in their 4-3 loss to the Indians. Saturday he led
off the fourth with a 411-foot home run off Bartolo Colon, the
Indians starter who had held Garciaparra hitless in 10 at-bats
during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Before Saturday, Garciaparra hit a three-run homer and sacrifice
fly for four RBIs in Game 1, a two-run double and sacrifice fly for
three RBIs in Game 2, and a fielder's choice and two-run homer for
three RBIs in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a guy who weighed 137 pounds his last year in high
school, according to his father, a small but well-built man who at
Don Bosco High in Rosemead, Calif., coaches the junior varsity
soccer team and is the baseball team's pitching coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was young, he was always the smallest kid on every
team he played,'' his father said.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra had other options besides Georgia Tech when he
graduated from St. John Bosco in nearby Whittier. UCLA wanted him
to be its football placekicker and play baseball, while Arkansas
wanted him strictly to kick for the football team. ``They didn't
even know he played baseball,'' Ramon Garciaparra said. ``UCLA was
very tempting, but Nomar just had a gut feeling about Georgia
Tech.''
</P>
<P>
   Father expects son to return home to California this winter,
even though he maintains a home in the Boston area. He likes to
watch his sisters, Monique, 16, and Yvette, 13, play soccer and his
brother, Michael, 15, play the same three sports in which Nomar
excelled.
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman, Michael earned varsity letters in football,
baseball, and soccer. ``He actually could be ahead of Nomar,''
Ramon Garciaparra said. ``He's already almost as big as Nomar is
now.''

MARTINEZ READY, BUT HE DIDN'T GO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Hello, no, Pedro won't go.
</P>
<P>
   Such remained the battle cry in the corner office of the Red Sox
clubhouse Saturday afternoon, manager Jimy Williams sticking by his
decision not to reach for his $75 million arm in the club's biggest
money game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro rode the pine and Pete Schourek, the 1-2 lefthander, toed
the rubber. And the rest was inked in the annals of Red Sox
history, inning by inning.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief pregame news conference, Williams was asked to assess
Schourek's frame of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete? ... Pete ... Pete Schourek?'' said Williams, in a tone
that could only be interpreted as practiced nonchalance. ``I
haven't seen him, so I imagine he's pretty good. I imagine he's
looking forward to pitching, and I'm looking forward to watching
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams wasn't alone in his anticipation, but it appeared he
shared a minority opinion in Red Sox Nation. Following Game 3, a
4-3 Cleveland victory that gave the Indians a 2-1 advantage in the
best-of-five American League Division Series, radio talk shows
filled the air with royal rooters lamenting the fact that Williams
wouldn't call on Martinez to be his main man.
</P>
<P>
   Even former Sox first baseman George Scott got in on the airwave
act of angst. The Boomer, manager of the Massachusetts Mad Dogs in
Lynn, called Ted Sarandis on WEEI and cast his vote for Martinez.
The Boomer talked of Jim Lonborg in '67. In times of need, reach
for the obvious. Why wait for Game 5 when Game 5 may never come?
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said Friday night that he twice asked Williams if he
could have the ball in Game 4. He said he was twice denied. The
manager told him he was looking out for his arm, his future, the
days and decades to come in Red Sox history.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he understood. He said he appreciated what the
manager was saying, doing. But he also said he wanted the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been strong in the arm and shoulder,'' said
Martinez, whose 1-2 record in September didn't make a strong
supporting case for his statement. ``I've never had a problem with
my arm or shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   It came down to this: Martinez was willing, but Williams and
pitching coach Joe Kerrigan didn't feel he was able. On Friday,
hours before Game 3, Kerrigan was making reference to Martinez's
slight build (167 pounds) and the great number of innings and
pitches he logged this season. Kerrigan watched Martinez throw
after his fine Game 1 performance and felt the staff ace didn't
have the necessary steam to pitch on only three days of rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be very impatient,'' said Martinez, asked what his
emotions would be watching Game 4 from the sidelines. ``Especially
if we don't start out ... but I'm thinking positively, positive
that they can do it without me. I'll have my cleats on and I'll be
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The hours on the baseball sundial burned away silently. Some 18
hours after leaving the park Friday night, Martinez was back in the
Back Bay ballyard, uniform clean, cleats laced and at the ready. No
need. There would be no call.
</P>
<P>
   In the pregame news conference, Williams was asked whom he had
ready for bullpen duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody but Pedro,'' said the manager. He was sticking by
his decision _ and while Schourek's 5 1/3 shutout innings justified
it, there will be no Game 5. So Martinez will be fresh for his next
start. In April.

KIM WAVED RUN GOODBYE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Wendell Kim's body language, the shrug of his shoulders
and his limited words, said what had to be said. The Red Sox third
base coach gave John Valentin the go-ahead to try for home in the
sixth inning Saturday, which turned out to be a one-way ticket to a
dead end.
</P>
<P>
   But what was Kim to do? Time was running out, and this was no
time to be playing cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the lead, 1-0, and I thought it was a good move,'' said
Kim, needlessly offering himself up for blame. ``It didn't work
out. That's part of it. There's a lot more involved, but I'm not
going to explain myself.''
</P>
<P>
   No need, really. Holding tenuously to the lead, faced with
postseason elimination, the light-hitting Sox were forced into
trying to manufacture a run. A one-run lead in Fenway Park means
little for any team, but it was clear early on in this series _
even in the Game 1 assault in Cleveland _ that much of the Boston
lineup wasn't going to make much of a contribution on offense.
</P>
<P>
   When Kim gave Valentin the order to wheel around third on Mike
Stanley's single to left, Troy O'Leary was the on-deck hitter, with
Scott Hatteberg to follow. O'Leary came into the evening with an
.083 average in the series. Hatteberg had gone 1 for 7 (.143). All
that considered, a loose ball in left field was all Kim had to see.
Valentin got the green light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to be aggressive,'' said Valentin, who was cut down
easily and cleanly by David Justice's peg to catcher Sandy Alomar,
a play that proved fatal in the Sox' 2-1 season-ending loss. ``I
didn't really know the place the ball went, whether (Justice) is
bobbling it or what. I'm just reading my third base coach.''
</P>
<P>
   As Valentin raced for home, dead duck to be, Nomar Garciaparra,
on first with an intentional walk after Valentin's double, set his
sights on taking third. His hope, with only one out, was to draw
Justice's throw, make himself a living, huffing, one-run sacrifice.
If Garciaparra was out at third, it meant Valentin was home free.
</P>
<P>
   Justice wasn't biting. Third baseman Travis Fryman, the cutoff
man on the play, also wasn't going for Garciaparra's wounded duck
decoy. Justice's heave was ticketed for home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw (Garciaparra) and I knew we had an easy out at third
base,'' said Fryman. ``But we are down one run and I thought we had
a chance on the play at the plate. It's easy for me to give up that
out at third base because I thought we had a good chance (at
home).''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary then came to the plate with two outs and ended the
inning with a fly to center. He finished the day 0 for 4. After
him, the Nos. 7, 8, and 9 hitters went a collective 0 for 9. The
bottom half of the the Sox lineup was a constant rerun of ``Death
Valley Days.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams, as always refusing to point fingers, said
the offensive failures didn't factor into Kim's thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wendell made the right decision,'' said Williams. ``Valentin
made a good effort. That's all you can ask. We put the pressure on
the defensive side, and they executed well.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Sox had been ahead by two runs, said Kim, the decision
would not have been the same. He would have flashed the hold sign,
Valentin would have pulled up at third, and the bases would have
been loaded with one out. A deep fly then would have pushed
Valentin home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were other reasons (for sending Valentin),'' said Kim,
still not wanting to elaborate on the obvious, ``if you look at the
situation. I made the decision and it didn't turn out. Basically,
it was my fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember, too, said Kim, that Justice had to run toward the
left-field line to retrieve Stanley's single.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what arm does he throw with?'' asked Kim, noting that the
play was slightly harder for Justice, a lefthander, because he
would have to stop, change momentum, and make his throw. ``I
figured we had a good chance.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be Boston's only chance. O'Leary fanned to end
the inning, not even swinging at strike three. The Sox got
Hatteberg as far as second base in the seventh, but he died there.
Vaughn doubled in the eighth, and pinch runner Donnie Sadler soon
moved to third, where he was stranded on an O'Leary inning-ending
fly. The Sox went 1-2-3 in the ninth, with hitters 7, 8, and 9
erased on two rollers and a strikeout. The bottom five hitters
finished 1 for 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was I surprised? Not really,'' said Valentin, asked once more
about getting the go-ahead from Kim. ``It's a short left field and
everything, but you want him to make the play. And he did. Justice
isn't usually in left field, so you want him to make the throw. You
want to be aggressive. I look at the third base coach, I see his

GORDON'S ARRIVAL PART OF MASTER PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In baseball times not so long ago _ but before Tony La
Russa and the breakdown of specialists into sub-specialists _ the
decision on when to call a pitcher out of the bullpen and into a
playoff game might not have been made before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is what Red Sox manager Jimy Williams and pitching
coach Joe Kerrigan decided before Saturday's season-ending 2-1 loss
to the Indians. If the Sox had the lead going into the eighth
inning of this survival game, Tom Gordon would be brought in.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox had a 1-0 lead. Gordon, the Red Sox closer, was
brought in to pitch. Never before this season had he been brought
in to start the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had it set up just the way we planned it before the game,''
said Kerrigan. ``There wasn't even a decision to make. We had
planned it out before the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet if there is one constant in playoff baseball, it is that
some players respond to pressure and some don't, just as some
managers respond to pressure and some don't. Williams and Kerrigan
had insisted before Saturday's game that starting Pete Schourek
instead of Pedro Martinez was merely a continuation of what had
been done all season _ staying with the rotation. But by using
Gordon this way, the brain trust deviated from what had been done
all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had (Gordon) down on our card because he'd had two full
days off,'' said Kerrigan. ``He could get six outs.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, in baseball times not so long past, the fact that
Derek Lowe had pitched so strongly in the sixth and seventh innings
for the Red Sox, retiring all five batters he faced, might have
been a consideration when deciding who should pitch the eighth. The
decision to remove Lowe had been made even before the seventh
inning had been completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lowe had been up the day before, and then three innings two
days before that, 38 pitches, long innings, with a pitching
change,'' said Kerrigan. ``After (Lowe) got the second out in the
seventh (a ground out to third by Richie Sexson), I just looked at
Jimy and Jimy looked at me, and we both just nodded. We both knew
what we were going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was, after Saturday's game and the season were done,
Gordon sat by his locker for long minutes. From time to time,
Gordon would stare into his locker and then he would bury his face
in his hands. Teammates came by to console him, first Mo Vaughn,
then Kerrigan, and next Bret Saberhagen. In time, Gordon was able
to talk about the night his 43 consecutive saves went for naught in
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Was getting six outs an issue for him?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' replied Gordon. ``Not for me, no. I was ready to pitch,
regardless if they brought me in in the seventh.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said he went through the same routine he always had,
threw many of the same pitches he had all year, did all the same
things that had resulted in save after save.
</P>
<P>
   ``All year I've been able to throw those pitches (fastballs
inside) and get ground-ball outs and even fly-ball outs with broken
bats,'' said Gordon. ``But tonight it didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after retiring Joey Cora on a soft fly to left to open
the eighth, Gordon threw to Kenny Lofton, who broke his bat but
flared a single to center. Next, the light-hitting Omar Vizquel hit
Gordon hard, stroking a single to right.
</P>
<P>
   After Lofton stole third, bringing the tying run only 90 feet
from the plate, ``I threw a pitch to (David) Justice, and Justice
is a good hitter. If he gets his pitch, he's going to hit it.''
Justice did, a rope double to the triangle in right-center, driving
in the tying and winning runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't change my approach. I didn't change one thing,'' said
Gordon. ``I stuck with the program.''
</P>
<P>
   If only the Red Sox brain trust could say the same.

REFLECTIVE TIME FOR DUQUETTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ ``I'll tell you soon,'' responded Red Sox general
manager Dan Duquette when he was asked what his club's playoff loss
to the Indians told him about his team and what improvements must
be made for next season. ``I don't have an answer for you now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the minutes following the Sox' season-ending 2-1 loss to the
Indians Saturday night, Duquette made his rounds in the dressing
room, quietly shaking hands with his charges, softly speaking words
of encouragement. He said he was proud of his team and he singled
out three players for their season-long leadership: Mo Vaughn, Bret
Saberhagen, and Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll address next year another time,'' said Duquette. ``We
needed to score some more runs. We wanted to score some more runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, you need five runs to win at Fenway Park. Everyone
in your lineup needs to produce offensively in the American League.
How many did we score in the first game here? Three, right? Three
yesterday and only one today. It's not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox' offensive attack disappeared after the meat of the
order. All of Red Sox Nation had its eyes focused on why Pete
Schourek and not Pedro Martinez was the Game 4 starter. It turned
out to be a nonissue. Schourek pitched splendidly, easily well
enough for the Sox to win. He had to pitch through a nine-man
batting order, while Indians starter Bartolo Colon faced only a
four-man lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made some good progress this year,'' said Duquette. ``We
won 90 games for the first time in a long time and we won a playoff
game. Both are good achievements for our organization. But we're
disappointed that we aren't playing deeper in October. We're
disappointed it ended so abruptly.''

JUSTICE A TWO-WAY STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There was an added sense of satisfaction in David
Justice's smile. He got his wish to play both ways, and, well, the
Red Sox are checking tee times Sunday because he did.
</P>
<P>
   Justice delivered two game-turning plays _ one in the field and
one at the plate _ in Cleveland's 2-1 victory over the Red Sox
Saturday at Fenway Park that clinched the best-of-five American
League Division Series in four games. They came two innings apart
and they illustrated not only Justice's versatility but also his
dependability.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to play left field when the series moved to Boston. He
let management know about it, and after two games in Cleveland as
the designated hitter, he was in left for Games 3 and 4. The
Indians are mighty glad they made the change.
</P>
<P>
   Justice's big play in the field kept the Indians in the game.
His big play at the plate gave the Indians the lead and silenced
Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed you why David Justice is David Justice,'' said
Indians manager Mike Hargrove. ``He is able to do things like that
because he is a tremendous athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   This is how it went down. The Red Sox led, 1-0, in the sixth
when John Valentin doubled to left. Justice almost nailed Valentin
then and there. He got a second chance a few minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   After Mo Vaughn popped to Kenny Lofton in center and Nomar
Garciaparra was intentionally walked, Mike Stanley lined a single
to left. Valentin was given the green light and Justice made him
pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I was thinking was catch the ball, but the
ball had such overspin that I knew I wouldn't be able to catch
it,'' Justice said. ``So I just needed to set up and make a throw.
I felt like I was going to make a perfect throw on one hop.''
</P>
<P>
   Was he surprised to see Valentin sent home? No. The company line
from the Indians clubhouse was that it was worth the risk in a
close game.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't even close. Justice's one-hopper was taken in by Sandy
Alomar, who had time for tea and crumpets before applying the tag.
</P>
<P>
   This was the way Justice envisioned himself helping the Indians.
He was a big star as the DH in Game 2, delivering a three-run
homer, and has by far the most postseason at-bats of any Cleveland
regular. But he also wants to play in the field, which can be a
challenge sometimes because of injuries. He underwent knee surgery
last November and was slow coming around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked them to start me,'' he said. ``I'm a career National
Leaguer and I play defense, too. You can help your team as a
designated hitter, but if you're the DH and you're not hitting,
that's no good.''
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't the DH and he was hitting. He got the second and
last of the two hits off Pete Schourek, chasing the Sox starter
with a double to left-center in the sixth. He got to third but died
there.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the eighth. Lofton and Omar Vizquel delivered one-out
singles off Tom Gordon, and Justice was in the spotlight again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a man on third, so I was just thinking, `Don't strike
out or pop up,''' he said. ``If I just put the ball in play, I have
a chance to drive in a run and I was able to hit it pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I went up there, I said, `God, you have put me in
situations like this and here is a time when I need your strength.'
When I walked into the box, I said, `This may be my last at-bat for
the evening.' So I took the first pitch just to get a feel for his
velocity and then I was looking for a pitch I could handle.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon gave him a fastball and Justice sent a laser to the
triangle in center. Both runners scored. Justice ended up on
second.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hit it, I was just saying, `Thank you, God. Thank you,
God,' all the way to first base. You can check the tape,'' he said.
``I was so excited. But the way I hit it, I probably should have
had a triple.''
</P>
<P>
   It may have been the only thing he didn't do all game.

VICTORY CELEBRATION LASTS JUST ONE WEEK FOR PRAIRIE VIEW A&AMP;M
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The after-party for the Prairie View A&AMP;M football team
lasted exactly seven days.
</P>
<P>
   A week after breaking its NCAA-record 80-game losing streak, the
celebration finally stopped for the Panthers. Grambling State
University unleashed a powerful second-half attack to turn out the
lights on the Panthers, 55-40, before a crowd of 33,549 in the Al
Lipscomb State Fair Classic last night at the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Grambling is now 2-2 overall and 2-0 in the Southwestern
Athletic Conference. Prairie View dropped to 1-3 overall and 0-2 in
the SWAC.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers entered the game on a high after last week's
record-breaking 14-12 victory against Langston University. Prairie
View rode that confidence builder into Dallas, and was tied with
GSU at the half, 21-21.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Tigers unleashed a scoring surge that brought the
Panthers to their knees. In particular, a 12-second spurt late in
the third period all but settled this battle.
</P>
<P>
   GSU fullback Rodney Beaudoin tallied his third touchdown of the
game on a 16-yard burst with 24 seconds left in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   On the ensuing kickoff, Prairie View's Kevin Bell fumbled at his
20, and Grambling's Vyron Brown picked up the ball and dashed into
the end zone for a 55-27 lead with 12 seconds to go in the period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think conditioning and the fact we had a little bit more
depth probably made the difference,'' GSU coach Doug Williams said.
``I told the kids before the game that Prairie View came to play,
and it was evident that they came to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the second half, Grambling moved ahead, 35-21, after
scoring a pair of touchdowns in 1:30. The first one came on a
47-yard pass from quarterback Lionel Hayes to David Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   The next touchdown came three plays after Prairie View's
third-string quarterback _ freshman Jamaal Foster _ entered the
game. Foster fumbled after he was stacked up in the backfield, and
defensive lineman Michael Johnson scooped up the ball and rambled
15 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fatigue and mental focus cost us,'' PV coach Greg Johnson
said. ``If we don't come in focused, we can't make plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a first for us \Rtrying to win two consecutive
games\S. But my kids played with a lot of heart and a lot of fight.
I was proud of them. But we didn't have enough people to play with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The one consolation for the Panthers is that they scored the
most points in a game since they defeated Bishop College, 44-21, in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   GSU tied the game at 21-21 with 4:34 left before halftime when
Lionel Hayes scrambled out of the pocket and found Scotty Anderson
for a 19-yard touchdown. Anderson caught the ball at the 10, and
did a tightrope job the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-play, 73-yard march was basically a gift from the
Panthers as they twice prolonged the Tigers' excursion with costly
penalties. On the latter one, the Tigers were in punt formation on
fourth-and-four. But an illegal substitution by Prairie View cost
it 5 yards and gave GSU a first down.
</P>
<P>
   Three plays later, Hayes connected with Anderson for the
touchdown. Hayes completed 20 of 35 passes for 341 yards for two
touchdowns, and also ran for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew Prairie View was going to be high, so we wanted to
jump out on top of them early,'' Hayes said. ``But I wasn't worried
about anything at the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we were going to get it together. I knew our offense
was going to finally start clicking, and I knew our defense was
going to start making some plays.''

HANDING SCHOUREK BALL RIGHT CALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The gloom enveloping the Red Sox locker room lasted
long minutes. Player after player sat at his locker staring ahead,
seeing nothing or seeing the chance that had slipped away. Finally,
Pete Schourek stepped forward and spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to answer many questions,'' the Red Sox' Game 4
starter began in the middle of the locker room. ``I just want to
say thanks to the Boston fans. You know, when I came out of the
dugout (at the start of the game), and they were behind me. I
really appreciated that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Achilles' heel of the Red Sox all season _ inconsistent and
weak hitting _ did in a Boston team that was good enough to beat
the Indians, if not any more teams in this postseason. For sure,
the fatal problem was not the choice of starter Saturday _ Schourek
over staff ace Pedro Martinez _ which had prompted an endless media
howl the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   If the media had been howling instead that Martinez should take
a bat in his hand and start in left field instead of Troy O'Leary,
that paragon of mediocrity, or in right field instead of Darren
Bragg, it might have been more to the point. Schourek proved the
howl was misplaced: The Red Sox had the right starting pitcher,
even though they wound up losing to the Indians, 2-1, and being
eliminated in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually got to say thanks to Jimy (Williams), too, for
putting his ass out on the line for me,'' Schourek said. ``You know
... I hope ... it felt like he made the right decision. I pitched
pretty good; it just wasn't in the cards for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Schourek gave up no runs and a mere two hits in 5 1/3 innings,
walking four but proving as gutsy as his postseason ERA (1.35 in
four appearances spanning 26 innings) indicates.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, for instance, Travis Fryman doubled with
one out and stole third as yet another Red Sox catcher _ this time
Scott Hatteberg _ held the ball in a tight situation. But Schourek
got Richie Sexson with heat for a swinging strikeout and ended the
inning when Sandy Alomar grounded to Nomar Garciaparra at
shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, after Fryman walked, Schourek ended the inning by
picking the Cleveland third baseman off first. And in the fifth,
Schourek walked Sexson and Alomar with one out but retired Enrique
Wilson on a long fly to right, allowing Sexson to reach third.
</P>
<P>
   Then he bore down again with a runner on third as Kenny Lofton
flied out to Darren Lewis in center for the third consecutive time.
It was clutch pitching at its best in a tight ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians were duly impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest,'' said Fryman, ``when he walked off the field
and got that standing ovation, I felt like clapping, too. I can't
imagine what pressure he must have been under. I've got a lot of
respect for Jimy Williams for sticking to his guns. The guy pitched
a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alomar concurred: ``Schourek pitched a great game. I don't
see how Pedro would do any better. He kept them in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   And David Justice, whose two-run eighth-inning double off Tom
Gordon settled the series, paid the ultimate tribute: ``Schourek
was Pedro-like out there. Two hits, no runs. He did his job. How
much better is Pedro going to do than that? Schourek was
outstanding. He shut us down.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it made no difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a whole lot you can say,'' said Schourek.
</P>
<P>
   But you pitched a good game?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   Could he be at least partially happy with his performance,
considering how the media had howled that he should be pushed off
the mound?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah ... but still, the bottom line is we lost. There's not a
whole lot more you can really think about or really say,'' said
Schourek. ``We're on our way home.''
</P>
<P>
   But not because of Pete Schourek.

WALKER'S PRESENCE FELT AS WILLIAMS' 350 YARDS, 5 TDS POWER
LONGHORNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ While the eyes of Texas were once again upon the
Longhorns' Heisman hopeful Ricky Williams, he felt the gaze of only
two.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he felt as if his friend and Texas football
legend, Doak Walker, was glancing down on him. Walker, 71, died
last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of times,'' Williams said of feeling Walker's
presence.
</P>
<P>
   Williams honored his friend with a performance befitting the SMU
legend. Williams had 350 yards rushing and five touchdowns in
Texas' 54-33 Big 12 victory against Iowa State last night at
Royal-Memorial Stadium. Texas is 3-2, overall and 0-2 in the Big 12
and Iowa State is 2-3, 0-2.
</P>
<P>
   Williams introduced himself to Walker while in Dallas in January
to a accept the Doak Walker Award for college football's top
running back.
</P>
<P>
   A friendship quickly developed.
</P>
<P>
   Walker was paralyzed in a skiing accident 10 days later,
touching Williams in a way he hardly imagined. Then came Walker's
death.
</P>
<P>
   Williams sent a message of condolence to Walker's family. He
displayed Walker's No. 37 on his helmet. His biggest tribute,
though, came with his performance.
</P>
<P>
   He scored his fifth and final touchdown of the night, his 20th
this season and his 67th of his Texas career with 6 minutes, 37
seconds remaining in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a really tough week for Ricky. We could see it in
practice,'' Longhorns linebacker Dusty Renfro said. ``There was a
lot going on and he overcame it all. We've almost come to expect
that from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' 350-yard performance established a Longhorns mark, and
also began a full-fledged assault on NCAA all-times lists.
</P>
<P>
   In a single game, he jumped to No. 1 in touchdowns (67) and
rushing touchdowns (65). He also jumped six players to take over
the No. 4 spot on the NCAA all-time rushing list with 5,241 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Only Tony Dorsett (6,082), Charles White (5,598) and Herschel
Walker (5,259) have more.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's not the best player in the country, he's definitely
one of them,'' said Texas coach Mack Brown said, resuming Williams'
Heisman campaign in earnest. ``He's a tremendous competitor and a
tremendous athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   And with everybody's eyes on Williams _ including Iowa State's _
UT's passing game had a field day, too.
</P>
<P>
   Longhorns quarterback Major Applewhite went 3-for-3 for 71 yards
on Texas' opening drive, including a 9-yard touchdown pass to Derek
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite finished 15-for-26 for 248 yards and two touchdowns.
Kwame Cavil and Derek Lewis were Applewhite's main targets, gaining
102 and 60 yards, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' much-maligned defense, ranking 99th among 112 Division
I-A defenses, held Cyclones tailback Darren Davis to 53 yards on 20
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping Todd Bandhauer-to-Damien Groce proved to be another
deal altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Bandhauer finished with an Iowa State-record 437 yards passing
and five touchdowns while Groce had 10 receptions for 137 yards and
two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Texas responded to that inadequacy by simply scoring more _ a
Williams-led endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   He has generated bigger numbers and gaudier performances in his
time.
</P>
<P>
   He displayed his most emotional against Iowa State, a player
remembering a player and a friend in a way only players appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a hard week,'' Williams said, school, a bit of
soreness and Walker keeping him up late into Friday night. ``He was
in my heart the whole game.''
High marks Highlights of Ricky Williams' record night:
</P>
<P>
   Set a UT single-game rushing record of 350 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Set the NCAA career record for touchdowns with 67 and rushing
touchdowns with 65.
</P>
<P>
   Set the NCAA career record (404) for most points by a
non-kicker.
</P>
<P>
   Jumped to fourth place on the NCAA career rushing list with
5,241 yards, past Archie Griffin of Ohio State, who had 5,177
yards.

HORNED FROGS EKE OUT VICTORY IN OVERTIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERRANCE HARRIS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ It could be that the fans in Amon Carter
Stadium are becoming accustomed to these on-the-edge-of-your-seat
and down-to-wire forays.
</P>
<P>
   That was certainly the scenario last night as the TCU Horned
Frogs needed to rally twice to escape with a 19-16 double-overtime
victory against Vanderbilt before 26,210 spectators. It marked the
third time in as many games at Amon Carter Stadium that the outcome
came down to the waning moments.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 12, Oklahoma won, 10-9, on a field goal in the final
seconds, and on Sept. 26, TCU's defense provided a late stand to
preserve a 35-34 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you, you don't leave early with this team. You better
hang until the end,'' said first-year TCU coach Dennis Franchione,
whose team improved to 3-1. ``Don't give up on these kids. They
won't, so don't you.
</P>
<P>
   ``You better stay there until the last tick is on the clock
because they will keep fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is exactly what the Frogs did in this non-conference
matchup after missed offensive opportunities and a subpar second
half forced them into an overtime situation.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs prevailed with a gutsy defensive performance in
overtime capped by a 4-yard touchdown run up the middle by tailback
LaDainian Tomlinson to seal the game. The win marked TCU's first
overtime victory and its first back-to-back triumphs since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't execute during the game like we should have,''
said TCU quarterback Patrick Batteaux. ``I don't know if we were
tired, but we just made a couple of mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the big thing is we executed in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   First-year kicker Chris Kaylakie kicked a career-best 50-yard
field goal to tie the game with :04 remaining and force overtime
after TCU ran its two-minute offense to near perfection down to the
Vanderbilt 33.
</P>
<P>
   But the Frogs found themselves forced in that situation after
allowing Vanderbilt to score 13 unanswered points in the second
half to rally and go ahead 13-10 on an 18-yard scoring run by
tailback Rodney Williams with 1:31 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   John Markham of Vanderbilt (0-4) kicked field goals of 49 and 26
yards in the second half to go with a 47-yarder in the second
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs' offense, meanwhile, sputtered during the second half
after missing three key scoring opportunities during the first two
quarters. Vanderbilt, stacking its defensive front during the
second half, stymied the TCU running attack with strong pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   TCU tailback Basil Mitchell finished with 125 yards, and
Batteaux had his strongest outing as a passer, 12-of-18 for 131
yards and one interception, but mental breakdowns throughout
preempted the offense's effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating, no doubt about it,'' said Franchione, who
was also coaching his first collegiate overtime game. ``Sound
defensive philosophy says make people drive it 80 or 90 yards and
they'll make a mistake. And eventually that happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get a first down, and we had the two turnovers in
the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   During the first half, it was only the Frogs who could stop
themselves. They managed to march into Vanderbilt territory on all
five offensive possessions during the half, but two turnovers and a
costly turf tackle preempted three potential scoring drives as they
held a 10-0 lead at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs made 18 first-half first downs and had 273 yards of
offense. With long and methodical drives, TCU won the time of
possession battle, 21:17 to 8:43.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson led TCU with 78 yards and a touchdown on the ground
during the first half. The Frogs, with four rushers over 30 yards,
completed the half with 196 rushing yards on 38 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   TCU put together a near-perfect opening 80-yard drive,
culminating in a 9-yard touchdown run by Tomlinson. The drive,
which lasted 13 plays and 5:57, including Batteaux pass completions
of 11 and 17 yards to receivers Michael Crawford and Mike
Scarborough, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Kaylakie kicked a 42-yard field goal in the second quarter
to put TCU ahead by 10 points with 11:44 to play in the half.
</P>
<P>
   TCU could have done much more damage were it not for a fumbled
handoff exchange between Batteaux and fullback Lance Williams on
the Vanderbilt 31-yard line in the second quarter and an
interception by Batteaux down on the Commodores' 16.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs also missed an opportunity when receiver Cedric James'
feet got tangled on a reverse for an 8-yard loss back to the
Vanderbilt 29 early in the first half. It stymied a drive that
ended two plays later when Kaylakie's 44-yard field-goal attempt
went wide right.

TEXAS TECH STOPS 2-POINT TRY, DEFEATS BAYLOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas _ Two dormant offenses erupted after quarterback
changes last night at Jones Stadium, with Texas Tech's Rob Peters
and Baylor's Jermaine Alfred coming off the bench to produce a
combined 561 yards and six touchdown drives.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest piece of real estate covered by either player
was the final step Alfred took that carried him out of bounds
before throwing a potential game-tying, two-point conversion pass
with 1:10 remaining. That provided Texas Tech's winning margin in a
31-29 shootout.
</P>
<P>
   However, it did not end postgame disagreements between players
about the accuracy of referee John Laurie's call, which nullified a
catch in the end zone by Bears' receiver Derrius Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred, who was under heavy pressure while rolling toward the
right sideline, said he made sure he planted his foot in bounds
before leaping into the air to throw a desperation heave toward the
end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the feeling I was in,'' Alfred said. ``It's very
disappointing, but it was their call.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said Alfred clearly was in bounds, and a replay on the
stadium scoreboard seemed to support his conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad call,'' Thomson said. ``They did us wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Not in the mind of Taurus Rucker, the closest Tech defender in
pursuit of Alfred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most definitely, I saw his foot step out before he threw the
ball,'' Rucker said. ``Some calls went our way and some didn't. But
the last one definitely went our way.''
</P>
<P>
   It proved to be the difference between allowing the Red Raiders
(5-0, 2-0) to continue their best start in 22 years or running the
risk of surviving in overtime against the Bears (1-3, 0-2), who
closed a 31-16 deficit in the final 4:47.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred, who threw for 225 yards and a touchdown after entering
the game with 2:29 remaining in the third quarter, made the Red
Raiders sweat down the stretch and might have earned a starting
role in next week's game against Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's accurate to say we'll at least consider it,'' said Baylor
coach Dave Roberts, who lifted starter Odell James in the fourth
quarter for a second consecutive week.
</P>
<P>
   Tech coach Spike Dykes, on the other hand, said he definitely
plans on handing the reins to Peters, who rushed for 106 yards and
threw for 226 in his first extended action of the season. The Red
Raiders' projected starter during fall drills, Peters played little
in the team's first five games because of shoulder and thumb
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   But he led the Red Raiders on touchdown drives of 80, 80, 80 and
66 yards last night. He capped the first with a 1-yard sneak and
hit Donnie Hart for a 38-yard touchdown strike on another.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was our starter when he got hurt, and I always said he'd be
the starter when he came back,'' Dykes said. ``Rob's a winner. He
looked even better than I'd hoped. He just got hot and we left him
in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters entered the game on Tech's third series and starter Matt
Tittle never returned.
</P>
<P>
   For a fifth consecutive week, Tech tailback Ricky Williams (29
carries, 159 yards) topped the 100-yard mark and scored two
touchdowns. For a fifth consecutive week, Hart grabbed a touchdown
pass. But this night belonged to Peters, who finished with 332
yards total offense and helped the Raiders build a 31-16 lead when
Williams scored his second touchdown with 6:44 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred, however, played a stirring game of beat the clock in
leading Baylor on a pair of seven-play touchdown drives covering 78
and 72 yards on the Bears' last two possessions. But he stepped out
of bounds on the game's biggest play.
</P>
<P>
   Or did he?
</P>
<P>
   ``It really doesn't matter,'' Roberts said. ``It's what the
official called. I thought the officials did a good job. If we take
advantage of other chances we had, we never put ourselves in that
position.'' Extra points Nikia Codie, a senior from Cleburne,
blocked a second-quarter punt, giving the Bears a blocked kick in
each of their past three games. ... Ricky Williams' halftime totals
(12 carries, 21 yards, 1.8 average) marked the least productive
half of the season for the back who was the nation's leading rusher
coming into the game. ... Tech offensive guard Curtis Lowery
strained his knee in the second quarter and did not return.

LOOK AGAIN! FEDERAL SURPLUS IS AN ILLUSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: The estimated $70 billion budget surplus is a mirage.
Actually, it's worse than a mirage. It's the fictional creation of
cynical and duplicitous politicians who take advantage of the
public's ignorance of federal finance.
</P>
<P>
   Most media types lend credibility to the hoax by accepting
Washington's numbers at face value. One story this week proclaimed
it the biggest surplus ever and said government was ``on course to
continue piling up surpluses for years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be further from the truth. When the 1998 fiscal
year ended Wednesday, the ``Government finances'' table for that
day in The Kansas City Star business section showed the federal
government's total public debt at $5.439 trillion. When the 1997
fiscal year ended one year ago, the same table showed public debt
at $5.327 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   How, pray tell, could the budget be $70 billion in the black
when the national debt expanded by $112 billion? It can't in the
context of accounting integrity, but anything is possible when
Uncle Sam is doing the accounting.
</P>
<P>
   This year's budget surplus is largely attributable to excess
Social Security tax receipts. This extra revenue was spent and the
Social Security trust fund received a credit, which amounts to an
IOU.
</P>
<P>
   The games played with Social Security explain part of the trust
fund scam, but not all. Social Security is only the most visible of
the many government activities funded by tax receipts dedicated to
specific purposes. Other examples include taxes for such pursuits
as highway maintenance and air transportation infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   These activities also have trust funds because the amount spent
on them usually lags the total revenue collected by the tax levied
for the program. The surplus revenue, as with Social Security, is
spent and the trust fund gets the same sort of IOU that Social
Security gets.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do the IOUs credited to these myriad trust funds add to
the national debt, but debt is piled upon debt as those
nonmarketable Treasury IOUs earn interest.
</P>
<P>
   As discerning readers may have noticed, there is $182 billion
worth of difference between the $70 billion surplus and the $112
billion rise in outstanding debt. This implies, of course, that the
federal budget for '98 was really substantially in the red. The
amount may be debatable, but the reality is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   An actual surplus could not have occurred during a period when
the national debt rose. Thus, the surplus is a bookkeeping
artifact. Given the Wonderland nature of federal accounting, Uncle
Sam not only feels comfortable, but also proud, to be able to
proclaim a surplus.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the mendacity of the putative surplus that is
irksome, either. The accompanying claim that there will be a series
of surpluses with which to ``save'' Social Security and do other
good works is not true. All that is true is that debt load of
future generations is higher than it was last year.
</P>
<P>
   The nature and scope of this fiscal flimflammery underscore
several critical needs. One need is a federal accounting system
that prevents rather than abets financial fraud. Another is
abandonment of the trust fund system that allows the back-door
misappropriation of tax revenues for general budget purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, no reform will work until Americans learn enough about
federal fiscal practices to understand how the vaunted surplus is
the usual Washington smoke-and-mirrors trick.

`DILBERT' CREATOR TAKES TEMPERATURE OF WORKPLACE CLIMATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ``Dilbert'' creator Scott Adams started
putting his e-mail address on his daily comic strip in 1993. Since
then, he's received hundreds of messages a day from workers who
share the pulse of their workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   Their tales of dehumanization and angst are depressingly
endless, right?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   Adams' newest book, ``The Joy of Work: Dilbert's Guide to
Finding Happiness at the Expense of Your Co-Workers'' may have a
cynical bent, but Adams says don't blame it on what he hears from
the work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not at all sad about the state of work right now,'' Adams
said in a telephone interview. ``I think people are generally
happier than they've been in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't get chains of complaints about low raises, impossible
bosses and excessive workloads. In fact, when he calls some of his
correspondents (yes, he does this on occasion), he finds that
almost all profess to be content with their pay and their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they're sort of schizophrenic,'' Adams said. ``They say
they like their jobs, but they'll (complain) like crazy about the
last 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams theorizes the sustained, strong national economy and the
accompanying tight labor market created this climate of
contentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may sound strange, but I think there's more recognition now
that everyone's a temp worker, that everyone looks at their jobs as
disposable,'' he said. ``Most everyone who was downsized _ or knows
someone who was downsized _ got a better job.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the economy is good, you know you can leave and get a
better job somewhere else. I think you rationalize that you must be
happy where you are or you'd be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't get the impression, though, that Adams' new book is full
of corporate rah-rah and optimism. Far from it. Like his earlier
``The Dilbert Principle,'' it has the darkly comedic ``Dilbert''
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   For example:
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't make the mistake of working extra hard in hopes of
getting the biggest raise in your department. The difference
between performing at `exceeds expectations' levels versus `meets
expectations' is likely to be about 2 percent per year.
Mathematically speaking, in the long run you're much better off
doing a lousy job at something that looks good on a resume as
opposed to doing a superb job at something that sounds dull.''
</P>
<P>
   And:
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't invent the term Reverse Telecommuting, but I wish I
had. It refers to the process of bringing your personal work into
the office. It's the perfect place for paying bills, playing games,
checking on your stock investments, handling errands, calling
friends and making copies. To the casual observer, those things
look just like work.''
</P>
<P>
   In a related vein, Adams gives credit to a reader for exposing
him to ``multishirking'' _ the practice of doing two non-work
activities at once, thus doubling ``the odds that an observer will
think you're doing at least one work-related activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the book's title emphasizes having fun at the expense
of co-workers, Adams made no apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``All humor is at someone else's expense,'' he said. ``You can
poke fun at yourself, but there are more of them than you, so you
can always count on having a lot of material.''
</P>
<P>
   The cartoonist, who absorbed much ``Dilbert'' material in his
former job as a Pacific Bell cubicle worker, said workplaces in the
last couple of years seem to be less frenzied about adopting the
trendy business practice of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Adams suggested, some of the best elements of mission
statements, team building, re-engineering and so forth have ``taken
their proper place in the toolbox.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The overselling of these micro trends has been beaten back,
and we're left with something good,'' he said. ``People have been
educated and exposed to new processes.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``micro trend'' Adams says he's watching now, and expects to
focus on in upcoming strips, is ``EVA,'' the economic-value-added
concept that ``breaks your company into individual units to see if
the value of each is exceeding its cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Real companies don't work that way _ broken apart in units _ he
said. Organizations will realize, he predicted, that true value is
added by interaction between units, not by measuring individual
parts.

PALMER STARS IN USC'S LATE RALLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett has started billing the Trojans as a
fourth- quarter team.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because he waited nearly that long to let freshman
quarterback Carson Palmer take his first snap Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   With a Coliseum crowd of 56,093 already booing the offense,
Hackett finally inserted Palmer into the game late in the third
quarter against Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   The belated move paid off. Palmer immediately re-ignited the
crowd, threw a touchdown pass and helped spark his teammates into a
22-point fourth-quarter blitz that enabled the Trojans to defeat
Arizona State 35-24.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just Carson. You guys hear the crowd. He makes something
happen,'' wide receiver R. Jay Soward said.
</P>
<P>
   Can a quarterback controversy be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   No. Hackett insisted sophomore Mike Van Raaphorst will start
next week against California. But the two-quarterback system seems
entrenched in USC's offense, especially since the Trojans were
trailing the Sun Devils 24-13 with only minutes remaining in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer's performance, combined with another tireless effort by
the defense and clutch plays by USC's special teams, helped the
Trojans (4-1, 2-0) avert a disastrous defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That qualifies as a big win in my book,'' Hackett said. ``At
halftime, I said, `If there's ever a time to play our best
football, it's time.' In the fourth quarter, that was USC football.
We overwhelmed them.''
</P>
<P>
   That was hardly the picture for three quarters, even though USC
linebacker Chris Claiborne knocked Arizona State quarterback Ryan
Kealy out of the game with a mild concussion on the game's third
play.
</P>
<P>
   Kealy never returned, but even with reserve Chad Elliott, the
Sun Devils were rolling right through the Trojans, as running back
J.R. Redmond rushed for a career-high 214 yards on 33 carries.
Redmond finished with a school-record 350 yards of total offense.
</P>
<P>
   With Redmond running wild and Elliott completing just enough
passes, the Sun Devils seemed to take command after Redmond's
2-yard run gave them a 24-13 lead with 5:03 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Palmer, finally. Maybe Hackett heard the boos on the
previous possession, when USC went three-and-out under Van
Raaphorst.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer drove the Trojans 62 yards, highlighted by a 20-yard
touchdown pass to Soward in the corner of the end zone. Palmer
called an audible on the play, electing to go for Soward after
watching Arizona State's safeties move closer to the line of
scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him in the huddle. Let's run the fade,'' Soward said.
``I went to his house and had a talk with him this week. The past
two weeks, we haven't done anything offensively. I said, `If you
want to play, you have to make something happen.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Soward turned diplomatic when asked if Palmer should be
USC's starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not endorsing him as the starter. Maybe coach will,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   After the Palmer-to-Soward touchdown, the Trojans completely
took over. They held Arizona State on downs, and cornerback Antuan
Simmons blocked Stephen Baker's punt. The ball tipped off Rashard
Cook's fingers and was caught by Ife Ohalete, who ran 14 yards for
a touchdown to give USC a 28-24 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the fourth quarter, linebacker David Gibson intercepted
an Elliott pass and returned it 16 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quarterback rolled out and pretty much gave me the ball,''
Gibson said. ``He looked at me the whole time. I thought I was the
receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   The harder part for Gibson was surviving the celebration on the
field, as the Trojans enjoyed their first comfortable lead against
the Sun Devils (2-3, 1-2).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was killing me. I had a bunch of guys on me,'' Gibson said.
``I had to get some air.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson's play sealed the victory and allowed the Trojans to
continue to think big, just a week after being embarrassed by
Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think games like this are definitely character builders,''
Gibson said. ``Especially coming off Florida State, we could have
easily gone down the hole _ but we came back and fought.''
</P>
<P>
   USC may have been outgained in yards, and it's defense may have
spent what seemed like forever on the field, but the Trojans were
thrilled with the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about where we are,'' Hackett said. ``After what
happened last year, this is a happy group of guys.''

'98 TROJANS HOOKED ON A FEELING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One Trojan talked about a certain ``feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Another described it as an ``energy.''
</P>
<P>
   One said it was more like a ``belief.''
</P>
<P>
   Another described the ``thrill'' of merely standing on the
sidelines in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   One said it was as if everybody was ``amped up.''
</P>
<P>
   Another said it was the feeling of a team coming ``together.''
</P>
<P>
   And whatever the words they chose, it was the answer to the same
question, the question that hung over USC football all summer.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be any different under head coach Paul Hackett than it
was under head coach John Robinson?
</P>
<P>
   After USC's come-from-behind, 35-24 victory over Arizona State
at the Coliseum on Saturday evening, you can stop asking.
</P>
<P>
   This was a game the Trojans had every right to lose. They were
favored by a field goal but the smart money was taking the points.
</P>
<P>
   USC didn't have its leading ground-gainer, tailback Chad Morton,
because of a back injury. And it was facing the best ball carrier,
J.R. Redmond, it has faced in five games.
</P>
<P>
   USC was coming off a loss at Florida State, a loss that silenced
any early talk of a Hackett Miracle. And ASU was beginning to look
like last year's UCLA team, coming into its own after two
season-opening losses.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, ASU had embarrassed the Trojans last year 35-7 and how
much difference could a year have made?
</P>
<P>
   After this, you can stop asking.
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room at halftime, Hackett referred to the score,
ASU by 10, and told his players a funny thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 'em right where we want 'em,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The funnier thing was, the players believed their rookie coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe everything he says,'' said safety Ifeanyi Ohalete
with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were up by 10 points and it didn't feel like they were
ahead,'' Ohalete said.
</P>
<P>
   When does a miracle begin, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   When the coach tells his team at the break, ``If there was ever
a time to step up and play your best football, this is the time''?
</P>
<P>
   Or when one of those players returns the second-half kickoff 62
yards to set up a touchdown pass?
</P>
<P>
   When a junior wide receiver visits a freshman quarterback at
home and tells him, ``If you want to start, you've got to make
something happen''?
</P>
<P>
   Or when the freshman quarterback audibilizes on third-and-5 and
throws a 20-yard touchdown pass to the junior wide receiver on the
first play of the fourth quarter?
</P>
<P>
   When the special-teams coach sets a goal _ he wants his scrappy
bunch to score or set up a score in every game?
</P>
<P>
   Or when they come through by scoring, incredibly, for the fourth
time in five games, blocking a punt and running it in for the
go-ahead touchdown?
</P>
<P>
   When a USC safety picks off a pass and runs it back for a
game-clinching touchdown?
</P>
<P>
   Or when he momentarily regrets it, when most of the roster piles
on him in celebration behind the end zone, the wildest USC
celebration in recent memory?
</P>
<P>
   ``Games like this are character-builders,'' said David Gibson,
the junior who made that fourth-quarter interception and lived to
tell about it. He added that after this, the Trojans feel like
``we're on the way to the Rose Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's not get ahead of ourselves, David.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett and the Trojans have work to do. Choosing a quarterback.
Mending Chad Morton. Cutting their penalty count in half. Slowing
down runners like Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   But even at 3-1, 2-0 in the Pacific-10 Conference, they've done
something they never could in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   They've put some magic back in USC football. They're fun to
watch again.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the stat on fun: The Trojans are outscoring their
opponents 66-13 in the fourth quarter this season. Take away their
loss to the superior Florida State team, and it's 66-3.
</P>
<P>
   They came from behind to beat Purdue and ASU, and beat Oregon
State after being tied in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (team's) whole motto this year has been, `The fourth
quarter, come on strong,''' Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the big stretch runs is stamina: Hackett
emphasized conditioning all spring and summer.
</P>
<P>
   But if winning the fourth quarter was as simple as cutting out
the fat, Jenny Craig would be coach of the year.
</P>
<P>
   It's something more. It's a feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could (begin ital)feel it(end ital) in the fourth
quarter,'' Hackett said. ``That's the way we have to play USC
football.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a great new feeling. &QL;

UCLA DEFENSE INOFFENSIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ The UCLA defense can appreciate what it's like to be
St. Louis outfielder Brian Jordan and have a stadium laden with
spectators fidgeting impatiently in their seats, enduring you so
they can embrace Mark McGwire when he steps up to the plate,
fireworks as close as his fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' defense isn't deluded; it knows the big-top offense
with ringleader Cade McNown is the Greatest Show at the Rose Bowl
on any given Saturday. A pile of points are what the people pay to
see, not a pile of players atop some opposing running back or
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's second-year head coach Bob Toledo isn't dumb; he knew
exactly what he was doing Saturday when he ordered his players to
let Washington State have the ball first if the Bruins won the
pregame coin toss.
</P>
<P>
   So what if 67,210 people had flocked to the Rose Bowl to see
shimmering spirals and rapturous runs? Toledo told his team on the
eve of its Pac-10 opener against the Cougars that if the Bruins had
any say in it, the fans were going to see the defense first.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about pressure. The defense hadn't exactly done anything to
grab the fans' attention and hold it in the first two weeks. But
that was before Toledo told the defense he wanted it on the field
first, to see what it could do.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, as it turned out, was plenty.
</P>
<P>
   On the eighth play of the Cougars' opening drive, a bees nest of
Bruins stripped running back DeJuan Gilmore. Junior defensive end
Pete Holland pounced on the loose football at the Cougars' 42-yard
line and McNown and Co. took it from there, marching methodically
to the end zone in six plays.
</P>
<P>
   Before it was all said and won, 49-17, the UCLA defense would
force two more fumbles and finagle an interception. That they gave
up 314 net yards to a tottering Cougars offense was something to be
addressed another day.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the Bruins defense took pleasure in having
answered Toledo's challenge. The gauntlet in the weeks just ahead
will be thrown by Arizona and Oregon, owners of the best offenses
in the conference besides the one the UCLA defense suits up next to
daily.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins defense knows it can't allow Arizona's Trung Canidate
or Oregon's Reuben Droughns to squirt free for substantial gains
like the Cougars' Kevin Brown did on his way to 109 yards. But the
remaining schools on UCLA's schedule also have to know now there's
more to beating the Bruins than confounding McNown.
</P>
<P>
   He had a so-so Saturday (14 of 27 for 205 yards with one
touchdown and one interception), yet the Bruins still notched their
school-record 13th consecutive win.
</P>
<P>
   Score one for the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we have to improve each game,'' said senior free
safety Larry Atkins, who takes charge of the defense the way McNown
does the offense. ``Now we know we can stop teams from running up
and down the field like they were the first two games.''
</P>
<P>
   In double-digit wins over Texas and at Houston, the defense
surrendered an unbeatific 55 points. It stood seventh in the
conference in rush defense and ninth in average total defense, its
415 yards allowed an eyesore covered pretty well by the Bruins'
liberal application of offense.
</P>
<P>
   The defense could hide behind the team's 45.5-point scoring
average and its 2-0 record and its No.4 national ranking. But it
couldn't escape the game videotape sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The makeover of the defense began in earnest Tuesday when the
players realized defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti wasn't playing
the film back at half speed, that the Bruins were really THAT slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had had enough of our offense carrying us,'' Holland said.
``Those defensive rankings don't lie. We had to be honest with
ourselves. If we wanted to stay one of the top-ranked teams in the
country, the defense was going to have to establish itself.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, everybody from Atkins to Zdenek (that would be
free safety Jason) came out focused and fiery. ``We really picked
up our intensity in practice,'' said freshman linebacker Ryan Nece.
``Our attitude was the biggest difference. The coaches kept telling
us, the games are like a piece of art and each of us should want to
put his signature on it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Nece's fingerprints were all over the completed
canvas. He left a mark no one could miss with eight tackles,
including a sack. Atkins led the way with nine tackles, six of them
unassisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess there's been a couple of comments that our defense
wasn't as tough as it could be,'' sniffed junior cornerback Ryan
Roques, who was never far from the pile. ``We weren't getting a lot
of respect. But we realized we hadn't earned it.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense made a nice down payment Saturday, earning kudos
from none other than the man who had challenged it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleased with the way we swarmed to the ball,'' Toledo
said. ``We were very aggressive. It was tough to see who did
what... there were so many guys flying around.''
</P>
<P>
   Their task this week? To stay grounded. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Haruki Murakami. Translated by Jay Rubin. Vintage
International, $14.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's most popular novelist begins humbly enough with a young
man's search for his lost cat but before long tackles some mighty
heavy subjects: the transitory nature of love, the vacuity of
contemporary politics and the legacy of aggression in World War II.
``Murakami has written a bold and generous book,'' Jamie James
wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Miriam's Kitchen: A Memoir &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Elizabeth Ehrlich. Penguin, $13.95.
</P>
<P>
   This culinary meditation-cum-family history tells of the
author's deepening relationship with her mother-in-law, a Holocaust
survivor whose religion is one first of deeds -- mostly cooking and
housework -- and then of faith. ``The stories of Elizabeth and
Miriam's encounters, and the memories that they draw forth, are a
celebration of everyday life,'' Peter Kaminsky said here in 1997.
In  &UR; M.F.K. Fisher and Me: A Memoir of Food &AMP; Friendship &LR; , by
Jeannette Ferrary (St. Martin's Griffin, $14.95), a fan letter
leads to a complex relationship between the young California author
and the aging food writer, whose celebrated works are a continuous
reminiscence about places, people and herself. It becomes
abundantly clear that ``the rewards of thrilling friendships of
this kind are not only one way,'' Victoria Glendinning wrote in the
Book Review in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Reader &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Bernhard Schlink. Translated by Carol Brown Janeway. Vintage
International, $11.
</P>
<P>
   A high school student falls in love with a former Auschwitz
worker in this offbeat German novel about the moral failures of
``the lucky late-born,'' those too young to be held accountable for
Nazi crimes. The result is ``a moving, suggestive and ultimately
hopeful work'' that ``leaps national boundaries and speaks straight
to the heart,'' Suzanne Ruta said here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; African Exodus: The Origins of Modern Humanity &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Christopher Stringer and Robin McKie. Owl/Holt, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   The authors present a well-researched case for the ``out of
Africa'' model of human origins, which holds that Homo sapiens
arose on the African continent alone and then spread out across the
world. ``The interlocking patterns of the different kinds of
evidence ... give powerful support to the theory,'' Robert J.
Richards wrote here in 1997.  &UR; Eco Homo: How the Human Being Emerged
From the Cataclysmic History of the Earth &LR; , by Noel T. Boaz (Basic
Books, $14), argues that human evolution was driven by environment
changes -- particularly by climatic shifts -- and links mankind's
origins to the drying up of the Mediterranean five or six million
years ago, which turned the forests of North Africa into the
Sahara. Last year in these pages, Mark Ridley found this a
``stimulating and enjoyable'' book.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Great Apes &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Will Self. Grove, $12.
</P>
<P>
   This satirical novel imagines a world in which chimpanzees stand
at the top of the food chain and civilized behavior includes
promiscuous copulation and deferential public grooming. The plot
turns on the psychiatric treatment of a famous artist who suffers
from the delusion that he is human. ``What should have been the
literary equivalent of a parlor trick turns out to be an utterly
absorbing and affecting work of fiction,'' Gary Krist wrote here in
1997.  &UR; The Bear Comes Home &LR; , by Rafi Zabor (Norton, $15), features
the exploits of an alto sax prodigy given to quoting Shakespeare
and reading Stendhal: he also happens to be a 400-pound bear. Last
year in the Book Review, Bruce Allen said this first novel
``adroitly contrasts the bear's richly expressive inner life with
the impressions he makes on human companions.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In a Glass House &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Nino Ricci. Picador USA, $13.
</P>
<P>
   A lonely Italian boy and his infant half sister move to a
Canadian farm, where they struggle to adjust to a new life and
language. In 1995 our reviewer, Ron Hansen, called this ``a
haunting, lyrical, intelligent coming-of-age novel'' and ``a
genuine achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Art of the Impossible Politics as Morality in Practice:
Speeches and Writings, 1990-1996 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Vaclav Havel. Fromm International, $14.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Czech Republic reveals a mystical side as
he discusses how to create citizens who are aware of both their
potential for evil and their obligation to do good. Last year our
reviewer, Douglas A. Sylva, admired ``the inspiring optimism of
someone who has seen the worst of humanity without losing faith in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; True Colors: The Real Life of the Art World &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Anthony Haden-Guest. Atlantic Monthly, $15.
</P>
<P>
   This scathing critique of the contemporary art world skewers
everyone in its path: artists, dealers, collectors and critics.
Last year our reviewer, David Kaufman, called the author ``a
valuable guide'' to an era in which esthetic concerns gave way to
purely mercenary forces.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Secrets of a Fire King: Stories &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Kim Edwards. Picador USA, $13.
</P>
<P>
   The characters in these far-flung stories -- whether circus
performers or Malaysian prostitutes -- find wonder, and terror, in
the familiar. ```The Secrets of a Fire King' gives eloquence to
their astonishing range of discoveries, and leaves the reader
entranced,'' Nina Sonenberg wrote here last year.

   DEMS _ WASHINGTON _ When he built his winning coalition for the
presidency in 1992, President Clinton relied heavily on fellow
southern Democrats like himself. This week, when he may need them
the most, many of those same southern Democrats are likely to break
ranks and vote to open a formal inquiry into whether Clinton lied
under oath, encouraged others to lie and obstructed justice in his
affair with Monica Lewinsky. The House Judiciary Committee will
meet today and may vote on opening the inquiry, with a full House
vote later in the week. About 75 Democrats may feel forced to vote
with the Republicans for an impeachment inquiry. Rep. Sanford
Bishop (D-Ga.), the only member of the Black Caucus who voted with
the Republicans in the Alcee Hastings impeachment, may be in that
position. (Foskett, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   IMPEACH _ WASHINGTON _ Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, said Sunday he hoped the House could reach a
decision by New Year's on whether to impeach President Clinton. But
Democrats pressed for guidelines that would limit both the scope
and length of the House probe, saying they feared that otherwise it
could turn into a ``two-year fishing expedition'' for more charges
against the president. (Dalglish, Cox News Service).

<P>
   PRISON _ Gangs have come to occupy a central role in Texas
prisons. Even though gang activities are banned, membership has
more than quadrupled since the start of the decade. But rather than
separate gang members, prison authorities usually house them
together because they're easier to manage that way. And though
prison officials say they try to prevent gang activities, they have
in some instances enlisted gang leaders in efforts to maintain
order. A look at prison gangs behind the walls. (Ward, Austin
American-Statesman).

   GANGSTERS _ Vignettes in which prison gang members discuss
racism, why they joined gangs, what life's like inside. (Ward,

   MAIL _ Prison officials play a cat-and-mouse game with gang
members that is worthy of the CIA. They intercept mail that's
written in code, in invisible ink that's made with urine and in
obscure places. (Ward, Austin American-Statesman).
</P>
<P>
   RENAUD _ Perspective on gangs from behind the bars written by
Jorge Renaud, former Statesman copy editor and convicted armed
robber who is serving time at the Wynne Unit in Huntsville. A
three-time loser who has been in and out of prison since the '70s,
he writes about his past experiences with prison gangs _ including
the time he witnessed a gang stabbing. (Ward, Austin
American-Statesman).
</P>
<P>
   SPECIAL REPORT: RIVERS IN THE SOUTH
</P>
<P>
   WATERWARS _ With its humid climate, bottomland swamps and lazy
streams, the South has long been regarded as water rich. But that
concept is evaporating. Because of the region's growth, experts say
there is not enough water to satisfy competing demands - for
consumption, waste treatment, development, hydropower, recreation,
irrigation and navigation. Nowhere are those concerns being aired
more dramatically than here, with Georgia, Alabama and Florida
negotiating to divide up the waters of the Chattahoochee and other
rivers flowing through the region. ``The stakes are huge,'' says
Aaron Wolf, who has consulted in international water conflicts.
``The tri-state water dispute has all the trappings of the bitter
water conflicts waged...in the dry Middle East between countries
like Jordan and Israel.'' A look at the blossoming water wars and
their potential impact on growth and environmental protection in
metro Atlanta. (Seabrook, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 70 WITH
PHOTOS.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   APALACHICOLA _ For 50 years, Donny Wilson has reaped a rich
bounty from Apalachicola Bay: oysters, shrimp, crabs. His business
has survived hurricanes and droughts. But now, he sees a new threat
upstream. He is one of many fishermen expressing concern that
Atlanta's growing demand for water is siphoning off the water that
nourishes the bay's shellfish beds. ``We don't want to pay the
price for Atlanta's growth,'' he says. (Seabrook, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 30
</P>
<P>
   AGRICULTURE _ You didn't have to be a plant scientist to figure
out who irrigated their crops and who didn't this summer in
southwest Georgia. Long stretches of stunted corn and shriveled
cotton baked in bone-dry fields - farms without irrigation - while
others were green or lush with ripening crops, a sure sign of
watering. ``If I hadn't had irrigation, I would have been wiped
out,'' says farmer Jerry Long. Scores of farmers like Long fear
that the water for their irrigation wells could become a casualty
of the water wars. (Seabrook, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 30
</P>
<P>
   NAVIGATION _ The Georgia State Ports Authority's docks in
Columbus stand empty. Only 11 barges checked in on this inland port
on the Chattahoochee River in 1997. And shippers fear there may be
even fewer barges in the future, leaving barge navigation a
footnote of Southern history, a victim of the water wars.
(Seabrook, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 30
</P>
<P>
   WESTWARS _ Nebraska, Colorado and Kansas signed a deal in 1943
spelling out how much water each could use from the Republican
River. But it's been anything but an amicable deal. The squabble
may be an omen for Georgia, Alabama and Florida. (Seabrook, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 7.

   SPRINT-HEALTHCARE (Kansas City, Mo.) _ At the start of the '90s,
when employers' health insurance costs were surging 15 percent a
year, the giant Sprint Corp. was quick to shift to health
maintenance organizations and their businesslike management of
medical care. Sprint's costs promptly stabilized. Today, its
comprehensive benefit program stands as a model of what Congress
and industry envisioned four years ago when they rejected President
Clinton's health plan and left the health-care system to the tides
of the marketplace. Yet along the hallways at Sprint headquarters
here, the great expectations for managed care have dimmed. In a
score of interviews with workers and managers, no one recounted the

 &HT;    Southern Democrats may cross party line in favor of formal probe
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When he built his winning coalition for the
presidency in 1992, President Clinton relied heavily on fellow
southern Democrats like himself.
</P>
<P>
   This week, when he may need them the most, many of those same
southern Democrats are likely to break ranks and vote to open a
formal inquiry into whether Clinton lied under oath, encouraged
others to lie and obstructed justice in his affair with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee will meet today and may vote on
opening the inquiry, with a full House vote later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, whose aides have been aggressively seeking censure
rather than impeachment, would like nothing more than a party-line
vote to substantiate the White House claim that the inquiry is a
partisan witch hunt designed to hurt the president and harm
Democratic chances in the Nov. 3 mid-term elections.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton won't get that. Some Democrats are already on record
saying they support an inquiry. Others, including Rep. Sanford
Bishop (D-Ga.), have remained largely silent, an indication of how
many Democrats are wrestling with such a politically potent vote
just weeks before the election.
</P>
<P>
   The political stakes for Bishop and other southern Democrats who
represent majority white districts are enormous. While national
polls indicate that most Americans are against impeaching Clinton,
there are strong regional differences.
</P>
<P>
   Many rural voters, who tend to be more conservative, are
outraged at Clinton's affair with a former White House intern half
his age and want Congress to act. Core Democratic voters,
especially black voters, want the inquiry to end quickly, leaving
some of these Democratic incumbents caught in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very polarizing in my district or any other district,''
said Rep. Charlie Stenholm (D-Texas), ranking member of the House
Agriculture committee, who represents a large ranching district in
west Texas. ``No matter what you do, someone is going to be unhappy
with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Stenholm said he will vote to proceed with the inquiry, a
position that is supported by fellow Texan Rep. Jim Turner
(D-Texas) and Rep. Bud Cramer (D-Ala.), whose Alabama district
includes Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   ``The few Democrats who represent conservative districts could
create real problems for themselves if they vote to exonerate
(Clinton) before the investigation is complete,'' said Whit Ayres,
a Republican pollster from Atlanta whose clients are drawn mostly
from the South.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Democrats who say they will vote for an impeachment
inquiry are so-called Blue Dog Democrats, conservative Democrats
whose ranks are drawn largely from the South. One Blue Dog, Rep.
Gene Taylor (D-Miss.), is already on record saying Clinton should
resign.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the predicament facing Georgia's Bishop, another
Blue Dog Democrat, is even more politically dicey. More than
one-third of Bishop's 2nd District is black. Nationally, black
voters have been Clinton's most loyal backers, saying they want
Congress to accept Clinton's apology and move on.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, members of the Congressional Black Caucus and other
white, liberal Democrats vented their frustration with the Clinton
investigation by offering a resolution to impeach independent
counsel Ken Starr for abusing his authority and attempting to
``demean, embarrass and defame'' the president.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop and Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee (D-Texas) were the only
members of the black caucus who voted against the measure, which
was tabled 340 to 71.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop's district is also heavily agricultural and typical of
the more rural South, whose voters are more likely to be critical
of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Letters and phone calls to Bishop's Washington office have been
overwhelmingly in favor of impeaching Clinton or forcing him to
resign, said Selby McCash, Bishop's spokesman. Of 150 letters
received so far, 135 have been for impeachment, McCash said, and
phone calls have been three to one for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop will likely wait until the day he casts his vote on the
inquiry to state his position publicly. ``He really wants to give
himself every opportunity to understand this thing fully,'' McCash
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic strategists argue that the political pressure is
for Democrats to vote against proceeding with an inquiry, since
that is what national polls are saying Americans want. These
strategists warn that Democrats risk alienating their core
Democratic voters if they vote with the Republicans to take
impeachment to the next phase.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does it do for a Democrat to stick a finger in the eye of
the Democratic base?'' said Mark Mellman, one Democratic
strategist. ``What does that do to turnout? In most places, the
(Democratic) base is clearly opposed to impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democratic strategists, however, say that such worries are
greatly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democratic voters can be opposed to his resignation or
impeachment even as they are appalled by his personal behavior,''
said Democratic pollster Alan Secrest, who has clients in the
South. ``But they aren't necessarily going to take it out on an
incumbent who votes to proceed with an investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Secrest said he is telling his clients to ignore the White House
line about how a vote for an impeachment inquiry could affect
turnout and worry more doing what's best for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 answer is follow your conscience,'' Secrest said.

`THE SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER': DARING LINCOLN TO SPIN IN
HIS GRAVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Art and entertainment can satirize any forbidden subject if the
treatment is witty and thoughtful enough; that's what satire is.
But let's not confuse ``The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer'' with
art, entertainment or satire. This is a jaw-droppingly witless
series about an aristocratic black Englishman who flees from his
gambling debts and finds work at the White House as Abe Lincoln's
butler.
</P>
<P>
   Meant to be a parody of the Clinton White House, the series has
stumbled into notoriety for another reason. The pilot episode drew
protests from black groups charging that it treated slavery as a
joke. As a result the UPN network has substituted a different
episode for Monday night's premiere.
</P>
<P>
   Now Lincoln has telegraph sex with an unknown woman. Now Desmond
tells the president, ``If I may be so bold, sir, you're acting no
better than a horny hillbilly from Arkansas.''
</P>
<P>
   Is ``Desmond Pfeiffer'' insensitive? Of course it is, though not
because it dares to take race or presidential sex as its subjects.
It is offensive because it treats them in such a clumsy,
name-calling way. ``Desmond Pfeiffer'' is likely to drive away
blacks, whites, presidents, historians and especially people with a
sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Does it treat slavery as a joke? Glancingly in the scuttled
pilot. The approach is not malicious, but its careless attitude
seems only marginally better than outright bigotry. That original
episode (which UPN says it is reviewing and may reschedule)
explains the current flap better than Monday night's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The slaves haven't been emancipated yet; get your feet off the
table,'' an officious White House staffer tells Desmond. The joke
is that Desmond is superior to this buffoon in every way. Desmond,
who has never been a slave, is by far the smartest man in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   The true idiots are white, including Desmond's personal lackey,
Nibblet, whom he describes as ``my trusted manservant and part-time
footrest.'' Nibblet literally cannot tell his right from his left
and repeatedly puts his hand on a hot stove.
</P>
<P>
   In what may be the only flash of genuine satire in the original
pilot, Desmond briefly tries to assume a slavish attitude and
language as a ruse. The words ``I just love my massa so'' come out
with his typical well-bred English accent and supercilious air. But
``Desmond Pfeiffer'' cannot be defended as a satire attacking
slavery; that would require a level of sophistication this muddled
series never approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, both episodes rely on jokes so cheap and hoary they
seem positively vaudevillian. Nibblet's feet smell like cheese! The
series is fond of weak double-entendres. And a mean-spirited
running gag involves the sexually frustrated, plump Mary Lincoln,
frequently seen in her bubble bath, raising her arms to reveal
major underarm hair growth.
</P>
<P>
   The contemporary parallels are ham-fisted. In Monday's episode,
when Desmond discovers the president telegraphing lewd messages, he
says, ``You don't have to explain, sir, this isn't a grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln later wonders: ``Can you imagine what would happen if
the president were found in a compromising position? What would I
do, apologize to the whole nation?''
</P>
<P>
   Television viewers are always hoping for something different.
``Desmond Pfeiffer'' (pronounced Puh-feiffer in another inane
attempt at comedy) gives new meaning to the warning ``Be careful
what you ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the UPN schedule is loaded with oddball new series.
``Mercy Point'' Tuesday at 9) means to be ``ER'' meets ``Star
Trek,'' but this drama about a hospital in space is not even
entertaining in a goofy, campy way. ``Legacy'' (Friday at 8) is a
post-Civil War soap opera about the lives and lusts of an Irish
horse-breeding family in Kentucky. At least it has lavish
photography. The horses look sleek, the grass looks emerald and the
people all look like models, though no one has anything interesting
to say. Like ``Desmond Pfeiffer,'' these other UPN series smack of
a frantic bid for attention. They merely highlight the difference
between desperation and true invention.

 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After years of trying to turn around the company's Blockbuster
video-rental unit, the chairman of Viacom Inc., Sumner Redstone,
seemed finally to be on the right track. Viacom's shares had been
weathering the recent stock-market turbulence, largely on word that
Blockbuster was bringing customers back into its stores in record
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Then last Tuesday, in a matter of hours, it looked as if
Redstone's well-laid Blockbuster plan was about to go bust.
</P>
<P>
   Early that morning, two Wall Street analysts reduced their
third-quarter earnings forecast for Viacom. Blockbuster was
spending so much to keep customers happy by keeping shelves stocked
with the biggest hit films, the analysts warned, that Viacom's
profits were bound to suffer. Within hours after Tuesday's opening
bell on the New York Stock Exchange, Viacom shares were down 16.6
percent on the American Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   So Redstone, who was in Los Angeles and planning to head to
Boston, directed the pilot of his Gulfstream III jet instead to
streak back to New York, where Viacom has its headquarters.
Throughout the five-hour flight, he worked the air phone at 20,000
feet, assuring institutional investors and heads of the major funds
that hold Viacom shares that ``all of our businesses are meeting or
exceeding expectations,'' as he repeatedly put it.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the market closed, Redstone was back at his
Manhattan office. And his damage control had helped the stock
recover part of its loss, closing at $56.75, down 10.8 percent on
the day. But despite Redstone's high-altitude salesmanship, the
crisis is hardly over. The stock closed Friday at $56.5625.
</P>
<P>
   Early next year, Viacom hopes to spin off 20 percent of
Blockbuster to the public, the first part of a two-part strategy in
which Redstone intends to separate the rest of Blockbuster from
Viacom through a spinoff, sale or stock swap. The whole process is
intended to let investors track Blockbuster separately from the
rest of Viacom, whose stock-market value is being held down by the
video operation, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   An initial offering would raise money for Viacom and put a de
facto market value for the other 80 percent of Blockbuster. That
could set the stage for the second step _ either a tax-free spinoff
to shareholders or perhaps even a sale of the rest of the video
unit. But last Tuesday's battering of Viacom's stock indicated that
analysts and investors are leery of any move that could affect the
share price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marketing and promotion costs are hurting near-term earnings
more than expected,'' said Jessica Reif Cohen, a Merrill Lynch
analyst, one of the people whose revised third-quarter cash-flow
estimates forced the Viacom chairman to change his flight plan.
``Hopefully,'' Ms. Cohen said in an interview, ``this is a one-time
investment.''
</P>
<P>
   But, warned Harold Vogel, a media analyst at Cowen &AMP; Co., if
marketing costs continue to reduce profit margins in the future, he
questions whether ``slower growth at Blockbuster will depress the
valuation received for an IPO.''
</P>
<P>
   But Redstone dismisses such critics, just as he has long scorned
soothsayers who have contended that interactive television and
digital cable would render the video-rental business obsolete. ``We
are intent on increasing our market share,'' he said of the
Blockbuster marketing blitz. ``Last year 17 million VCRs were
sold,'' Redstone pointed out. ``The year before they sold 18
million, and people are not using them to wash clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Viacom remains strong in its core businesses: the MTV,
Nickelodeon and VH1 cable networks, and the Paramount film and
television studios. The film business, in particular, has had a
standout year at the box office with ``The Truman Story'';
``Titanic,'' a co-production with News Corp.'s 20th Century Fox,
and ``Saving Private Ryan'' and ``Deep Impact,'' both
co-productions with Dreamworks SKG.
</P>
<P>
   But Blockbuster has long been seen as an albatross, almost from
the moment Viacom paid $5.5 billion for it in 1994 as a way to
generate the large cash flow to help finance its $10 billion
purchase of Paramount Communications. It was widely considered a
quick fix for Viacom, but one that would not last long as the
advent of interactive digital cable television systems sent rental
videos the way of the Victrola.
</P>
<P>
   Digital cable remains somewhere in the future, though, and
Blockbuster's problem turned out to be less one of demand and more
one of supply. Under the time-honored operating strategy,
Blockbuster would buy tapes from the studios for $65 each and
recover the cost and make any profits from the rental fees. The
company kept all the proceeds, but the high purchase price for each
tape meant a limited rental inventory _ and dissatisfied customers.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier this year, Redstone and Blockbuster's new chief
executive, John Antioco, came up with a plan in which the home
video chain would buy tapes from film companies for $7 a cassette
or less and then split the rental revenues with the studios. ``What
drives the plan,'' Antioco said in a telephone interview, ``is that
the customer is doing better. You can pretty much go into a store
and get anything you want.''
</P>
<P>
   The results from this ``Satisfaction Guaranteed'' campaign are
already evident. In the second quarter of 1998, which ended on June
30, same-store sales improved more than 12.8 percent from those in
the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   And for 1998, Blockbuster could account for $550 million, or
more than 25 percent, of the company's $2 billion in cash flow _
earnings before interest, taxes depreciation and amortization _ on
revenues of $12 billion, according to estimates by Ms. Cohen of
Merrill Lynch. Last year, Blockbuster generated only about $425
million, Ms. Cohen estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But the reduced earnings forecast last Tuesday by Ms. Cohen and
Alan Kassan of Deutsche Bank Securities took note that Blockbuster
is spending aggressively to advertise and promote its customer
satisfaction campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors have seen Blockbuster's rebound through rose-colored
glasses,'' said Vogel, the Cowen &AMP; Co. analyst, ``not realizing
there is a cost attached to gaining market share.'' But ``in the
long run, it is the right thing to do,'' he said, particularly if
Viacom is dressing up Blockbuster for a spinoff or sale.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that Viacom has wanted to spin off or sell
Blockbuster. But tax rules dictate that an acquirer must retain
ownership of an acquired company for at least five years before
divesting it in any type of tax-free transaction. So it has been to
the advantage of Redstone, the largest Viacom shareholder, with 67
percent of the voting stock, to wait until September 1999 to make
such a move with Blockbuster. But the initial offering for 20
percent could come at any time, and Redstone is hoping for early
next year.
</P>
<P>
   So the question for Redstone's critics is not so much ``When?''
but ``At what cost?''
</P>
<P>
   Blockbuster's promotional costs will presumably drop, but no one
can yet say by how much. And though the new strategy lets
Blockbuster stores carry a larger inventory of hits, one film
company executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said
that making it easier for customers to rent the most popular
mass-market movies could reduce the demand for niche films _ and
make it harder for studios to recover the costs of making those
pictures, which are often still in the red before being released on
video.
</P>
<P>
   To that criticism, Antioco offers a counterargument: On an
independent or art film, where he used to worry about taking the
risk of spending $65 for a tape that might not cover its costs in
rentals, he can now afford to take a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Redstone, for his part, says that nothing so far in the stock
market _ not last Tuesday's selloff of Viacom, not the general
paralysis in the initial-offering market that last week claimed
Goldman, Sachs as its latest victim _ need deter him from a
Blockbuster stock offering. ``We are doing very well,'' Redstone
said. ``And we have very little exposure in Asia,'' he added,
referring to that region's economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   The best measure of his confidence may be that, as Viacom has
told analysts, the company is buying back a series of stock
warrants, trading at $4 a share, that will expire worthless unless
the stock price exceeds $70 a share next July. ``If Viacom thought
the stock would be down next July,'' Ms. Cohen said, ``then they
wouldn't need to buy them in.'' To some analysts, Redstone's
optimism is worrisome because it has prompted overbullish
expectations on the part of Wall Street before.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that optimism may be justified. The pending $4.3 billion
sale of the Simon &AMP; Schuster book publishing unit to Pearson PLC
will help the company cut debt to $4 billion next year from $10
billion in 1996. ``Their balance sheet is very strong,'' said David
Londoner, an analyst who follows the company for Schroder Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, under the Viacom Entertainment unit's chairman,
Jonathan Dolgin, and Sherry Lansing, who reports to him as chairman
of the motion picture group, the movie business has curtailed its
release schedule from more than 20 films a year to an annual rate
of about 16, below the industry average. Dolgin noted that the
competition among releases of big-budget films had grown so heated
that he thought a more limited release schedule would help the
company focus on the movies that count most.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Dolgin's entertainment division, the biggest
challenge is getting the fledgling UPN broadcast network on track.
In an era where the major television networks increasingly want to
own the series they produce, Viacom needs a viable network of its
own to showcase some of its Paramount television series, like ``The
Watcher.'' After a rocky debut for UPN in 1995, featuring ill-fated
experiments that failed to attract many advertisers to the network,
its new head, Dean Valentine, is using shows like ``Legacy,'' a
multigenerational period drama, to seek a broader middle-class
audience for UPN and to differentiate it from the increasingly
narrowly targeted broadcast networks like Time Warner's WB, which
focuses on a younger audience.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom's mainstay, meanwhile, is its cable networks. MTV,
Nickelodeon and VH1 continue to drive the company, providing
roughly half its operating cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, future growth for MTV and Nickelodeon will be hard to
maintain as those networks reach saturation among cable households
with teen-agers and younger children. Ms. Cohen estimates that
cash-flow growth at the cable networks will drop to about 14
percent in 1999 from 18 percent this year. That makes the outlook
for Viacom's other divisions more crucial than it might be
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Investors might not care quite as much about Blockbuster's
future if they thought that Redstone, who is 74, would sell all of
Viacom in the near future so that shareholders could realize a
premium on the stock.
</P>
<P>
   But such a sale is unlikely. The stock is held in trust,
Redstone said, ``first for my wife during her lifetime, and then it
goes to the kids and the grandchildren.'' And as long as he is
around, Redstone apparently has no intention of passing the baton.
``While I would listen to offers,'' he said, ``my strong
inclinations would be against selling.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means that the only Viacom asset likely to be in play any
time soon is part, or perhaps all, of Blockbuster. And as Redstone
learned last Tuesday at 20,000 feet, investors will be watching his
every move.

GARCIAPARRA A LEGEND IN THE MAKING 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many a ballplayer will look you squarely in the eye and tell you
how he's not about the stats or the money, that the one and only
thing he cares about is the final outcome, even as insincerity
oozes from every pore.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   When Nomar says he couldn't tell you his stats, he is telling
the gospel truth. When Nomar says he won't be watching any
subsequent playoff action on TV because ``we won't be playing, so
why should I care?'' he is telling the gospel truth. When Nomar
says the only things he cares about in this game are the W's and
the L's, he is telling the gospel truth. Every player in the
clubhouse knows it all to be the gospel truth and nothing but the
gospel truth.
</P>
<P>
   A seasoned player knows when he is in the company of something
special. Mike Stanley routinely refers to 25-year-old Nomar
Garciaparra as a ``true superstar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He plays hard every day,'' Stanley says. ``There is a cliche,
a `true professional.' Nomar is a true professional who is also a
superstar. There is just no quit in him.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a fruitless exercise to congratulate Nomar Garciaparra
for having one of the great four-day stretches in baseball
postseason history. The three home runs, the double in Game 2 that
missed being a three-run homer by a foot or less, the
record-breaking 11 runs batted in, and the breathtaking play he
made from deep in the hole on Omar Vizquel in Game 2 are all
absolutely irrelevant to this extraordinary California kid. He
absolutely, positively does not care. The only numbers he cared
about were 11-3, 9-5, 4-3, and 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   The final scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we win the World Series, you can congratulate me,'' he
said. ``It doesn't really matter. This is what we're playing for.
All I care about is the wins and losses, and we didn't win.''
</P>
<P>
   See what I mean?
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox knew, and they didn't know, what they had. Dan
Duquette felt blessed to be able to draft him with that 12th pick
in the first round back in 1994. The brass was further exhilarated
by his play at Sarasota and in the Arizona Fall League. I mean, it
was pretty obvious by the spring of 1995 that the kid with the big
beak and the unusual first name (dad Ramon spelled backward, in
case you're just plugging into the Nomar saga).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's as good a prospect as I've ever seen here,'' said Johnny
Pesky in early March of 1995. ``If nothing happens to him
physically, we have a shortstop for the next 10 years. If we have
to move somebody, well, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty good call, John.
</P>
<P>
   That said, nobody on this earth expected Nomar to come into the
American League and become one of baseball's elite players in the
span of two seasons. A nice little Rookie of the Year plaque would
have sufficed. But what we have is the type of player you really do
build a franchise around. The nature of baseball dictates that the
two most difficult commodities to find among everyday players are
great defensive catchers who hit and great defensive shortstops who
hit _ and who hit with true power. The Red Sox have hit the lottery
at what just might be the most important position in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar is almost fictionally too good to be true. Shortstops bat
fourth in Little League, Babe Ruth League, American Legion, and
perhaps even college. After that, someone pats them on the head and
directs them to a more appropriate spot, such as leadoff, second,
or perhaps even ninth. Nomar is a totally legitimate cleanup man,
not that he cares where he hits.
</P>
<P>
   When he was clearly miscast as a leadoff man during his first
season and a half, he never uttered a peep. If Jimy Williams had
ever decided that it might be cute to stick at No. 9 in order to
give him ``a second cleanup hitter,'' or something like that, Nomar
never would have uttered a peep about that, either. If the truth be
known, Nomar goes through long stretches in which he never utters a
peep about anything. He's not into rhetoric or managing. He's into
playing.
</P>
<P>
   Good Lord, what a hitter. He can hit anything, anywhere. If
there happened to be such a category as ``Ratio of Bullets to
Contact,'' he'd have to be in the top five.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here,'' says Stanley, ``is the telltale sign of how much
respect he has in baseball. I had the pleasure of hitting behind
him and I loved the catchers' reaction when I came up to bat. They
would invariably be shaking their heads after watching him bat. I
can tell you that Sandy (Alomar) didn't know what to do with him.
They just didn't know what to throw him. He has incredible power
with that wide stance and that little bat. Mo (Vaughn) swings
something like a 36-36, but Nomar swings a 33-31.''
</P>
<P>
   His sheer power, the product of a phenomenally cut body that
enables him to generate frightening bat speed, is absolutely
astonishing. ``Righthanders don't hit the ball over our bullpen,''
noted Williams in reference to Nomar's home run off Bartolo Colon
in Game 4. He is right about that. I've been watching Fenway games
for 35 years, and I can't recall too many righthanded batters who
have ever done it. Dick Allen, maybe. George Scott might have
popped one on occasion. But that's about it. For the record, Nomar
Garciaparra weighs 175 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   There is no downside to this story. The Duke has locked him up
well into the next century. We can be 100 percent assured that he
isn't going to change his approach to the game or to life. He is a
day-in, day-out delight to his manager, teammates, and fans.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanley says there is something else to ponder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nomar Garciaparra,'' he reminds us, ``is just getting
started.''

MEDIA TALK: SUIT AGAINST DISCREDITED WRITER; ANTI-PAPARAZZI LAW;
PARTY TIME IN L.A. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stories about journalistic invention have been distressingly
common these last few months, with their impact upon the
credibility of the news media well dissected. But what of the legal
consequences of questionable attributions and fictitious ``facts''?
</P>
<P>
   On June 29, DARE America, an anti-drug group, filed suit in
federal Court in Los Angeles against Stephen Glass, an associate
editor dismissed in May by The New Republic for making up people,
quotes and situations in several articles he had written for the
magazine. Among the articles was ``Don't You DARE,'' a critique of
the organization in which, the magazine has acknowledged, Glass
admitted inventing several of the people he quoted, including an
Illinois college professor who was supposedly harassed for research
unfavorable to DARE. Glass also wrote a similar piece about DARE
that subsequently appeared in Rolling Stone.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking $10 million in damages on grounds that it lost national
sponsors, DARE contends that Glass knowingly fabricated ``false and
defamatory articles'' meant to suggest that the organization
``regularly engages in harassing, threatening and terrifying its
critics.'' Skip Miller, the lawyer representing DARE, said the
group first considered legal action in 1997, when The New Republic
article appeared, and again in March, when the Rolling Stone piece
was published. But it was only when Glass admitted his fabrications
that the organization decided to sue.
</P>
<P>
   The two magazines have not been named in the suit, Miller said,
adding that his client was ``taking a separate, close look'' at
them, while engaging in settlement negotiations with Glass and his
lawyer, Gerson Zweifach. Zweifach declined to be interviewed for
this article.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers who handle First Amendment claims said the
complaint made a strong case for libel if not, perhaps, for
damages. Richard Emery, a former lawyer for the New York Civil
Liberties Union who is now in private practice, said the complaint
made a ``classic case for defamation.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor Kovner, whose clients have included publications like The
Village Voice, said, though, that other people had criticized DARE.
``If the gist of the criticisms about DARE are true,'' he said,
``they will have to show how the damages from these articles are
different from the damages from the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, at age 25, Glass presumably does not have the deepest
of pockets. ``I've never seen a situation like this, where the
magazines aren't also being sued,'' said Martin Garbus, the lawyer.
``Instead of money, I presume what they want from Glass is some
kind of retraction or formal apology.''
</P>

   California Law Will Allow Celebrities to Sue Paparazzi
</P>
<P>
   Granting the wishes of an industry that at once promotes and
protects its famed charges, Gov. Pete Wilson of California signed
legislation last week intended to allow celebrities to sue
paparazzi for invasion of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The law will allow photographers to be found liable for invasion
of privacy if it is proved that they trespassed or used telephoto
lenses to capture images of people engaging in personal or familial
activity, and provides for hefty damage awards against both
photographers and their organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The law is thought to be the first of its kind in the country,
said Tom Newton, general counsel for the California Newspaper
Publishers Association. It is one of four measures pushed by
California legislators after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales,
in a car accident while being pursued by photographers in Paris in
1997. A similar measure is being sponsored in the U.S. Senate by
Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's approval will certainly come as a pleasure to an
industry that already exerts considerable control over the
journalists who cover it, with stars often denying access to those
whose coverage they find unflattering and even at times demanding
the right to select the people who write profiles about them.
Indeed, the bill was supported by a virtual Hollywood A-list, in
addition to victims'-rights and law enforcement groups (the bill
extends the same rights to crime victims and exempts police from
liability).
</P>
<P>
   But it has drawn the opposition of major media organizations and
professional associations that while condemning the acts of tabloid
photographers, nonetheless fear the law will be used to punish
legitimate, aggressive reporting techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Erbin, a lawyer who represented NBC, CBS, ABC and CNN
during a committee hearing on the bill earlier this summer, said
stars sometimes encouraged intense personal coverage. ``They wish
to expose their private lives to their advantage, but don't want to
when it detracts from their celebrity,'' Erbin said. ``I'm not sure
you can have it both ways.''

   In the Battle for Advertisers, Parties, Parties Everywhere
</P>
<P>
   One of the great perks of working in the media department of a
New York advertising agency is the wining and dining you're treated
to. Even a lowly media planner has enormous discretion over where
an advertiser spends its money. But such largesse usually stops at
the banks of the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   That won't be the case in mid-October, when the American Society
of Travel Agents holds its annual conference in Los Angeles. Conde
Nast, the magazine company, plans to overwhelm the often-overlooked
Los Angeles ad industry with four parties over two nights.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest is being sponsored by Conde Nast Traveler. The
magazine uses the conference as the staging area for its annual
Readers' Choice Awards. Invitations for this year's black-tie
awards presentation on Oct. 14 resemble elaborate wedding
invitations.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 heavyweights from the travel industry _ foreign
ministers of tourism, general managers of hotels, airline marketing
chiefs and advertising folk _ are to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Other battles for the hearts, minds, stomachs and media budgets
will take place the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Architectural Digest has invited a select group of advertisers
and friends to the home of the film director Kathryn Bigelow, a
residence with ``the scale of an industrial warehouse and the
finesse of Japanese fabrication,'' the invitation says. The New
Yorker is sponsoring a dinner at the Cicada. Can't decide which to
attend? No matter, but feel free to drop by Bon Appetit's ``special
evening of cocktails, billiards, fine wines and cigars'' at the
Wine Merchant of Beverly Hills. The fun starts at 10.

Viacom shares were down 16.6 percent on the American Stock

MANAGEMENT TIPS, FROM THE `LITERATURE' SHELVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end of review)  
(js) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bristling with suspicion, I picked up Robert Brawer's ``Fictions
of Business: Insights on Management From Great Literature.'' First,
the very juxtaposition of the human imagination and business
management seemed somehow contradictory. The dust jacket of
Brawer's book, a detail of Edward Hopper's painting ``Office at
Night,'' said it all: the possibility of any spontaneous
interchange between the young woman at the file cabinet and the
young man at the desk seems deadened by something unseen, perhaps
the threat of bankruptcy looming in the next room.
</P>
<P>
   Second, a quick glance at the table of contents reveals that
among Brawer's examples is David Mamet's play about the
salesman-eat-salesman Florida real-estate business, ``Glengarry
Glen Ross.'' You think: if this is a sample of how a business ought
to be run, I don't want to know about it.
</P>
<P>
   But Brawer immediately surprises you and gradually begins to win
you over to his views. His point about Richard Roma, the
supersalesman played by Joe Montegna in the stage version of
``Glengarry Glen Ross'' (and by Al Pacino in the film), is that he
seems to violate every real-life canon of good salesmanship, like
not talking too much, or seeking to understand the customer's
needs. But in fact Roma reminds Brawer of some of the best salesmen
he has ever known, who were masters at creating a sense of theater
and understood that what they were selling was essentially
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Brawer keeps doing the unexpected throughout ``Fictions of
Business.'' This parallels his career, which began with his
teaching English literature at the University of Wisconsin, where
he specialized in medieval studies, then led to his joining
Maidenform Inc., the women's apparel maker, where he worked for 20
years in marketing positions, including chief executive and
president of Maidenform Worldwide. He now teaches a
cross-disciplinary course, ``Fictions of Business,'' at New York
University.
</P>
<P>
   In his introduction, he writes that over the course of his
career as a business executive, people who knew about his academic
background were always asking him how he felt about being in the
``real'' world. His response was that he wasn't at all certain he
was any more in the ``real'' world now than he had been before,
since marketing always depended on ``capturing the minds of
consumers'' by creating a certain perception.
</P>
<P>
   In that spirit, Brawer introduces several other fictional
salesmen, among them Chaucer's merchant, who, the author points
out, is such a self-made master of appearances that the narrator of
``The Canterbury Tales'' cites him as ``a worthy man with-alle,''
even though ``sooth to seyn,'' he doesn't even know his name. And
Anthony Trollope's Melmotte, the wealthy financier in ``The Way We
Live Now,'' whose fraudulent creation of the South Central Pacific
and Mexican Railway Brawer compares to Robert Campeau's leveraged
buyout and near destruction of Allied Stores.
</P>
<P>
   To Brawer the timelessness of such fictional creations belies
``the notion that the information revolution, so-called, will make
traditional ways of selling and buying obsolete (or reduce our
vulnerability to con men).'' We may get more facts about products
from the Internet, he says. But we still require a sense of
illusion when we buy them.
</P>
<P>
   In the most telling parts of his book, Brawer addresses the
apparent contradiction between business and the human imagination.
The notion that people lose their individuality in choosing a
corporate career ``is baseless,'' Brawer insists, and some of the
most memorable novels and plays about business underline his point.
The title of Sloan Wilson's 1956 novel, ``The Man in the Gray
Flannel Suit,'' may well have come to describe the businessman as
automaton. But the novel's plot actually concerns a man who redeems
his career by becoming more self-aware, Brawer points out.
</P>
<P>
   And in Arthur Miller's ``Death of a Salesman,'' it is not the
business environment that destroys Willy Loman but rather his
inability to give up his own self-destructive illusions. In
Brawer's experience, business leaders who misunderstood the play
and vowed to be kinder to their older employees tended to harm
their companies by keeping the wrong people on too long.
</P>
<P>
   Similar provocative lessons are drawn from such works as ``Point
of No Return,'' by John P. Marquand; ``Major Barbara,'' by George
Bernard Shaw; ``The Financier,'' by Theodore Dreiser; ``Babbitt,''
by Sinclair Lewis; ``The Big Money,'' by John Dos Passos; ``The
Jungle,'' by Upton Sinclair; ``A Connecticut Yankee in King
Arthur's Court,'' by Mark Twain; ``Office Politics,'' by Wilfrid
Sheed; ``The Catbird Seat,'' by James Thurber; and ``Typhoon,'' by
Joseph Conrad.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his book, Brawer moves nimbly between smart
interpretation of these texts and pointed real-life illustrations
of their contents. More and more as you read him, you wonder why in
the popular American imagination the image of businessmen has
fallen so far from the time in the mid-19th century when, as Brawer
points out, ``merchants thought of themselves and were generally
regarded as men of intellect and culture.'' Why has the eponymous
hero of Sinclair Lewis' ``Babbitt,'' which, Brawer argues, was
intended merely to satirize the excesses of efficiency, come to
stand for businessmen in general?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is the subject for another book by Brawer. In the
meantime, with ``Fictions of Business,'' he has dug beneath ``the
fashionable buzzwords and managerial ideologies of the day'' that
he so deplores, and made us see some universal truths common to
both business and fiction.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Cynics will wonder why, if Susan Miller can really peek into the
future, she did not predict years ago that something called the
Internet would make her fortunes rise as an astrologer. But then,
Ms. Miller _ whose Astrology Zone is one of the most popular of its
kind on the Web, spawning a number of media spinoffs _ is
accustomed to wisecracks from those who doubt that the stars and
planets guide personal fates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people see astrology as fortune telling,'' she said.
``It's not. It's the study of cycles.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller, who is in her mid-40s (she won't be more specific)
learned astrology from her mother as a girl. And she did have some
early clues about where the cycles might take her _ and that
technology would play a role.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Aquarius was in Uranus,'' she explains. (There's more to an
astrological reading than the sun sign that even most nonbelievers
can identify.) ``I have Gemini rising, which means publishing, and
I'm a Pisces, which is philosophical. My moon is in Virgo, which
explains my voluminous manuscripts.'' But dotted throughout her
chart was the planet of things technological: Uranus.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I got on with my life, I knew something newly invented
would figure prominently in my career,'' Ms. Miller said. Which is
why, when Time Warner Electronic Publishing asked her in 1995 to
create an astrology Web site, ``I knew this would fulfill the
potential of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   What Ms. Miller did not know at the time was exactly what that
meant. She was already a personal computer devotee, having
discovered that software was a great aid in the complicated
mathematics involved in the ancient science of astrology _ which
calculates the placement of the planets at the precise time and
location on Earth of a person's birth, and continues that calculus
over the course of the person's life.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1995, the Web was new enough a medium that it would have
been hard for anyone to predict that with no publicity and a
difficult-to-find on-line address
(www.pathfinder.com/twep/astrology) that Astrology Zone would
become so popular that it would prompt a flurry of other media
deals: television commentaries on shows like Fox's ``Good Morning
New York''; a two-book contract with Warner Books, with the first
to be published in 1999; columns in magazines like McCall's, New
Woman Australia and Self; and a 900-number telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither of the leading Web-metering services, Media
Metrix or Relevant Knowledge, has comparative figures on astrology
sites, Ms. Miller said that her site attracted more than 1.3
million page views a month and had generated a mailing list of at
least 33,000 readers. Those readers log on for a detailed
commentary of the movement of the planets and an analysis of what
that means for each of the twelve signs of the zodiac _ as well as
the world at large.
</P>
<P>
   Well before the release of the Starr report, Ms. Miller wrote
about three eclipses coming in rapid succession _ an Aug. 7 lunar,
an Aug. 21 solar and a Sept. 6 lunar _ and discussed their
potential power:
</P>
<P>
   ``Close to eclipses, the media always bring news of world events
that stir us, no matter which side of the issue we happen to be on.
With any eclipse, the level of emotion is heightened, and it is
hard to think straight. No matter what comes up, don't rush to
judgment based on what you think is obvious. Eclipses push so much
information at us that it is hard to make sense of it all at once.
Sit back, think, read, reflect, talk, and think some more.''
</P>
<P>
   Another popular feature on the site is a match-making guide,
where readers can determine whether a love interest is
astrologically appropriate and figure out suitable gifts and
courting techniques according to sign. ``If you take your Scorpio
beloved out for dinner,'' she suggested to men trying to woo a
woman born under that sign, ``make it a private little dark
rendezvous, overlooking water if possible or, better yet, as a
guest on a private yacht (preferably yours).''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller _ who juggles her astrology ventures with the
photographers' agency Susan Miller Represents, which she runs with
her business partner, Evelyn Brady _ said she was no longer
surprised by the variety of people who were interested in her line
of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the creative ones would be the only ones interested
in astrology,'' she said. ``I was afraid to tell techno-heads that
I was into this. But they were into it. Mathematicians, scientists,
people dealing in biology, were very intrigued as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web, Ms. Miller conjectured, allows people who might not
otherwise admit an interest in horoscopes to check out the stars in
relative privacy.
</P>
<P>
   That tendency has made astrology popular elsewhere on the
Internet, as well. America Online helped start Astro Net, based in
New Canaan, Conn., in 1995. Its creators say that 300,000 people
read its horoscopes each day, and America Online officials confirm
that Astro Net has become one of the online service's most popular
features.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a business standpoint, there are a lot of people who
`don't believe in astrology,' but a lot of people who read their
horoscopes,'' said Eugenie Diserio, president of Astro Net.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Purveying broad advice, rather than predicting specific
incidents, is what Ms. Miller sees as the role of astrology. But it
was one such case, in late 1994, that sent her into the business
from her original career as an agent for commercial photographers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was selling photographs to Warner Books because they needed
cover art, and portraits,'' Ms. Miller said in explaining her
accidental foray into the business of calculating charts.
</P>
<P>
   To the creative director, Jackie Meyer, she confided her
astrology skills, and thanked her for the business by reading her
charts over lunch. ``I told her I would like her to buy a lottery
ticket the last two weeks of December,'' Ms. Miller said. ``She
said, `I never win,' and I said, `Just buy something.' ''
</P>
<P>
   According to Ms. Miller, Ms. Meyer forgot that she had already
purchased a raffle ticket in the office, which resulted in a
telephone call on New Year's Eve telling her she had just won a
Porsche.
</P>
<P>
   ``She called and said, `I have 30 editors outside my door who
want to meet you,' '' remembered Ms. Miller, who credits that bit
of soothsaying as the incident that pushed her out of the
astrological closet. Ms. Meyer ultimately offered her a book
contract, and offered her up as a candidate for the site she now
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller, who earned a degree in business from New York
University, is pragmatic about her calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think things are fated,'' Ms. Miller said. ``I am
dealing with probability. When you are in a good cycle, your
probability statistics are high. When things are going against you,
I don't want you taking big risks. When you're in a tough cycle,
there's always somewhere in your chart that's good.''

`A PARALYZING FEAR': POLIO'S SENTENCE OF DEATH OR DISABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end of the review)  
(js) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a while in the 1940s, movie fans could count not only on a
double feature, a newsreel and a cartoon at their local movie
house, but also on a plea from a star for a contribution to fight
polio. The clink of coins in cans was the music for what must be
the most successful publicity campaign in a worthy cause ever to
capture America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The March of Dimes,'' as it was famously known, is celebrated
Monday night in ``A Paralyzing Fear: The Story of Polio in
America.'' Pictures from the archives recall a period when
outbreaks of the mysterious ailment known as infantile paralysis
were crippling and killing children, yet the federal government had
not yet ventured seriously into fighting the disease.
</P>
<P>
   This history, like the companion book by Nina Gilden Seavey,
Jane Smith and Paul Wagner, gives a survivors' eye view of the
illness: pain, isolation and paralysis; braces, crutches and iron
lungs; little hope of cure and fear of death. Among the survivors,
most memorably, was Franklin D. Roosevelt, who served as president
without the use of his legs and inspired what would become a
national drive to prevent polio.
</P>
<P>
   The humane hucksterism of the time, presided over by Basil
O'Connor, the March of Dimes impresario, made powerful use of
celebrity appeals, ``birthday balls,'' ``mothers' marches,'' ``the
poster child'' and other means of raising money for the research
that would bring success. A short course in the nature of polio and
the urgent efforts to develop a vaccine against it are provided,
but the focus is on a few men and women whose lives were forever
changed by the disease.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, as the incidence of polio was on the rise (59,000
new cases in 1952), hopes were invested in the ``killed virus''
approach developed by Jonas Salk and the ``live virus'' approach of
Albert Sabin, a competition that has been treated in sharper detail
elsewhere: the Salk injections won the initial race, reducing polio
cases markedly; then, by the 1960s, they were replaced by the
easier to administer Sabin oral vaccine, which was endorsed by the
American Medical Association in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   The happy ending was the eradication of polio in North America,
although epidemics continue in some parts of the world. As for the
early sufferers from whom we hear extensively on Monday, the
reaction is more melancholy. ``For me it was too little too late,''
one says. ``But I was so grateful no one else would have to go
through this.''

AD REVENUES DECLINE AT SOME NEWSPAPERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla., N.Y., Texas)  (js) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Advertising revenue has fallen off sharply at Dow
Jones &AMP; Co.'s two major newspapers, The Wall Street Journal and
Barron's, a sign of newspapers' vulnerability to
industry-by-industry and region-by-region economic storms.
</P>
<P>
   But to date, according to several newspaper business executives
and two economists at the Newspaper Association of America, an
industry trade group, most newspaper companies have gained at least
as much as they have lost despite the gyrations of the world's
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal's third-quarter advertising volume was down about
6.7 percent over the corresponding quarter in 1997, Dow Jones said.
The September comparisons were off more sharply, reflecting an
increasingly steep drop in advertising from banks and other major
financial concerns, according to a Dow Jones executive who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, Dow Jones also announced a buyout plan for 340
eligible employees who turn 55 by the end of the year and have
worked for Dow Jones for at least 10 years. That development, said
Richard Tofel, a spokesman for the company, had been planned for
nearly two months and was unrelated to the bad news about
advertising revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock rose $1 Friday to close at $44.6875.
</P>
<P>
   Miles Groves, the chief economist for the Newspaper Association
of America, an industry trade group, said the Journal's revenue
decline was an anomaly because it is a traditional vehicle for
financial services advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the most vulnerable sector,'' Groves said. ``For most
newspapers, it's a different situation.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he and James Conaghan, the association's director
for market and business analysis, said the trend of deregulation in
utility industries had been a boon for newspapers, which are prime
vehicles for the newly competitive industry's advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, Groves said, he would not alter his standing forecast
that spending by companies and individuals advertising in
newspapers would increase by more than 6 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   But there are setbacks in some regions. The Boston Globe, which
is owned by The New York Times Co.; The San Jose Mercury-News, one
of the biggest papers in the Knight Ridder newspaper chain; and The
Los Angeles Times, the flagship of the Times Mirror Co., have all
seen classified advertising revenues, particularly those from
help-wanted ads, scaled back since the high-technology business
started losing customers in Asia, because of economic turmoil
there.
</P>
<P>
   Local housing market trends had a negative impact in Miami and
San Francisco. The Miami Herald, another Knight Ridder paper, has
had difficulties with classified advertising for a different
reason. A building boom, fueled in part by demand from Latin
American buyers seeking a place of their own in Miami, went through
a lull in the last year, according to The Herald's publisher,
Alberto Ibarguen. The result has been a softening in revenue from
real estate advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The decline, Ibarguen added, began long before the summer shocks
in the world's financial markets. ``Our issues have been classified
all year long,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Guittar, the publisher and editor of The San Francisco
Examiner, which is owned by Hearst Corp., said a robust housing
market had meant few vacancies and therefore fewer real estate ads:
while ad revenues were running about 6.5 percent ahead of 1997 in
the first two quarters, the increase was closer to 2 percent in the
third quarter, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, the opening of a city airport is expected to bring
new airline competition to challenge the dominant Southwest
Airlines _ an industry battle that could mean new advertising for
The Dallas Morning News, according to Burl Osborne, the newspaper's
publisher. But the newspaper, which had record-high revenues in
telecommunications advertising in 1997, has not been able to
improve on those figures significantly, he added. The Morning News
is owned by A.H. Belo Co.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times also saw a slight falloff in classified
advertising revenues, largely in the help-wanted category, said
Nancy Nielsen, spokeswoman for The New York Times Co. But, she
added, national advertising revenues have far outpaced the 1997
figures.

POPE CALLS FOR PEACE AND INTERNATIONAL AID IN THE BALKANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPLIT, Croatia _ At a seaside mass here Pope John Paul II called
for reconciliation throughout the former Yugoslavia and urged the
world to do more for the victims of the Balkan war that ended not
long ago in Croatia and that has most recently raged in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could we not recall with anxious concern the continuing
tragedy taking place in nearby Kosovo?'' the pope asked from a vast
podium built to look like a ship's prow before hundreds of
thousands of believers squeezed along the shore and onto boats
bobbing in the water. ``May understanding, mutual respect,
forgiveness and reconciliation at last take the place of violence
and destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   He urged the international community to ``not fail to provide
its timely help.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope's visit was joyously welcomed by Croats and the
nationalist government of President Franjo Tudjman. Tudjman's
popularity has waned even among Catholics under his strong-armed
leadership and the country's economic and social troubles. The
archbishop of Zagreb, Monsignor Josip Bozanic, 49, who was
appointed a year ago, has frequently spoken out against corruption
in the government and other failings.
</P>
<P>
   The Croatian president took every opportunity to place himself
at the pope's side during the three-day visit. He had a private
audience on Saturday afternoon in his residential palace in Zagreb,
a modernist glass-and-brick house built for Tito in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   But the pope did not give his host a blank check. At the mass,
and later in his farewell remarks at the airport, John Paul II
rather pointedly called on Croats to make ``society and its civil
institutions more democratic'' in a country that is rarely
described as open and free.
</P>
<P>
   ``After long years of dictatorship and the terrible experiences
of violence which the peoples of this region have undergone,'' the
pontiff said at the airport, ``it is now necessary to make every
effort to construct a democracy based on the moral values inscribed
in the very nature of the human being.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of the visit, however, the pope's attention was focused
on another, more remote conflict, namely the Catholic Church's
struggle against Communism during the Cold War, which the
Polish-born pope experienced first-hand. The pope arrived in
Croatia, a country of 4 million that is more than 75 percent
Catholic, on Friday to beatify one of Croatia's national heros,
Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, who was persecuted by Tito after World
War II and died under house arrest in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Beatification is the final step before sainthood, and the homage
was highly controversial. Though many historians say that Stepinac
helped save the lives of hundreds of Jews and others during the
war, he was tried as a Nazi collaborator by the Communists. He is
still viewed by Orthodox Serbs as the symbol of the Croatian
Catholic Church's complicity with the Ustashe, the World War II
fascist regime that killed tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of
Serbs, Jews and other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Tudjman government has sought to rehabilitate the Ustashe
regime as the founder of the modern, independent Croatian state.
Croatia's centuries-old Serbian minority has mostly left or been
driven out of Tudjman's state.
</P>

<P>
   In 1994, when the pope made his first papal visit to Croatia,
the country was still in the throes of a war started when Croatia
broke away from Yugoslavia in 1991 and lost a third of its
territory to Serbs. Earlier this year, the United Nations returned
control of the last Serb-dominated area in Croatia, Eastern
Slavonia, to the Croatian government. Prosperity has not yet
returned along with the fragile peace.
</P>
<P>
   As the pope lamented Croatia's tragic past and uncertain
present, he also reminded Catholics not to follow the West too
closely in its search for a better future. At a meeting with the
Croatian Bishop's Conference after the Sunday mass, John Paul II
reminded Croatian church leaders to keep followers in line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, in the new democratic climate, it is necessary to give
strong support to the new evangelization, so that the human person,
the family and society as a whole will not be harmed and fall into
the trap of consumerism and hedonism'' the pope said.

ADVERTISING: FOUR A'S LOOSENS MEMBERSHIP RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 BY STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Association of Advertising Agencies, in a
significant step, is opening membership for the first time to
independently owned agencies that specialize in services outside
the realm of traditional advertising, like media planning and
buying, public relations and corporate identity consulting.
</P>
<P>
   The change, to be announced formally Monday and take immediate
effect, is indicative of marketers' increasing communication with
consumers in ways different from such conventional methods as
television commercials and print advertisements. It is also
emblematic of the remaking of the agency industry as mergers and
acquisitions reduce the ranks of membership in the association,
known as the Four A's, from a peak of 764 in 1988 to 540 today.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as if to underline that trend, Avrett, Free &AMP; Ginsberg
in New York _a midsized independent shop that has long been a
member of the association _ unexpectedly agreed on Friday to be
acquired by a Madison Avenue giant. Avrett, Free, which handles
accounts with billings estimated at $370 million, is being bought
for undisclosed terms by the Bozell Worldwide unit of True North
Communications in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a lot of consolidation in our membership base
over the last decade,'' said O. Burtch Drake, president and chief
executive of the Four A's in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that the advertising agency business is
changing,'' he added, ``and the association founded to serve the
industry must reflect this reality and evolve.''
</P>
<P>
   The Four A's ``will not change our primary focus,'' Drake said,
because ``advertising is what the association is about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the age of just doing 30-second commercials for most
clients is long gone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The association now has members that do not create traditional
forms of advertising, but only because they are owned by agencies
that do. For instance, Western International Media is a Four A's
member because it is part of Interpublic Group of Cos., but an
independent competitor, DeWitt Media Inc., has not been eligible to
join.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obviously pleased'' by the change, said Bob Flood,
senior vice president and director for national broadcast at DeWitt
in New York. ``This acknowledges the value of media in the
advertising process.''
</P>
<P>
   DeWitt ``will consider joining'' the association, he added,
because ``we always felt we were part of the advertising
community.''
</P>
<P>
   A top executive at an independent public relations agency
described the loosening of the membership rules as ``long
overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the acceptance of public relations as a key part of
integrated marketing,'' said Renee Edelman, executive vice
president at PR 21 in New York, owned by Daniel Edelman Inc., which
also owns Edelman Public Relations Worldwide, the largest
freestanding public relations agency.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edelman said that she would ``definitely'' join the Four A's
as a result of the revamping of the membership provisions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to Drake, the change would not increase revenue for
the association because ``dues are based on a percentage of
members' revenues'' rather than the number of members.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if one agency buys another,'' Drake said, ``the revenues
are combined and the acquirer pays on the combined amount.''
Revenue at the Four A's has increased to $13 million for 1998-99,
he added, from about $8.5 million in the corresponding period a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   True North will be paying more in dues as a result of the deal
to acquire Avrett, Free, which lists among its clients the Clairol
Professional unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.; Crayola, owned by
Hallmark Cards; Enterprise Rent-a-Car, and Ralston Purina Co.
Avrett, Free, founded in 1970, will retain its name and operate as
an autonomous unit of Bozell, which also works for Bristol-Myers
Squibb.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be small, medium and large agencies and you
can stay small or medium,'' said Frank Ginsberg, 51, who will
continue as president, chief executive and creative director at
Avrett, Free. ``But to keep up with the needs of clients as they
grow, you've got to be part of a global network _ now more so than
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was sad that Avrett, Free was no longer free,
Ginsberg replied: ``Those people who feel independence is a
strength are great, and God bless them. But for public relations,
direct marketing, Internet marketing and expansion in North America
and worldwide, we needed to align ourselves with the right company
with the right resources and the right people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginsberg was attracted to True North because he has long been
friendly with top executives of Bozell and Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding,
the other principal worldwide agency owned by True North.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural progression of relationships,'' said David
Bell, president and chief executive at Bozell. ``Frank needed
additional resources and the opportunity to serve clients outside
the United States, and we were comfortable with him, his clients
and the way he does business.''
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is the largest made by Bozell since the agency
was acquired by True North late last year. Bozell's billings are
estimated at $3.1 billion and True North's at $10.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Among other independent agencies acquired this year are: Arnold
Communications in Boston, now part of Snyder Communications; Hill,
Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston, taken over by Interpublic,
and Hal Riney &AMP; Partners, purchased by Publicis SA.

VAUGHN'S DEPARTURE WILL BE RED SOX' LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Shame on the Red Sox for letting it come to this.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn is the heart, bones, and soul of the Red Sox
clubhouse. He is the Sox' best hitter and a true leader. He has
made himself part of the community more than any sports star in New
England history. And he is a black athlete who told the world he
likes living in Greater Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is a free agent and he's probably played his last game
for the Red Sox. It's going to be about the money and the Sox are
going to tell you that Team X is offering just too much cash and
poor Boston just can't afford to match the offer. They will paint
Mo as the greedy guy who just doesn't want to stay here.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way it ended with Roger Clemens. The Sox dragged
their feet, then said it wouldn't be prudent to compete with
Toronto's whopping offer. It was too much money for a pitcher in
the ``twilight'' of his career. Boston lost the best pitcher in
franchise history in exchange for a draft pick, and Clemens has
gone on to win back-to-back Cy Young trophies, solidifying his
place in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Dan Duquette promised that he would not allow
Vaughn to leave the same way Clemens left. But it's happening
again. No doubt the offer Mo gets will be too eye-popping to match.
And that will be the team's spin _ Mo's too expensive. But everyone
who's been paying attention knows it never should have gotton to
this point.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, specifically Duquette and CEO John Harrington, have
alienated Vaughn and his family. Certainly, they have paid Vaughn
well and made sizeable donations to his youth foundation. But they
should have taken care of Mo's contract last winter when the
numbers would have been more reasonable. Instead, they took care of
everybody else and made it clear Mo was not part of their plan.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra was locked up well into the next century, even
though he had no leverage to leave until 2002. Troy O'Leary, Tim
Wakefield, Jeff Frye, and Tom Gordon were signed. Jimy Williams and
Duquette himself got extensions. And of course, Pedro Martinez was
given a six-year, $75 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no money for Mo. There was no urgency about
signing Vaughn. Then Mo harpooned himself with a drunken driving
arrest (he was acquitted) and management had the hammer.
</P>
<P>
   They used the hammer, demanding that Vaughn submit to alcohol
evaluation as a condition of any new pact. Then they kicked off a
massive public relations campaign, selling Nomar as the team's new
star. It was all Nomar all the time. Nomar was portrayed as the
anti-Mo. Duquette talked about how Nomar was a real ``baseball
player'' (as opposed to Mo, who must have been playing bocce all
these years). Nomar was a ``conditioned athlete'' (as opposed to
Mo, the sloppy town drunk).
</P>
<P>
   Nomar is the perfect Duquette player. He was drafted by Dan,
signed by Dan, promoted by Dan, and he has succeeded beyond all
expectations. Nomar says nothing controversial, considers public
relations an outside distraction, and goes about his work. Sound
like any GM you know?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, all season Duquette avoided any positive mention
about Vaughn. When asked, ``Do you like Mo Vaughn?'' Duquette would
answer, ``Mo is a very good hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer was clear. The Duke didn't like Mo, probably because
Vaughn represented the previous administration. Take a good look at
the Sox roster, around the team offices, and the farm system. Most
of those who were here before Dan are gone or demoted.
</P>
<P>
   Among player personnel, Vaughn, John Valentin, and Trot Nixon
are the only holdovers from the prior regime. All have had their
chops busted by management. And now Vaughn is ready to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox of 1998 were Mo Vaughn's team. They will be Mo's
team until Mo leaves. Then they will be Dan's team and all will be
right with the Duquette Universe. The Duke must have majored in
Machiavelli at Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington, who controls the cash register, has not helped this
situation by letting Duquette snub Mo (remember the Duke talking
about Sox All-Stars Garciaparra, Pedro, and Flash when the 1999
All-Star logo was unveiled?) and by detailing the team's
negotiating strategy in the newspaper. Mo knows when he's being set
up to be the bad guy.
</P>
<P>
   If Mo goes, remember that he lit up the sky here for the better
part of the 1990s, emerging as a Sox leader of Tiantesque
dimensions. He put enormous pressure on himself in the spring of
1998, then responded with 40 homers, 115 RBIs, and almost a share
of the batting title. Remember, his last at-bat was a wall double
when the Sox needed a run to stay alive in the Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   Mo said the price would go up every day, and no doubt it has.
That's why it will be the Red Sox' fault if he goes. They'll claim
his price tag is too high if he leaves, but discerning fans know
the Sox should have taken care of Mo Vaughn long ago.

   BOMBAY, India _ The melodrama was irresistible to playwright
Pradeep Dalvi: An eloquent, idealistic thinker, who had studied the
teachings of history, fires three bullets into the bony chest of
this century's greatest apostle of nonviolence, Mohandas K. Gandhi,
then puts down his gun and shouts for the police to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences packed the Shivaji Mandir auditorium in July to see
Dalvi's play about Gandhi's assassin, Nathuram Godse, 50 years
after the murder of India's most beloved pacifist. Many
theatergoers lustily cheered the killer's impassioned condemnations
of Gandhi's philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of nonviolence is this?'' the protagonist asks. ``We
are advised to keep quiet when Hindus are being massacred. But to
allow a massacre is violence, not nonviolence.''
</P>
<P>
   The drama won no fans in the Hindu nationalist-led government in
New Delhi. Despite sold-out shows, ``I, Nathuram Godse Speaking,''
was shut down after only seven performances, banned as a threat to
law and order on the strong recommendation of the national
government. The play's producers say they will fight the ban in
state court in coming weeks after they have the script translated
into English from Marathi, as the court requires.
</P>
<P>
   The case touches on free speech, but also on Indians'
complicated attitude toward the man considered the father of their
nation _ and toward his assassin. Gandhi is a kind of secular saint
here, but his ideals are admired more in principle than in
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, there has been a rash of plays and books that portray
Gandhi as a flawed father and husband. They have been tolerated.
But Dalvi's drama, which he says does not glorify the killer, has
been widely interpreted as doing so. And that has proved more than
the country's leaders are willing to countenance.
</P>
<P>
   If the producers lose their court battle to lift the ban, the
drama's next venue may well be Dayton, Ohio. There, Harsh Trivedi,
who heads a small foundation that promotes Indian culture, will put
on his own English translation of the play in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had planned to tone down some of the provocative lines, but
in view of the ban, which is quite shocking, I'll produce the play
in full without changing anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Censorship has succeeded in bringing the drama to national
prominence. A veritable army of columnists has dissected Godse's
views.
</P>
<P>
   The play is largely based on court records and Godse's lengthy
final speech to the court, as well as Dalvi's interviews with
surviving conspirators. Godse's character, talking easily with the
audience, narrates his evolution from a young militant who saw
himself as a defender of Hindus to the man who committed the most
dastardly crime in modern-day India. The play takes him through his
trial and walk to the gallows.
</P>
<P>
   ``People came backstage to touch the feet of the actor who
played Godse,'' Dalvi said.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks to the court, Godse blamed Gandhi for the 1947
partition of the country into Pakistan and India, which Gandhi
lobbied against behind the scenes but did not crusade against in
public. Hundreds of thousands were killed in the mass migration of
Hindus and Moslems after the division.
</P>
<P>
   The assassin also condemned what he saw as Gandhi's favoritism
toward Muslims. In his final fast, Gandhi, who believed the best
way to peace between Hindus and Muslims lay in the generosity of
the dominant Hindus, insisted that India pay predominantly Muslim
Pakistan a financial settlement promised at partition.
</P>
<P>
   Ashis Nandy, a well-known political psychologist who is a senior
fellow at the Center for the Study of Developing Societies in New
Delhi, provocatively asserts that the murder cleared the way for
India to become a conventional, modern nation built on reason,
science and industry. Godse advocated what Nandy calls
``Kissingerian realpolitik'' _ that India should act in its own
self-interest and strive to be a military and industrial power on
the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Godse articulated the myth of the modern nation-state in a way
that the Indian middle-class would like to subscribe to, but he
also killed Gandhi, so they feel morally uncomfortable about
agreeing with some of Godse's ideas,'' Nandy said. ``That is why
they would like to avoid confronting the issues raised by the
play.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The play certainly outraged guardians of Gandhian ideals across
India. Even some of those who battled censorship under the British
Raj say that restrictions on expression are occasionally justified
in a country where words can lead to murderous outbreaks of
violence between caste and religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the Congress Party made this argument to justify
banning Salman Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' which some
Muslims said had blasphemed their God. And this ambivalence is
written into India's constitution, which guarantees free expression
but also allows it to be restricted in the interests of public
order and morality.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say censorship has too often been used by elected
officials who are really pandering to constituents _ in the case of
Dalvi's play, the millions of Indians who revere Gandhi as a
hallowed leader. But The Times of India, the nation's largest
English-language daily, praised the decision. ``Any act condoning a
heinous crime offends public morality, as well,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Dalvi said he got the idea for the play in the early 1980s when
he met Godse's brother, Gopal, who kept the assassin's ashes in a
pewter urn. ``I actually saw the ashes,'' Dalvi said. ``I touched
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stage Performances Scrutiny Board in Maharashtra, a culture
police that exists in all Indian states, denied permission to
produce the play when Dalvi first requested it in 1984. But when he
asked again this year, three years after a Hindu nationalist
coalition took power here, the board gave its approval. Bal
Thackeray, the head of the Shiv Sena party leading the government,
has made no secret of his admiration for Godse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not staunch Gandhians,'' said Pramod Navalkar,
Maharashtra's Minister of Culture. ``But we respect Gandhi and we
found that there was no insult to the Mahatma.''
</P>
<P>
   Usha Mehta, a tiny 78-year-old woman who heads the Gandhi
Memorial Trust in Bombay and who was once a soldier in Gandhi's
nonviolent army, disagreed and single-handedly sparked the campaign
against the play.
</P>
<P>
   She never saw the drama, but she was outraged when she read a
newspaper article that quoted Dalvi as saying he hoped audiences
would smash statues of Gandhi after seeing his play. Ms. Mehta
immediately wrote a letter of protest to Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as freedom fighters know the value of freedom of
expression, but we certainly do not equate freedom with license,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dalvi denies that he encouraged playgoers to smash Gandhi's
statue and insists that he was only trying to explain, not justify,
Godse's indefensible act.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Congress Party led the fight to ban the play on
the floor of Parliament in New Delhi. Vajpayee, who heads the Hindu
nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and seeks to distance it from
Godse's brand of zealotry, asked Home Minister L.K. Advani to act.
Advani, in turn, advised the state to ban the play.
</P>
<P>
   After the play's supporters and opponents clashed outside the
theater on July 17, the state _ led by a coalition that includes
Vajpayee's party _ held an emergency Cabinet meeting and bowed to
the wishes of the government in New Delhi. The Bombay commissioner
of police revoked the license to perform the play.
</P>
<P>
   Dalvi says his motives have been misunderstood and his rights
violated. In an interview, he said that Nathuram Godse himself had
become ``the hero of this thing'' and that Godse's co-conspirator
and brother, Gopal, had credited the playwright with giving the
assassin a voice from the grave.
</P>
<P>
   Dalvi quoted Gopal: ``Gopal said, `I could not take what
Nathuram wanted to say to the people for 50 years. What I could not
do in 50 years, Pradeep Dalvi did in eight days.'''

   Marcel Duchamp (1887-1968) and Joseph Cornell (1903-1972) were
friends and sometimes collaborators. Now the relationship between
the radical Duchamp (``Nude Descending a Staircase'') and the
influential Cornell, best known for the constructions called boxes,
will be explored at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in an exhibition
that will be on view from Thursday through Jan. 3. The exhibition,
``Joseph Cornell/Marcel Duchamp ... in Resonance,'' assembles 57
works by Cornell and 32 by Duchamp. Information: (215) 763-8100.

   The literature of rebellion, the poetry of freedom and the
language of rock-and-roll are among topics to come under scrutiny
starting on Friday, when the 1998 Cheltenham Festival of Literature
opens in Cheltenham, England. In its 49th year and billed as the
world's longest-running book festival, this event, through Oct. 18,
gathers novelists, poets, biographers and academics, as well as
dramatists, cartoonists, artists, musicians and politicians, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare will be reassessed, and Giles de la Mare will evoke
the genius of his grandfather, the poet and novelist Walter de la
Mare, on the centenary of his birth. Helen Fielding (aka Bridget
Jones), John Fowles and William Boyd are also among the
attractions. As the bon mot flies, Cheltenham is 41 miles west of
Oxford. Information: 011-44-1242-22-79-79.

ITALIAN GOVERNMENT'S STABILITY IS THREATENED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ It is autumn in Italy, the birds are going south, and so
it seems could the Italian government, as the bonds of compromise
and political opportunism that bind a small leftist party to the
government came undone Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The latest threat to the government of Prime Minister Romano
Prodi came after delegates to a two-day conference of the Communist
Refounding Party voted to reject the government's proposed 1999
budget, imperiling the future of the center-left coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the prime minister's office said Sunday night that
Prodi would meet on Monday with President Oskar Luigi Scalfaro to
discuss the political turbulence, though not to offer his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   If the Communist Refounding's parliamentary deputies abide by
the resolution, which passed by a vote of 188-112, it will
destabilize Italy's government at a time when the outcome of the
recent election in Germany has already injected a note of
uncertainty into the future of European economic and fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro Zani, a spokesman for the Democratic Party of the Left,
the main party in Prodi's coalition, called the decision by
Communist Refounding a ``misfortune for the entire country.''
Passage of the budget, he said, is essential ``to avoid disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Prodi's coalition is a loose alliance of the former Communists,
known as the Democratic Party of the Left, and Prodi's moderate
Catholic-oriented followers. It is supported by Communist
Refounding, a fringe group of hard-line leftists who broke with the
mainstream Communists after they overhauled the party following the
collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Despite frequent shocks, the alliance has held since 1996, glued
together mainly by the desire to meet the fiscal requirements to
allow Italy to adopt the single European currency.
</P>
<P>
   As the Jan. 1 date approaches for the introduction of the new
money, the euro, Italy must cut its key lending rates to bring them
in line with those of bigger European neighbors, like Germany. A
rate cut by the Italian central bank is generally thought to hinge
on passage of the budget bill. If the bill is not passed, negative
signals would be sent to global financial markets that are already
upset because of the financial crises in Asia, Russia and Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Prodi's backers were still hoping that a sufficient
number of Communist Refounding deputies would break ranks and back
the budget when it comes up for a vote in Parliament later this
week. If that fails, a centrist group that rescued Prodi in June
under similar circumstances and that is led by former President
Francesco Cossiga announced it would support the budget, thus at
least assuring parliamentary passage.
</P>
<P>
   Communist Refounding and its mercurial leader, Fausto
Bertinotti, have pushed Prodi to the brink twice before. The party
forced him to offer his resignation last year over proposed budget
cuts, but then backpeddled after the party's rank and file
protested. In June, the hard-line leftists again refused to follow
the prime minister, that time in a Parliament vote for NATO
expansion, but the government muddled through with the help of
Cossiga's party.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the leaders of that centrist group, Clemente
Mastella, said Sunday that it would not support the government
generally, leaving the future of Prodi's coalition highly
uncertain.

ARAB CONCERN GROWS OVER TURKEY-SYRIA DISPUTE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk)  
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ In a sign of Arab concern over growing tensions
between Turkey and Syria, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flew on
short notice to Syria on Sunday in an effort to defuse what is
being portrayed in the Middle East as an unsettling crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak met with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and was
expected to renew his mediation bid on Monday by traveling to
Ankara, the Turkish capital, for meetings with top officials there.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish officials have accused Syria of allowing the country to
be used as a base for Kurdish rebels who have been fighting for
self-rule in southeastern Turkey. Official newspapers in Syria have
denied the contention and have called for talks to end the dispute,
as did the Syrian and Egyptian foreign ministers after their
meeting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between the two countries include a territorial
dispute and arguments over Turkey's diversion of water from the two
rivers that flow into Syria.
</P>
<P>
   A military conflict between Syria and Turkey is still considered
remote, Egyptian officials said Sunday night. But a Turkish warning
that differences with Syria had reached the stage of ``undeclared
war'' has prompted worries that if clashes began, they might
spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fire that has been smoldering for a long time, but
it has now reached the point at which it wouldn't take a whole lot
more to turn it into a real blaze,'' a diplomat from Cairo said.
</P>
<P>
   In this region, at least, the situation is considered explosive
because of Turkey's new and friendlier relations with Israel. The
two countries signed a military cooperation agreement in 1996 and
have conducted several joint exercises.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Arab newspapers have suggested that Turkey's
alignment with Israel may lie behind its toughened stance toward
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   A typical editorial, published Sunday in the independent
al-Khaleej newspaper in the United Arab Emirates, said that it was
``notable that the sudden Turkish escalation has come in the
framework of the military alliance with Tel Aviv, whereby Syria is
placed between the hammer and anvil.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel, for its part, has taken pains to distance itself from
the crisis, saying it plans to scale down its military activity
along its border with Syria to signal that it is not a party to the
dispute.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Arab League, which last month formally condemned the
Turkish-Israeli ties, issued a statement Sunday saying that the
tensions between Turkey and Syria represented ``a blatant threat to
the security and stability of the region.'' But only Iraq among
Arab countries has explicitly criticized Turkey for the hard line
that it has taken against Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Although Turkey has repeatedly stated its willingness to accept
a diplomatic solution, its official statements have also maintained
a vaguely threatening air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not only warning Syria, I am warning the world,'' the
Anatolia news agency quoted President Suleyman Demirel as saying
Sunday. ``This cannot continue. We are in a position of
self-defense. The situation is serious. Turkey has suffered for
many years, and it no longer wants to suffer.''

WWUS IN KEY WEST IS A VOICE IN THE STORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JIM CARRIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The voice that haunts Bill Becker is a woman's, filled with
fear, who dialed in the dark on Sept. 25 as Hurricane Georges
reached its 100 mph peak over the Florida Keys. She was huddled in
a closet, her house shaking, a phone in one ear and a portable
radio tuned to WWUS-FM, said Becker, news director of the station.
</P>
<P>
   As water ran under his feet and chunks of concrete ripped out of
the studio roof, Becker chatted with the woman and hundreds of
others in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the only thing connecting these people,'' Becker said.
``They were describing the water rising. They were asking, `How
high is it going to get?' You could hear the howling of the wind in
their phones.''
</P>
<P>
   In an industry dominated by group ownership and satellite-fed
formats with disembodied voices, the sound of neighbors holding
hands on the air seems almost old-fashioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was absolutely essential,'' said the Monroe County sheriff,
Richard Roth. ``We wound up using that as our main source for
supplying information.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, WWUS, owned by Crain Communications of Chicago, is live
only between 7 a.m. and 11 a.m. with news and a flea market. At 11
a.m. the station plugs in an oldies satellite feed from Westwood
One and CNN newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly after Georges arrived around dawn on Sept. 25, with
30,000 people still in the Keys, the station's general manager, Bob
Soos, opened the phones. Six lines jammed immediately.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 a.m. the satellite dish blew away. By noon an inch of
water had turned the carpets into sponges. Callers reported yachts
floating in back yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't show people you were scared, though I really
was,'' Gene Michaels, the operations manager, said.
</P>
<P>
   As night fell and the worst of the winds struck Key West, studio
lights flickered. Michaels played Don McLean's
eight-and-a-half-minute-long ``American Pie,'' giving him time to
suck up water with a shop vacuum. He signed off at 1 a.m. as the
hurricane headed for the Gulf Coast.

GREAT TREATS DEALT OUT AT BRIDGE GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there has been a decline of creativity in the American
kitchen, you can't necessarily blame Wendy, Ronald McDonald or that
hairless dog that hangs around taco parlors.
</P>
<P>
   Not nearly enough women play bridge anymore. At least not
between the hours of 1 and 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, at that hour wives and mothers are climbing into
tractor cabs, space capsules, police cars or the command bridge on
aircraft carriers. Or they are rapidly climbing the ladder in
corporate board rooms.
</P>
<P>
   That's all very well, but what kind of recipes will they be able
to pass on to future generations? That is, excluding the recipe
that begins, ``Remove pizza from box before placing in 450-degree
oven.''
</P>
<P>
   They didn't capture the moments on film, but I have a strong
hunch that Beaver Cleaver's mother played a whole lot of bridge, as
did many others of her generation. And they left a legacy for their
well-fed offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the bridge-club ritual involved serving something
fattening to the ladies around the table. Sometimes it was a
luncheon dish. More often it was just a midafternoon dessert. You
could probably play bridge without cards. But you could not play
bridge without homemade fudge on each table.
</P>
<P>
   It was assumed that a homemaker who could serve a three-no-trump
treat in a card game with friends was capable of a culinary grand
slam on occasions such as Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   An enthusiastic Seattle cook named Bill Gannon recalls that his
mother's bridge club was known as ``The Hungry Eight.'' He
inherited her recipe box and decided he should share the wealth
with friends and relatives. He incorporated some of the recipes
into a Christmas booklet.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Gannon's friends reciprocated by sending him recipes of
their own so he compiled four more annual mailings. One of them
contained a recipe for the famous tomato soup served at the 4 B's
restaurants in Montana. Former Post-Intelligencer staffer Eleanor
Shaw introduced me to the soup, and to Gannon.
</P>
<P>
   4 B's Tomato Soup
</P>
<P>
   1 32-ounce can diced tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce butter
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of baking soda
</P>
<P>
   9 ounces chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   2 cups cream
</P>
<P>
   Into a pot dump the tomatoes, butter, sugar, soda, broth and
onion. Simmer for an hour. Heat the cream in a double boiler, add
to the soup pot. Stir and serve to six tractor drivers or eight
bridge players.
</P>
<P>
   My friend Bobbi Roumonada, whose parents founded the 4 B's, says
her father sometimes used whipping cream, but you could use
half-and-half. Bobbi also says she prefers to dump the cooked
tomato mixture into a blender or processor for just a quick hit
before adding the cream. She likes a few tomato chunks in the
finished product, but not a lot of them.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another recipe from Gannon's collection. He credits ``Bev
from Mercer Island'' for:
</P>
<P>
   Mercer Island White Chili
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 pound boneless chicken breasts, diced
</P>
<P>
   3 shallots, peeled and chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 18-ounce can tomatillos, drained and cut up
</P>
<P>
   1 10-ounce can chopped tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   10 ounces chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   1 7-ounce can diced green chilies
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon coriander seeds, crushed
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon dried oregano, crumbled
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   2 cans white kidney beans (30 ounces total)
</P>
<P>
   Juice of one lime
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   In a large pot heat the oil. Brown the chicken hunks, then
remove. Add to the pot the shallots and garlic and saute until
soft. Stir in the tomatillos (Bev prefers Progresso green
tomatoes), tomatoes with liquid, the chicken broth, green chilies _
and don't forget the spices.
</P>
<P>
   Bring ingredients of the pot to a boil, reduce heat and simmer
20 minutes. Return chicken pieces to the pot and dump in the white
beans (cannellini). Cook until hot. Add the lime juice, salt and
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Since Mercer Island is in the Gracious Living Belt, when Bev
divides the soup into four main-dish or six appetizer portions, she
offers guests chopped red onion, fresh chopped cilantro, avocado,
sour cream, shredded jack cheese and lime wedges, so they can
doctor the soup to their tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one other bit of advice:
</P>
<P>
   Never play penny-a-point bridge with a lady named Lucky.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   An intensifying storm in the central Plains will produce a
variety of inclement conditions in the middle of the nation on
Monday. Gusty thunderstorms will erupt across the Mississippi
Valley as an approaching cold front intercepts a very warm and
humid air mass moving north from the Gulf States. Severe
thunderstorms with large hail and perhaps a few tornadoes are
possible from northeast Texas to central Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Cold rain with embedded thunderstorms are likely from northern
Minnesota across most of the Dakotas and into eastern Montana.
Strong winds from the north in Wyoming will force the chilly, moist
air into the mountains. As the damp air ascends the sloping
terrain, heavy snow is likely in the Big Horn mountains. The
combination of brisk winds to 35 miles an hour along with the rain
will pose a hazard to livestock in the northwest Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Much cooler air will sweep southeastward across the Texas and
Oklahoma panhandles while it becomes mainly sunny and cooler in the
southwest Plains. Farther east, clouds and scattered showers will
affect the Tennessee and Ohio valleys as well as the western Great
Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast will turn cooler as a formidable high pressure
system builds southward from James Bay, Canada. Farther south,
clouds will recede from the Middle Atlantic states as drier air
circulates in from the north. The Southeast will stay dull and
humid.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the California coast will be very warm with plenty of
sunshine and gusty winds from the east. The Northwest will notice
some clouds, but the afternoon will be milder.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: High and Dry Ohio
</P>
<P>
   September was warm and very dry in Ohio. In Mansfield, only .70
inches of rain was measured making it the driest September on
record. Akron noted .61 inches for its third-driest September. Many
sections also ranked in the top ten warmest Septembers with
readings more than three degrees above average. The combination of
warmth and dryness can be attributed to a stronger than usual jet
stream across the northern states. These fast winds aloft prevented
moisture from the South from advancing into the region while
regularly drawing warm air eastward from the Plains.

   DEMS _ WASHINGTON _ When he built his winning coalition for the
presidency in 1992, President Clinton relied heavily on fellow
southern Democrats like himself. This week, when he may need them
the most, many of those same southern Democrats are likely to break
ranks and vote to open a formal inquiry into whether Clinton lied
under oath, encouraged others to lie and obstructed justice in his
affair with Monica Lewinsky. The House Judiciary Committee will
meet today and may vote on opening the inquiry, with a full House
vote later in the week. About 75 Democrats may feel forced to vote
with the Republicans for an impeachment inquiry. Rep. Sanford
Bishop (D-Ga.), the only member of the Black Caucus who voted with
the Republicans in the Alcee Hastings impeachment, may be in that
position. (Foskett, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.

   PRISON _ Gangs have come to occupy a central role in Texas
prisons. Even though gang activities are banned, membership has
more than quadrupled since the start of the decade. But rather than
separate gang members, prison authorities usually house them
together because they're easier to manage that way. And though
prison officials say they try to prevent gang activities, they have
in some instances enlisted gang leaders in efforts to maintain
order. A look at prison gangs behind the walls. (Ward, Austin
American-Statesman).

<P>
   SPECIAL REPORT: RIVERS IN THE SOUTH
</P>
<P>
   WATERWARS _ With its humid climate, bottomland swamps and lazy
streams, the South has long been regarded as water rich. But that
concept is evaporating. Because of the region's growth, experts say
there is not enough water to satisfy competing demands - for
consumption, waste treatment, development, hydropower, recreation,
irrigation and navigation. Nowhere are those concerns being aired
more dramatically than here, with Georgia, Alabama and Florida
negotiating to divide up the waters of the Chattahoochee and other
rivers flowing through the region. ``The stakes are huge,'' says
Aaron Wolf, who has consulted in international water conflicts.
``The tri-state water dispute has all the trappings of the bitter
water conflicts waged...in the dry Middle East between countries
like Jordan and Israel.'' A look at the blossoming water wars and
their potential impact on growth and environmental protection in
metro Atlanta. (Seabrook, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 70 WITH

<P>
   APALACHICOLA _ For 50 years, Donny Wilson has reaped a rich
bounty from Apalachicola Bay: oysters, shrimp, crabs. His business
has survived hurricanes and droughts. But now, he sees a new threat
upstream. He is one of many fishermen expressing concern that
Atlanta's growing demand for water is siphoning off the water that
nourishes the bay's shellfish beds. ``We don't want to pay the
price for Atlanta's growth,'' he says. (Seabrook, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 30

<P>
   AGRICULTURE _ You didn't have to be a plant scientist to figure
out who irrigated their crops and who didn't this summer in
southwest Georgia. Long stretches of stunted corn and shriveled
cotton baked in bone-dry fields - farms without irrigation - while
others were green or lush with ripening crops, a sure sign of
watering. ``If I hadn't had irrigation, I would have been wiped
out,'' says farmer Jerry Long. Scores of farmers like Long fear
that the water for their irrigation wells could become a casualty
of the water wars. (Seabrook, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 30

<P>
   NAVIGATION _ The Georgia State Ports Authority's docks in
Columbus stand empty. Only 11 barges checked in on this inland port
on the Chattahoochee River in 1997. And shippers fear there may be
even fewer barges in the future, leaving barge navigation a
footnote of Southern history, a victim of the water wars.

   WESTWARS _ Nebraska, Colorado and Kansas signed a deal in 1943
spelling out how much water each could use from the Republican

 &HT;    Next Georgia Tech game may make or break season
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Georgia Tech coach George O'Leary keeps telling his team to
approach this season as if it was playing 11 one-game seasons. The
Jackets's next game _ Saturday at N.C. State _ might be the one to
make or break the season.
</P>
<P>
   Beat N.C. State and the Yellow Jackets (3-1, 2-0 in ACC) are in
a position to fight Florida State and Virginia for the ACC title.
Lose to N.C. State, and Tech will have its work cut out to get to a
better bowl than the Carquest.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolfpack (3-1, 2-0) has been the surprise of this college
football season, upsetting Florida State 24-7 and then following it
up with a 38-17 win over Syracuse last Thursday. Wide receiver
Torry Holt (29 catches, 594 yards, four touchdowns) is making a
case for being the top receiver in the country, and quarterback
Jamie Barnette is having a good year.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in N.C. State's loss to Baylor and near-loss to Ohio
University, and the Wolfpack vulnerabilities come to the surface,
but this N.C. State team is clearly Tech's toughest 1998 opponent
yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing with great, great effort and enthusiasm,''
O'Leary said. ``They've got their crowd behind them big time.
They're making big plays on offense and defense. Holt could be tops
in the country. What doesn't he have? He's strong. He's quick. He
can catch. He's got big hands.''
</P>
<P>
   As for what Tech has planned for Holt defensively is yet to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Jamara Clark is Tech's best cover man, but he won't
be asked to take Holt on by himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anybody in the country who can cover him
one-on-one,'' O'Leary said. ``(But) If you overload on him, they've
got two other receivers who can beat you.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Tech, here are some observations by O'Leary following
Saturday's 41-13 victory over Duke:
</P>
<P>
   -Good: Joe Hamilton. Big plays on offense, like Hamilton and Dez
White hooking up for a 53-yard touchdown on Saturday. Offensive
balance.
</P>
<P>
   Creating turnovers on defense. The Yellow Jackets forced two
Duke
</P>
<P>
   turnovers and scored 10 points off of them.
</P>
<P>
   -Bad: Dropped balls. Tech had six of them against Duke.
``They're running before they have the ball,'' O'Leary said. ``You
can't do that in a
</P>
<P>
   big game.''
</P>
<P>
   -Worrisome: The health of backup quarterback George Godsey, who
pulled his hamstring at the end of Tech's practice on Thursday.
Without him against Duke, Tech had to risk playing Hamilton for the
entire game.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary said the plan was if Hamilton had to come out and the
game wasn't close to use walk-on Alex Thompson. If the game was
close and Hamilton had to come out, he'd use true freshman Jermaine
Crenshaw. O'Leary said he'll use the same plan this week if Godsey
is unable to go. The difference is Thompson will have more than one
light practice day to get prepared for something besides running
the scout team in practice. O'Leary doesn't want to use Crenshaw if
at all possible, so he can redshirt him and save him a year of
eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   UP NEXT FOR GEORGIA TECH
</P>
<P>
   Opponent: N.C. State
</P>
<P>
   When: Saturday, 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Carter-Finley Stadium, Raleigh, N.C.

 &HT;    Braves' celebration, excitement not missed by a single player
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Before the games get really grim, while there is still
time to revel in small pleasures, let us visit those precincts in
the Braves clubhouse where beating the Chicago Cubs was more than a
duty.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga had little to do with the outcome in this
division series, scoring one of the Braves 15 runs, driving in
none. The September preceding it was sleepy, with only two home
runs and nine RBIs. Still, there was no smile broader or more
genuine than Galarraga's in the champagne backwash of the Wrigley
Field visitors' quarters Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they (the rest of the Braves) get used to it, but this
is pretty special. Thirteen years and only two times in the
playoffs for me. And this is the first time I've won one. Yes, it's
really exciting,'' said Galarraga, one big, happy cat.
</P>
<P>
   So, stand back and let him roar: ``I hit .250 (in three games
against the Cubs). One-for-four, I'll take that every game if we
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've won a batting title (1993), an RBI title ('96), but this
is different. This is something special. I am really focused on
these playoffs. I want one of those rings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have managed a high level of sameness in the 1990s by
constantly changing. That's the baseball biz. Bream before McGriff
before Galarraga. And with each alteration, there comes a fresh way
to look at the Braves experience.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga proved himself a loud celebrant, whooping it up on a
Saturday night, often in his native tongue. Turns out he's a hugger
as well, slapping an unbreakable, WCW-approved hold on any teammate
or coach who happened by. And why not? At 37, he finally enjoyed
the playoffs, regardless that it was but the soup course, and a
thin broth at that. Six years in Montreal never led to anything.
His only other postseason experience was a brief flirtation in
Colorado in 1995, quickly ended by these same Braves. Bear with him
if he treats this like a major breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves can use a little giddiness at such junctures. They
can be as stiff as Oren Hatch's collar. All business, no happy
hour. New perspectives on another 100-win season and another
division series put early to bed are most welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Weiss fits the Braves mold perfectly. Plays hard, plays
smart, plays like he means it. Where there was Blauser there is now
Weiss, playing a higher level of shortstop. This first-timer in the
Braves postseason parade brings yet another slant to October.
</P>
<P>
   When he began, Weiss thought the World Series was a logical
extension of the season. ``I break in, and like that, three
straight World Series,'' he said. Weiss was a light-hitting
infielder for the Oakland A's during their last gasp of glory
(1988-90). But then reality intruded. He never won another
postseason set, never sniffed another World Series, until signing
this year with the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't take any of this for granted,'' he said. ``I realize
how hard this is. You really don't know when you're going to get
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Galarraga, lead-off man Weiss did not exactly bludgeon the
Cubs. He hit only .154, but did score the winning run in the
10th-inning of Game 2. Let 'em celebrate in peace. More will be
asked of them soon enough.

CALIFORNIA FIRM LEADS A NEW COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic had a problem.
</P>
<P>
   A big corporate client in New Jersey was convinced that there
were problems with a new network that Bell Atlantic had built for
it. Bell Atlantic knew it could slove the perceived problems, but
simply could not spare enough engineers with the right technical
skills to set things straight. So the big telephone company did
something that once might have been unthinkable for a bearer of the
Bell legacy: It sought outside help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked for a resource that could come in with the specific
network and trouble-shooting characteristics so they could work on
the team,'' recalled Evelyn Howe, director for business development
at Bell Atlantic's data networking group.
</P>
<P>
   The ``resource'' Bell Atlantic turned to back in the winter of
1996 was International Network Services Inc., a small company based
in Sunnyvale, Calif., that is in the vanguard of a new industry:
dedicated network consulting.
</P>
<P>
   INS, founded in 1991, does not manufacture equipment. It does
not run computers. It does not re-engineer business processes. It
does not develop corporate strategies. What INS does do is design,
manage and secure communications networks. And the company does it
so well that it has become the network engineers' engineer _ the
expert that the network experts can turn to when they need a
specialist's touch.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Bell Atlantic, among the other telecommunications and
technology giants that have used INS are AT&AMP;T, MCI Communications,
Worldcom, SBC Communications, Sprint, BellSouth, Cable &AMP; Wireless,
Airtouch, GTE, Cisco Systems, Compaq Computer and Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   In its narrow focus on network services, INS may be unique among
public companies, and for that it has been rewarded. It is true
that the company's stock has been slammed during the recent wave of
concern about global spending on communications networks, closing
Friday in Nasdaq trading at $34.375, down more than 37 percent from
a high of $47.125 in July. Even so, INS' stock price is still up
48.7 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike many Silicon Valley start-ups, INS makes money. The
stock trades at nearly 49 times estimated per-share earnings, a
reflection of the company's explosive revenue growth, to $170
million in the fiscal year ended in June from $16 million in fiscal
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The market opportunity is huge. The Yankee Group, a consulting
and research firm in Boston, estimates that the overall market for
network integration services will grow to $52.7 billion in 2001
from $29.6 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those services today are provided by companies which
generally focus on doing something else, like selling equipment or
managing computer rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Keirstead, who follows INS for Lehman Brothers, has a
highly plausible theory on the evolution of consulting markets, and
his notion helps put INS into context.
</P>
<P>
   The way Keirstead puts it, corporate executives have generally
been reluctant to involve outsiders in the deployment and
management of new technologies until a big company validates the
idea that outsourcing is viable. Such validation is what Electronic
Data Systems brought to computer services business in the 1960s and
what Andersen Consulting helped bring to software services in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Network services are the next stage in outsourcing. The
validation, at least in the eyes of the largest corporations, is
being performed by outsourcing operations like AT&AMP;T Solutions, IBM
Global Services and Bell Atlantic Network Integration. Now
independent companies like INS can reap the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goliaths are now looking to the INS' for help in
delivering on these contracts,'' Keirstead said.
</P>
<P>
   And as put by Howard Anderson, the Yankee Group's managing
director, corporate technology managers are trying to add technical
expertise without adding full-time employees.
</P>
<P>
   But INS does more than perform subcontracting work for
brand-name telecommunications carriers. Ascend Communications, a
data network equipment maker, has used INS engineers to help deploy
Ascend-based networks that include equipment from other companies.
And Mastercard International hired INS to help Mastercard move its
headquarters to Purchase, N.Y., from New York City in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a number of challenges that went far beyond simply
relocating computers for 1,000 people,'' said Art Carapola,
Mastercard's vice-president for global internal technology. ``INS
was commissioned to provide the network expertise we were lacking
in-house at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Considering the unusually compressed schedule, as
well as the complexity of the network transition, I do not believe
we would have met our goals without INS.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The company that wins such praise from its clients was the
creation of Donald McKinney, one of the founders of Silicon
Graphics Inc. He use his textbook understanding of the inner
workings of Silicon Valley to create and build INS.
</P>
<P>
   First he turned to Sequoia Capital, the venture capital firm. He
wanted financing, but just as important, he wanted the blessing of
Donald Valentine, Sequoia's founder, who is also vice-chairman of
Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Once McKinney won support from Sequoia and Valentine, it was
relatively easy to convince Cisco, the leader in data networking,
to invest as well. But just as important, he got Cisco to begin
referring INS to its customers for installation and support
services.
</P>
<P>
   Once INS was on a solid footing, McKinney could step back. He is
still the company's chairman but has turned over the chief
executive's job to John Drew, a former Unisys executive. (In a sign
of just how small the networking industry really is, Bell Atlantic
first built its relationship with INS in part through a former
Unisys colleague of Drew's named Kevin DeNuccio, who helped found
Bell Atlantic Network Integration. DeNuccio is now an executive at
Cisco.)
</P>
<P>
   Cisco still owns about 8 percent of INS, which has a market
value of about $1.1 billion, while McKinney owns just over 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   INS compensates each of its 1,000 engineers at least partly in
stock. McKinney and Drew hope that the stock policy gives INS a
recruiting advantage over larger, slower-growing companies that are
trying to expand into the network consulting market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intellectual property goes home every night,'' McKinney
said. ``What we need to do is honor their requests and make them
wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   As put by Drew, ``Our focus and our people provide our
competitive advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is a lot of competition. Each of the
telecommunications carriers that INS serves as a client is also a
potential competitor. INS must also contend against consulting
companies including Andersen and KPMG Peat Marwick; computer
services operations including EDS; value-added resellers of
networking equipment including Entex and Vanstar, as well as the
growing consulting operations inside telecommunications equipment
vendors, including Lucent Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps INS' most intriguing competitor is a private
consulting company based in New York called Predictive Systems Inc.
Smaller, younger and even less well known than INS, Predictive is
perhaps the only company that focuses exclusively on the same sort
of network consulting as does INS. Among its clients are Qwest
Communications International, the upstart long-distance carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Belau, Predictive's president, said he was now
auditioning investment banks for an initial public offering.
Naturally, he says his company is better than INS. But if he
succeeds only in matching his West Coast competitor, he will have
done quite well, indeed.

CONTROL OF DOMAIN NAMES ON INTERNET DRAWS ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration this week enters the
final phase of what has been a highly contentious effort to hand
administration of the Internet over to an international nonprofit
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   A group led by Jon Postel, a founder of the Internet, presented
the government on Friday with its proposal for creating a
California-based entity called the Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This organization will be unique in the world _ a
nongovernmental organization with significant responsibilities for
administering what is becoming an important global resource,''
Postel wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The larger significance of the proposal is that it lays out the
final privatization of the Internet by the federal government,
which financed decades of Internet development as a communication
tool for military and academic researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The more immediate issue is forming an equitable plan for
creating and distributing ``top-level domain names,'' the
identifiers like .com and .org that identify what type of resource
an Internet address is. The .com top-level domain, for example,
signifies a commercial address.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, domain names have been administered by the U.S.
government _ at first directly and in more recent years under a
government contract granting a registration monopoly to Network
Solutions, a corporation based in Herndon, Va. A number of private
companies have demanded that they be allowed to compete with
Network Solutions in the lucrative business of registering domain
names, while Europeans and Asian have complained that their
interests are underrepresented in the development and
administration of domain names.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which
is newly incorporated, nominated nine interim board members to help
finish writing bylaws and create a permanent 19-member board
responsible for introducing competition and a recognition of
international interests to the domain registration system. Under
the proposal, the corporation would also make decisions on how and
when to add new top-level domains.
</P>
<P>
   But the long-awaited revamping plan by Postel's group still has
a number of critics, and the Clinton administration has not yet
ironed out the details for a smooth transition of crucial property
and customer records from Network Solutions to the new corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Magaziner, the adviser to President Clinton who has been
overseeing the transition to private governance of the Internet,
had hoped to have a plan in place by the time the government's
contract with Network Solutions expired on Oct. 1. But a
last-minute breakdown in negotiations prompted the Commerce
Department to extend the old contract for one week. It is now set
to expire on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Another extension is likely, since the government will take 10
days of public comments on the plan and two proposed variations
before it moves forward. Many critics say the Postel plan was
hammered out behind closed doors, despite the administration's call
for a process that strove for consensus among the international
groups that have an interest in how the network is governed.
</P>
<P>
   One contention about the Postel plan concerns whether the new
agreement would unfairly strip Network Solutions of the lucrative
business it has built as the monopoly registrar of top-level
domains. Company spokesmen declined comment beyond saying
negotiations with the government were continuing.
</P>
<P>
   A larger issue about the plan, though, is whether there would be
proper fiscal controls and long-term checks on the powers of the
proposed new board, whose members would be largely appointed by the
professional, advocacy and commercial organizations that finance
the corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The substantive problem with it is that it is completely
obtuse to questions of separation of powers and limits and
accountability,'' said Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard Law School
professor who has been critical of what he sees as a secretive
process for drafting the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perfect corporation if you trusted the board members,''
Lessig said, ``just like any Communist government is perfect if you
trust the Communist government.''
</P>
<P>
   An international coalition of associations representing a range
of Internet interests has filed its own bylaw proposals, which
would make the corporation based on membership rather than one
whose board members are largely selected by the organizations that
finance it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In another objection, J. William Semich, president and chief
financial officer of .NU Domain, a registrar of second-level domain
names, said that the proposed bylaws lacked the proper budget
reviews and spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to Secretary of Commerce William Daley, Postel
acknowledged the continuing opposition to his plan. He said that
while the organization had been formally incorporated, it had not
yet elected a board or adopted bylaws and did not plan to do so
until the completion of a Commerce Department review of the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many challenges left for the days and years to come,
but the consensus that developed around these documents provides
considerable promise that those challenges can also be overcome,''
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed interim board includes representatives of
telecommunications, Internet and academic interests from the United
States, Japan, Australia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed interim board members are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Geraldine Capdeboscq, executive vice president for strategy,
technology and partnerships at Groupe Bull, an international
information systems group based in France.
</P>
<P>
   _ George H. Conrades, a partner at Polaris Venture Partners,
based in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gregory L. Crew, chairman of the Australian Communications
Industry Forum.
</P>
<P>
   _ Esther Dyson, chairwoman of Edventure Holdings, a venture
capital firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   _ Frank Fitzsimmons, senior vice president for global marketing
at Dun &AMP; Bradstreet Corp.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hans Kraaijenbrink, chairman of the executive board of the
Association of European Public Telecommunications Network
Operators.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jun Marai, professor of environmental information at Keio
University in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eugenio Triana, an Internet management consultant in Spain.

<P>
   _ Linda S. Wilson, president of Radcliffe College.

 &HT;    The Chattahoochee: River in peril
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With its humid climate, vast stretches of bottomland
swamps and lazy meandering streams, the South has long been
regarded as water-rich. But that concept is fast evaporating.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the region's phenomenal growth, experts have come to
a stark conclusion: No longer is there enough water to satisfy all
of the competing demands for the precious liquid _ for consumption,
waste treatment, hydropower, recreation, irrigation, wildlife
protection, navigation and industry _ and at the same time ensure
an adequate supply for future development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our current water management systems were not planned to deal
with this kind of growth,'' says David Feldman, a University of
Tennessee water expert.
</P>
<P>
   This summer's scorching agricultural drought, as well as dry
spells in the 1980s, has heightened concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Fears of future water shortages have prompted Southern states to
draw up battle lines. Virginia and Maryland are squabbling over the
Potomac River, and North Carolina and Virginia have gone to court
over the use of water from Lake Gaston along their border.
</P>
<P>
   But nowhere is a struggle over water being played out more
dramatically than the conflict pitting Georgia against sister
states Alabama and Florida. Their intense, complex and sometimes
acrimonious negotiations to divide up the waters of the
Chattahoochee and other rivers flowing through the tri-state region
are being closely monitored across the nation by water experts, who
fear the same thing is in store for their states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are huge,'' says Aaron Wolf, a water policy
specialist at Oregon State University who has consulted in national
and international water conflicts. ``The tri-state water dispute
has all the trappings of the bitter water conflicts that were waged
in the arid Western states, and even in the dry Middle East between
countries like Jordan and Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf says the settlement of the current tri-state water squabble
will be a ``turning point'' in the South's history. ``The water
wars are going to play out in areas where you never, ever thought
water would be an issue,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   That may be especially true in Georgia. In exchange for
guarantees of enough water for growth over the next 30 to 50 years,
Georgians may have to pay higher electricity rates as hydropower
production is reduced. Strict limits on water for irrigation may be
imposed on southwest Georgia farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Navigation at Georgia's inland ports at Bainbridge and Columbus
may be curtailed. Industries and municipalities _ and the people
they serve _ may have to pay more to treat wastes discharged into
rivers because of less water to dilute the effluent. In metro
Atlanta, permanent restrictions on outdoor watering and other stern
conservation measures may be put in place. As early as 2025, the
metro area probably will have to find sources of water other than
the Chattahoochee.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of water that counties and cities can withdraw from
rivers and streams is set by permits issued by the Georgia
Environmental Protection Division. The permitted amounts are based
on the water needs of each locale and how much water is available
in the waterways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be fair to our sister states in allocating water from
rivers flowing across our borders,'' says Bob Kerr, who is
negotiating on behalf of Georgia. ``At the same time, we also
expect them to be fair. If they demand that Georgia control its
growth, they must be willing to do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He and negotiators for Florida and Alabama are operating under
the authority of two interstate water compacts _ the first ever in
the South _ approved last year by the three state legislatures and
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In one compact, Georgia, Florida and Alabama are fighting over
the use of the Apalachicola, Chattahoochee and Flint rivers and
their tributaries, the so-called ACF basin. The Apalachicola in the
Florida Panhandle is formed by the merging of the Flint and
Chattahoochee in southwest Georgia. In a second compact, Georgia
and Alabama are squabbling over the Alabama, Coosa and Tallapoosa
rivers and their tributaries, the ACT basin.
</P>
<P>
   In most water wars, the conflict boils down to upstreamers vs.
downstreamers. People living upstream have first call for the
water. Those living downstream fear the upstreamers will hoard it
or make it unfit for use, leaving less water for downstream use.
</P>
<P>
   In the tri-state water war, Georgia is the upstream state _ all
of the rivers have headwaters in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Also upstream is metro Atlanta, a water glutton that sits 80
miles from the headwaters of the Chattahoochee. Seventy percent of
the metro area's 3 million inhabitants get their water from the
river and dump their treated wastes into it. An additional 20
percent get water from the ACT basin, which also includes the
Etowah River.
</P>
<P>
   And the Flint River basin, whose headwaters are just below
Hartsfield International Airport, is a main supplier of water for
fast-growing Henry, Fayette and Spalding counties and other areas
south of metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   As early as three decades ago, people in west and southwest
Georgia, southeast Alabama and northwest Florida were casting wary
eyes upstream, worried that metro Atlanta's wildfire development
and ever-increasing water withdrawals from the Chattahoochee would
rob them of water needed for growth in their own areas.
Furthermore, Atlanta's use of the Chattahoochee as a dump for waste
water meant much of the water coming downstream was too polluted
for use.
</P>
<P>
   Droughts in 1981, 1986 and 1988 _ and now 1998 _ heightened
downstreamers' concerns. The impact was more severe because growth
had increased the competition for water. During the dry spells of
the 1980s, hydropower generation and commercial navigation were
drastically reduced to conserve water for drinking and waste
treatment in metro Atlanta. Metro Atlantans faced outdoor watering
bans, with hefty fines for violations.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1986 drought _ and in this year's dry spell _ scores of
counties were declared agricultural disaster areas. Across the
South, crops worth more than $1 billion were wiped out in the 1986
heat wave. That same year, the Alabama National Guard was mustered
to truck water into cities that faced severe water shortages. Those
impacts alarmed government planners, especially those in metro
Atlanta, who feared that the consequences of future droughts would
cause greater water shortages as the region added people and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows when a drought will begin or when it will end,''
says Harold Reheis, head of the Georgia Environmental Protection
Division. ``We have to plan as if a drought is always imminent.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced a plan to
reallocate 20 percent of the water normally reserved for power
generation in Lake Lanier to drinking water. The plan was designed
to ensure an adequate water supply for Atlanta through 2010. But
the decision sparked a howl of protest in Alabama and southwest
Georgia. Then-Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt demanded that the reallocation
plan be suspended until the corps conducted a detailed analysis to
determine the impacts on downstream users.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, however, went ahead with another controversial plan: In
June 1990, Georgia asked the corps for a permit to construct a
4,200-acre reservoir on the Tallapoosa River only five miles
upstream from the Georgia-Alabama line. The lake was to be the
first of a dozen or so state-built regional reservoirs that would
circle metro Atlanta and ``drought-proof'' North Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after the corps received Georgia's request, Alabama
sued the corps in federal court. The suit claimed that the corps,
by acceding to Georgia's demands, would be unable to operate Lake
Lanier and other federally built reservoirs in the ACF and ACT
basins in a neutral manner. Georgia's plan, Alabama said, would
vest Georgia with expanded water rights at the expense of
downstream users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta was not going to grow at our expense,'' says Walter
Stevenson, the negotiator for Alabama. ``We felt Georgia wasn't
treating us fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Georgia intervened on the side of the corps,
and Florida sided with Alabama. Florida contended that hoarding
water upstream for metro Atlanta would jeopardize growth in
northwest Florida, as well as oyster beds and marine life in
Apalachicola Bay. With the filing of the lawsuit, the South's first
interstate water war was on. It quickly became bitter. At one
point, Georgia threatened to withhold permits for some Alabama
companies to withdraw water from the Chattahoochee.
</P>
<P>
   The downstreamers' demand for more water was perceived as a
threat to Georgia's sovereignty. A University of Alabama study says
Georgia was reluctant ``to even recognize Alabama's claim to the
Chattahoochee as the official border'' between the two states.
Georgia says the border is the west bank of the Chattahoochee and
therefore the river lies wholly within Georgia _ a right it claims
as one of the original 13 states.
</P>
<P>
   As the dispute worsened, the governors of the three states in
1992 called a truce. Out of that came an agreement, with each state
pledging to cooperate in devising a plan to share rivers flowing
through the states. Georgia's plan to build regional reservoirs was
put on hold. The states and the corps also agreed to conduct a
comprehensive study, which so far has cost about $20 million, to
analyze how much water is available in each basin, how much each
state needs based on growth projections, and the possible economic
and environmental consequences of meeting those needs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, negotiators for the three states created two
commissions _ made up of the governor of each state or his
representative, and a federal representative appointed by President
Clinton _ to devise a formula by the end of this year to divide up
the basins' waters. The commissions agreed to use findings from the
comprehensive study as a basis for negotiations, which began in
February. The study was supposed to have been completed in the fall
of 1996, but portions are still unfinished.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the negotiators say they have enough data for serious
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be sure we don't give up anything we don't have
to,'' says Kerr. ``What we give up, we give up in perpetuity.''
</P>
<P>
   In public negotiations so far, one thing is clear: No one will
get all they want. The intensity of the negotiations has caused
some acrimony. For instance, to the consternation of Alabama's
negotiators, Georgia announced in May that North Georgia's
population growth already nearly exceeds the forecasts of the
comprehensive study. The state's mid-1997 population estimates for
counties served by the two basins already approach the study's
projections for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama officials, however, accused Georgia of pulling numbers
out of ``thin air'' to support its claims for more water.
Alabamians also are wary of Clinton's federal appointee, Lindsay
Thomas, to the commissions.
</P>
<P>
   He is a former Georgia congressman and head of the Georgia
Chamber of Commerce, and Alabama officials fear he might favor
Georgia at their state's expense.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas says he will strive to be fair to all. ``My primary goal
is to look out for the interests of the federal agencies, such as
the Corps of Engineers,'' he says. The corps will play a major role
in any water allocation formula worked out by the states because it
operates the big dams on the Chattahoochee that control the flow of
the river over most of its 436 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas has the authority to concur with or veto whatever
agreements the state negotiators reach. A veto would automatically
dissolve the compacts and send the water war to the Supreme Court.
If that happens, no state may get what it wants.
</P>
<P>
   The public deliberations are now in the eighth month, but
negotiators say there is still much work ahead. Georgia was the
first state to put some numbers and a controversial proposal on the
table. In essence, its plan for sharing the waters of the
Apalachicola, Chattahoochee and Flint basin calls for maintaining
water levels in Lanier and two other reservoirs at higher levels
than in the past, which would entail reducing hydropower generation
and possibly navigation.
</P>
<P>
   Florida and Alabama are both suspicious of the plan. Florida
possibly would have to accept a reduction in flow in the
Apalachicola River. Meanwhile, Alabama's own recently unveiled plan
calls for releasing more water than normal from Lanier to increase
flows in the Chattahoochee. Georgia says Alabama's plan is
``unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Some authorities believe the competition for water in the ACF
and ACT basins is so complex and the differences between Georgia's
and Alabama's plans so huge that the negotiators are not likely to
reach agreement by the end of the year, or for several more years.
</P>
<P>
   But Wolf, the Oregon State expert who has studied dozens of
national and international water treaties, believes water may
actually draw the states closer together.
</P>
<P>
   He notes that some analysts predicted the contest for water in
the Middle East could spark a gun-shooting, missile-firing war
there. Instead, water has proved to be a source of cooperation
among some old enemies. In 1994, for instance, Israel and Jordan
signed a historic agreement to share their water resources
amicably. ``If Israel and Jordan can do it, I think Georgia,
Alabama and Florida can do the same thing,'' he says.

 &HT;    Farmers sow worry of lack of water
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAINBRIDGE, Ga. _ You didn't have to be a plant scientist to
figure out who did and did not irrigate their crops this summer in
southwest Georgia. You only had to travel the rural roads and gaze
at the fields.
</P>
<P>
   Long stretches of stunted corn and shriveled cotton baked in
bone-dry fields, while others were green or lush with ripening
crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hadn't had irrigation, I would have been wiped out,''
says Jerry Long, 49, who runs a you-pick-it farm planted with 20
different vegetables in Decatur County. ``This is the most I've
irrigated since 1977, when we had one of the worst droughts on
record here.''
</P>
<P>
   With Georgia's agricultural losses from the summer's drought
approaching $500 million, about the only farmers in southwest
Georgia who stand to make a decent profit this year are those who
sprayed water on their fields. Those who didn't irrigate gambled on
adequate rainfall, which didn't come.
</P>
<P>
   But scores of farmers like Long believe that the free-flowing
water from their irrigation wells could become a casualty of the
water war between Georgia and sister states Florida and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Studies by the U.S. Geological Survey and the three states show
that irrigation in a 10-county area of southwest Georgia can divert
hundreds of millions of gallons a day from the Flint and
Apalachicola rivers. The Flint flows across southwest Georgia and
meets up with the Chattahoochee at the Florida line to form the
Apalachicola, which winds across the Florida Panhandle to
Apalachicola Bay and the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the farmers say they feel caught in a squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   Downstream from them, Florida officials demand that a certain
flow be maintained in the Flint and Apalachicola to keep fish and
oysters in Apalachicola Bay healthy, especially during dry periods
_ precisely when farmers are most likely to irrigate.
</P>
<P>
   Upstream, metro Atlanta is eyeing the Flint or its tributaries
as sources of additional drinking water. One possibility is that
fast-growing Henry, Fayette, Spalding and other counties south of
Atlanta will draw more water directly from the river. Another
possibility is that Atlanta's expanding northern suburbs will be
forced to tap new water sources other than the Chattahoochee, and
thus more water will be drawn from the Flint and transferred to the
Chattahoochee basin.
</P>
<P>
   The state Environmental Protection Division issues permits for
increased water withdrawals based on supply and demand. But if
metro Atlanta is allowed to take more water out of the Flint, the
farmers say, there will be less water coming down the river and
probably more restrictions on pumping of ground water in southwest
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want Florida and Atlanta to respect our rights; we have a
right to what God has put down here for us,'' says Oscar Jackson, a
Bainbridge dentist who represents the region on an advisory
committee appointed by Gov. Zell Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Kerr, who represents Georgia in negotiating an agreement
with Alabama and Florida to divide the waters of the Chattahoochee
and other rivers, acknowledges that caps probably will have to be
put on irrigation in the 10-county southwest Georgia area _
including Baker, Calhoun, Decatur, Dougherty, Early, Lee, Miller,
Mitchell, Seminole and Worth counties _ to help Georgia satisfy
water needs elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers in those counties in 1996 planted 153,000 acres of corn,
317,000 acres of cotton and 179,000 acres of peanuts. Irrigation
equipment _ southwest Georgia has about 4,500 irrigation systems _
was capable of watering roughly half of that total acreage, by far
the greatest concentration of irrigated farmland in the entire area
drained by the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint river basin.
</P>
<P>
   Most farmers who irrigate in southwest Georgia draw their water
from the Floridan aquifer, a massive underground reservoir that
stores water in a huge formation of pocked and cracked limestone.
Like a giant tilted sponge, the formation sops rainwater from as
far north as Middle Georgia and drips it out through springs along
the lowlands of the Flint, south of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   The water seeping from the aquifer is critical for maintaining
the flow of the Flint and Apalachicola. According to a U.S.
Geological Survey study, the two rivers lose about six-tenths of a
gallon of flow for each gallon pumped from the aquifer. During the
October low point of the severe drought of 1986, agricultural
withdrawals knocked already-low flows in the Apalachicola down by
6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the information we have indicates that southwest Georgia
farmers consume in a dry year more water for irrigation than all
the 3 million people in metro Atlanta consume, now and into the
future,'' says Harold Reheis, director of the Georgia Environmental
Protection Division.
</P>
<P>
   However, he says, about 70 percent of water used for human
consumption is returned to the rivers as treated waste water, while
very little for agricultural use gets back into the streams. Also,
farmers currently face fewer regulations than the state's other
major water users: Farmers' withdrawal permits don't expire, and
they need not report their usage. The farmers pay nothing for the
permits, and the water they withdraw is free.
</P>
<P>
   By all indications, southwest Georgia farmers will require more
irrigation. Banks are becoming more reluctant to lend money to
farmers who don't have irrigation systems. And the more valuable
cash crops and higher yields that many farmers hope to harvest
require more water. Crop yield can be as much as 100 percent
greater on irrigated acreage.
</P>
<P>
   But Reheis says the Floridan aquifer doesn't have enough water
to meet projected irrigation demands during the next 50 years,
``unless we allow the Flint to run dry, and we can't let that
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Those projections could change as numerous uncertainties about
irrigation are cleared up. Researchers acknowledge, for instance,
that their understanding of the Floridan aquifer's flow and storage
capabilities is still far from precise. Also, how irrigation should
be applied to crops under differing drought, rainfall, soil and
crop conditions is not fully understood.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr says most southwest Georgia farmers probably are aware of
the limitations on the Floridan aquifer, ``and the state will work
with them to develop strategies for conserving water.'' Replacing
wasteful irrigation systems with more efficient but more expensive
``center-pivot'' systems is one alternative. Another possibility is
drawing water from smaller, still untapped aquifers.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Long, the Decatur County vegetable grower, says Atlanta
probably deserves some additional water. ``But we deserve water for
our farms, too; people have to have food,'' he says.

 &HT;    A Harvest from the sea
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1988 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apalachicola, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   APALACHICOLA, Fla. _ For most of his 50 years, Donny Wilson has
reaped a rich bounty from Apalachicola Bay: oysters, crabs, shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   His seafood business, a whitewashed warehouse at the edge of the
bay, has survived hurricanes that wiped out huge swaths of oyster
beds and severe summer droughts that deprived the bay of freshwater
vital for the bay's succulent marine life.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he sees the next big threat coming from nearly 500 miles
away: metro Atlanta. He and dozens of other Apalachicola watermen
believe Atlanta's mushrooming growth and unceasing demand for more
water are siphoning off the fresh water that nourishes the bay's
world-famous oysters.
</P>
<P>
   ``More water for Atlanta means less water for us,'' he says.
``We don't want to pay the price for Atlanta's growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Apalachicola Bay is unique among Florida's waters. It's at the
end of the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint river basin, which
drains some 12.5 million acres in Georgia, Florida and Alabama. The
Chattahoochee's water first dribbles out of a spring on the side of
a mountain in North Georgia and then flows 436 miles across the
Piedmont and coastal plain to the Florida border, where it meets up
with the Flint and forms the Apalachicola.
</P>
<P>
   The Apalachicola winds 108 miles across the Florida Panhandle
and at the bay empties into the Gulf of Mexico. The river
transports into the bay tons of nutrients picked up from upstream,
crucial nourishment for oysters and other marine life. The fresh
water keeps the bay from getting too salty. High salinity levels
attract oyster predators such as starfish and conchs that normally
stay out to sea where the saltier water is more to their liking.
</P>
<P>
   The bay's delicate environment has made it a cornucopia for
seafood. It accounts for about 90 percent of Florida's commercial
oyster fishery and 10 percent of the nation's. Wilson sells his
seafood to wholesalers along the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Water quality experts say Wilson's concerns about Atlanta are
legitimate. They agree that metro Atlanta's demands for more water
from the Chattahoochee could cut freshwater flows into Apalachicola
Bay. But by how much is subject to much scientific debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any decrease in historical flows of fresh water into the bay
would cause some mortality to oysters and other marine life
there,'' says John Klein of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration. ``The greater the reduction, the higher the
mortality.''
</P>
<P>
   Of equal concern is the timing of the flows. The health of
oysters and other marine life depends on higher amounts of
nutrient-laden fresh water at certain times of the year, such as in
spring. Curtailing flows during those periods could be even more
destructive to the marine organisms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to have those periodic slugs of water, the peaks and
valleys,'' says Woody Miley, manager of the Apalachicola National
Estuarine Research Reserve. ``It's quite possible for the bay to
starve to death if the timing of these flows isn't right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why our primary concern is to maintain the historical
seasonal flows of fresh water into the bay,'' says Doug Barr, who
is negotiating on Florida's behalf with Alabama and Georgia on a
formula to divide up the waters of the basin.
</P>
<P>
   Barr and other water experts see an even bigger threat to the
bay than metro Atlanta _ the farmers in southwest Georgia who
irrigate their farms with ground water from the vast
Floridanaquifer. Farmers are most apt to irrigate from May through
August _ when the bay's oysters are most in need of fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   Irrigation by farmers in the Florida Panhandle and a sliver of
southeast Alabama, and plans to develop thousands of acres of
pulpwood forests owned by St. Joe Co. in the Panhandle, also may
affect the bay. But Georgia's irrigation practices far outweigh
whatever effects the other activities may have, state and federal
studies show.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia officials argue that some of Apalachicola Bay's problems
were brought on by Florida itself. Florida sliced a canal called
Sikes Cut through St. George Island on the outer perimeter of the
bay to allow easier access to the Gulf for barges and fishermen.
The cut has significantly increased salinity levels of the bay. In
addition, paper companies have drained tens of thousands of acres
of swampland around the bay, reducing the seasonal flows of
nutrients and freshwater from the wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   The bay's biggest freshwater contributor by far, however, is the
Apalachicola River. A controversial proposal that Georgia has
placed on the negotiating table calls for the flow in the river
near Blountstown, Fla., never to drop below a monthly average of
about 33,600 gallons (or 4,500 cubic feet) per second _ an amount
that some experts say will cause a 5 percent to 7 percent reduction
in the historical flow of the waterway.
</P>
<P>
   Barr says Florida is studying the proposal and won't comment
until the analysis is complete.
</P>
<P>
   However, Howard Marshall, a water expert with the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency's regional office in Atlanta, stood
up at a recent meeting of a committee advising Georgia's
negotiators and said, ``If Georgia gets Florida to accept this
reduction, it will be an exceptional accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Donny Wilson: ``This bay has been through a lot and bounced
back, but cutting off our rightful share of fresh water might get
it to the point where it can't bounce back. We won't let that
happen.

 &HT;    Barge traffic to Georgia's ports slows, causing fear
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ The Georgia Ports Authority's docks along
Lumpkin Boulevard here stand empty. They were built to handle
commercial barges coming 256 miles up from the Gulf of Mexico. But
no barges are in sight.
</P>
<P>
   That's the usual scene at this inland port on the Chattahoochee
River, the head of navigation on the
Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint river basin, also known as the
ACF. Only 11 barges _ fewer than one a month _ checked in here in
1997. At Georgia's other inland port at Bainbridge on the Flint
River, 33 barges tied up at state docks last year.
</P>
<P>
   Shippers and operators fear there may be even fewer barges in
the future. Navigation on the lower ACF may become a footnote of
Southern history, a victim of the water war between Georgia and
sister states Alabama and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Demands for more water to fuel growth in metro Atlanta and
southeast Alabama, and providing adequate water to irrigate
southwest Georgia crops, may not leave enough water to float barges
in the ACF basin much of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried,'' says Rebecca Martin of the Tri-Rivers Waterway
Development Association, based in Dothan, Ala. ``There seem to be
clear differences in philosophy between people in North Georgia who
want more water and the people who rely on this navigation system
for various needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia officials acknowledge the possibility of a navigation
cutback. ``Georgians (may have) to more frequently use
non-navigational means of transporting goods due to a slightly less
reliable ACF navigation channel,'' says Bob Kerr, who is
negotiating on Georgia's behalf to reach a settlement in the water
war.
</P>
<P>
   That might not be so bad, say environmentalists and economists.
The National Wildlife Federation, Friends of the Earth and other
groups say the constant dredging required to maintain a
100-foot-wide, 9-foot-deep navigation channel in the basin
jeopardizes the health of fish and plants in the rivers and oysters
in Apalachicola Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Economists with Common Cause, the Cato Institute in Washington
and other organizations say that maintaining inland navigation
channels like the ACF amounts to one of the nation's most egregious
examples of pork barrel welfare. Taxpayers pay about $3.5 million
annually to maintain the ACF channel, according to the Army Corps
of Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   On a cost-per-mile basis, say economists, the ACF system is
among the most costly in the nation for taxpayers to operate.
``Truckers pay their own way,'' says Stephen Moore of the
libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. ``Why shouldn't (barge)
shippers?''
</P>
<P>
   The users of the system say they feel they have few advocates.
Georgia's highest priorities for water use are ensuring enough for
drinking and agriculture; navigation ranks low on its wish list.
Florida's top goal is having enough water for oysters and other
marine life in Apalachicola Bay.
</P>
<P>
   When it authorized the navigation channel for the lower ACF
basin in 1945, Congress envisioned a dependable channel providing
an inexpensive route for fertilizer, fuel, mining and farm products
and other bulk items in an economically depressed region of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   To support navigation and at the same time provide power
generation and flood control, the Corps of Engineers built five
major dams on the Chattahoochee. Also in support of barge traffic,
riverbeds were dredged, curves on all three rivers straightened and
locks installed at three of the dams _ Walter F. George, George W.
Andrews, and Jim Woodruff on Lake Seminole at the Georgia-Florida
line. The lock at Lake Walter F. George downstream of Columbus has
a lift of 88 feet _ the second highest of any lock east of the
Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   A barge starting out at Apalachicola Bay on the Gulf could come
up the Apalachicola River across the Florida Panhandle to Lake
Seminole, where it could head east up the Flint to Bainbridge or
north up the Chattahoochee to Columbus. At one point, the corps
envisioned extending the channel to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But more than 30 years after the ACF channel opened, the system
has never come close to accommodating the 1.8 million tons the
corps predicted for it by 1990. Its best year was 1985, when 1.2
million tons were shipped in the lower ACF basin. By 1990, that was
down to 636,000 tons, and last year it was about 600,000 tons, only
a third of the projected traffic. The majority of the commerce that
moves on the rivers is sand and gravel dredged from river and lake
bottoms. Other products include fertilizer and other agricultural
chemicals, petroleum products and limited amounts of industrial
chemicals, asphalt, wood products and cottonseeds.
</P>
<P>
   President Reagan in 1983 recommended ending the federal
maintenance of waterways handling less than 5 million tons
annually. And in the 1990s, business and political leaders in
Columbus quietly attempted to close the state docks in the city,
saying that barging was outmoded and was harming the river. But an
intense lobbying effort by Tri-Rivers, barge operators and shippers
killed the proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the lower-than-predicted tonnage was that
sand in the riverbeds shifted more often than the corps had
predicted, requiring more dredging. In 1983, the corps acknowledged
that it needed 40 percent more water to provide the 9-foot depth on
a reliable basis. Much of the time, however, that water wasn't
available: Atlanta's growth and recreation on corps-built
reservoirs had triggered demands for more water upstream. There was
less water to send downriver for barges.
</P>
<P>
   The droughts of the 1980s showed the critical relationship
between upstream and downstream users. In the 1988 dry spell, more
water was hoarded in Lake Lanier to quench Atlanta's thirst, and
barge traffic on the ACF downstream was suspended for nearly three
months.
</P>
<P>
   To avert another such shutdown, the corps and barge operators
worked out a system of ``navigation windows'' in which the corps
would try to store more water in its four big Chattahoochee
reservoirs _ Lanier, West Point, Walter F. George and Seminole _
during dry spells and release it to float barges for as long as two
weeks each month.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the ACF never recovered from the uncertainties of
the droughts. The ongoing tri-state water war has created more
doubts, and the channel is stuck with a reputation of
``unreliable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reliability problem is the main reason shippers don't use
the ACF,'' says Martin. Her Tri-Rivers organization has lobbied
Congress to have the channel maintained at least 250 days a year.
``If we had a reliable channel, we could handle another million
tons a year,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia officials, however, doubt that will ever happen. One
reason the ACF never reached its full potential, they say, is that
several dams that were supposed to be erected on the Flint to help
support navigation were not built. Former Gov. Jimmy Carter in the
1970s, for instance, killed the corps' effort to build a huge dam
on the river at Sprewell Bluff because he claimed it was
environmentally unsound. Also, the officials note, shippers have
stopped transporting certain types of fuels on the system because
of Florida's tough anti-spill laws.
</P>
<P>
   Barge operators and users of the system counter the criticism,
declaring that barge traffic is the most ``energy-efficient''
transportation for moving nonperishable bulk materials. One barge,
they say, can haul 10 times more than a truck and 2.5 times more
than a railroad car. ``A barge causes less congestion, less
pollution and less noise,'' says Homer Hirt, a marketer for
Georgia's inland ports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maintaining the system may be a little expensive,'' says Ben
Bowden, 64, of Eufaula, Ala., who farms more than 6,000 acres in
Barbour County and relies on barges as an economical way of getting
bulk fertilizer shipments. ``But we have the potential for economic
development here, and we need the jobs. And we need this system to
operate reliably so that we can reach that potential.

 &HT;    Are the water wars a Midwestern omen?
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nebraska, Colorado and Kansas signed a deal in 1943 that spelled
out how much water each state could use from the Republican River.
But it's been anything but amicable among the three states.
</P>
<P>
   Saying Nebraska wasn't abiding by the compact, Kansas sued its
northern neighbor in May. Kansas claims that Nebraska has been
siphoning off too much water from the river for irrigation, leaving
it some 10 billion gallons short every year.
</P>
<P>
   The squabble may be an omen for Georgia, Alabama and Florida,
which are in intensive negotiations to divide the waters of rivers
they share. The states are supposed to agree on water allocation
formulas by the end of the year. The agreements will be binding on
all three states.
</P>
<P>
   But the conflict between Nebraska and Kansas shows that such
agreements don't necessarily settle water wars.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas alleges that Nebraska for years has illegally withheld
water from Kansas under the compact. The agreement spelled out
distribution of the Republican River's waters, with Nebraska
getting 49 percent, Kansas 40 percent and Colorado 11 percent. The
depletion, say Kansas officials, was caused by indiscriminate
drilling of water wells in the lower and middle portions of the
river basin in Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to sue a neighbor, but sometimes the neighbor
gives us no choice,'' says Kansas Attorney General Carla Stovall.

   REPORT CRITICIZES U.S. FOR HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES  
(js) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amnesty International, in its first campaign directed at any
Western nation, intends to publish a harsh report on the United
States on Tuesday, saying U.S. police forces and criminal and legal
systems have ``a persistent and widespread pattern of human rights
violations.''
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International, the 37-year-old human rights organization
based in London, plans to make its report the focus of a yearlong
effort in more than 100 countries and in international bodies like
the United Nations to protest what it calls a U.S. failure ``to
deliver the fundamental promise of rights for all.''
</P>
<P>
   The report is part of a growing effort among human rights
organizations to seek ``balance'' in reporting by looking at
industrialized as well as developing nations. The Clinton
administration has encouraged that trend more than its
predecessors, welcoming monitors from the U.N. Human Rights
Commission in the face of sharp criticism from some members of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials and U.S human rights groups that are also
often critical have had mixed reactions to some international
reports, describing some as selective or lacking in nuance and
context and often deliberately excluding background information on
civil rights protections in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The new Amnesty report is bound to be among the most
controversial of the recent surveys. Officials in New York, which
figures prominently, and in Washington declined to comment because
they had not seen the report.
</P>
<P>
   The 150-page report pulls together widely reported cases of
abuses around the United States and incorporates the work of U.S.
advocacy groups and Amnesty investigations. Without responses from
U.S. officials, it concludes with this statement:
</P>
<P>
   ``Across the country thousands of people are subjected to
sustained and deliberate brutality at the hands of police officers.
Cruel, degrading and sometimes life-threatening methods of
constraint continue to be a feature of the U.S. criminal justice
system.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also condemns what is sees as a general failure to
punish offending officials. It criticizes the treatment of people
who seek asylum by U.S. immigration authorities and calls, as
Amnesty has done in the past, for the abolition of the death
penalty, which the report says is ``often enacted in vengeance,
applied in an arbitrary manner, subject to bias because of the
defendant's race or economic status, or driven by the political
ambitions of those who oppose it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Sane, a development expert from Senegal who has been
secretary general of Amnesty International for six years, said in
an interview that the United States was chosen as the first Western
target because human rights conditions were deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it was ironic that the most powerful country in the
world uses international human rights laws to criticize others,''
Sane said, ``but does not apply the same standards at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Sane does not deny that the report, some of it in strong, often
polemical language, seems to hold government officials more
responsible for violations than the individuals who exceed their
authority in committing abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Responsibility to uphold human rights lays with the federal
government, lays with the Congress, lays with authorities in the
different states,'' he said. ``I think that what our research has
found is a generalized failure of the systems of monitoring, of
accountability for the police, for the prison guards, for
immigration officials.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report criticizes the United States for failing to sign
international rights conventions, among them the Convention on the
Rights of the Child. Sane said it was not relevant that some
countries that had signed the convention did not act against abuses
of children, as in southern Asia, where more than 50 million
children are thought to be forced to work, many of them in bonded
labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The covenant is extremely important, because the covenant
represents a consensus of all nations,'' he said. ``That a country
does not respect its laws once it becomes part of the covenant is
another problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Sane said the purpose of the Amnesty campaign against the United
States was ``to raise awareness of the need to take action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in terms of the severity of what is happening in the
U.S., more or less people are aware,'' Sane said. ``They are aware
that in the States police can be brutal. They're aware that prisons
are not the best place to be in. But what we are concerned with is
the lack of action and the complacency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that the international community, in terms of
standards, is moving really ahead of the standards obtained in the
United States today.''

SEC GUIDELINES TO YIELD DATA ON YEAR 2000 RISKS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As awareness of the Year 2000 problem has spread, a wide gulf
has opened between computer consultants, who say many companies are
dangerously vulnerable, and Wall Street analysts, most of whom have
been telling investors there is little to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to new guidelines from the Securities and Exchange
Commission, this debate is about to get something that has been in
short supply: public information about how most companies are doing
in assessing and reducing their risks.
</P>
<P>
   The new data will appear in reports filed with the SEC in the
coming weeks summing up corporate earnings for the quarter that
ended Wednesday. In response to previous prodding from the agency,
a majority of the 10,000 or so publicly traded companies that file
quarterly and annual earnings reports started mentioning Year 2000
concerns in filings earlier this year. The new reports, though,
will be the first for most of them since the agency, alarmed at how
vague and limited most disclosures had been, issued more specific
Year 2000 guidelines two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC guidelines have been viewed positively in Congress,
which on Thursday sent President Clinton a bill allowing companies
to exchange information on their Year 2000 readiness or put such
information on the World Wide Web without fear that the information
could be used against them in a lawsuit if it turned out to be
wrong. The protection does not cover knowingly false or reckless
statements.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 problem, also known as the Millennium Bug, stems
from the longstanding practice of using just two numbers in
computer code to stand for the year, as in ``98'' for 1998.
Computers, software and electronic devices may read ``00'' as 1900
instead of 2000 and crash or create inaccurate data.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC wants companies to discuss specifically how much they
expect to spend to cope with this problem, assess how far along
they are in identifying and dealing with their problems and
describe what, if any, contingency plans they are making. It is
also requiring reasonable ``worst-case scenarios.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency also recommended that all companies consider a
variety of disclosures that might not be required, like the
percentage of their information-technology budget being used on
Year 2000 projects, whether other information-technology
investments were being delayed and what outside resources were
being used to verify that repairs were successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the lack of information regarding your preparations
for the Year 2000 could seriously undermine the confidence
investors place in your company, it is imperative that you provide
thorough, meaningful disclosure on this topic,'' said SEC Chairman
Arthur Levitt in a letter to more than 9,000 chief executives.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been given a hint of what the new disclosures may
look like from companies that filed reports covering the three
months that ended June 30. The SEC requested that they voluntarily
observe the new guidelines and many made at least a partial stab at
it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Year 2000 consultants say the model to date is probably the
Phillips Petroleum report for the quarter that ended June 30, which
was filed in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 disclosure by Phillips ran more than 1,250 words,
over five times the length of the previous quarter. It noted that
although the overall Year 2000 project was ``on schedule,'' a piece
of it _ the introduction of new software from the Oracle Corp. that
would retire a number of defective programs _ was running far
enough behind schedule that the company had developed contingency
plans. Phillips said it planned to decide by the end of the third
quarter whether or not to rely fully on Oracle. (The company
decided on Thursday that the contingency plan would not be needed,
according to Del Clark, director of Year 2000 issues for Phillips.)
</P>
<P>
   Phillips also disclosed that it had spent $20 million of its
projected $58 million budget and that most of the rest _ $21
million _ would go to fix or replace chips in machinery and other
``embedded systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallinckrodt, a St. Louis-based medical equipment and supplies
company, was less detailed and more confident in its 10-K report
for the fiscal year that ended June 30, which was filed last week.
``Based on accomplishments to date, no contingency plans are
expected to be needed and therefore none have been developed,''
Mallinckrodt said.
</P>
<P>
   The same report might make some investors wonder whether
Mallinckrodt is too complacent, because it disclosed that the
company was still assessing what it might have to fix or replace in
its research, manufacturing, and facility management operations _
areas where embedded systems are common.
</P>
<P>
   The new data should give a snapshot of corporate America's Year
2000 readiness and may force some companies to look at the problems
more closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect investors to begin voting with their feet by March,''
said Jeff Jinnett, a New York lawyer. ``It could be a minefield for
companies that don't pay a lot of attention to what they are
disclosing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Year 2000 consultants doubt, though, that enough reliable
information will emerge from the new filings to allow investors to
make worthwhile judgments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guidelines are window dressing unless we have random
audits in order to determine whether companies are disclosing
accurately,'' said Louis Marcoccio, Year 2000 director at the
Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Marcoccio said Gartner's research suggested that nearly nine out
of 10 companies were publicly underestimating their Year 2000
problems, either knowingly or inadvertently.

   SWISS TELEPHONE COMPANY PRICES ITS INITIAL OFFERING
</P>
<P>
   Swisscom, Switzerland's dominant, state-owned telephone company,
said it would sell its shares at 340 Swiss francs each, raising 7.5
billion francs, or $5.5 billion, in the eighth-biggest initial
offering of all time and the biggest in Europe this year.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Swisscom will start trading in Zurich on Monday. On
the New York Stock Exchange, its U.S. depository receipts, which
represent one-tenth of a share, will begin trading at $25.30 each.
The price is at the low end of the company's range announced in
September as the offering came under pressure from the recent slump
in world markets.

   INTERNET SUCCESS SEEN IN THE STARS
</P>
<P>
   Dotted throughout Susan Miller's astrological chart is Uranus,
the all-important planet of things technological, so she had an
inkling that computers would change her life. What was harder to
predict was that her Astrology Zone site would become one of the
most popular of its kind on the Web and prompt a flurry of other
media deals.

<P>
   YEAR 2000 PROGRESS REPORTS
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to new guidelines from the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the debate over the extent of the year 2000 computer
problem is about to be infused with something that has been in
short supply: public information about how most companies are doing
in assessing and reducing their risks. The new data will appear in
reports filed with the SEC in the coming weeks summing up corporate
earnings for the quarter that ended on Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   HAND-OVER OF INTERNET APPROACHES
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration this week enters the final phase of
what has been a highly contentious more-than-yearlong effort by the
government to hand administration of the Internet over to a
nonprofit corporation.
</P>
<P>
   AD REVENUE DROPS AT SOME PAPERS
</P>
<P>
   Advertising revenue has fallen off at some newspapers, but most
newspaper companies have gained at least as much as they have lost,
despite the gyrations of the world's financial markets, according
to several newspaper executives and two economists at an industry
trade group.
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING FOR A CHECK IN THE MAIL
</P>
<P>
   Late payments _ the dirty little secret of running a small
technology-based company, especially one catering to Fortune 1000
companies _ are a serious problem for many Silicon Alley companies.
While most vendors expect small businesses to pay outstanding bills
within 30 days, small companies often find themselves struggling to
get paid by companies with vast accounting departments where no one
seems accountable.
</P>
<P>
   WORST MAY BE OVER FOR CHIP MAKERS
</P>
<P>
   U.S. semiconductor companies, still in the midst of one of the
longest industry slumps, are expected to report a lackluster third
quarter, but analysts said that the worst may be over.
</P>
<P>
   AD GROUP TO EXPAND ITS MEMBERSHIP
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Advertising Agencies, in a
significant step, is opening membership for the first time to
independently owned agencies that specialize in services outside
the realm of traditional advertising, like media planning and
buying, public relations and corporate identity consulting.

   It's much more chic to stay in an intimate ``boutique'' hotel,
says the latest issue of Bazaar, than a ``grand old establishment

couple of middle-aged men on the door.''

RED SOX CEO WANTS TO ADD TOP STARTER, KEEP VAUGHN

 SOX-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the morning after, John Harrington, wearing a windbreaker and
sports shirt, strode through a Red Sox clubhouse that was all but
deserted.
</P>
<P>
   He shook hands with the handful of players who were packing
their belongings in large cardboard cartons; chatted with veteran
Bret Saberhagen, who is sticking around to see the Hootie and the
Blowfish concert  &UR; tomorrow &LR; ; and greeted hitting coach Jim Rice and
Tom McLaughlin, the equipment man sorting through red socks that
will go unused until next season.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra's locker was unoccupied. Pedro Martinez was
elsewhere. So was Tom Gordon. The manager's office was empty, the
surest sign of all that the Sox' season had come to an end. No one
spends more time at Fenway Park on a game day than Jimy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Before he left (``I'm double-parked outside''), the Red Sox CEO
took a few moments to reflect on the season just ended with the
four-game American League Division Series loss to the Indians and
touched upon the team's intentions this winter, which include
pursuing another top-of-the-rotation pitcher to complement last
year's prize catch, Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if that meant the Sox would pursue someone of the caliber
of potential free agents Randy Johnson, Kevin Brown, and Al Leiter,
Harrington answered in the affirmative.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, we are,'' Harrington said, ``if they're available
and interested in coming to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no sense in going after another fourth or fifth
starter. We've got a bunch of guys we've given chances to for those
spots. If we get somebody for the top of our rotation, we'll go for
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's something else out there, we'll look at it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But first they'll look inward. First baseman Mo Vaughn will be
eligible to file for free agency in less than three weeks, at 12:01
a.m. the day after the World Series ends.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington reiterated the team's desire to re-sign Vaughn, upon
whom he lavished praise, but acknowledged that he expects the
team's leading hitter (.337) and slugger (40 home runs) to test the
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timetable is his,'' Harrington said Sunday. ``Yes, we
would be interested in doing things ahead of time, and they may
have a willingness to talk to try and get a deal done, but unless
we overwhelm them, they'll probably want to see what's out there. I
think he's going to shop the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you're looking at this going into November. I wouldn't want
to mislead our fans into thinking this could be done soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington wants to make something else clear, too. He has no
intention of personally trying to cut a deal with Vaughn and his
agents, Tom Reich and Adam Katz.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Dan (Duquette) and Elaine (Weddington Steward) have to get
it done,'' Harrington said, ticking off the names of the team's
general manager and legal counsel, who have been talking with
Vaughn's agents off and on about a new deal for more than a year.
``I have to give those people the authority to develop our strategy
to take into negotiations. They have my every confidence. I take a
role, but as you know, it's the quiet kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington said he believes Vaughn wants to return. ``The
nucleus of our team is there,'' he said, ``but it would be nice to
get Mo. He's bonded with these guys, I think he prefers to stay
here, but I don't want Mo's people to think I mean he'll take a
hometown discount.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I keep saying, `We want him, too.' We take heart
that he says he wants to be here, but negotiations are
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears unlikely that the Red Sox intend to try to overwhelm
Vaughn with an offer before he declares free agency. Vaughn
rejected a four-year, $37.5 million offer at the All-Star break; it
remains to be seen if another club is willing to pay the Martinez
money ($12 million plus) Vaughn's agents are expected to seek.
</P>
<P>
   ``People blame high salaries on the owners,'' Harrington said,
``but who puts the pressure on us to pay them?''
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary list of potential suitors for Vaughn includes
Baltimore, Texas, and Anaheim, though the Orioles and Rangers must
decide what to do with their incumbent first basemen, Rafael
Palmeiro and Will Clark, both of whom are eligible for free agency.
The Angels, after yet another late-season collapse, might consider
moving Darin Erstad to center field and trading Jim Edmonds, though
Mike Piazza might also be on their list if he opts for free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto would seem to be another possibility, though the Blue
Jays' uncertain ownership situation, the faltering Canadian
economy, and the presence of up-and-coming slugger Carlos Delgado
at first base might incline them to pass on Vaughn. And while it
seems unlikely he'd want to tinker much with a team that won an
AL-record 114 games this season, Yankees boss George Steinbrenner
always seems to surface when a big-name free agent hits the market.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday Harrington said all the right things in reference to
Vaughn. ``Wasn't he great?'' he said. ``Fantastic. I'm sure his
manager would agree. He showed his leadership once all the things
that happened in the offseason were over.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I believe that what he did wasn't because this was a
contract season but because of his pride and determination. He knew
this would be a good team to play with.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington, mindful of how other top free agent pitchers signed
elsewhere while the Sox waited for Roger Clemens to make a
decision, said they don't intend to allow that scenario to unfold
this fall. If Vaughn re-signs, it is almost certain to happen by
Thanksgiving. Vaughn has indicated as much.
</P>
<P>
   And if he leaves? A few weeks ago, he laughed at the thought of
joining what he called ``the ghosts'' with which present Sox
players must cope, starting with G.H. Ruth. ``The black ghost,''
Vaughn said, cackling. ``I like that.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other decisions the Sox must make. Duquette will pass
on picking up the club option on lefthander Steve Avery, who
probably would prefer a fresh start elsewhere, and is not expected
to pick up the club option on Tim Naehring, who hasn't played in 14
months and will become a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox hold a club option on Darren Lewis, the center fielder
who was everything advertised defensively and gave more than
expected offensively, but because he met a games-played clause in
his contract, Lewis has the right to become a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox have already attempted to re-sign lefthanded reliever
Greg Swindell, another potential free agent, and might think about
asking lefthander Pete Schourek to return, especially after his
performances at the end of the year. Lefthander Butch Henry, who
began the season in the rotation but missed all except the first
month after knee surgery, also will be a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Jeff Frye, who has two years left on a
three-year, $7 million contract, will be back next spring after
missing this season following spring training knee surgery, but he
is expected to be pushed by rookie Donnie Sadler, with Mike
Benjamin returning to his previous role of all-purpose utilityman,
if he comes back.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler is not the only young player who will get a look in camp
next spring. Outfielder Trot Nixon's stock has risen dramatically,
as witnessed by his postseason start against the Indians, and he
gives the club a cheaper alternative to arbitration-eligible Darren
Bragg should the club attempt to deal Bragg. Nixon could also wind
up being trade bait.
</P>
<P>
   And rookie pitcher Brian Rose, who was shut down in May because
of a bone spur in his right elbow, does not need surgery, team
doctor Arthur Pappas said Saturday night. ``He's healing,'' Pappas
said. ``The only question that remains is when he can begin
throwing again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox appear satisfied with their young catching platoon
of Jason Varitek and Scott Hatteberg, two players who will only get
better. DH Mike Stanley, acquired in a trading deadline deal with
the Blue Jays in July, is signed through next season and should be
back, though the club might need to find a lefthanded-hitting
counterpart if Reggie Jefferson's back doesn't improve. Jefferson
has two more years left on his contract, so he'll be given every
opporunity to win his job back.
</P>
<P>
   But if Vaughn doesn't return, acquiring a top-flight pitcher
won't fill the void he'll leave. It took the Sox two years to find
an adequate substitute for Clemens; there's no telling how long it
will take to replace Vaughn.

SUPREME COURT DOCKET MIXES OLD AND NEW 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court term that opens Monday has the
potential to produce significant rulings in such areas as civil
rights and federal regulation, with a mix of constitutional and
statutory cases on a docket that is still very much a work in
progress.
</P>
<P>
   The court's calendar is also a mix of old and new: The justices
will revisit the familiar issues of sexual harassment and
redistricting, while also undertaking their first review of the
1996 law that was intended to increase competition in the
telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   In a case of immediate practical importance, the court has
scheduled an expedited argument next month on whether the Census
Bureau can proceed with its plan to adjust for the expected
undercount in the 2000 census by using statistical sampling. A
special three-judge U.S. District Court here ruled on Aug. 24 that
sampling was barred by federal law, leaving plans for the census in
doubt until the Supreme Court resolves the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The court has 45 cases on its docket for decision, roughly half
the number it will decide by the time the term ends late next June.
A few of the cases waiting in pipeline could, if granted during the
next few months, convert an already interesting term to one of
extremely high visibility. Among these is the Clinton
administration's appeal of a ruling in July that the
attorney-client privilege does not shield communications between
the president and White House lawyers (Office of the President vs.
Office of Independent Counsel, No. 98-316).
</P>
<P>
   Also awaiting the court's review, but not yet granted, is a
constitutional challenge to a school voucher program in Wisconsin,
upheld by that state's Supreme Court, that permits the use of
vouchers for parochial school tuition (Jackson vs. Benson, No.
98-376). Another of the pending appeals, a campaign finance case
from Cincinnati, could provide the justices with a vehicle for
re-examining the court's precedents equating campaign spending with
free speech.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, City of Cincinnati vs. Kruse, No. 98-454, the city
is defending limits on expenditures for City Council elections. A
U.S. Appeals Court invalidated the $140,000 spending limit on the
basis of the Supreme Court's 1976 ruling in Buckley vs. Valeo.
Cincinnati is arguing that unlimited campaign spending has been so
damaging to the country that the justices should revisit their 1976
precedent that found spending limits to violate the First
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Of the cases the court has already accepted, the census sampling
case could have the most immediate impact _ but then again, it may
not. One question is whether the House of Representatives, where
the Republican majority opposes the use of sampling techniques, had
standing to bring the lawsuit in the absence of any concrete,
institutional injury to itself. The administration is arguing in
its appeal, Department of Commerce vs. U.S. House of
Representatives, No. 98-404, that the suit should have been
dismissed, noting that no matter how the census is conducted, the
House of Representatives will still consist of 435 members and will
still exercise the same constitutional powers.
</P>
<P>
   The stated aim of the sampling effort is to adjust for the
several million people the census will predictably miss, as the
last one did, if it counts heads in the traditional manner. The
heated politics around the issue reflects the fact that the
undercount is not neutral; members of minority groups and poor
people living in cities are missed most often and, consequently,
the predominantly Democratic areas where these people live would
benefit the most if they were accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the census issue, another of the court's cases could
affect the next round of reapportionment. For the third time in
five years, the court will review a congressional districting case
from North Carolina. The justices invalidated, as an
unconstitutional racial gerrymander, the state's earlier effort to
comply with the Voting Rights Act by creating an irregularly
shaped, majority-black district.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 12th Congressional District has another new shape,
somewhat more compact and with a slight majority of white voters.
The question in Hunt vs. Cromartie, No. 98-85, is whether the
district is still invalid, as a special panel of three federal
judges ruled last spring. The court's answer could determine the
extent to which legislators can take race into account in drawing
new district lines after the next census.
</P>
<P>
   In its last term, the court ruled in four sexual harassment
cases, one of which, Gebser vs. Lago Vista Independent School
District, concerned harassment by teachers of students. The court
ruled that Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which
prohibits sex discrimination in school programs that receive
federal money, made school districts liable for harassment by
teachers if it could be shown that school officials knew of the
problem and refused to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   The new case, Davis vs. Monroe County Board of Education, No.
97-843, presents the question of a school district's liability for
harassment of a student by another student. The federal appeals
court in Atlanta ruled last year that Title IX did not apply to the
situation. The Supreme Court appeal was filed by a woman whose
daughter was harassed for months by a boy in her fifth-grade
classroom in Macon, Ga., where school officials refused to take
action despite repeated complaints.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In another civil rights case, the court will decide whether
collective bargaining agreements that provide for arbitration of
disputes bar individual lawsuits against an employer for
discrimination on the basis of race, sex, age or disability. Most
labor agreements these days contain arbitration clauses, and there
has been widespread dispute in the lower courts over whether these
apply only to workplace issues arising under the contract, or
whether the clauses also bar access to federal court by employees
seeking to vindicate their rights under federal civil rights law.
This closely watched case is Wright vs. Universal Maritime Services
Corp., No. 97-889.
</P>
<P>
   While the sexual harassment and arbitration cases present
statutory questions, the court also has some important
constitutional cases that raise civil rights issues. The justices
will review a Chicago anti-loitering ordinance under which the
police can arrest people they suspect of being gang members, and
who refuse an order to move along after being seen lingering with
another person ``with no apparent purpose'' in a public place.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois Supreme Court last year struck down the law, under
which the police had made some 43,000 arrests in three years, on
the ground that it was impermissibly vague and imposed arbitrary
restrictions on individual liberty. Anti-loitering laws were common
before the court struck down several of them in the 1970s, and this
case, Chicago vs. Morales, No. 97-1121, is being watched closely to
see whether the court adheres to those precedents.
</P>
<P>
   A welfare case from California also implicates the court's
precedents, raising the question of whether states can discriminate
against newcomers in the distribution of benefits. In 1996,
Congress authorized states to reduce welfare benefits for new
residents. The federal appeals court in San Francisco blocked
California from putting into effect its two-tiered welfare policy,
under which new residents are held for the first 12 months to the
benefits they would have received in their home states.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1969 decision, Shapiro vs. Thompson, the Supreme Court
ruled that it violated the constitutional right to travel for
states to deny all welfare benefits to newcomers. A question in the
new case, Anderson vs. Roe, No. 98-97, is how that precedent
applies to a reduction rather than elimination of benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the case with the highest economic stakes may be the
court's review of an appeals court decision last year that sharply
limited the federal government's role in opening up the $100
billion market for local telephone service under the
Telecommunications Act of 1996. There are a number of separate
questions in AT&AMP;T vs. Iowa Utilities Board, No. 97-826, which is
actually a group of eight cases with so many parties and such
complex regulatory issues that the court has scheduled an unusual
two hours, instead of one, for argument on Oct. 13.
</P>
<P>
   A basic issue is the allocation of regulatory authority, in
making important pricing decisions under the 1996 law, between the
Federal Communications Commission and state regulators. Would-be
entrants into the market for local service are on the government's
side, while the incumbent local carriers are on the side of the
states.

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Under NATO threat to end his punishing
offensive against ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia has ordered most units of his army
back to their barracks and may well avoid an attack by the
alliance, military observers and diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who on one hand is excoriated by Washington as the
scourge of Kosovo yet on the other hand is treated as key to peace
in Bosnia, acted as the European Union, NATO and the United Nations
prepared for a review on Monday of possible military intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Russia stepped up its warnings against such action and
dispatched its foreign and defense ministers on an unusually
high-level mission to see the Yugoslav president Sunday in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   As he has so often, Milosevic appears to have bowed to foreign
demands in the nick of time and yet still accomplished what he
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, foreign diplomatic observers in Kosovo reported
that a ``military stand-down'' had taken place in the province,
where Milosevic's forces have waged a fierce offensive against
Albanian rebels. The observers said that except for segments of
three brigades, most units of the Yugoslav army were ``home.''
</P>
<P>
   The daily reports of the observer mission, made up of U.S.,
European Union and Russian military experts, are one of the key
elements in helping Washington and European capitals decide whether
Milosevic has met their demands for a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   By putting the army back in its barracks, sending some police
units out of Kosovo and ordering an end to burning and looting of
villages, Milosevic may well avoid a NATO attack, diplomats here
and in Washington said.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, they acknowledge that while NATO looked
the other way, he enjoyed a three-month license to overwhelm the
Kosovo Liberation Army _ the rebel army fighting for independence
for Kosovo and its ethnic Albanian majority _ and terrorize the
rural civilian population that supports it.
</P>
<P>
   His military operation created more than 250,000 refugees, whom
the Clinton administration is gearing up to take care of this
winter through a variety of relief organizations.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said they expected Richard Holbrooke, the U.S.
envoy who dealt with Milosevic in negotiating an end to the war in
Bosnia, to meet with him on Monday to discuss a political plan for
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the disagreement in Kosovo is between Serbia,
Yugoslavia's principal republic, which insists on keeping Kosovo as
a province, and the ethnic Albanians there who have chafed under
Milosevic's repression since he stripped the province of virtual
autonomy in 1989, and who now seek independence.
</P>
<P>
   The West, fearing the precedent that independence for Kosovo
would set in other conflicts in the world, has been trying to
mediate a middle course.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, diplomats said they believed that the plan Holbrooke
will present to Milosevic calls for a three-year interim period
leading to a status fairly close to the pre-1989 autonomy
arrangement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Since the Kosovo conflict flared up in March, critics of
Washington's policy toward Milosevic argue that he has been able to
choreograph every move to suit his goal: pushing the Albanian
population into submission with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States and its allies have waited four months while
he cleaned the clock of the Kosovo Liberation Army,'' said Morton
Abramowitz, head of the International Crisis Group, a policy
analysis organization, ``and taken three weeks to discuss military
action, with the result that 500 Albanian villages were
destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials now acknowledge that when NATO failed
to live up to its earlier threat in June to strike Serbia,
Milosevic took advantage of the indecision and plunged ahead with
an artillery and tank offensive against the lightly armed guerrilla
forces, whose bedrock of popular support had helped win them
effective control of large swaths of Kosovo territory, including
key roads.
</P>
<P>
   While he was doing that, Milosevic skillfully managed a key
requirement for Washington: he made sure that the war did not spill
over into neighboring Albania and Macedonia, fragile countries in a
traditionally volatile area.
</P>
<P>
   All along, the biggest fear in Washington has been that the
Kosovo conflict would engulf neighboring countries and encourage
Albania and the ethnic Albanian population in Macedonia to join the
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Such a possibility raised the specter of a new Balkans conflict
just three years after peace was secured in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic catered to Washington's concern that the conflict be
contained. The Yugoslav army mined Kosovo's borders with Macedonia
and Albania, ensuring that few refugees could escape and limiting
routes for arms supplies for the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav leader also understood that Washington was unsure
about how to deal with the disorganized Albanian political
leadership in Kosovo and the unbending Kosovo Liberation Army,
whose main chiefs were hardened emigres returned from Switzerland
and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Holbrooke persuaded Milosevic to meet in May with
Ibrahim Rugova, the top Albanian political leader in Kosovo, an
encounter that turned out to be little more than a photo
opportunity. For that procedural breakthrough, Holbrooke
recommended the lifting of a ban on foreign investment in Serbia
that had been put in place the month before.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Rugova, Milosevic stepped up his military
operations in Kosovo, forcing Washington to reverse itself again
and carry out the investment ban.
</P>
<P>
   In late June, Holbrooke met with two self-styled Kosovo
guerrilla commanders in the province's western town of Junik but
then broke off all contact. Clinton administration officials said
at the time that they were concerned that NATO intervention would
bolster the separatist forces.
</P>
<P>
   To try to put the best face on the situation, Washington worked
with Moscow to get Milosevic to accept the presence of
international monitors who would patrol Kosovo and report on
military action.
</P>
<P>
   The monitors were slow in getting organized. By August, when the
Yugoslav army, backed by the Serbian special police, were in full
swing against the rebels and burning and looting villages in the
process, the monitors found it difficult to gain access to the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   They drove up to roadblocks, knew something was going on from
the sounds and the smoke, but could not be precise.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days as the tanks and artillery have withdrawn, access
has improved, the monitors say.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some areas in central Kosovo around Likovac and
Gornje Obrinje that the monitors have ruled off limits because of
land mines on the roads. The mines are believed to have been
planted by the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Gornje Obrinje was the site of a massacre of 18 ethnic Albanian
women, children and elderly people on Sept. 26. A British reporter
who walked across fields into the village on Sunday said about 10
mortar shells, apparently from the Serbian police or the Yugoslav
army, were fired at the village early Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav army and police forces have been responsible for
the vast majority of atrocities in the Kosovo conflict, said a
report by New York-based group Human Rights Watch, released here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the rebels had also violated the laws of war by
taking civilian hostages and carrying out summary executions. But
the violations by the guerrillas were on a ``lesser scale'' than
the government abuses, the author of the report, Fred Abrahams,
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The report focused on what it called a watershed in the conflict
_ the attack by police forces on three ethnic Albanian villages in
late February and early March in the Drenica region of central
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At least 83 people, including 24 women and children, were killed
in the attack, which involved helicopters, artillery and armored
personnel carriers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, which is a four-hour drive
north through rolling countryside from Kosovo's capital of
Pristina, Milosevic remains politically secure.
</P>
<P>
   That is in part, his domestic critics say, because diplomats
like Holbrooke and the head of the U.N.refugee agency, Sadako
Ogata, insist on going to see him, thus enhancing his stature.

TOP LINEMAN RILEY COMMITS TO TROJANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bernard Riley of Los Alamitos High School,
considered the top defensive lineman in the nation by one
recruiting service, gave an oral commitment to USC on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Riley, a 6-foot-3, 295-pound tackle, selected USC over Florida
State, Notre Dame, Michigan, Texas, Ohio State, UCLA and
Washington. He is listed as the No. 1 defensive lineman in the
country by SuperPrep magazine. Last year, Riley led the Los
Alamitos defense with 67 tackles, five sacks and five pass
deflections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it took a lot of people by surprise,'' said his
mother, Cindy Riley. ``He was getting tired of the recruiting
process and wanted to get it over with.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Riley said the main reason her son chose USC was because
he liked Trojans defensive line coach Ed Orgeron.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about coach Orgeron that excited him,'' she
said. ``He just wanted to go somewhere where he had a good feeling
about the coach. He also liked that coach Orgeron had several
players go to the NFL when he coached at Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Orgeron is also responsible for USC's other defensive-line
commitment _ Malcolm Woolridge of Boca Raton, Fla. The Trojans also
have commitments from tight end Jacob Rogers of Oxnard and
linebacker Markus Steele of Long Beach City College.

WITH LINES DRAWN, HOUSE PANEL SET TO OPEN IMPEACHMENT ENQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Congress poised to open the first presidential
impeachment inquiry since the national agony of Watergate, the
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee said Sunday that it was
his ``hope and prayer'' to complete the investigation of President
Clinton by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The pledge by Rep. Henry Hyde came as a prelude to the bitter
partisan and legal struggle expected to take place in the House
Judiciary Committee on Monday. The committee is to consider whether
to recommend, for only the second time this century, that Congress
authorize a formal investigation into whether a president's actions
should lead to his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   With Republicans in the majority, it is considered inevitable
that on Monday or Tuesday the committee, and later this week the
full House, will vote to open a formal impeachment inquiry. The
House vote will be one of Congress's last acts before it recesses
for the midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde sought on several television news programs Sunday to assure
the nation that he would not seek to stretch out the scandal that
has engulfed the White House for eight months, ever since
Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr began investigating
the president's affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a New Year's resolution, and that is we finish by New
Year's,'' the Illinois Republican said on NBC's ``Meet the Press,''
``and you know how New Year's resolutions sometimes get broken, but
it's my hope and prayer that we could finish by New Year's.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of Hyde's own Republican committee members resisted
setting such a time limit, and Democrats expressed doubts that Hyde
would be able to adhere to his pledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Year's resolutions sometimes get broken,'' said House
Democratic Leader Dick Gephart of Missouri on ABC's ``This Week.''
``I also don't have a lot of confidence from the way the
Republicans have run other inquiries over these last two years that
his wish will be followed.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Hyde's committee, one of the most ideologically
polarized in Congress, will hear David Schippers, the investigative
counsel for the Republicans, and Abbe Lowell, his counterpart for
the Democrats, set out clashing views of the case for and against
the president.
</P>
<P>
   In his hour-long presentation, Schippers plans to speak of the
president's unique role in the American system of government and of
the importance of the oath he takes to faithfully execute the
nation's laws, according to Republicans. He is also expected to
strike a very personal note about his own sorrow as a registered
Democrat about the charges before him.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers will not emphasize the president's sexual relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern, but will argue the
dangers to the nation's legal system if the president makes false
statements under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers is not expected to embrace all 11 charges of
potentially impeachable offenses that Starr referred to Congress,
and will likely differ with the independent counsel, for example,
over Starr's charge that the president's claim of executive
privilege in legal proceedings amounted to an abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   And he is expected to add new criminal violations, according to
Republicans, such as charges of lying under oath or a charge of
concealment of a felony, Republicans said. A concealment charge
could accuse the president or his aides of failing to alert a judge
to a false affidavit, such as Ms. Lewinsky's claim in the Paula
Jones sexual misconduct case that she had not had a sexual
relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said Schippers ``has reinterpreted and otherwise
interpreted'' some of the material sent by Starr, ``so we have a
little different take on it, not widely different.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said that Congress was not judging private morality.
``We're talking about perjury, subornation of perjury, witness
tampering, obstruction of justice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his own presentation, Lowell planned to explore the intent of
the founding fathers when they put the power of impeachment into
the Constitution and to cite historical precedents that have set a
high threshold for removing a president from office.
</P>
<P>
   Another broad theme in his argument, according to a Democratic
official, will be that in many cases Starr's evidence falls short
of proving the offenses with which the independent counsel has
charged the president.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, lawyers sympathetic to the president circulated an
eight-page legal memorandum arguing that Starr had created a
``misleading chronology'' and an ``unfair rendering of the facts''
when he charged that Clinton ``endeavored to obstruct justice'' by
helping Ms. Lewinsky find a job in New York when she faced being
called in the sexual harassment case brought by Mrs. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers argued that the facts showed that Ms. Lewinsky's
desire to leave Washington arose long before she was named in the
Jones case and that the president ``provided only modest
assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the
Judiciary Committee, also said Sunday that he did not believe false
statements under oath ``in and of themselves'' are necessarily
impeachable. ``The answer is that it is unclear and probably not,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting of the House Judiciary Committee will set in motion
only the third presidential impeachment process in the history of
the republic. Aware of the high stakes, Republicans and Democrats
on the committee each took home large briefing books over the
weekend to help them prepare for an all-day session expected to be
widely televised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly hope that the president is not impeached, '' Rep.
James Rogan, R-Calif., said on ABC's ``This Week.'' ``I hope that
when this is all over, we can exonerate him. I'm not sure where the
facts are going to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday or on Tuesday, the committee is expected to vote
along party lines, with Republicans pushing through a
recommendation that Congress investigate ``fully and completely
whether sufficient grounds exist for the House of Representatives
to exercise its constitutional power to impeach William Jefferson
Clinton.'' The wording is modeled after the impeachment resolution
used to open the investigation into Richard Nixon and the Watergate
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats will vote for their own proposal to limit any inquiry
to the Lewinsky affair and to complete it by Nov. 25. They would
set up a two-step process in which the committee first sought to
define what it considered an impeachable offense and then see if
any evidence against the president met that threshold. Only after
that would the committee decide whether to open a formal
impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   While the committee is expected to split along party lines, it
is not clear whether Democrats from conservative or swing districts
will choose to vote in the full House with the Republicans on the
impeachment inquiry once the Democratic proposal is voted down.
</P>
<P>
   Once the House opens an impeachment inquiry, it is up to the
Judiciary Committee to hold hearings and clear the president or
vote on articles of impeachment. The House then must decide whether
to impeach _ the equivalent of an indictment. In 1974, Nixon
resigned before the House took its impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   If the House approves articles of impeachment, the Senate then
holds an impeachment trial of the president and acts as the jury.
It takes a two-thirds majority to convict a president and remove
him from office.
</P>
<P>
   By its nature impeachment is both a quasi-judicial and a
political process, and both political parties will be carefully
watching the midterm elections to see whether they produce a
landslide against the president's party or offer any mandate on how
to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde conceded Sunday that, at present, there are not the votes
in the Senate to remove the president from office. ``That would
have to be done by the Senate in a bipartisan way,'' he said.
``They won't do that until the American people move, and they have
to move from where they apparently are if the polls are true.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Republicans, as some strategists predict, pick up five
Senate seats in November, they would still fall short of the number
needed to remove Clinton from office unless Democrats swing to
their side.
</P>
<P>
   While they have accused the Republicans of moving too quickly to
judge Clinton, Democrats too are treading a careful line. Their
alternative proposal is an acknowledgment that they are not willing
to stop the impeachment process right now.

FEEL-GOOD MAGAZINE OF THE YEAR

<TEXT>
<P>
   Although it's been in the works for months, the timing of Sport
magazine's November issue celebrating today's heroes _ more
specifically, what's !ital!right!off! with sports _ couldn't be
much better.
</P>
<P>
   The on-field accomplishments of Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa
combined with their off-the-field humanitarian work seems to have
reversed a trend in sports coverage in which negativism once
dominated.
</P>
<P>
   Sport magazine's approach is to look into the far-reaching
effects of sports heroes with articles that a daily or weekly media
outlet might not have the time or space to devote. The athletes
chosen for the cover _ Andre Agassi, Cynthia Cooper, Dikembe
Mutombo, Troy Aikman and Derek Jeter _ represent a small part of
the warm-and-fuzzy stories in the issue that includes a forward by
former Senator (and New York Knicks star) Bill Bradley called
``Examples of Excellence.'' (Bradley also has a new book out called
``Values of the Game.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to be the `good sports people' magazine, but
we want to look beyond the sexy headlines and find the real-life
heroes who happen to be in sports,'' said Sport associate editor
David Scott. ``We're all very proud of this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigative work includes a look not only at the upside of
some athlete's foundations, but also how they can turn sour.
Jacksonville quarterback Mark Brunell, for example, raised
thousands of dollars for charity but was sickened to find out that
those he trusted to distribute the money weren't doing so.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 athletes whose actions have had a positive impact
on society are also recognized, as are the ``bad boys'' who do good
deeds such as Dennis Rodman and Marge Schott.
</P>
<P>
   The issue hits newsstands on Tuesday.

U.S. WILL PAY RUSSIA $80 MILLION FOR TIME ON SPACE STATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a concession born of crisis, Russia has agreed to sell the
United States up to all its allotted research time aboard the first
phase of the International Space Station for $60 million, NASA
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the deal reduces Russia's role to that of a builder
but not a user of the biggest space project, at least during its
many years of orbital assembly. But the sale would help keep
Russia's faltering space program alive and its scientists engaged
in the project, and presumably not searching for foreign work _ a
major goal of arms controllers in the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was worked out last week in Moscow by officials of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Russian Space
Agency, which is increasingly desperate for money to fulfill its
commitments. The meetings concluded on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The accord is the first time Russia has agreed to scale back its
use of the planned international outpost since it joined the
venture five years ago. The deal focuses on the assembly phase,
which is to start in two months and take five or six years.
</P>
<P>
   Up to three astronauts are to occupy the station while it is
being built and seven at completion.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Goldin, NASA's administrator, told Congress in a letter
last week that the agency proposed to buy for $60 million ``up to
100 percent of the research time previously allocated to Russia''
in the assembly phase.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase, he said, includes crew time and ``readily
accessible stowage space'' aboard the outpost. Some American
research projects would replace Russian efforts on the station, but
the work might end up being done by Russian astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, dated Sept. 29, Goldin called the purchase
``urgent'' and said the money had to be delivered to Moscow ``no
later than'' this Friday if the huge project, already a year behind
schedule, was to avoid further delays. Even with this bailout,
assembly plans beyond the first two flights are in tatters because
the financially squeezed Russians have been unable to finish a
major unit.
</P>
<P>
   If and when it is finished, the outpost of laboratories and
living areas is to be nearly the size of two football fields,
orbiting hundreds of miles above Earth, powered by huge arrays of
solar-energy cells.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials said details of the new accord would be described
on Wednesday at a hearing of the House Science Committee. But there
is growing animosity in Congress over NASA's handling of the
Russian crisis. Already, some members are complaining of deception.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's smoke and mirrors,'' said Rep. Tim Roemer, D-Ind., a
longtime opponent of the space station project. ``What NASA has
done is to propose a leveraged buyout of the Russian Space
Agency,'' he said. ``All you have left is Russian participation as
a subsidiary of NASA.''
</P>
<P>
   But other committee members worry that the Russians are getting
too much and giving up too little. At best, they say, Russia's
research area in the unfinished outpost is small and unsubstantial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear that they have all that much to give us, and
maybe it's not worth the money,'' said a congressional aide, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``They're giving up something they
don't really have.''
</P>
<P>
   His skepticism focused mainly on the station's third element,
known as the service module, which the Russians are building. It is
crucial, but it remains unfinished. Its troubles have precipitated
the frantic maneuvering to save the Russians and keep the station
project on track.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the place where Russia had planned to do its research
in the station's long assembly. In theory, aside from astronaut
time, the alcoves of the service module are among the few concrete
goods on orbit that Moscow has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Russia's economic problems, completion and launching
of the unit have been pushed back from next April to July at the
earliest, throwing next year's station assembly sequence into
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The new deal focusing on the sale of Russian research time
represents an abrupt shift in NASA's strategy to save its troubled
Russian partner. Early in September, the agency proposed buying two
rescue craft for the station from Russia at a cost of roughly $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   But that plan has been dropped for the moment for reasons that
have not been spelled out.
</P>
<P>
   In the new plan, NASA would divert $60 million to Moscow from
its accounts for station development and operations. Congressional
experts say NASA can do that on its own authority, but they add
that taking that step without Congress' blessing would only sour
relations further.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, the agency has offered few other details of the goods
and services it would buy to bail out its Russian partners in
building the sprawling outpost. In September, it said it wanted to
send Moscow as much as $660 million over five years.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued on Friday, NASA said the officials meeting
in Moscow had agreed to press ahead to launch the first station
element in November, speeding the countdown for the start of
project.
</P>
<P>
   As currently cast with Russian participation, the International
Space Station began in 1993 and is expected to cost about $50
billion.

PATENTS: SOFTWARE THAT TRACKS WEB USAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the unknowns about the Internet, the greatest questions
may revolve around whether or not it will ever become a reliable
money maker. Granted, some companies do earn money through World
Wide Web sites, but for the majority the promise of e-commerce with
vast new markets, customers and profits remains unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   That does not daunt those who believe that with customized
information delivery and targeted advertising, someday the Internet
will become the most lucrative way to sell goods and services. They
picture a world in which customers will leave traces of information
about their habits, preferences, spending patterns, economic needs
and personal status every time they use a computer. The information
will be sorted into databases and used to fashion Web sites,
promotional campaigns, advertisements and even junk mail that is
tailored specifically to each user.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly such visions raise concerns about privacy. Without
tackling those issues, however, many companies are at work on the
software and hardware needed to make culling the information and
setting up the databases a reality. One company, Thinking Media
Corp. of New York, has a new patent for a method of tracking how
people respond to Internet advertisements and commercial Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The company says that its approach is singular because rather
than count the number of ads or Web-site pages sent out by Internet
server computers, it counts the sites or ads actually received by
the browser software on individual computers.
</P>
<P>
   Many Web sites earn money by selling advertising space. They
carry banner ads in the manner of city buses adorned with placards
for jeans, new movies and fast-food restaurants. Surely people see
those ads as the bus passes, but do they pay attention to them? Do
they buy the jeans? By the same token, advertisers wonder whether
an ad on a Web site catches anyone's eye. How many people actually
follow it up?
</P>
<P>
   There are a variety of ways for advertisers to track how many
``hits,'' or clicks of a mouse, a particular ad icon or Web site
receives. Data can be collected from central servers, or from the
individual sites that display the ads.
</P>
<P>
   But Owen Davis, the managing director and a founder of Thinking
Media, says the vagaries of how Internet servers provide access to
computer users mean those methods undercount how many ads actually
reach people as they sit at their terminals.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Internet was created as a series of
independent computer networks that would not be subject to total
failure if one or more sections went down. But that makes it
difficult to track the movement of information between browsers and
servers that act independently and do not communicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've done is insert a very small homing beacon that goes
along with an ad or a Web page,'' Davis explained. ``It's a piece
of Java, a Java applet.''
</P>
<P>
   Vid Jain, the company's chief creative officer, explained, ``The
patent covers the idea of embedding a little smart piece of
software with something sent out, whether it's a Web page, an ad or
other resource, so when it gets to your machine it gets `live,' and
sends back information.'' Part of that information, Davis said, is
``how much time the client spent on the Web site; once the Web site
is loaded, it starts a timer and it runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, when someone uses a browser to call up a Web site, the
software enables Davis' company to follow that page as it leaves
the server and heads for its destination.
</P>
<P>
   The patent also eliminates a problem created by the process
known as caching. That refers to the time-saving mechanism under
which a person loads a page from a server one time. After that, the
page is stored on his or her PC hard drive, creating a temporary
backlog of recent documents. This cache means the server does not
continually have to send items the user has recently requested.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of keeping track and counting on the server side, if
you look at a page twice or more but the server has only sent it
once, then there's no way to keep track,'' Davis pointed out. With
his company's software, ``every time the page comes up and a person
looks at it, it sends back a message that it's live, that the page
is live.''
</P>
<P>
   Thinking Media's software uses so-called cookie files that
identify individual computers and Internet protocols, or Web site
addresses, ``as a way to mark someone,'' Davis said.
</P>

   ``We don't know the person, but we know their machine,'' he
added. ``We can look at the time they spend, the cached ads, we can
look at the cookie and the IP, and we can collect environmental
variables like the browser type and the kind of operating system
they're on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of the cookie and IP identifiers as we build a
profile is that we can know that someone has seen an ad twice, so
we can take them off the list and swap the ad for another one,''
Davis explained. ``Now we have real control over the reach and

   ``As someone moves through an ad and makes use of different

said. ``Say Barnes &AMP; Noble has live chats with famous authors
online. As part of their promotional feature, they put up six book
covers. You click on one, see a page of the book, and say `enroll
me in that,' and 24 hours before the event Barnes &AMP; Noble sends an
e-mail that says `Don't forget.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's also interesting to Barnes &AMP; Noble to know that you
looked at three other books but didn't enroll in the chats,'' he
continued. ``Imagine that you are Coca-Cola and you put a game
inside an ad. There's nothing to sign up for, but somebody might
play the game for three minutes. That's incredibly important
information because they had your undivided attention for three
minutes and they need to know that.''

   He added, ``Where an ad has some depth and requires people to
move through it, we can capture the time spent'' as well as other
statistics about use.

 &HT;    Inmates face ugly choices, violent lives
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ After spending the past four years in prison,
Brian Collins, 31, knows the routine well.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy comes in from the streets (and) the first thing that
happens is he gets checked _ by blacks, whites, everybody,'' said
the Mineral Wells resident who is serving 10 years for theft.
``This is how it goes, man. These dudes are going to charge you up
and see if you got heart, see if you're going to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most want money, sometimes sex.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to fight or you're going to tell the police
(guards) you need protection'' and get moved to a one-man cell.
</P>
<P>
   Collins says he chose the former.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he also chose the Aryan Circle, a white-supremacist
group well-known inside prison for fights against black and
Hispanic convicts. Collins says he is a major in the group, and he
proudly shows off the AC tattoo on his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Is he racist?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I think I probably am,'' Collins said. ``I'm the type of
person that ain't going to go out and try to hurt people just
because I don't like them. I'll probably just try to stay away from
them. But if somebody does something to me or someone I love, I'm
going to take care of my business with them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened a year ago at another prison when, as he
explains it, a member of a Hispanic gang ``stole something from one
of my brothers. We asked for it back and they said that we was a
bunch of whores. So I went and took care of business.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses. ``I caught him right out there on that (cellblock)
run. Stabbed him with a welding rod.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shouldn't have stole.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe ``Flaco'' Saldivar, 51, spent more than 20 years in Texas
prisons before he joined a gang.
</P>
<P>
   And when he did, in 1993, he had little choice, he says. He was
from San Antonio, so he had to go with the Mexican Mafia. Like
black and white convicts split into gangs along racial lines,
Hispanics in Texas prisons mostly split by hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured if (other gangs in prison) were going to target me
as the enemy and I'm going to have to suffer the consequences, I
might as well join up and see if there are benefits to reap,'' said
Saldivar, serving a life term as a habitual thief.
</P>
<P>
   He was soon moved to solitary confinement, with members of that
gang.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that in lockup I wasn't in actual danger of being
assaulted by anybody. . . . A lot of the members I had met back in
the '60s and '70s . . . and I thought that if I joined up I could
help them out in some way.''
</P>
<P>
   He did.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Saldivar sits in a solitary cell at the Estelle
High-Security Unit outside Huntsville. He said he tries to stay
busy, so as to not ``let insanity or old age catch up with me.''
</P>
<P>
   And while he hopes he eventually will be paroled, he concedes he
may well die in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilbur Jones Jr. was 15 when he came to prison. Gerald Ford was
president and Texas prisons were still segregated.
</P>
<P>
   ``You felt you had that right'' to be segregated, recalls the
38-year-old convicted robber, serving a life term for shooting a
store clerk during a Beaumont robbery.
</P>
<P>
   By 1984, Texas prisons had been desegregated by a federal judge,
and racial tensions exploded. Gangs started forming and warring.
Beatings, stabbings and killings bloodied prison cellblocks almost
every day.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, one of only a few black convicts in a dorm at the Ramsey
prison farm outside Houston, was marked for death by two members of
the white-supremacist Aryan Brotherhood as part of their initiation
rite into the gang.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was targeted because I was African-American,'' Jones says.
``That was all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They caught me in the dorm. . . . I grappled with one, got his
shank. I threw him off, and (the other one) who was supposed to be
watching out then came at me. I stabbed both. One died. I was
acquitted in a trial. It was self-defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Jones was placed in a maximum-security cellblock with
members of the Self Defense Family, one of the first black prison
gangs in Texas. Prison officials tagged him as a member, too, even
though he insists he never was.
</P>
<P>
   Since then he has served time in 11 different Texas prisons,
including more than three years in solitary confinement. Prison
officials list him as a suspected member of the Mandingo Warriors,
another black prison gang, a tie he also denies.
</P>
<P>
   During his 22 years in prison, Jones says, he has seen a gradual
rise in racial and ethnic tensions. ``It's more pronounced across
the board now,'' he says. ``You're dealing with a lot of
individuals in here who are highly uneducated . . . who are not
used to dealing with a problem in the right way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a dinosaur. I've seen the system all different ways. And
it's not good the way it was then. Or now.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenton Keith Ford says he knows firsthand about violence and
hate and why convicts join gangs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, newly arrived on the Hilltop Unit near Gatesville to
serve a 15-year sentence for burglarizing a Tyler home, Ford said
he faced a choice: fight or be raped by other convicts. For
protection, he said, he joined the Aryan Brotherhood, a
white-supremacist prison gang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, if you're white . . . you pay protection or give sex or
whatever they want,'' he said. ``I wasn't raised to be a racist any
more than any other white kid. But when I got to prison, I saw it
was different in here. Here, people can learn to hate.''
</P>
<P>
   At another prison, that hate exploded in a crude bomb _ a small
plastic mouthwash bottle filled with toilet tissue and match tips _
that he ignited with a cigarette lighter and threw into a black
convict's adjacent cell. It grew with the more-frequent fights he
had with black convicts, altercations that broke his jaw, knocked
out two teeth and left him with swollen testicles.
</P>
<P>
   Moved in 1995 to another cellblock where most of the convicts
were black, Ford said, he was overpowered and raped by a convict.
``I'd been turned out. . . . I couldn't fight anymore,'' Ford said,
explaining that in return for sex twice a week, the other convict
bought him commissary items _ chips, shampoo, candy, all common
barter in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do what you have to to stay alive in here. That's the way
I see it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford now ponders his future from a one-man isolation cell at the
Hughes Unit outside Gatesville, where his sentence has been
extended to 23 years because of a new felony charge resulting from
the bomb incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a breeding of hate in prison? Yes,'' he said. ``I'm
bitter. I'm angry because I'm stuck down here and my life is
getting away. How come I gotta ride with somebody to survive?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to hate. But once people live around this
mentality in prison, they can hate.''

 &HT;    Secret codes of crime concealed in books, letters
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ ``God Bless You and Your Family,'' read the
printed birthday greeting. But inside the back flap of the card
were scribbled numbers carrying a much more ominous message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Code,'' explains Irma Fernandez, who helps oversee the prison
system's gang enforcement program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message was reporting to a member of an Hispanic prison
gang that an assault had been successfully carried out. We got it
instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Fernandez headed the five-member unit at the
Estelle prison here _ part of the more than 50 specially trained
corrections officers across Texas who pore over thousands of pieces
of mail each day, intercepting and deciphering coded messages to
and from gang members in a script more suited to a James Bond movie
than prison. Sometimes the messages are written in numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they are dots atop words in a handwritten letter.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they are hidden behind a stamp or disguised in a
drawing.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, officials at another Texas prison
confiscated an elaborate pencil sketch of a nude woman on a
background of flowers, drawn by a member of a Hispanic gang. In the
background was a message ordering a killing.
</P>
<P>
   A similar message was hidden in a crude drawing of a cave man
chiseling letters in a rock, done by a member of a white
supremacist gang. It too was confiscated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gangs have been using codes for years, and we've been
intercepting them for years,'' said Sam Buentello, the prison
system's top gang expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've tried just about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Example: Letters written with invisible ink _ made by convicts
with urine or with cleaning fluids _ that are readable when heat is
applied with an iron or hair dryer.
</P>
<P>
   Example: Almost-invisible messages that are typed with a
ribbonless typewriter on the margins of a letter or in the folds of
an envelope. The recipient can read the message after lightly
tracing over the areas with a pencil.
</P>
<P>
   Example: Magazines and books that have words underlined on
random pages. By leafing through the pages, either front to back or
vice versa, a convict can read the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``By breaking the codes, we've been able over the years to stop
a number of crimes,'' Buentello said.
</P>
<P>
   He said thwarted crimes included murders of police officers, a
state judge, even prison officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``You name it, inmates have probably tried it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buentello and Fernandez said all correspondence to and from
confirmed gang members in prison _ except for that with their
lawyers _ is examined each day by gang intelligence officers.
</P>
<P>
   Along with coding, the officers look for things such as whether
a convict is still active in a gang, Buentello said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the coded messages, this communications system
has its own vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   When a girlfriend or other visitor delivers a message verbally,
it's called ``sending a kite.'' Letter writers' mention of a
``green light'' can be code for a murder.
</P>
<P>
   The solution?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not stopping the flow of mail to and from prison gang
members _ even between convicts in different prisons, officials
said. That is something that was forbidden years ago by federal
court orders.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, said Fernandez, ``We read the mail. We know what's
going on.''

 &HT;    From inside: Anger creates violent culture
 &HT;    By Jorge Antonio Renaud
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Editor's note: Jorge Antonio Renaud, 41, is serving a 60-year
sentence at the Wynne prison unit in Huntsville, Texas, for
aggravated robbery. Renaud was convicted in 1992 of robbing a Mr.
Gatti's restaurant and a Jack Brown Cleaners in Austin, a crime
spree he said was driven by a cocaine habit. He was working at the
time as a copy editor at the Austin American-Statesman. He becomes
eligible for parole in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ In 1977, when I first came to prison, the
convict code demanded that my courage be tested. The task fell to
my homeboys. I had seven fights my first day at Ferguson, the
gladiator unit, where inmates 21 years old and younger were
assigned.
</P>
<P>
   I left prison in late 1979 and returned in seven months, to stay
for seven years. Violence escalated dramatically in the mid-1980s
as convicts warred over the spoils left unclaimed when the building
tender system was dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   In August of 1984, my neighbor was stabbed to death on the run
(the hallway outside cells). As I mopped the blood that seeped into
my cell, I composed a poem for Tattoo, whose murder was the 12th in
what would prove to be a record-setting year for Texas prison
homicides.
</P>
<P>
   I left again in 1987 and this time didn't return until 1992. I'd
heard the system had changed. An improved guard-to-inmate ratio had
allowed a clampdown on gang activities. New building
configurations, designed to provide officers unimpeded views of
living quarters, supposedly allowed guards to closely monitor
convicts and respond quickly to disturbances. I expected stricter
but quieter prisons.
</P>
<P>
   I was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, a man with whom I was sharing a cup of cocoa was almost
stabbed to death. His assailant chased him around the day room,
slashing whenever he was within reach. The guards, dozens strong,
stayed in the hall and lobbed gas canisters and insults at us with
equally ineffectual results, intervening only when another convict
snatched the shank away.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a man staggered past me, a 20-cent black pen dangling
from his punctured right eyeball, as rival Hispanic factions _ not
organized gangs, but homeboy groups called ``tangos'' _ rioted on
the Robertson Unit yard. I've seen three racially motivated riots _
Hispanics against blacks.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen innumerable shockingly brutal incidents erupt over the
most trivial insults, and sometimes for no reason other than to get
an inmate off the wing in order to burglarize his cell. I've seen
dozens upon dozens of Anglos broken _ forced to pay cash or provide
sex to stop the beatings they endured daily _ in what seems a
savage payback for the sins of all Anglos.
</P>
<P>
   Prisons are violent arenas. Brutality rarely hides its face
here. But violence in Texas prisons used to be predictable and,
thus, avoidable. You stayed away from drugs and alcohol; you kept
your mouth shut and minded your own business; you demonstrated a
willingness to defend yourself _ and you were allowed to do your
time in relative peace.
</P>
<P>
   This is no longer true. Violence in Texas prisons is so
mindlessly pervasive and its effects so widespread that the
inevitable has happened _ a group of released convicts are charged
with an act so atrocious that it has focused a spotlight on Texas
Department of Criminal Justice conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The response by officials has been depressingly familiar: Give
us more money, and we'll identify the most vicious predators and
build more ``Super Max'' units to bury them in.
</P>
<P>
   This is absurd. You can't lock away 100,000 convicts, and that
is what it would take. Criminal Justice officials _ especially
those watching the gangs _ are too quick to blame prison gangs for
all prison violence, and for the recent murder in Jasper in
particular. Their reasoning runs like this: The three ex-convicts
charged in that incident sported racist tattoos. They were
therefore in a prison gang, or affiliated, and they were simply
practicing what racist prison gangs preach.
</P>
<P>
   This is a dangerous oversimplification. The problem does not lie
primarily with gangs, at least not those identified by the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice. The problem is a huge influx of
young convicts with unimaginably long sentences, who are angry and
afraid and all too willing to band together in groups with racial
or geographical bonds. They cloak their despair in rage, and they
act out that rage on anyone not of their group.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting violence feeds the animosity of others, many of
whom have shorter sentences and carry their hate to the free world.
</P>
<P>
   Racial animosities in prison are intractable and deadly. If
racism is so tangible, so pervasive in the free world that the
country's president feels compelled to appoint a commission to
offer suggestions, how terrible it must be where society consigns
its deadliest men?
</P>
<P>
   And the system has no idea how to deal with it, other than to
integrate its cells and dorms willy-nilly, with only a cursory
attempt to classify convicts. In Texas prisons, the only way to
avoid integration is to stab someone of a different race. You can
tell officials that you are a stone-cold racist; you can have
hideously racist tattoos from head to toe; you can have a
documented history of having participated in racially motivated
riots _ but if the system orders you into a 9-by-12-foot cell with
a man of the race you detest, you must comply or lose class and
good time and privileges.
</P>
<P>
   Such forced intimacy does little but magnify negative
stereotypes.

   __ Pacific Trading Card company
(http://www.pacifictradingcards.com) has figured out a way to put
out the first baseball card that incorporates the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Its 750-card series, out since mid-August and called Online
($1.49 a pack), includes both the players' Web-site address and the
team's official Web address with each card. One of the nine cards
per pack stamped in gold foil has an eight-digit alphanumeric code
on the back. Go to either the players' official site
(http://bigleaguers.com) or baseball's site
(http://www.majorleaguebaseball.com) and click on to the Pacific
Online baseball-card sweepstakes. Type in that code and it'll
immediately tell you if you've won one of more than 1,700 prizes
offered _ the grand prize a trip for two to the '98 Players Choice
Awards in Orlando, Fla. Other prizes include private chats with
players, magazine subscriptions, hats and T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Side note on the set: It's the first to include every
major-league player from the start of issue, making it the largest
set of single series ever.
</P>
<P>
   __ The official site of the '98 World Series
(http://www.worldseries.com) was launched last week by Major League
Baseball and SportsLine USA. In addition to live audio broadcasts
of each game, it'll have a pitch-by-pitch graphic representation.
Padres third baseman Ken Caminiti will also contribute entries from
his not-so-secret journal.
</P>
<P>
   __ The Sports Illustrated for Kids site (http://www.sikids.com)
has put up a weekly free fantasy football game called Grid-O-Matic.
Each kid is given $3 million in ``fantasy money'' and can draft
eight players, and are then put in a league.
</P>
<P>
   Yup, just another swell way to get the youth of America prepared
for Internet gambling.

 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ At the start of the '90s, when employers'
health insurance costs were surging 15 percent a year, the giant
Sprint Corp. was quick to shift to health maintenance organizations
and their businesslike management of medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's costs promptly stabilized. Today, its comprehensive
benefit program stands as a model of what Congress and industry
envisioned four years ago when they rejected President Clinton's
health plan and left the health care system to the tides of the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Yet along the hallways at Sprint headquarters here, the great
expectations for managed care have dimmed. In a score of interviews
with workers and managers, no one recounted the kind of HMO horror
story that makes headlines: The wrong leg amputated, a child denied
a transplant. Instead, they said they had found managed care to be
exasperating, callous and sometimes just senseless.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Leroy, a Sprint sales compensation manager, says his HMO,
Cigna, saved his 10-year-old daughter's life with months of
hospitalization to help her conquer a mysterious immune system
disorder. But it also required him to interrupt three days of work
to get a third doctor's opinion before authorizing hernia surgery
for him.
</P>
<P>
   The toddler son of Elsa Wong, a project manager, suffered an ear
infection for a year before her HMO primary-care physician sent him
to a specialist. When Phyllis Van Kamp, a secretary, had the fever
and deep cough of bronchitis, a clinician told her over the phone
to try aspirin for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Today managed care plans are entrenched in the economy,
enrolling 61 percent of the population, according to the American
Association of Health Plans. But managed care has lost its luster
as an industry and as the answer to the nation's health care needs.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care has so far served as a different way to pay for
medical care, not a better way to provide it. Its savings to large
employers have been real, contributing significantly to the current
economic boom, but they are likely to prove temporary, while
coverage has become more expensive for small businesses and the
self-employed. Perhaps most important, managed care has shifted
many consumers' concern from cost to quality.
</P>
<P>
   In a New York Times poll in July, 85 percent of respondents said
the health care system needs fundamental change, barely below the
90 percent who said the same thing in a Times/CBS News poll in 1994
before the Clinton health plan died. Although 68 percent said they
were satisfied with the quality of their family's health care, 30
percent said they were not, up from 19 percent in 1994. And the
percentage dissatisfied with the cost of health care was
practically unchanged, 46 percent now compared with 47 percent
then.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about health maintenance organizations, 58 percent of
respondents said the HMOs had impeded doctors' ability to control
treatment, compared with 17 percent who said they had improved it.
And though a 1995 Harris Poll found more people saying managed care
would improve the quality of care rather than harm it, the Times
poll found a sharp reversal, 50 percent saying care would be harmed
and only 32 percent saying it would be improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four and a half years ago, the country was at a watershed and
didn't know it,'' said Dr. Leo Henikoff, chief executive of the
Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's hospital system in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``One option,'' he said, ``was a highly government-regulated
system. That was the Clinton plan, and the country abhorred it.
They took the other option, to throw health care to the
marketplace, and four years later, people don't like what they're
getting.''
</P>
<P>
   The discontent at one time had put health care back at the
center of political debate, with Democrats especially seizing on
the issue. But more recently it has been eclipsed in Congress by
the scandal involving President Clinton, and although both the
White House and Congress had been considering ``patient
protection'' laws, nothing is likely to emerge this year.
</P>
<P>
   At the state level, more than 40 states have chipped away at the
marketplace model with new regulations. But no two states have
adopted the same restraints and there is no agreement on a
comprehensive system that might work better. Within the health
profession itself, experts are predicting a far more wrenching
debate focusing on ways to improve health care, not the system that
pays for it.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care was promoted as a means of reducing costs by
emphasizing preventive care and purging redundant and unnecessary
care. But now the practice of managed care is seen as little more
than a short-sighted way to manage costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managed care so far is largely an insurance phenomenon,'' said
David Lawrence, chief executive of Kaiser Permanente of Oakland,
Calif., the nation's largest nonprofit health maintenance
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, we've had not much impact on the quality of care,'' he
said. ``Ironically, the way to do that is by improving care, not by
withholding it.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the populist vilification of managed care companies
like Aetna and United Health Care, Cigna and Kaiser, the companies
work within constraints set by other, often mightier, businesses.
These are the nation's largest employers, its Sprints.
</P>
<P>
   A study published in the April issue of The New England Journal
of Medicine said, ``Large portions of the health care system have
undergone revolutionary change, and not for the purpose of
improving health care, but in order to reduce the cost of doing
business for large corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Ellwood, a retired pediatric neurologist in Jackson
Hole, Wyo., and an early proponent of managed care, said there is
``a misconception about who's in charge. It's not the HMOs. It's
the large corporate buyers of medical care.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporations with tens of thousands of employees know they can
break an HMO by terminating its contract, so they can draw the line
on what they will pay. That, more than the much scorned HMO
``utilization manager'' who must approve doctors' procedures,
defines the services that employees get and those they are denied.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Prescription plans, for example, often limit the medications
that are covered, because employers object to the cost of covering
all medications, said Donald Brain Jr., a consultant in Kansas City
who negotiates plans for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Such a plan, Brain said, might include one antidepressant,
Prozac, but not another, Zoloft. So if a physician decides Zoloft
is more suitable for a patient, the patient will have to pay for it
himself if he wants it.
</P>
<P>
   The patient blames the HMO, Brain said, ``but it's the employer
who makes the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Large corporations can also use their leverage to obtain a good
mix of care and prices. ``We're trying to provide a healthy work
force to the best of our ability, provide choice to the best of our
ability and attract good people and keep them,'' said J. Robert
Dinneen Jr., assistant vice president for corporate benefits at
Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Not all employees, however, are benefiting. While workers for
big companies like Sprint get a break on the cost of their health
insurance, tens of millions of others, the employees of small
businesses that lack Sprint's negotiating clout, have seen their
costs continue to rise at the 1980s rate.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey last year of companies with fewer than 200 workers,
the journal Health Affairs found that the average monthly payroll
deduction for family health insurance had leaped from $34 in 1988
to $175 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Thornton, the owner of National Consulting Services near
Kansas City, a firm with eight full-time employees, ended his
contract with Humana last year after it told him his premium would
go up nearly 50 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   After considering six other health plans, his employees chose
United Healthcare, which offered more benefits and more choice than
Humana but still raised their premiums 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Because Thornton says he can afford to pay just 50 percent of
the premiums for his employees, they pay $75 to $600 a month for
health insurance, depending on their age and coverage. That is five
to 10 times more than workers pay at Sprint, which covers 90
percent of premiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think that you're going to get anywhere near the
benefits or costs and resulting value that a large business such as
Sprint is going to receive,'' Thornton said of small businesses,
``you will be woefully disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are limits to how much large employers can squeeze
managed care companies, and corporations like Sprint are starting
to accept larger increases in premiums in return for improved
services and more options.
</P>
<P>
   This year Sprint accepted a 3.8 percent increase, after three
years when increases totaled 3.2 percent. An increase of 5 percent
to 6 percent is likely for next year, Dinneen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're giving up some clout for choice,'' he said. ``We're
assuming it will be much tougher this year to keep rates at as
modest an increase as they have been in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Increases are likely in any case, however, because in their race
to enroll the work force, 49 percent of the nation's 650 HMOs lost
money through September last year, said InterStudy Publications in
Minneapolis, which tracks the industry. Four years ago, InterStudy
said, 90 percent were profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Ominously for the economy, employers and subscribers, HMOs are
trying to rebuild their profits with higher premiums.
</P>
<P>
   As the Kansas City area's largest private employer, Sprint has
immense leverage over HMOs that want its business, but there is
still tension between its goals: keeping costs down, and keeping
employees not only healthy and productive but also happy with their
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The formula Sprint has settled on works, to a point. Employees
say they usually get the care they need. But they say that under
managed care, routine events like having blood drawn or having a
baby can become exasperating and, if they drop their guard,
something worse.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Ott would seem to have an edge on the system as human
resources director for the Local Telecommunications Division. But
halfway through her second pregnancy, her HMO, Cigna, switched her
from St. Joseph's Hospital near her home in Overland Park, Kan., to
Baptist Hospital in Kansas City, Mo., 45 minutes away.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ott had gestational diabetes and had to have blood drawn
once and sometimes twice a week, and Cigna required that she use
Baptist. Finally she complained to her obstetrician, so he did it
in his office.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ott still had to go to Baptist to deliver, however. She was
in for another surprise. ``I was checked in and out in 23 hours,''
she said. ``I was John Wayne, walking down the hall with my
newborn.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress later mandated that hospitals allow two days for
births, but Ms. Ott had already had enough of Cigna. She switched
to another HMO with a Sprint contract.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint offers an unusually large range of choices: five managed
care plans and HMOs, plus two traditional fee-for-service plans,
which permit employees to seek whatever care they want wherever
they want. That option can be expensive, however, costing a family
needing a lot of care as much as $6,000 a year, so less than 20
percent of the work force chooses it.
</P>
<P>
   In managed care plans, each subscriber typically has a primary
care ``gatekeeper,'' the physician who provides all routine care,
keeps his charts and refers him to specialists. Sprint employees,
though, have stumbled upon a peculiar feature of many HMOs: the
phantom gatekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   The gatekeeper function survives: Charts are kept, medicines are
prescribed and referrals are made. But when a patient visits the
clinic, he sees whoever is available. It is rarely the same doctor,
and sometimes it is a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Having little confidence that anyone really knows them or their
conditions, some Sprint workers have devised a strategy to make the
plans work for them. They trust their own instincts. They do their
own research. They don't accept no for an answer. They persist. In
effect, they manage their managed care.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Tasby and her family have been covered by Kaiser for 11
years. ``I love my primary care physician,'' said Ms. Tasby, a
Sprint human resources manager. Kaiser was instrumental in helping
her stop smoking and lose weight, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then last year, she brought in her 13-year-old son because his
left leg was bowing. A doctor correctly diagnosed it as Blount's
disease, a condition in which the upper shin bone stops producing
bone tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they didn't tell me anything about it,'' Ms. Tasby said.
``I went on the Internet and found information myself.'' When she
went back to Kaiser and asked about corrective surgery, ``They told
me I shouldn't do anything until he was 16.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So I went outside Kaiser,'' she said. ``I paid $350 to a
specialist. He told me I should do the surgery now.'' Again she
returned to Kaiser, and this time she was referred to a Kaiser
orthopedist, who also recommended surgery. The boy had the
operation in January and Kaiser covered it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't quit Kaiser,'' Ms. Tasby said. But she has learned
something about life with an HMO. ``They think, `What the customer
doesn't know won't hurt. If they ask, we'll give it to them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of managed care say that so far the marketplace has been
a ham-handed manager of medicine. In cutting premiums to attract
employers and patients, in chipping away at excess and in wringing
discounts from its physicians, hospitals and drug companies, HMOs
have produced scant evidence that care itself is actually managed,
or that the health plans' customers are any healthier.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of evidence that some hospitals and their
doctors are providing erroneous, excessive and inappropriate care,
while others do much better.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lawrence of Kaiser, for example, said some hospitals deliver
five times as many babies by Caesarean section as others, most of
them unnecessary. The New England Journal of Medicine has found
that 34.5 percent of all women who get mammograms in their 40s
receive false positive results and then often are treated
unnecessarily. Estimates of preventable deaths in hospitals, those
arising from mistakes and mistreatment, range from 120,000 a year
to 180,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sloppy care is not cheap care,'' said Bruce Fried, a former
assistant secretary in the Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that true management of care can curb the cost of
errors and excess. They look to the developing discipline of
evidence-based medicine to enable doctors make better decisions on
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Kaiser has begun recording patients' charts, treatments
and treatment results in computers across its entire network with
the goal of learning what practices and treatments work best.
</P>
<P>
   Shifting to evidence-based medicine, however, will require
immense investments in computers and great changes in how HMOs and
doctors do business. And so its proponents are not making the kinds
of sweeping promises that HMOs made in the '80s, when managed care
was still a movement, before the nation's giant insurance companies
stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of evidence-based medicine will be a while coming,
cautioned Uwe Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton
University. Its best hope? ``That after two or three years of
premium increases, business and government will say, `This doesn't
work,' and that will wake us up.''

HOW SMALL COMPANIES GET BIG CUSTOMERS TO PAY BILLS ON TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JANET STITES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Jeff Stewart started Square Earth, a company
based in New York that develops World Wide Web applications for
Fortune 500 companies, he knew that managing cash flow would be
almost as important as getting business. As a former consultant
with Ernst &AMP; Young's financial services division, he knew how large
companies operated, and realized that collections, and thus cash
flow, would be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger the company, the longer it takes to get paid,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Painfully late payments _ the dirty little secret of running a
small technology-based company, especially one catering to Fortune
1000 companies _ are a major problem for many of New York's
``Silicon Alley'' companies. While most vendors expect small
businesses to pay outstanding bills within 30 days _ not one day
later _ small companies often find themselves struggling to get
paid by companies with vast accounting departments where no one
seems accountable.
</P>
<P>
   Square Earth was acquired in January by Proxicom, based in
Reston, Va., and Stewart now serves as marketing director for
Proxicom's financial services practice. Making payroll is no longer
his responsibility, but from day one as chief financial officer of
Square Earth, he had a systematic, methodical, nearly obsessive
strategy for collecting his receivables, which ranged from $50,000
to $300,000 per invoice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would structure the deal to allow us to invoice as quickly
as possible,'' he recalled. ``We would cut invoices on time. The
invoice would be constantly monitored. We would follow up three
days after we sent the invoice out to make sure it was received. On
day 15, we would follow up again, and on day 28, we'd make sure it
was being processed.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart concedes that this vigilance did not always expedite an
invoice, but it did let him know where things stood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our invoices were payable on demand,'' he said. ``So if the
company normally paid in 200 days, well, then we'd get paid on day
200. I don't think they noticed what our terms were.''
</P>
<P>
   As the company grew, Stewart secured a credit line from Silicon
Valley Bank East that he described as ``critical to our growth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't such a big risk for Silicon Valley Bank,'' he said,
``because all of our customers were Fortune 500 companies, so the
bank knew it was going to get paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit lines, however, are hard to come by. For instance,
Silicon Valley Bank East generally only grants them to technology
companies that already have venture backing or some other investor
support. ``Square Earth was already generating decent revenues,''
said Doug Marshall, the bank's vice president. ``They were at a
break-even point and had an angel investment,'' referring to
financial backers who provided seed money.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Boissevain, managing director of E-Technologies Associates,
a firm that helps technology companies raise money, says that while
it is not impossible to get a credit line, the opportunity costs
are high. ``Sometimes it's just easier to get venture funding,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For clients who pursue a credit line, Boissevain suggests
opening personal and business accounts at the bank, getting to know
the loan officer by name, talking to him or her about the business,
and then eventually asking for a small credit line. ``It's a
step-up process,'' he said. ``The banker needs to trust you as an
individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Suzdak, formerly general manager and co-founder of a New
York-based Web design company, Oculus Interactive, applied the
personal approach to his collection process. When IBM became an
Oculus client, Suzdak found out who could push the button to get a
check cut and then made it a point to develop that relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a client relationship people generally overlook
completely,'' he said. ``Late payment can be the death of a small
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Through a series of phone calls and a strategy of respect and
courtesy, Suzdak got to know the button pusher as a friend, and
vice versa. IBM owed Oculus anywhere from $25,000 to $50,000 at any
given time, and ``our checks came in on time, sometimes
overnight,'' he said. ``Just like in anything else, people take
care of people who they like.''
</P>
<P>
   Oculus was sold last June to Blair Lake New Media, and Suzdak is
now with a Web development software firm, Arcus. He never met his
phone friend at IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen King's company, Virtual Growth Inc., has served as a
bookkeeping and accounting service for 150 Silicon Alley companies.
In addition to standard accounting services, the firm handles
billings and collections. King often finds himself doling out
advice to managers in positions similar to those of Stewart and
Suzdak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recommend to our clients that they clearly understand the
chain of command when dealing with larger companies,'' he said.
``Where does the invoice have to go before it gets paid? What's the
process? They need to find out the time-frame for payment. What is
the minimum amount? If it's going to take too long, we advise them
to bill a month in advance and to build that into the contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Collections are difficult for any size business. Invoices are
lost. Someone is waiting on an approval of an approval. The guy who
signs the checks is on vacation. Sometimes, the customer simply
knows he can draw the vendor out because the vendor needs the
business and is not going to jeopardize the account.
</P>
<P>
   Large corporations can manage all these problems with entire
departments dedicated to collections and bankers at their heels.
But what small companies have are overdue notices from their
insurance companies, employees waving deposit slips on the 15th and
30th, and late-payment fees adding up on their personal credit
cards.
</P>
<P>
   So the entrepreneur must find creative ways to circumvent the
issue, learning how to manage not only his company's cash flow but
those of its clients.
</P>
<P>
   Now safely ensconced in an established company and with a
direct-deposited salary, Stewart has the luxury of reflecting on
the early days.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're eight to 10 employees, you can max your credit
card out to make payroll,'' he said. ``But once your payroll
exceeds your life savings, you know things are getting serious.
That's when you think about paying the bills constantly. It's on
your mind when you go to sleep at night or when you're brushing
your teeth.''

WORLD BANK WORRIED BY PRESSURE FOR QUICK-FIX ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Also see WORLDBANK-IMF) 
(lb) 
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the global economic crisis spreads across much
of the developing world, the World Bank fears that the Group of
Seven major industrial powers wants to transform it from a
slow-moving development agency into a financial fire truck,
programmed to squirt streams of cash at countries under speculative
attack as part of a plan to create a large financing mechanism
capable of combating the global turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund, which was expressly
created to perform the job of emergency financial rescue, is in
danger of becoming sidelined in the present emergency. After
advancing huge loans to Asia and Russia, it has only enough cash
left for one more big rescue operation unless the U.S. Congress
overcomes its hostility to giving it new funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've been trying to do recently is to convince my
shareholders that they shouldn't think of the bank as a
second-level IMF,'' the World Bank's president, James Wolfensohn,
said last week at a news conference, stressing that his duty is to
promote sound long-term development. ``We are not that; we are not
a lender of last resort or a liquidity funder.''
</P>
<P>
   As finance ministers from all over the world gathered here this
weekend in preparation for next week's annual joint meeting of the
World Bank and the IMF, many warned that without a radical
strengthening of the international financial system the crisis will
spread far beyond Asia and Russia to affect the whole developing
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recession will be at the door of all countries unless we react
quickly,'' Algeria's finance minister, Abdelkrim Harchaoui, said on
Saturday after serving as chairman of a meeting of the Group of 24,
which represents the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   India's finance minister, Yashwant Sinha, said, ``We're
witnessing an unprecedented crisis, with whole regions engulfed,
not just countries. It's a global challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The IMF has sharply lowered its economic growth forecasts for
the developing world as a whole, predicting now that its economies
will expand by 2.3 percent this year and 3.6 percent next. That
compares with last year's 5.8 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
   The four most seriously affected Asian countries _ Indonesia,
Malaysia, Korea and the Philippines _ are much the worst hit.
Together they face a 10.4 percent decline in economic output this
year and another smaller contraction next year.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes of economic growth in Russia and the rest of the former
Soviet Union have also been dashed, with the IMF now expecting a
decline overall and a sharp 6 percent fall in Russian output this
year and next combined.
</P>
<P>
   Under difficult international conditions, what the World Bank
now fears is that the United States and other members of the Group
of Seven will push it into contributing to the plan they endorsed
Saturday for creating a big new pool of money to combat the global
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   This would involve asking the World Bank to relax its usual
lending standards and to join the IMF in making new
quick-dispersing loans to countries in trouble that would be little
more than cash injections rather than a serious contribution to
their long-term development.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Sunday, the British chancellor of the
Exchequer, Gordon Brown, was ambiguous about the World Bank's role
in the present crisis, saying the Group of Seven wanted ``to stress
the World Bank's long-term role in promoting structural reforms''
but adding that it must still ``take a role in crisis management.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the back of everyone's mind is Brazil, which has been in
danger of speculative attack for some time and is informally
discussing a possible big new loan of about $30 billion with
international aid agencies and Western governments once this
weekend's elections are out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank is vulnerable to pressure to become more of a
short-term financing agency for countries in distress because,
unlike the IMF, it is relatively flush with cash at the moment.
With a lending capacity of some $160 billion and about $104 billion
in outstanding loans and pledges, it could in theory lend an
additional $50 billion or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Larry sees those figures,'' a senior World Bank official
said, referring to Lawrence Summers, the U.S. undersecretary of the
Treasury, ``he says to himself, `Here's another $50 billion to
throw at the crisis.'''
</P>
<P>
   World Bank officials say they are ready to play some financial
fire-fighting role. But they do not want to endanger their
reputation as a first-class borrower on international financial
markets by raising annual net lending above $11 billion, from about
$8 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   And they insist that any extra loans should meet their
traditional lending conditions and be destined for sound long-term
projects intended to fight poverty and to promote development goals
like education, health and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF, meanwhile, has the potential to play an enhanced role,
as the Group of Seven called on it to do on Saturday, since member
governments have agreed to give it $90 billion more of their
national currencies, of which about $60 billion would be paid in
desirable currencies that crisis-stricken countries would want to
borrow.

<P>
   In addition, they want to expand a special overdraft fund known
as the General Arrangements to Borrow by a further $22 billion,
thus giving the IMF a total of nearly $90 billion in extra money to
lend.
</P>
<P>
   But the actual provision of this cash remains stalled by the
refusal of Congress to approve the United States' contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Until Congress gives its assent, the IMF has only about $26
billion of usable currencies left in its coffers and $16.5 billion
more in the special overdraft fund.

ANALYSIS: D'AMATO AND SCHUMER: NOT SO OPPOSITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also filed in category `a')  
(js) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anyone following the U.S. Senate race in New York
this year could be forgiven for concluding that this is one of the
epic ideological battles of the 1990s: the right-wing extremist,
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, versus the ultraliberal Brooklyn congressman,
Charles Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   On one side is D'Amato, who, as Schumer said again Sunday, voted
to cut Medicare, opposed abortion rights and battled
environmentalists. On the other is Schumer, who, as D'Amato likes
to say, voted against crime bills, opposed welfare restrictions and
supported a series of tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth behind these ideological caricatures is
considerably more complex, despite the best efforts of Schumer and
D'Amato to confuse it. These two candidates for Senate are, in
fact, political hybrids, masters of the fluid school of politics
and ideology that has emerged in U.S. elections in the 1990s, and
very much in the tradition of such successful politicians as Bill
Clinton, Rudolph Giuliani and George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Like Clinton, who campaigned in the New Hampshire Democratic
primary in 1992 on a promise to slash welfare, and Pataki, who ran
for New York governor in 1994 by embracing the environmental
movement, D'Amato and Schumer have defied just enough of their
parties' orthodoxy to resist easy characterization.
</P>
<P>
   Their legislative histories are certainly littered with votes
that permit their opponents to paint them as extreme, like
Schumer's voting in the state Assembly to weaken drug laws, or
D'Amato's championing of much of House Speaker Newt Gingrich's
Contract With America. But like most New Yorkers _ or more
specifically, like most people who will vote on Nov. 3 _ the
three-term Republican senator and his Democratic challenger are
closer to the center than to either extreme.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think they are as different as they say,'' said the
Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader who ran for the
Democratic nomination to challenge D'Amato in 1992. ``Chuck has
always been right of center in the Democratic Party, and D'Amato
has always been, well, whatever works for him on that given day.
They are both rewriting as they go.''
</P>
<P>
   The flood of conflicting vote citations and ideological
name-calling that have filled the state's airwaves notwithstanding,
these first three weeks of the general election campaign have been
less about ideology and more about tactics. With a nod to the
political reality of the moderate cast of New York's electorate,
D'Amato and Schumer are each trying to accomplish the same thing,
if from different corners of the ring: to cover the tracks of their
own political evolution while portraying their opponent as extreme.
</P>
<P>
   This maneuvering began on the first day of the general election
campaign as D'Amato attacked Schumer as liberal while the
representative assailed D'Amato as soft on crime. And it has
continued every day since then, testimony to one of the most
enduring facts of this contest: Whatever their differences on
issues, as political tacticians, Schumer and D'Amato have similar
reflexes.
</P>
<P>
   This is nothing new for D'Amato. He has historically prepared
for each election with a march on the political center, and then
campaigned by portraying his opponents, notably Robert Abrams, the
state attorney general, in 1992, as liberal vestiges. This formula,
combined with a record of tending to the more parochial needs of
the state and its voters, largely accounts for D'Amato's repeated
success at winning re-election in what is, by registration, a
strongly Democratic state.
</P>
<P>
   What is different this time is that D'Amato has encountered in
Schumer a challenger who is trying to do to the senator what the
senator typically does to his opponent. The representative has
parried each ideological assault by D'Amato by asserting that it is
the senator who is the ideological extremist, and then by blurring
his own ideological evolution with a recitation of what was his own
march on the political center as he prepared in Congress for this
race.
</P>
<P>
   It seems unlikely that Schumer will ever convince voters that he
is, for example, tougher on crime than D'Amato, or that D'Amato is
a foot soldier for Gingrich's Republican revolution. But at the
very least, by echoing D'Amato's tactics, Schumer may succeed in
neutralizing a weapon that D'Amato has used against previous
opponents to devastating effect.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato certainly has a basis for saying that Schumer is to the
left of most of the U.S. electorate. Schumer voted against the 1996
bill that restricted welfare benefits. He opposed the
balanced-budget amendment. He has supported a series of tax
increases over the years. He voted for federal legislation that
would ban discrimination in hiring homosexuals. He has voted
against measures that would make it easier to jail juveniles in
adult prisons, and against another measure that would have imposed
additional penalties for crimes involving the use of guns.
</P>
<P>
   But Schumer, who has spent many of his 18 years in Congress
preparing for the seven weeks of this general election campaign,
has also repeatedly voted in favor of a federal death penalty.
(Though Schumer earlier in his life opposed the death penalty.) He
was the sponsor of legislation to provide funds to hire police
officers and to ban many forms of assault weapons. He voted to
restrict the rights of illegal immigrants in some cases, and in
favor of legislation to crack down on food-stamp fraud. He
supported the line-item veto. He also voted in favor of a measure
that would ban the recognition of marriages between homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, on many levels, D'Amato's Republican credentials seem
more than secure. He has opposed abortion rights throughout his
career, and voted against gun control. He has supported many
aspects of Gingrich's attempts to cut social spending, and his
votes on environmental legislation have earned him consistently
weak ratings from national environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   Yet D'Amato is no less nimble than Schumer. The senator voted
for the federal legislation that would ban discrimination in hiring
against homosexuals; he is poised to win the endorsement of one of
the nation's major gay rights groups, the Human Rights Campaign. He
became one of the chief advocates in Washington of repealing
legislation passed by a Republican Congress (with his support) that
curbed benefits to the children of illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, he spoke before one of the largest black
congregations in New York City at the church in Queens led by a
former congressman, the Rev. Floyd H. Flake, where he recounted his
efforts to push through a commemorative coin for Jackie Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   He is planning to testify in Washington on Tuesday about ways to
curb acid rain. And he has pushed consistently and successfully for
spending on breast cancer research and screening.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of politics, the efforts by these two candidates
suggests how complicated it is becoming to run a statewide race in
New York. The shifting ideology of the electorate, combined with
the diminishing vote out of New York City in state elections, means
that being viewed as a liberal is no longer the electoral lift that
it once was. Yet New York remains a long way from being a
conservative state.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the best evidence of where these two candidates
stand could be found in the endorsement by Schumer last week by
District Council 37, the umbrella group of unions representing New
York City employees. What was surprising was not that this
historically solid Democratic union endorsed Schumer but that it
anguished so much over it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are differences between them,'' said Norman Adler, the
political consultant who works for Republicans and Democrats. ``But
on the whole, they are less different than you would like to
think.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ World financial markets are in turmoil. Hedge funds
are bleeding billions. But with consumers confused and investors
scared, a measure that supporters say would modernize the United
States' financial system and make it more globally competitive is
stuck in Congress, caught in the crosscurrents of several political
fights.
</P>
<P>
   In the tension between policy and politics, politics is winning
out as the measure approaches the finish line. The bill, which
Congress has debated for two decades, would eliminate barriers
separating banks, insurance companies and brokers and allow them to
merge into new financial conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   The first fight that could derail it pits Alan Greenspan, the
Federal Reserve Board chairman, who has been arm-twisting for the
bill, against Robert Rubin, the Treasury secretary, who opposes it.
This battle has nothing to do with financial policy but is a bitter
turf fight over who will be the top regulator in the financial
world of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the tight Senate race in New York. The incumbent,
Alfonse D'Amato, a Republican and chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, has been tirelessly pushing for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   It could give him a major legislative victory, especially for
his hometown financial industry and longtime financial backers, as
the race moves into the final stretch. A victory would portray
D'Amato as someone who can deliver a big bill, the most important
piece of financial legislation in decades.
</P>
<P>
   In a squeeze is his Democratic opponent, Rep. Charles Schumer,
who voted for the bill in May but has done little since. He risks
upsetting his Wall Street supporters if he does not prevail on
fellow Democrats in Congress and in the administration to enact
this bill. But while its passage could polish his image, too, as
someone who can get things done in Washington, it would also hand a
public relations victory to D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is President Clinton, who has threatened to veto
the measure even as he lectures Japan and other Asian nations on
modernizing their financial systems.
</P>
<P>
   His motivation? Those close to the process suggest that it is to
``look presidential'' amid his own political problems by waving the
veto pen, to deny Republicans a legislative victory on a bill that
Democrats have never been able to get out of Congress and to deny
glory to D'Amato, who harshly criticized the Clintons during the
Senate Whitewater hearings. Besides, Rubin opposes it, and Clinton
trusts Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are big political currents on this bill,'' said Martin
Farmer, a lobbyist for the Independent Bankers of America, a trade
group. ``There are fist fights going on, and it's all getting
pretty intense.''
</P>
<P>
   But D'Amato said simply: ``Financial modernization is long
overdue. It's good for the country, good for the state, but it's
not a political issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, it appears there are enough votes in the Senate to
pass the bill if these political battles do not scuttle it. In May,
the House passed the measure by a single vote. But since then,
various industry groups that had been fighting one another have
settled their differences and now back the bill. Moreover, support
is largely bipartisan, with enough Democratic and Republican
support to eliminate party-line fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the middle, there is overwhelming consensus to get this
bill passed,'' said an aide to a Democratic Senate leader. ``The
question is whether this bill will be pulled apart at the edges, or
is there enough heft in the middle to roll it through. As a
political matter, it's gotten weird.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Russbuldt, executive vice president of the Independent
Insurance Agents of America, added: ``You have a bill before the
Senate that now has no substantial private-sector opposition. You
have historic agreements between many industries once antagonistic.
The issues on the table now are not substantive; they are
political.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the weirdest fight of all is between Greenspan and
Rubin. Technically, it is over how financial institutions of the
future would be structured, as bank holding companies with numerous
affiliates or as banks with numerous subsidiaries. Most banks,
brokers and insurance companies don't care which structure is
chosen; they just want the bill to pass.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that if the bank holding company structure is
chosen, the Federal Reserve becomes the nation's top financial
regulator; if the affiliate structure is selected, the Treasury
Department keeps its hold.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Greenspan is winning. The bill has the Federal Reserve
as the top regulator, and efforts by Rubin and the Treasury to
shift it were defeated by a 3-to-1 ratio in the House and
resoundingly in the Senate Banking Committee. Even Democrats did
not support Rubin, a Democrat, on this issue. The reason? Congress
loves Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time Greenspan has come to pitch Congress, they've sided
with him,'' said Dan Zielenski, a lobbyist for the American
Insurance Association. ``He's got the stature as the lord high
protector of the economy, and if Greenspan is saying it is not safe
to vote the other way, what member of Congress wants to take the
risk of voting against Alan Greenspan?''
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin has something in his back pocket: the threat of a
presidential veto. So far, the Treasury has refused to negotiate
with lawmakers or lobbyists, preferring a ``just say no'' attitude
in the belief that this veto threat will cause Congress,
ultimately, to change the bill.
</P>
<P>
   There are two theories to explain this strategy. One is that
Rubin, formerly a Wall Street trader, is engaged in a game of
political ``liar's poker'' and, to gain maximum leverage, will not
give an inch until the last minute. The other theory is simpler _
that he means what he says.
</P>
<P>
   A top administration official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said the latter theory was correct. ``Unless the
concerns we have expressed are fully satisfied _ and we have not
seen any movement at all in that direction _ as far as I'm
concerned, the bill is on a veto track.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So what happens if the bill, with Greenspan as the top
regulator, is passed by the Senate this week and lands on the
president's desk? Here again, theories abound. One is that given
the financial turmoil everywhere, the president would have a hard
time not signing a measure that the entire financial services
industry says is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Another theory holds that the president would also have a hard
time saying no to congressional Democrats, especially close allies,
who have been trying to pass the bill for two decades, or to a
Congress that has worked, with bipartisan cooperation, on this
measure for two years _ and all over a bureaucratic turf fight.
</P>
<P>
   That said, he would also be loath to hand a victory to a
Republican Congress or do anything that could help return a
Republican to the Senate, especially in the key New York race.
</P>
<P>
   Based on some of the president's statements, some say Clinton
may duck behind the argument that the bill is anti-consumer because
it does not greatly expand provisions of the Community Reinvestment
Act, which requires banks to provide low-cost services to low- and
moderate-income consumers. But that could prove to be a flimsy
reason because the bill maintains the status quo on that issue and
actually expands it a bit.
</P>
<P>
   In late September, a delegation of Wall Street executives,
including Sanford Weill, chief executive of Travelers Group, and
John Reed, chief executive of Citicorp, called on Rubin. But their
efforts were to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told the Wall Street CEOs that our veto is still in
place,'' one White House official said. ``We told them they should
put pressure on Congress to change the bill to the Treasury
regulatory structure.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is another potent obstacle in the Senate. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, has vowed to kill the bill with a filibuster and deft
parliamentary maneuvers because it does not eliminate any and all
Community Reinvestment Act obligations on banks, something Gramm
has compared to slavery. On this point, to the dismay of the
Republican leadership, Gramm is acting on his own convictions. No
one in the financial services industry supports his view.

stand could be found in the endorsement by Schumer last week by
District Council 37, the umbrella group of unions representing New
York City employees. What was surprising was not that this
historically solid Democratic union endorsed Schumer but that it
anguished so much over it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are differences between them,'' said Norman Adler, the
political consultant who works for Republicans and Democrats. ``But
on the whole, they are less different than you would like to
think.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ World financial markets are in turmoil. Hedge funds
are bleeding billions. But with consumers confused and investors
scared, a measure that supporters say would modernize the United
States' financial system and make it more globally competitive is
stuck in Congress, caught in the crosscurrents of several political
fights.
</P>
<P>
   In the tension between policy and politics, politics is winning
out as the measure approaches the finish line. The bill, which
Congress has debated for two decades, would eliminate barriers
separating banks, insurance companies and brokers and allow them to
merge into new financial conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   The first fight that could derail it pits Alan Greenspan, the
Federal Reserve Board chairman, who has been arm-twisting for the
bill, against Robert Rubin, the Treasury secretary, who opposes it.
This battle has nothing to do with financial policy but is a bitter
turf fight over who will be the top regulator in the financial
world of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the tight Senate race in New York. The incumbent,
Alfonse D'Amato, a Republican and chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, has been tirelessly pushing for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   It could give him a major legislative victory, especially for
his hometown financial industry and longtime financial backers, as
the race moves into the final stretch. A victory would portray
D'Amato as someone who can deliver a big bill, the most important
piece of financial legislation in decades.
</P>
<P>
   In a squeeze is his Democratic opponent, Rep. Charles Schumer,
who voted for the bill in May but has done little since. He risks
upsetting his Wall Street supporters if he does not prevail on
fellow Democrats in Congress and in the administration to enact
this bill. But while its passage could polish his image, too, as
someone who can get things done in Washington, it would also hand a
public relations victory to D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is President Clinton, who has threatened to veto
the measure even as he lectures Japan and other Asian nations on
modernizing their financial systems.
</P>
<P>
   His motivation? Those close to the process suggest that it is to
``look presidential'' amid his own political problems by waving the
veto pen, to deny Republicans a legislative victory on a bill that
Democrats have never been able to get out of Congress and to deny
glory to D'Amato, who harshly criticized the Clintons during the
Senate Whitewater hearings. Besides, Rubin opposes it, and Clinton
trusts Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are big political currents on this bill,'' said Martin
Farmer, a lobbyist for the Independent Bankers of America, a trade
group. ``There are fist fights going on, and it's all getting
pretty intense.''
</P>
<P>
   But D'Amato said simply: ``Financial modernization is long
overdue. It's good for the country, good for the state, but it's
not a political issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, it appears there are enough votes in the Senate to
pass the bill if these political battles do not scuttle it. In May,
the House passed the measure by a single vote. But since then,
various industry groups that had been fighting one another have
settled their differences and now back the bill. Moreover, support
is largely bipartisan, with enough Democratic and Republican
support to eliminate party-line fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the middle, there is overwhelming consensus to get this
bill passed,'' said an aide to a Democratic Senate leader. ``The
question is whether this bill will be pulled apart at the edges, or
is there enough heft in the middle to roll it through. As a
political matter, it's gotten weird.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Russbuldt, executive vice president of the Independent
Insurance Agents of America, added: ``You have a bill before the
Senate that now has no substantial private-sector opposition. You
have historic agreements between many industries once antagonistic.
The issues on the table now are not substantive; they are
political.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the weirdest fight of all is between Greenspan and
Rubin. Technically, it is over how financial institutions of the
future would be structured, as bank holding companies with numerous
affiliates or as banks with numerous subsidiaries. Most banks,
brokers and insurance companies don't care which structure is
chosen; they just want the bill to pass.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that if the bank holding company structure is
chosen, the Federal Reserve becomes the nation's top financial
regulator; if the affiliate structure is selected, the Treasury
Department keeps its hold.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Greenspan is winning. The bill has the Federal Reserve
as the top regulator, and efforts by Rubin and the Treasury to
shift it were defeated by a 3-to-1 ratio in the House and
resoundingly in the Senate Banking Committee. Even Democrats did
not support Rubin, a Democrat, on this issue. The reason? Congress
loves Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time Greenspan has come to pitch Congress, they've sided
with him,'' said Dan Zielenski, a lobbyist for the American
Insurance Association. ``He's got the stature as the lord high
protector of the economy, and if Greenspan is saying it is not safe
to vote the other way, what member of Congress wants to take the
risk of voting against Alan Greenspan?''
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin has something in his back pocket: the threat of a
presidential veto. So far, the Treasury has refused to negotiate
with lawmakers or lobbyists, preferring a ``just say no'' attitude
in the belief that this veto threat will cause Congress,
ultimately, to change the bill.
</P>
<P>
   There are two theories to explain this strategy. One is that
Rubin, formerly a Wall Street trader, is engaged in a game of
political ``liar's poker'' and, to gain maximum leverage, will not
give an inch until the last minute. The other theory is simpler _
that he means what he says.
</P>
<P>
   A top administration official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said the latter theory was correct. ``Unless the
concerns we have expressed are fully satisfied _ and we have not
seen any movement at all in that direction _ as far as I'm
concerned, the bill is on a veto track.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So what happens if the bill, with Greenspan as the top
regulator, is passed by the Senate this week and lands on the
president's desk? Here again, theories abound. One is that given
the financial turmoil everywhere, the president would have a hard
time not signing a measure that the entire financial services
industry says is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Another theory holds that the president would also have a hard
time saying no to congressional Democrats, especially close allies,
who have been trying to pass the bill for two decades, or to a
Congress that has worked, with bipartisan cooperation, on this
measure for two years _ and all over a bureaucratic turf fight.
</P>
<P>
   That said, he would also be loath to hand a victory to a
Republican Congress or do anything that could help return a
Republican to the Senate, especially in the key New York race.
</P>
<P>
   Based on some of the president's statements, some say Clinton
may duck behind the argument that the bill is anti-consumer because
it does not greatly expand provisions of the Community Reinvestment
Act, which requires banks to provide low-cost services to low- and
moderate-income consumers. But that could prove to be a flimsy
reason because the bill maintains the status quo on that issue and
actually expands it a bit.
</P>
<P>
   In late September, a delegation of Wall Street executives,
including Sanford Weill, chief executive of Travelers Group, and
John Reed, chief executive of Citicorp, called on Rubin. But their
efforts were to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told the Wall Street CEOs that our veto is still in
place,'' one White House official said. ``We told them they should
put pressure on Congress to change the bill to the Treasury
regulatory structure.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is another potent obstacle in the Senate. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, has vowed to kill the bill with a filibuster and deft
parliamentary maneuvers because it does not eliminate any and all
Community Reinvestment Act obligations on banks, something Gramm
has compared to slavery. On this point, to the dismay of the
Republican leadership, Gramm is acting on his own convictions. No
one in the financial services industry supports his view.

<P>
   Bell Atlantic had a problem.
</P>
<P>
   A big corporate client in New Jersey was convinced that there
were problems with a new network that Bell Atlantic had built for
it. Bell Atlantic knew it could slove the perceived problems, but
simply could not spare enough engineers with the right technical
skills to set things straight. So the big telephone company did
something that once might have been unthinkable for a bearer of the
Bell legacy: It sought outside help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked for a resource that could come in with the specific
network and trouble-shooting characteristics so they could work on
the team,'' recalled Evelyn Howe, director for business development
at Bell Atlantic's data networking group.
</P>
<P>
   The ``resource'' Bell Atlantic turned to back in the winter of
1996 was International Network Services Inc., a small company based
in Sunnyvale, Calif., that is in the vanguard of a new industry:
dedicated network consulting.
</P>
<P>
   INS, founded in 1991, does not manufacture equipment. It does
not run computers. It does not re-engineer business processes. It
does not develop corporate strategies. What INS does do is design,
manage and secure communications networks. And the company does it
so well that it has become the network engineers' engineer _ the
expert that the network experts can turn to when they need a
specialist's touch.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Bell Atlantic, among the other telecommunications and
technology giants that have used INS are AT&AMP;T, MCI Communications,
Worldcom, SBC Communications, Sprint, BellSouth, Cable &AMP; Wireless,
Airtouch, GTE, Cisco Systems, Compaq Computer and Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   In its narrow focus on network services, INS may be unique among
public companies, and for that it has been rewarded. It is true
that the company's stock has been slammed during the recent wave of
concern about global spending on communications networks, closing
Friday in Nasdaq trading at $34.375, down more than 37 percent from
a high of $47.125 in July. Even so, INS' stock price is still up
48.7 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike many Silicon Valley start-ups, INS makes money. The
stock trades at nearly 49 times estimated per-share earnings, a
reflection of the company's explosive revenue growth, to $170
million in the fiscal year ended in June from $16 million in fiscal
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The market opportunity is huge. The Yankee Group, a consulting
and research firm in Boston, estimates that the overall market for
network integration services will grow to $52.7 billion in 2001
from $29.6 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those services today are provided by companies which
generally focus on doing something else, like selling equipment or
managing computer rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Keirstead, who follows INS for Lehman Brothers, has a
highly plausible theory on the evolution of consulting markets, and
his notion helps put INS into context.
</P>
<P>
   The way Keirstead puts it, corporate executives have generally
been reluctant to involve outsiders in the deployment and
management of new technologies until a big company validates the
idea that outsourcing is viable. Such validation is what Electronic
Data Systems brought to computer services business in the 1960s and
what Andersen Consulting helped bring to software services in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Network services are the next stage in outsourcing. The
validation, at least in the eyes of the largest corporations, is
being performed by outsourcing operations like AT&AMP;T Solutions, IBM
Global Services and Bell Atlantic Network Integration. Now
independent companies like INS can reap the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goliaths are now looking to the INS' for help in
delivering on these contracts,'' Keirstead said.
</P>
<P>
   And as put by Howard Anderson, the Yankee Group's managing
director, corporate technology managers are trying to add technical
expertise without adding full-time employees.
</P>
<P>
   But INS does more than perform subcontracting work for
brand-name telecommunications carriers. Ascend Communications, a
data network equipment maker, has used INS engineers to help deploy
Ascend-based networks that include equipment from other companies.
And Mastercard International hired INS to help Mastercard move its
headquarters to Purchase, N.Y., from New York City in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a number of challenges that went far beyond simply
relocating computers for 1,000 people,'' said Art Carapola,
Mastercard's vice-president for global internal technology. ``INS
was commissioned to provide the network expertise we were lacking
in-house at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Considering the unusually compressed schedule, as
well as the complexity of the network transition, I do not believe
we would have met our goals without INS.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The company that wins such praise from its clients was the
creation of Donald McKinney, one of the founders of Silicon
Graphics Inc. He use his textbook understanding of the inner
workings of Silicon Valley to create and build INS.
</P>
<P>
   First he turned to Sequoia Capital, the venture capital firm. He
wanted financing, but just as important, he wanted the blessing of
Donald Valentine, Sequoia's founder, who is also vice-chairman of
Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Once McKinney won support from Sequoia and Valentine, it was
relatively easy to convince Cisco, the leader in data networking,
to invest as well. But just as important, he got Cisco to begin
referring INS to its customers for installation and support
services.
</P>
<P>
   Once INS was on a solid footing, McKinney could step back. He is
still the company's chairman but has turned over the chief
executive's job to John Drew, a former Unisys executive. (In a sign
of just how small the networking industry really is, Bell Atlantic
first built its relationship with INS in part through a former
Unisys colleague of Drew's named Kevin DeNuccio, who helped found
Bell Atlantic Network Integration. DeNuccio is now an executive at
Cisco.)
</P>
<P>
   Cisco still owns about 8 percent of INS, which has a market
value of about $1.1 billion, while McKinney owns just over 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   INS compensates each of its 1,000 engineers at least partly in
stock. McKinney and Drew hope that the stock policy gives INS a
recruiting advantage over larger, slower-growing companies that are
trying to expand into the network consulting market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intellectual property goes home every night,'' McKinney
said. ``What we need to do is honor their requests and make them
wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   As put by Drew, ``Our focus and our people provide our
competitive advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is a lot of competition. Each of the
telecommunications carriers that INS serves as a client is also a
potential competitor. INS must also contend against consulting
companies including Andersen and KPMG Peat Marwick; computer
services operations including EDS; value-added resellers of
networking equipment including Entex and Vanstar, as well as the
growing consulting operations inside telecommunications equipment
vendors, including Lucent Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps INS' most intriguing competitor is a private
consulting company based in New York called Predictive Systems Inc.
Smaller, younger and even less well known than INS, Predictive is
perhaps the only company that focuses exclusively on the same sort
of network consulting as does INS. Among its clients are Qwest
Communications International, the upstart long-distance carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Belau, Predictive's president, said he was now
auditioning investment banks for an initial public offering.
Naturally, he says his company is better than INS. But if he
succeeds only in matching his West Coast competitor, he will have
done quite well, indeed.

ROD STEWART: CALCULATED FUN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANN POWERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ah, debauchery. It really doesn't make for a
sustainable life style, but those who gave themselves over to it
sure came up with some fine rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Stewart, who swooped down upon Madison Square Garden on
Friday and Saturday, was once the grand master of amiable abandon.
Now he's 53 and settled down with a supermodel and a career
marketing schmaltzy ballads and his own oldies. He has preserved
himself in the aspic of his good nature, and his continued stamina
is a marvel.
</P>
<P>
   He still likes to think about the bad times, though. His concert
on Friday night opened with ``Cigarettes and Alcohol,'' a song by
Oasis that he covers on his latest album, ``When We Were the New
Boys'' (Warner Brothers). That barroom stomper sounds like the ones
he recorded with the Faces in the early 1970s; by recording it and
``Rocks,'' by Primal Scream, he neatly reclaimed a style younger
bands had filched.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this silk-clad showman knows better than to bring back real
rock-and-roll excess, not so much because it would make a man of
his age look foolish _ Stewart has never feared foolishness _ but
because such displays have lost their cachet. The Gallagher
brothers of Oasis seem disgusting when they overdo things. It is
cooler to keep your nasty habits to yourself, or to render them
theatrical, the way Marilyn Manson or the reformed Courtney Love
does.
</P>
<P>
   The latter method is what Stewart opted for on Friday. It would
have been fun if he had let himself go just once, but his two-hour
show was the epitome of calculated fun. His band and set list could
have been determined by the principles of feng shui, the Chinese
philosophy of balancing elements.
</P>
<P>
   A virile, tattooed guitarist here, a Boyz II Men type on backing
vocals there, a glam-rock dude on keyboards and a drummer as
precise as a cyborg: Stewart's accompaniment provided him with
every useful pop trope. The music this collection of archetypes
produced stayed balanced and within bounds, the Broadway version of
the singer's ouevre.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart performed his array of raunchy sex odes and anthemic
tearjerkers as if he were going for a Tony. His costume changes
culminated with a yellow jacket that matched his Day-Glo socks. On
both knees for a melodramatic ``Tonight's the Night,'' wagging his
tail during ``Hot Legs,'' sprawled out and grinning at the end of
``Twistin' the Night Away,'' he humorously choreographed his
enthusiasm. To demonstrate how he had kept in such good shape, he
kicked soccer balls into the audience throughout the set.
</P>
<P>
   As for the voice that occasioned all this madness, it remains a
distinctively accessible instrument. The tenor famous for being
part rooster crow and part lover's croon tips toward screechiness
now, but Stewart managed a lovely falsetto on ``Have I Told You
Lately?'' and belted with gusto on the night's rockers. However
much he overindulged, he always cared for his vocal cords. Such
prudence is just what you'd expect from a man who so skillfully
turns excess into a routine.

EARLY RETURNS INDICATE RE-ELECTION OF CARDOSO IN BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: More to be filed) 
(mk) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Brazilian voters appeared to re-elect
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso in the first round of balloting
Sunday, thus maintaining the leadership of a country struggling
against economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In preliminary returns, Cardoso appeared to have defeated Luiz
Inacio Lula da Silva, the three-time presidential candidate of the
leftist Workers Party, with 56 percent of the vote, a far stronger
showing than polls initially predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Cabinet members gathering at the presidential palace in Brasilia
Sunday night called the vote a mandate for reform, which the
president is under national and international pressure to carry
out.
</P>
<P>
   With $30 billion having drained from federal reserves since
Russia's economic collapse in late August, and the Sao Paulo stock
market down more than 40 percent this year, the Brazilian
government has been somewhat paralyzed by the approach of
elections. It has been negotiating a bailout with the International
Monetary Fund, but has been unable to show progress on structural
reforms that would cut government expenses over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   But the waiting is probably not over yet. The size of his
victory strengthens Cardoso's hand for the politically sensitive
social security, civil service and tax overhauls ahead. But,
political analysts said, Congress will probably not convene to
consider painful economic reforms before important gubernatorial
runoffs on Oct. 25.
</P>
<P>
   With policy-makers at the meetings of the Group of Seven top
industrialized nations and the International Monetary Fund in
Washington seeking permanent solutions to ward off the volatility
that is threatening Brazil after devastating Asia and Russia,
Cardoso is expected to start taking steps to put Brazil's accounts
in order.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Carlos Alkimin, a political science professor at
Catholic University and chief of population studies at the
Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, said he did not
expect that Cardoso could make progress toward restructuring the
government before Oct. 25, because these measures would require
legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he can do is take measures on the administrative level to
cut costs, or to play with controls on currency,'' Alkimin said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gregg Smith, chief investment strategist at Prudential
Securities, said that financial markets were not expecting concrete
reforms from Brazil in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next thing everybody's going to be watching is whether
there is an IMF and World Bank package to support Brazil and
whether the Brazilians are starting to take actions to work on the
budget deficit,'' he said. ``If those two things look like they're
moving in the right direction, it will begin to calm financial
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's balloting was somewhat confused, with about half the
country voting on small shoebox-sized computers that elderly voters
had trouble mastering. Though electioneering was required to end
before polls opened, most candidates appeared to ignore the
prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   At Rocinha, in Rio de Janeiro, believed to be the largest slum
in South America with about 300,000 residents, palm-sized photos of
candidates fluttered like autumn leaves through the air and
carpeted the streets. People waited more than an hour to cast their
votes, with many supporting Cardoso for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Luiz Claudio Silveira, a 34-year-old horse trainer, said he
planned to vote for Cardoso, largely because he ended inflation.
``If you go to the supermarket, you can buy whatever you need
now,'' he said. ``Four years is not enough to change a country as
big as ours. I really believe in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rute Vicente Oliveira, a 48-year-old manicurist, also planned to
vote for Cardoso. She said that for most of her life, her family
lived in a lean-to, too poor to build a proper home. It was her
father's dream, she said, and he died before it was realized.
``Now, the house is almost done, it's almost completely in order,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilberto Manuel da Silva, 40, who owns an ice cream parlor, said
that he expected the economic adjustments that Cardoso announced
would hurt him personally, but he was prepared to sacrifice in
order to stabilize Brazil's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking more about the situation of the country,'' da
Silva said. ``With a stable money, our situation will get better.''

   MOSCOW _ If the Communist Party has its way _ and it has been
planning for months _ millions of Russians will take to the streets
on Wednesday for some of the biggest demonstrations in years.
</P>
<P>
   But now that Communists or politicians with the Communist stamp
of approval are running the country and its economy the question is
what the marchers will be demonstrating against.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin and his economic advisers were easy
targets two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin seems but a shadow of himself today, and his
advisers are gone. The Communists, who have undergone a sort of
resurgence by playing on the discontent, are working hard to cast
themselves as outsiders in the government that they help run _ and
to keep the focus of the protests on Wednesday on Yeltsin and his
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Even that strategy may backfire, however, because discontent
over Yeltsin does not necessarily translate into support for his
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   An adviser to the Communist Party leader, Gennadi Zyuganov, made
headlines not long ago when he called the new government bourgeois.
The characterization was striking, because the new prime minister,
Yevgeny Primakov, was one of Zyuganov's top choices for the post.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy prime minister in charge of the economy, Yuri
Maslyukov, is a Communist Party figure who once headed Gosplan, the
infamous central-planning program that helped bring the Soviet
Union to ruin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have slogans that are aimed against the government,''
the first secretary of the Moscow Communist Party committee,
Alexander Kuvayev, said in a recent interview. ``All the slogans
are aimed against the president and the economic course of the
country. Only the president can fully be blamed for the course that
has brought the country to this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Anger over Russia's fate, and their own, is drawing some
Russians back to Soviet-style slogans and old-style hostility
toward capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   The ardently pro-Communist newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya devoted
most of its front page on Thursday to what it said were the results
of a contest among readers for protest slogans.
</P>
<P>
   The entries ranged from catchy to kitschy, from, ``Legislator,
official, banker _ study the Constitution; the exam is Oct. 7,''
to, `` Imperialist! Help Russia return the exported capital, and we
will pay the debts at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has seen nothing approaching this sort of economic chaos
and despair since 1993, when hyperinflation swept the economy.
There is no real way of knowing whether the latest travails will
produce huge and ugly crowds or small, peaceful ones.
</P>
<P>
   A deputy editor and political analyst at a newsweekly, Itogi,
Masha Lipman, said the situation was not unlike that of 1993, when
Yeltsin sought, and won, a popular mandate in a referendum. He used
it to dissolve the Communist-dominated Parliament and increase his
own power.
</P>
<P>
   That led to an autumn showdown, the shelling of Parliament by
tanks and the total defeat, for the time being, of Yeltsin's
legislative opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can interpret this demonstration as a Communist mandate,
but I don't think they will act like Yeltsin,'' Ms. Lipman said.
``Support for the Communists is at its smallest level, maybe 20
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of 1,714 people that was released last week the
All-Russian Public Opinion Center said that nearly half the
population supported the idea of demonstrations against Yeltsin,
but that barely one-tenth were likely to participate in any way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is interested in any sort of struggle,'' Yuri Levada,
who heads the center, said in an interview. ``This is mainly a
general expression of a great wave of distrust of authorities,
mainly the president. He's the great scapegoat for all our sins.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There seems to be little enthusiasm for demonstrations of any
sort. Only a few thousand people turned out Sunday for the fifth
anniversary of the shelling of Parliament and Yeltsin's subsequent
triumph over the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party and the Federation of Independent Russian
Unions, a leftist organization that says it is the main sponsor of
the protests, predict that 9 million Russians will participate on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The government has vowed to keep order without resorting to
force. But it is concerned enough that it has summoned 11,000
police officers to patrol Moscow and 6,000 military troops to
intervene if violence erupts.
</P>
<P>
   Protests since 1993 have generally been tepid, a deep-seated
feeling here. Some demonstrations last week, more or less practice
runs, hinted at similarly dampened marches this year.

ST. PETERSBURG PHILHARMONIC: EVOKING THE PALL OF POLITBURO
CENSORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fear is not the best motivation for musical
composition, but all three pieces on the St. Petersburg
Philharmonic's program at Carnegie Hall on Friday night were
touched by it. The music was Shostakovich and Prokofiev, the two
most talented composers of the Soviet school and therefore the two
to suffer most at its hands.
</P>
<P>
   Yuri Temirkanov conducted this second of three programs.
Shostakovich's ``Festive'' Overture, his Second Violin Concerto and
the Prokofiev Seventh Symphony were all written after 1950 (Stalin
died in 1953), but none could be thought of as very new.
</P>
<P>
   The overture harvests every martial and folk dance mannerism
cultivated over the last 100 years. Brass blares for a while and
then everyone else engages in cheerful fast footwork. Cliches they
are, but they are cliches in the hands of a master. Surprise often
interrupts the familiar turns of phrase. This brief and
Politburo-pleasing piece is one of those moments when Shostakovich
seems to have had all the sarcasm scared out of him. It returns
plentifully, however, in the violin concerto, a difficult piece
played brilliantly here by Gidon Kremer.
</P>
<P>
   The three movements offer little happiness; nor do they make a
pretense of beauty in the usual sense. The textures are hard and
nasty. The tone is depressive if not downright despondent, and yet
one finds an eloquence. Masquerading as high spirits, the busy
finale reminds one of a rustic dancer fighting the effects of a
hangover.
</P>
<P>
   The Prokofiev symphony, one of his last pieces, is depressing
for other reasons. Its good cheer and soaring sentiments, none of
which would hurt a fly, have been purged of the bitter wit that
made a younger Prokofiev so interesting, and which Shostakovich
managed to horde until the end. The Allegretto is wobbly waltz
time; the finale is embarrassingly sincere. The Seventh has lovely
touches, but all the fight has gone out of it.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to describe the sound of the St. Petersburg
because it differs so vastly from any other orchestra I know. The
word ``rich'' springs to mind when talking about the string and
brass playing, but this is not richness in the sense of
mega-caloric food. Rather the sound is deep without being heavy,
powerful but not tough, alive but never nervous. The more this
interesting orchestra plays in the West the more it is going to
lose its hometown quality, so I suggest hearing these musicians
while they still represent one specific place and no other.

WHIRLING DERVISHES OF TURKEY: TWIRLING SKIRTS ON BRIDGE TO THE
DIVINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The form looks simple. Imbuing it with depth and
meaning is something else. This lesson came through clearly in a
return appearance at City Center on Friday night by the group that
has toured nationally in recent years as the Whirling Dervishes of
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Like a repeated abstract design in an oriental carpet, the
geometric patterns and repetitive turns of the dervishes carry a
symbolic meaning. In the ceremony, the dervish seeks union with the
divine and does so through meditation in motion.
</P>
<P>
   This group of fine classical musicians, singers and dervishes
from Konya, Turkey (the Mevlevi Ensemble of the Mevlana Culture and
Art Foundation), presented by the World Music Institute, is a
strong antidote to the tourist's view of dervish rituals. The
program's integration of music and dance (whirling) emphasizes how
the Sufi order founded by Mevlana Jalaluddin Rumi (1207-1273) fuses
the devotional and the artistic in praise of God.
</P>
<P>
   For all its attention to artistry (poems and music), the
ceremony is not an outright performance. As such it differs,
interestingly, from one given last month by La Tannoura, a
government-sponsored group of dervishes and musicians from Egypt
who were seen in Lyons, France. There the ceremony was a folk
entertainment, with the dervishes raising multicolored skirts above
their heads, sometimes recalling spinning tops.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the Turkish group from Konya seek the theatricalization
that the Royal Swedish Ballet will show in May at the John F.
Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington when it
presents Jean Borlin's 1920 ballet, ``Dervishes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish dervishes are more austere, but not joyless. In a
presentation that preserves a sense of purity, the program set the
tone with haunting recitations from the Koran by Kani Karaca, a
blind drummer and singer.
</P>
<P>
   The musicians, playing traditional Turkish instruments, make
room for instrumental solos. A break with tradition in the first
half of the program introduced three American women, Mevlevi
disciples, who whirled briefly. The master of ceremonies was Shaikh
Kabir Helminski, American representative of the Mevlevi order.
</P>
<P>
   The dervishes, he said, were not performers, and viewers were
invited as guests. In the strict structure that followed, the seven
kneeling dervishes rose to shed their black cloaks and stepped
forward in tall hats and white robes. Their arms crossed and then
rose into the traditional position of the right palm facing the sky
and the left toward the ground: the dervish as conduit of divine
energy.
</P>
<P>
   Turning always to the left with one knee raised, each
participant moved in a circle as he whirled, sometimes gently
nudged back into place by an ambulatory dance master. The
accompanying musical segments could end abruptly, but the sense of
resolution, symbolized by a circular procession, was felt at the
end.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: SEX ON THE BRAIN, ALL OVER LONDON 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ ``The obsession that taunts us all, Sex.'' So speaks
the doomed, noble Phedre of her illicit, ruinous passion for her
stepson in the stark new West End production of Racine's tragedy,
which _ Oops. Scratch that. That's not Phedre talking. That's a
headline that appeared in a tabloid here the day after the
videotapes of President Clinton's testimony about his illicit,
ruinous passion for a White House intern were made public.
</P>
<P>
   What Phedre, played by an intense Diana Rigg from a new
translation by Ted Hughes, says is, ``Venus fastened on me like a
tiger.'' This is not to be confused with what the rugby star Will
Carling, in articles that temporarily knocked Clinton off the front
pages, said about his love for the late Princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Nor with what the chastity-challenged Ado Annie sings in the
vibrant, smash-hit revival of ``Oklahoma!'' at the Royal National
Theater here. Nor, for that matter, with what those working-class
men with gold chains and half-buttoned shirts (who appear to have
modeled their look on that of the Brooklyn street studs in the new
assembly-line stage adaptation of the movie ``Saturday Night
Fever'') had to say about their compulsive promiscuity on a recent
chat show.
</P>
<P>
   Has there ever been a moment, at least since the days of
Shakespeare, when what is seen in British theaters so literally
reflected the fixations of the country, regardless of class or
intellectual persuasion? Whether in institutional or commercial
theaters, in the claustrophobic studios of London's fringes or the
shabby splendor of the West End, the subject, more often than not,
is sex and the havoc it wreaks in the lives of ordinary and
extraordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   Despite enough bared bums, breasts and genitalia onstage to
stock a year's run of ``Oh! Calcutta!'' the overall effect is
hardly salacious, to use a word much favored by journalists here.
There are only faint echoes of the titters and smirks of standard
British sex farces with titles like ``Run for Your Wife.'' Dramas
of infidelity remain a staple, but minus the four-hankie sentiment
of a Terrence Rattigan.
</P>
<P>
   The mood instead runs from aloof, condemning cynicism to
scathing anger. The new templates of the genre are Patrick Marber's
wildly acclaimed ``Closer,'' a brutal look at an internecine
romantic quadrangle (headed for Broadway next year), and Mark
Ravenhill's notorious ``Shopping and ... '' (seen in New York last
season), works in which carnal knowledge, explicitly documented, is
unsatisfying and unenlightening.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest ticket in London is David Hare's ice-cold reworking
of ``La Ronde,'' by Arthur Schnitzler. This is the two-character
show in which the movie star Nicole Kidman has made her London
stage debut to delirious reviews, playing five women who look for
love in all the wrong places, the point being that no place is the
right place.
</P>
<P>
   The single most unsettling, and representative, image to emerge
from my 10 days of playgoing here comes from Ravenhill's latest
offering, ``Handbag,'' in which a young woman is digitally brought
to orgasm, by a man who might as well be a vibrator, while standing
up and wearing a mask that suggests an extraterrestrial pig. She is
transformed by sex, for sure, but not into anything human.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not forget that for centuries England has been dancing an
uneasy waltz between tight-lipped puritanism (think Oliver
Cromwell) and open-mouthed hedonism (think Christine Keeler), nor
that the sort of sexual shenanigans now tainting the American
presidency are nothing new to the British. In living memory, the
country has seen a government unseated and its monarchy threatened
by such activities.
</P>
<P>
   Both phenomena are currently represented on the boards with the
West End production of ``A Letter of Resignation,'' Hugh
Whitemore's look at the Profumo scandal of the 1960s, and the
delectably silly and oddly affecting ``Love Upon the Throne''
(written by Patrick Barlow and performed by Barlow and John Ramm,
the entire company of the self-styled National Theater of Brent),
in which two middle-aged, bespectacled men in business suits
awkwardly enact the troubled courtship and marriage of Prince
Charles and Lady Diana.
</P>
<P>
   There's a genuine warmth to ``Throne,'' something notably absent
from much of the rest of London's popular theatrical fare. This
doesn't mean, however, that audience and critical response to
consciously chilly productions has been comparably detached. The
English clearly like to have their cake and drool over it, too.
Just consider the reviews garnered by Ms. Kidman in the Donmar
Warehouse production of ``The Blue Room,'' staged by the
omnipresent Sam Mendes, with Iain Glen (a classical actor who,
surprisingly, tends toward cartoonishness here) playing the other
halves of a series of erotically linked couples.
</P>
<P>
   That Ms. Kidman gives an exceptionally proficient performance,
nimbly shifting accents and embodying characters from a Cockney
streetwalker to a self-dramatizing, self-adoring stage star, was
duly noted by most critics. But what really wowed 'em was the
perfection of her body, seen in various states of undress and
briefly in the altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The Evening Standard, which knows its priorities, wedged a brief
critical appraisal of the play beneath a splashy assessment of Ms.
Kidman's physique. The reviewer for The Daily Telegraph called the
performance ``pure theatrical Viagra.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe, if you're stimulated by the idea of copulation as a
purely mechanical activity, something wittily emphasized here by
the supertitles that tabulate the time consumed by each sexual act.
The daisy chain of couplings in Hare's rather perfunctory
modernization of Schnitzler's classic is a joyless cycle of users
and the used, and it lacks the depths of passion and character that
infuse the playwright's best works. Unlike the original ``La
Ronde,'' this adaptation gives off about as much Weltschmerz as the
lurid neon lighting in which it is bathed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Audiences seeking to recover from the frostbite of ``The Blue
Room'' might find it at the National Theater, the home of Trevor
Nunn's triumphant revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein's
``Oklahoma!'' In this miraculously fresh-feeling production, which
moves to the West End in January with (one prays) a Broadway
engagement to follow, raging hormones may get people into trouble,
but they are also a source of exuberant, unquenchable life.
</P>
<P>
   This sensibility matches the robust, pioneer spirit of the
show's world of farmers and cowboys. The production has been
restaged in ways that go beyond the usual respectful museum-piece
revivals, with vital new choreography by Susan Stroman replacing
the fabled dance numbers of Agnes de Mille. Yet it comes closer
than any version I've seen in creating a sense of how thrillingly
novel the original production must have been.
</P>
<P>
   Every song, even the chestnut of an opening number, ``Oh, What a
Beautiful Mornin','' has a feeling of conversational spontaneity.
The show, populated with largely unknown but vigorously talented
actors, seems propelled by young sexual urges uncertainly groping
for an outlet, finding blissful release in dance. The more troubled
eroticism of the show is given appropriately shadowy life, most
notably in Shuler Hensley's compellingly brutish Jud.
</P>
<P>
   The sexual ambivalence of the virginal Laury, reconceived as an
overalls-wearing tomboy, registers more pointedly than ever. The
threat of disruptive violence and the possibility of
disappointments and losses to come are never far from the surface.
This acknowledgment of darkness only enhances the energy-charged
light thrown off by the ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   A similar exuberance could be found in the Globe Theater's
brassy interpretation of ``A Mad World, My Masters,'' an early
(1605) ribald comedy by Thomas Middleton. The Globe has had a huge
popular success, and this production makes it easy to see why.
</P>
<P>
   As directed by Sue Lefton, ``Mad World,'' which concluded its
run last month, was a gaudy, nonstop roundelay of earthy erotic
entanglements, full of actorly adrenaline that fed off the rowdy
audience. The play, whose characters include a courtesan who has
sold her virginity 15 times, is a reminder that a cynical take on
sexual foibles is nothing new to the British theater and that such
cynicism could also be fun. Also on hand is a debauchee whose
oxymoronic name speaks volumes about the English temperament:
Penitent Brothel.
</P>
<P>
   In the title role of the Almeida Theater's production of
Racine's ``Phedre,'' directed by Jonathan Kent at the Albery
Theater, Diana Rigg appears to be possessed by a succubus of some
sort, and believe you me, she's not happy about it. This fiercely
intelligent actress creates a stinging portrait of a woman whose
loins are directly at odds with her fine mind. Desire is a cancer,
and Ms. Rigg's contorted postures and bitter, enraged delivery
suggest a pain as much physical as emotional.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the evening is too solemnly chic by half, with Maria
Bjornson's elegant setting and costumes bringing to mind a fashion
shoot by Horst. Kent, who collaborated with Ms. Rigg on ``Medea,''
is not, to put it mildly, a relaxed director. Here, he has his
actors flattening themselves against the walls to express fear and
sprinkling themselves with water in vain attempts to cool their
characters' passions.
</P>
<P>
   The approach verges on camp, particularly in Toby Stephens'
tremulous, lip-biting performance as the unwilling object of
Phedre's affection. But Julian Glover is first-rate as Theseus, a
strutting king whose bluster deflates into bewildered grief, and
the blistering war against eroticism waged by Ms. Rigg's Phedre is
unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   The contemporary characters in Ravenhill's ``Handbag,'' at the
Lyric Studio in Hammersmith, don't put up much of a struggle
against their carnal appetites. This messy but intermittently
powerful play juxtaposes two plots: the modern-day tale of two
couples, one gay and one lesbian, who decide to rear a child
together and a speculative version of the history of the misplaced
baby in ``The Importance of Being Earnest.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the age of repression nor that of promiscuity makes good
parents. The people in Ravenhill's very bleak world are selfish
creatures with short attention spans and muddled, conflicted
notions of what it means to take care of someone else. Directed by
Nick Philippou, the production has the subtlety of a
fire-and-brimstone revival meeting. But the six-member cast brings
a fearless, raw conviction to the evening, and unlike ``The Blue
Room,'' ``Handbag'' locates the sharp pang of emptiness in its
terminally dissatisfied characters. Even in the midst of vividly
simulated sexual acts, no one has a good time.
</P>
<P>
   The Prince and Princess of Wales, as incarnated in the ``Beyond
the Fringe''-style antics of ``Love Upon the Throne,'' don't get
much pleasure out of life, either. England's most closely watched
example of marital infidelity in recent years is rendered as a tale
told by idiots, two bumblers of high aspirations and modest talent,
named Desmond Oliver Dingle and Raymond Box (the alter egos of
Barlow and Ramm).
</P>
<P>
   But while they tend to get crucial details like the names of the
royal family hilariously wrong, this hapless pair somehow gets the
sad core of Charles and Diana's ill-starred relationship right.
Beneath the farcical high jinks, there's a current of wistfulness
about one couple's inability to connect that taps into what made
this royal marriage such a gripping and disturbing soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, although a bed scene between Diana and one of
her lovers is promised, it never actually takes place. When Raymond
Box learns the scene has been cut, he lets out a cyclonic sigh of
relief. After more than a week of coital theater in London, I fully
shared his feelings.

`LATE AUGUST, EARLY SEPTEMBER': PENSIVE AND SENSUAL IN THE FACE OF
MORTALITY
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Though the subject of mortality is at the heart of
``Late August, Early September,'' this latest film by Olivier
Assayas studiously avoids an air of life-or-death urgency. Assayas,
a filmmaker capable of both subtle intensity (``Wild Reeds'') and
sneaky wit (``Irma Vep''), this time takes a tastefully oblique
approach to his material. Though his film centers on the death of a
middle-aged man and its effect on the friends around him, Assayas
concentrates on myopic egos and changing relationships rather than
morbidity or pain. The film shows at least as much interest in
texture _ smoking, eating, shrugging, kissing _ as in fully
grasping its characters' malaise.
</P>
<P>
   The ailing man is Adrien (Francois Cluzet), a serious writer of
overlooked books, but he is not the film's main focus.
Interestingly, Assayas concentrates on Adrien's friend Gabriel
(Mathieu Amalric), whose equilibrium is in flux during the course
of the story. Always slightly intimidated by Adrien and tacitly
competitive with him, Gabriel responds in complex ways to his
friend's ill health.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gabriel is also diffidently involved with two
women: Jenny (Jeanne Balibar), the steady old flame he's in the
process of leaving, and Anne (Virginie Ledoyen), the free spirit
with whom he's having an affair.
</P>
<P>
   These players seem pensive, sensual and attractive in ways that
help deflect attention from the film's discreetly soapy side.
Amalric, a rumpled, perpetually astonished-looking actor with a
seductive gleam in his eye, is memorable for having played a
similar role in Arnaud Desplechin's wiser and more passionate ``My
Sex Life ... or How I Got Into an Argument.'' Ms. Balibar, who also
appeared in ``My Sex Life,'' brings warmth and quirky charm to the
lonely woman who manages to remain everybody's friend.
</P>
<P>
   Cluzet is as grave and thoughtful as the screenplay makes him,
though perhaps not as cruel (Arsinee Khanjian plays his bitter
ex-lover). And Ms. Ledoyen, in decadent bohemian mode here, is one
of the great beauties of contemporary French cinema. ``Do I look
like a bimbo from Paris?'' her Anne asks Gabriel coyly as he brings
her to dinner in the country with too many of Jenny's old friends.
This is the sort of film in which even Anne's kinky streak is given
a pretty gloss, and in which she smokes soulfully while announcing,
``I don't love you,'' to a man with whom she's just had a
supposedly wild encounter. ``I know,'' he answers, eating a chicken
drumstick as food for thought.
</P>
<P>
   Assayas gives the film a self-consciously natural look (with
hand-held camera work). And he structures it as a series of
indirect glimpses into these people and the various entanglements
in their lives. The effect is meant to be enhanced through
juxtapositions (he has compared this to David Hockney's fragmented
landscapes made of Polaroids), but it often stays muted and remote.
</P>
<P>
   The film is most insightful about the mix of love and rivalry
between Adrien and Gabriel, and the effect of a friend's mortal
illness on a 40-ish man who still clings to some of his adolescent
streak. (``You die and you're a genius,'' Gabriel says cruelly
after the fact.) The endless round of romantic standoffs seems more
mundane and mechanical, with exhaustive talk of the ``You dumped
Jean-Paul really hard'' variety.

   If Assayas doesn't always transport his film's events beyond the
all too commonplace, his understatement can also yield moments of
quiet simplicity. Adrien's illness is made most affecting not by
outright grief but by his straightforward remark: ``You're all
alone with what goes on inside your body.''

SPEAKING FOR THE PRESIDENT, WITH KNOWING HUMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Joe Lockhart is realistic about his new job as
President Clinton's press secretary. ``I'm sure something horrible
will happen'' right away, he said, in this his first full week on
the job.
</P>
<P>
   His predecessor, Mike McCurry, who defended the administration
through eight months of scandal, spent day after day telling
reporters that he could not say, did not know and did not want to
know much about the president's relationship with a former intern.
And that he would not parse _ repeat, would not parse _ that
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Even in his final days in the post, McCurry had to explain the
difference between covering up a third-rate burglary and concealing
a third-rate romance. Still, McCurry did keep White House reporters
laughing, and in his farewell performance last Thursday, most
applauded him for so charmingly deflecting their questions.
</P>
<P>
   And like McCurry _ who insists it was his deputy, Lockhart, who
came up with many of his best lines _ the president's new chief
mouthpiece is inclined to fall back on humor as the scandal
coverage continues.
</P>
<P>
   One particularly well-received comic riff came after the
president's latest trip to Moscow, where Lockhart overslept and
missed his ride to Belfast on Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   When the press secretary-elect finally caught up with his group
in Northern Ireland, he offered a mock apology for his late arrival
in the words Clinton had used to explain his relationship with the
former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky _ words that, up until
that point in the trip, had not provided a lot of hearty yucks for
the president's gloomy entourage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take responsibility for my own actions,'' the tardy Lockhart
told reporters. ``I deeply regret it. I'm dealing with the people I
have hurt the most. And I'll have nothing further to say.''
</P>
<P>
   He said later that he thought it was worth making a little fun
of himself and even the president in an effort to lighten the mood
on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Lunching outdoors at a restaurant near the White House last
week, Lockhart immediately made light of his new situation, asking
for a table in the shade and muttering, ``I'll be sweating enough
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, when he spied the president's personal
secretary, Betty Currie, of grand jury fame, walking down the
street, they both cracked up and waved like it had been years.
</P>
<P>
   But, facing tough times and a generally tough crowd, with
McCurry a very tough act to follow, Lockhart also communicated a
proper appreciation of what he is up against.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a problem now after the president acknowledged
misleading'' the country about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky,
he said. ``We have to build back that trust.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the related challenge of how to focus the
public on administration initiatives that he said are typically
reported in sentences that begin, ``In an attempt to change the
subject ...,'' or ``In an attempt to appear presidential ...''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lockhart, who has worked in both politics and journalism
since college, did campaign for this promotion _ a position that
friends said he had been preparing for all his adult life. Kind of
like the president?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if at 14 he shook Walter Cronkite's hand and
there's video of it, but, yeah,'' said Lockhart's friend Dayton
Duncan, who worked with him on both the Mondale and Dukakis
campaigns, referring to famous footage of a young Bill Clinton,
student leader, meeting President John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart was born into a family of journalists. His late father,
Raymond Lockhart, and mother, Ann Teahan Lockhart, both worked for
NBC News in New York.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Laura Logan, is also a journalist who quit a senior
position with ABC to care for the couple's 4-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   At 39, with graying hair and a sturdy build, Lockhart is a New
York Mets and Bruce Springsteen fan who comes across like a regular
guy you would probably enjoy having a beer with.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Logan says one of the premier challenges of her husband's
new job will be the longer hours that will make it harder to get
home to read their daughter, Clare, her favorite bedtime story,
``Little Bear.''
</P>
<P>
   White House colleagues note that this is the rare instance of a
nice-guy understudy who got the starring role by working hard.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he has not always been warm and fuzzy with the press, and
must break out of the ``bad cop'' role that he played opposite
McCurry's ``good cop.'' The role of campaign press secretary often
requires a sharper and more partisan tongue than the White House
job, and even after he went to work as McCurry's deputy, it was
Lockhart who invariably called reporters at all hours to complain
about negative stories, and sometimes lost his temper in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll have to go through the transition of no longer playing
pit bull to Mike's golden retriever rolling over and letting you
scratch his belly,'' said Dee Dee Myers, who preceded McCurry as
Clinton's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart says he knows he will need to take a step back in the
top job. ``The best press secretaries can detach,'' he says, ``and
I still have some work to do on that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And there are other challenges even beyond managing the
continuing scandal and meeting the standard set by McCurry: He's
got to prove that he has the same access to the president that
McCurry enjoyed _ when he wanted it. (The president and Lockhart
have a good but not terribly close relationship, by all accounts,
and Lockhart is not confused about its limits, referring to it as
``a business relationship,'' and saying, ``I'm the hired help and
glad to be the hired help.'')
</P>
<P>
   Also, he is not as experienced in foreign policy as McCurry, who
came to the White House from the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   In his favor is his experience in this White House, and his
years as a journalist for three television networks, which have
given him an unusual understanding of the news profession, how it
works and does not work. ``People in my business are quick to judge
the motives of the journalist,'' he said. ``But I understand how
random the business is.''
</P>
<P>
   After McCurry, whom he had known on the Mondale campaign,
recruited him as chief spokesman for Clinton's 1996 campaign, he
signed on, he said, because of a basic ideological compatibility
with the president.
</P>
<P>
   And now that he has McCurry's job, other former presidential
press secretaries expressed not only sympathy for his difficult
assignment, but confidence in his ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's good, with a nice mix of humor and rough-and-tumble, and
nobody's going to blame him if things don't go well,'' said George
Stephanopoulos, the former Clinton adviser who rates his own tenure
as a White House briefer as ``no good.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlin Fitzwater, the former Bush and Reagan press secretary,
offered this view: ``It's the greatest job in the world and worth
taking no matter how much trouble your president is in. Now, you
may die in the job, it may ruin your life, and your reputation. But
it still will have been the greatest experience of your life.''

FOSTER CAN FILL PLAYMAKER'S ROLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If his performance eventually meets his potential,
if he one day joins Freeman McNeil, Gaston Green, Karim
Abdul-Jabbar and Skip Hicks in the UCLA tailback pantheon, perhaps
he'll call Saturday the game that started it all.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman DeShaun Foster showed his stuff against Washington
State _ the strength and speed that made him one of the nation's
top prep runners last year, the vision and balance that could make
him one of the nation's top college runners in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
   In UCLA's 49-17 victory, Foster gained 185 all-purpose yards. He
rushed for 94, caught passes for 14 more, returned punts for 34 and
kickoffs for 60.
</P>
<P>
   Were some of his yards against Washington State's second-team
defense? Yes. Does it matter? Not a lick.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made one move,'' UCLA offensive coordinator Al Borges said,
marveling. ``There was a safety blitz, (Foster) was trapped in the
hole, and he left the guy in his shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster's voice is soft as his play is loud. Nestled in a far
corner of UCLA's locker room _ with Cade McNown a few feet to the
right and Jermaine Lewis a few to the left _ Foster admitted that
after six weeks he finally feels comfortable with the offense and
his role in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting better with the speed of the game and knowing the
offense,'' he said. ``The first couple games, I was hesitant. I
wasn't hitting the holes as fast as I should. Now I'm just
running.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins need it. Oh, do they. The next two weeks might
determine their season. Conquer Arizona and Oregon, and they're on
course for a New Year's in Pasadena or Tempe. Lose both, and they
probably seal a second-tier bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Foster is essential to their success _ both as Freddie
Mitchell's replacement on returns and as a ballcarrier. The
tailback rotation of Foster, Lewis and Keith Brown sounds great.
Against Washington State, it looked great. But in the biggest
games, against the best teams, UCLA needs its playmakers, and
Foster is a playmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid could be a phenom before he leaves,'' Borges said.
``He's that skilled. He's tough to tackle and he has great
vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster is one of several true freshmen who must contribute
during the Arizona-Oregon doubleheader. Nose guard Ken Kocher
(sprained ankle) and linebacker Robert Thomas (broken hand) are
critical to the defense reaching its potential. Both are expected
to play more as their injuries heal.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the veterans immune from introspection. McNown must
improve on his 52.5 completion percentage the last two games. The
dropped passes must end. UCLA had 11 penalties against Washington
State, 29 in three games; that won't cut it. The defensive line
must generate a pass rush so the cornerbacks aren't left in single
coverage. The special teams must continue to make plays.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the coaches have plenty to teach. If the Bruins don't
eliminate mistakes, their winning streak will end at 13 games
Saturday night in Arizona Stadium, where they haven't won in 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our margin for error will be a heck of a lot less,'' Borges
said. ``We've got to become more disciplined.'' &QL;

<P>
   Cumulative GPA: 3.09

<P>
   Quarterback _ Best ball of the day was Drew Bennett's touchdown.
Cade McNown's passes floated as if he had mechanical difficulty.
Better get it corrected this week. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Running backs _ Jermaine Lewis played like a No. 1 back trying
to clear his name. So did DeShaun Foster. Are there enough carries
to go around? Grade: B+

no sacks and more pancakes than IHOP. Now, about those penalties.
Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line _ Only six tackles, but that's deceiving. UCLA
played most of the game with just two linemen because of Wazu's
spread formation. This week: Get healthy. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers _ Best game of the season for LBs, especially
ubiquitous Tony White. Ryan Nece and Ali Azziz came off the bench
and created havoc. One request: more Robert Thomas. Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Defensive backs - First-time starters Tod McBride and Ryan
Roques avoided killer mistakes. Marques Anderson played with
spirit. If they could just clone Larry Atkins. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Special Teams _ Chris Sailer, still without a field goal, boomed
his kickoffs. Good returns from DeShaun Foster, and TWO blocked
punts. Stop the presses! Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Coaching: _ From pregame speech to deferring coin toss, nickel
defense, blocked punts and 32-point win, a solid job all around.
But 11 penalties will doom them in Tucson. Grade: A-

FROM ROMANTIC-COMEDY SIDELINES TO GLARING SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The thing about the people in ``Unmade Beds,''
Nicholas Barker's docu-narrative about four New Yorkers searching
for love and marriage, sex and companionship, or the money that sex
and companionship can secure, is that they are the kind of people
that movies about romance have always relegated to the sidelines.
They don't have the physical glamour or charisma that makes us
eager to believe that the leading man and woman will find each
other (and therefore happiness) against all narrative odds.
</P>
<P>
   Barker's leads are real people, characters in a highly stylized
film. But it is easy to see the roles they would have played in
romantic comedies and dramas of the last 50 years. They would have
been cast as the sidekicks, the foils who get the plot leavings.
The two women would be seen as infinitely less desirable than the
leading lady. One is fat, which puts the emphasis on pathos; one is
visibly working class, which puts the emphasis on wisecracks
jauntily uttered in a broad neighborhood accent.
</P>
<P>
   The men would be similarly cast, but there would be a touch of
rivalry in their relations with the leading man. They would court
the top girl, but to no avail. One is sweet and even playful, but
not sexy; the other is self-centered, with a touch _ make that an
all-enveloping layer _ of sleaze.
</P>
<P>
   The gilded stars are gone now, and so is the protective
coloration of fiction. ``Unmade Beds'' is certainly artful _ a
little smugly so, with its repeated device of framing people
through apartment windows as they dress, undress or (occasionally)
make love. Barker, a British television and radio producer, shaped
the script from conversations he had in 1996 and 1997 with his
subjects. (Or are they better described as his objects?)
</P>
<P>
   They are very conscious of their roles as characters here, and
they deserve their billing, which reads: ``And Starring as
Themselves: Brenda Monte, Aimee Copp, Mikey Russo and Michael De
Stefano.'' Good nonfiction has to be as carefully shaped as good
fiction, and I'm not bothered at all by this artifice. ``Unmade
Beds'' is a set of cinematic memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   And each has just one subject _ the desperate search for a mate
in a city of equally desperate strangers. Ranging in age from their
late 20s to late 40s or early 50s (the two older ones don't
specify), all four people do the same things. They advertise in the
personals and answer them. They go on disappointing to mortifying
dates that we never witness. We hear their pre-date hopes and
anxieties and witness their post-date depressions. They mock, they
weep, they brood; they pull out every available emotional defense,
from cynicism to dogged ``the sun will come out tomorrow''
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Michael De Stefano would be the ineffectual suitor in an old
movie. He is earnest, rueful and 5-feet-4-inches tall. He insists
upon telling women his height in advance (truth in advertising, he
says, a tad grimly) and finds that they usually don't want to meet
him. (Women who insist that they want to date nice men don't, he
tells us: they give it away to jerks.)
</P>
<P>
   Aimee Copp is the standard good friend, the one who always sends
the leading lady off to the leading man (risk everything, she
says), and is left alone in the little flat they once shared as
bachelor girls. She is a disturbing blend of vigor and pathos, and
she is funny telling us that at 28, with a good job and health
insurance, she should certainly be a bargain to all the 40-year-old
losers she meets who have neither. She has just split up with her
last boyfriend, a cabdriver in his 40s who liked her to wear
leather and use a whip when they had sex. And she is funny when she
lets out a raucous giggle and says: ``I mean, it's pretty
embarrassing. I was dumped by a submissive.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is humiliating when her slim friend, Lori, tells her she
must go to a personal dating service or lose a lot of weight, and
when the members of her conventional Midwestern family assure her
that they will support her if she decides to become a single
mother. She takes it as a sign that they have given up all hope
that she will ever find a husband. Her interpretation is probably
correct.
</P>
<P>
   Mikey Russo is the type of seedy playboy who always gets his
sexual comeuppance eventually. Mikey brings old-fashioned words
like wolf and, alas, even pig to mind, with his talk about dating
only beautiful women _ no ``mutts'' for him, just beauties _ and
his view that while he is no Paul Newman or Robert Redford, he is a
Jack Nicholson or Harvey Keitel type. He has his tricks ready
whenever he meets a ``mutt''; he gets a friend to ring his beeper,
pleads a work emergency, pays for the woman's drink and gives her
taxi fare.
</P>
<P>
   But his payback moment is awful to watch. He relates how he met
a woman for dinner after what seemed to be a good telephone
conversation and took her to a very expensive restaurant, where, at
the evening's end, she told him she would be embarrassed to
introduce him to her friends because he wasn't high up enough on
the corporate ladder. She is a judge. And what is he? We've heard
him say he wrote screenplays, mostly for television dramas. No, he
admits, that is what he tells women. He does write screenplays. But
he has never sold one.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to gloat. By this time, the round of search and hope,
search and reject or search and psychically destroy is so endless
we feel we're in a world that is the romantic equivalent of a
nuclear waste dump. Hollywood's classic romantic comedies
flourished during an economic depression. The depression hanging
over the nation now is sexual and psychological.
</P>
<P>
   The only one who triumphs is the utterly antiromantic Brenda
Monte, a divorcee with a va-va-va-voom figure (at one point she
displays and briskly itemizes all of its major virtues and minor
flaws) and a mouthful of buoyant wisecracks. You can always find
sex, Brenda says. What she wants is a man who will give her enough
money to pay her debts in exchange for as little sex and
companionship as possible. It is Brenda who manages to generate
real star power and turn a narrative that could be pitiful or
cynical into something with comic hopefulness. Brenda knows how to
improvise.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, here is what is so unsettling about ``Unmade Beds'':
You can distance yourself from it in all sorts of ways _ ``I'm much
more successful and attractive''; ``I'm married with children'';
``I put personal ads in The New York Review of Books, not The
Village Voice or The Free Press.'' But you have friends who are or
have been just as desperate, you remember perfectly well when you
were and perhaps you dread a time when you might be again. And you
also know that even if they find mates after the camera stops,
their fantasies may still go unmet. There are all kinds of unhappy
endings.

ELLIOTT SMITH: SOUNDS OF COMFORT FOR THE COLLEGIATE SET 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Elliott Smith has been performing for the last few
years alone with his acoustic guitar, singing in a quiet, wispy
voice. But he is no folk singer; he is, instead, a pop craftsman
who rethinks structure with every song.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has hooked up with a band, Quasi, who played its own set
and backed him up at Tramps on Saturday night. (Quasi's guitarist
and keyboardist, Sam Coomes, used to be with Smith in Heatmiser,
their late-1980s band in Portland, Ore.) The merger pushes Smith's
songs toward their true roots, even as it trades away some
subtlety.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is a fan of the Beatles, the Beach Boys and the more
obscure groups who, particularly in the 1960s, concealed unlikely
chord changes and uncompromising lyrics behind graceful melodies.
He uses many of the Beatles' trademark devices, among them the
bounce of British music-hall rhythms and chords that turn from
major to minor and back.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he is no throwback. True to his collegiate 1990s audience,
he sings about drinking, drugs, failure and love gone wrong;
sometimes he lashes out, and sometimes he calmly observes people
going under. And the music, like a drug itself, provides the
illusion of comfort.
</P>
<P>
   On Smith's new album, ``XO'' (Dreamworks/Geffen), the
arrangements use largely acoustic instruments with a band
materializing now and then. With Quasi, however, the songs were
Merseybeat all the way, with Smith strumming an electric guitar and
Janet Weiss on drums and Coomes on bass kicking up sturdy midtempo
rock, cruising easily through the hidden complexities of Smith's
tunes. Most of the songs were from ``XO'' and Smith's previous
album, ``Either/Or'' (Kill Rock Stars); he didn't play ``Miss
Misery,'' the song written for the movie ``Good Will Hunting'' and
nominated for an Academy Award.
</P>
<P>
   The harder arrangements made Smith shift his voice from the Art
Garfunkel tone of his solo performances to something with more
backbone, bringing out the sullen defiance in lyrics like ``I'm
never going to become what you became.''
</P>
<P>
   But the band risked making Smith sound simply like a Beatles
imitator, closing off the alternatives he produced on his album and
limiting the arrangements a fan can imagine when he performs by
himself. Smith did play a few songs alone _ on electric guitar, not
acoustic _ and they became a little more tender; he saved ``Say
Yes,'' one of his few optimistic songs, to play as a solo, keeping
it tentative.
</P>
<P>
   Quasi, which performed as a duo and in some songs with Smith on
bass, played more aggressive, equally tuneful pop songs with two
main subjects: the dehumanization of working people and the
precariousness of love.
</P>
<P>
   Coomes, on keyboards, propelled the songs with steady repeating
chords in the style of mid-1960s garage rock, and then veered into
avant-garde dissonance, the chaos from which the order of pop could
emerge. Ms. Weiss was pure muscle on the drums and a sweet descant
when she sang. If things are headed downhill fast, as Quasi's
lyrics insist, at least there's something to hum during the
collapse.

   SAN JUAN CHAMULA, Mexico _ Local elections that the government
was counting on to bring stability to the turbulent state of
Chiapas were thrown into unexpected turmoil Sunday when some of the
government's staunchest supporters boycotted the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   About 40,000 voters from San Juan Chamula, a prosperous Tzotzil
Indian county which for decades has been a monolithic bastion of
support for the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party,
refused to vote or even to allow the election authorities to set up
any of the 59 polling stations slated for the county.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians of Chamula, whose rebellious spirit is legendary
here, barred the vote as a protest to demand the release from jail
of five Chamula men they say were falsely accused of murder.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the peculiar calculus of Chiapas elections, the
boycott seems likely to torpedo much of the government's plan by
making it impossible to inaugurate a new state legislature. The
elections were for all 40 seats in the legislature and the
mayoralties of 103 counties.
</P>
<P>
   This year President Ernesto Zedillo adopted an aggressive policy
to undermine support for the Zapatista rebels, whose followers hail
from the Indian villages of the highlands and jungles of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   While dismantling parallel county governments set up by the
Zapatistas, the government blanketed the state with well-financed
social programs to draw the Indian population away from the
guerrilla movement.
</P>
<P>
   The elections Sunday were crucial to that strategy. The state
authorities decided to press forward with them despite torrential
floods that last month washed away dozens of villages along
Chiapas' Pacific coast. Elections could not be scheduled in eight
counties and three state legislative districts out of a total of
24. No date has been set to make up those elections.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with no balloting in San Juan Chamula, not enough members
have been chosen to make a quorum to convene the new legislature.
</P>
<P>
   In most places the voting came off normally, but abstention
rates appeared to be high. Preliminary results were expected by
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The events pointed up the vast gap between the Indian
communities of Chiapas and the largely non-Indian, or mestizo,
state government.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday the speaker of the state legislature, Juan Carlos
Bonifaz Trujillo _ who is from the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, known by the Spanish acronym PRI _ and officials from the
State Supreme Court traveled by helicopter to San Juan Chamula,
where generally more than 95 percent of any vote goes to the PRI.
They tried to cajole disgruntled residents to permit the polling
stations to open.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Standing before 500 restive Indians in the cobbled square of the
county seat, with firecrackers booming in a celebration of a local
patron saint, Bonifaz warned that blocking an election is a felony
but promised to speed the trials of the five jailed Chamula men.
</P>
<P>
   As soon Bonifaz headed back towards his helicopter the Chamula
men, all in their distinctive black wool ponchos, began shouting.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way! No voting!'' said Pedro Hernandez Lopez, 42, raising
both fists. ``We have no problems with the government or with the
PRI. But no one here is going to vote until we have our five men
back!''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict is part of a 30-year clash in San Juan Chamula
between the Catholics who control the community and an insurgent
group of Evangelical Protestants. The five imprisoned men are
facing trial in the slayings of two Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   Recently a well-known Protestant, Manuel Collazo, was acquitted
of the murder of a Chamula Catholic, in a court verdict that
awakened public suspicion of corruption. Collazo's release sparked
the demands for the release of the five accused Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent failure of the legislative elections was alarming
to opposition parties as well as the government, since the
opposition expected to elect many mayors and possibly take a
majority in the statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas were largely quiet. In national elections in July
1997, the rebels burned or broke up dozens of polling stations
across the state.
</P>
<P>
   But in a communique on Saturday, Subcommander Marcos, the
Zapatistas' top strategist and spokesman, said the rebels would not
disrupt these elections.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was not explicit, Zapatistas appeared to be under
instructions not to vote. But in at least one Zapatista stronghold,
the county of Pantelho, hundreds of Zapatista sympathizers turned
out to cast ballots for an opposition party.

MARY ANTHONY DANCE THEATER: A CHOREOGRAPHER UNAFRAID, SO EVEN
CALIGULA LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Dances Old and New'' was the name of the program
presented by the Mary Anthony Dance Theater on Saturday night at
the Merce Cunningham Studio. The six pieces did span three decades.
But it was the ``old'' that distinguished this satisfying evening,
from a choreographic emphasis on solid craft to big, emotionally
committed, weighted dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Kun-Yang Lin, Ms. Anthony's young artistic protege, has grown
measurably in the year since his work was first presented by Ms.
Anthony's company. Lin's new ``Passages/Three Aspects,'' a suite of
sleek, focused solos, made imaginative use of its scores, drew
strong performances from its dancers and allowed three shimmering
worlds to emerge from darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Nai-Yu Kuo moved from contemplative sadness to frenzied anguish
in ``Lachrymose,'' the first of the solos, set to music by Dmitri
Yanov-Yanovsky. In ``Renascence,'' danced to music by Quentin
Chiappetta, Kori Darling emerged slowly, pale and seemingly nude,
from a ragged chrysalis of red tulle.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Antognazzi's strikingly quiet, powerful presence made
each stretched calligraphic pose count in ``For M.A.'' The closing
solo was set to music by Chiappetti and to Ms. Anthony's
soft-voiced reading of an E.E. Cummings poem that celebrated
``everything which is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lin is not afraid of bold imagery, so it was not surprising that
he would so forcefully evoke the lethal paranoia of Muriel Cohan's
``Caligula,'' a 1973 solo that is both a horrific portrait and a
study of tension and release. Gwendolyn Bye was as riveting in a
sumptuous performance of the lead role in Ms. Anthony's gutsy,
lyrical 1967 ``Gloria,'' set to the Poulenc score.
</P>
<P>
   Another highlight was Mary Ford's simple, luminous performance
of Ms. Anthony's ``Magdalen,'' a New York premiere set to
traditional madrigals and music by Henrik Gorecki and inspired by
the paintings of Georges de la Tour. Ms. Ford's old-school clarity
and devotion added greatly to this psychological portrait, seen in
flashback memories, of an innocent grown wise.
</P>
<P>
   The program was completed by Lin's breezy new ``Aperitif II''
and his less focused ``Luminous Song.'' John Musall was the
evening's imaginative lighting designer.

TOP 19 JAPANESE BANKS REPORTED TO BE IN DEEP TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET
EMBARGO for electronic media.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Japan's top financial officials told their American
counterparts this weekend that their country's banking system was
acutely short of capital, with the top 19 banks in deeper trouble
than Tokyo has ever before admitted, according to officials
familiar with the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   At a private meeting Saturday, the governor of the Bank of
Japan, Masaru Hayami, told Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Alan
Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, that the capital
supporting those 19 major banks has dwindled to dangerously low
levels in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The capital reserve levels are now so low that these banks of
the world's second largest economy might be banned from operating
internationally ``if the rules were vigorously pursued,'' said a
senior Japanese official, relating the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, in a reflection of the enormous confusion
surrounding Japan's financial crisis, other senior Japanese
officials disputed Hayami's presentation and insisted that the
reserve levels have not declined to dangerous levels.
</P>
<P>
   Banks that want to operate globally are required to keep on hand
capital amounting to at least 8 percent of their outstanding loans.
Few and fewer of Japan's banks can meet that standard today.
Hayami's remarks suggest some may fall below the 4 percent minimum
for operating within Japan's borders.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's conflicting explanations came as leaders of the world's
major economies met here for a second day at the annual meetings of
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to grapple with
an economic crisis that many fear has spun out of control. On
Sunday, Rubin again pressed for changes at the fund and the bank
that would improve their ability to head of crises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strengthening the response to the current crisis and creating
a modern framework for the global markets of the 21st century will
not be easy or quick,'' Rubin said before the committee that
oversees the IMF's operations.
</P>
<P>
   But many officials here, including James Wolfensohn, president
of the World Bank, argued on Sunday that countries should focus
their energies on the immediate crisis and postpone a broader
discussion of remaking the global financial system.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's meeting with Japanese officials on Saturday took place
in the ornate private conference room adjacent to his office at the
Treasury. The session also included Japan's finance minister,
Kiichi Miyazawa, a 78-year-old former prime minister who has
negotiated with the United States since the U.S. occupation ended
nearly a half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Hayami discussed the problem publicly, though in less
detail, telling reporters that Japan's major banks were
``undercapitalized.'' He called on Japan's parliament to inject
billions of taxpayer dollars into the banks to restore them to
health, a hugely controversy question within the country.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstering Japan's ravaged banking system is considered by many
experts the single most critical factor in quelling the global
financial turmoil that has rocked markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But there are still disputes, inside Japan and beyond its
borders, over just how much trouble the banks are in. Much depends
on how the figures are calculated _ and there are many ways to
manipulate the numbers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hayami, who runs Japan's independent central bank, appeared to
be painting a bleak picture in the meeting at the Treasury,
describing how banks have been forced to eat into their capital to
write off enormous bad loans in real estate. He used, Japanese
officials said later, a narrow definition of the banks' capital
that put their condition in the most perilous light.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night officials of the Ministry of Finance, which has
been accused of greatly mismanaging its regulatory responsibility
over the banks, insisted that Hayami's presentation to Rubin and
Greenspan was deeply flawed. In response to queries on Sunday, they
offered an alternative calculation, based on accounting standards
set out by the Bank of International Settlements, that they said
demonstrated that the biggest Japanese banks largely exceeded the 8
percent standard.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement seemed to underscore the enormous disarray
within the Japanese government at a time that the country is being
portrayed, by U.S. and European officials, as a major cause of the
continuing turmoil. But it is also possible that some Japanese
officials are hoping that the disclosures with prompt enough
foreign pressure to help force parliament to inject billions of
dollars into the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said that at the meetings on Sunday they were
successfully building support for a proposal by President Clinton
to change the strategy of the IMF, so that it can offer pre-emptive
aid to countries that are fundamentally healthy, but in danger of
runs on their currency or their banking systems because of
``contagion'' from other striken nations. They said it would
probably be a number of weeks or a few months before the plan is
adapted, however.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to press for changes in the IMF and an
increase in social spending in a presentation to finance ministers
from 22 nations on Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Britain, which has supported Clinton's plan,
offered a pointed reminder on Sunday that the U.S. proposal to
restructure the fund would be sharply undercut if Congress failed
to approve $18 billion in money the United States has committed to
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The starting point of this is the American government voting
the resources the IMF requires,'' the British chancellor of the
exchequer, Gordon Brown, said at a press conference on Sunday.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Cone carried a Yankee cap with him to
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan Sunday for Darryl
Strawberry, a cap with Strawberry's No. 39 embroidered on it. Cone
knew that Strawberry had seen the caps on television, but he wanted
to give him a cap in person and remind his teammate just how much
he meant to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry underwent surgery to remove a cancerous tumor from
his colon on Saturday, and Cone and manager Joe Torre were among a
group of Yankees who visited him in the hospital less than 24 hours
later. They represented the close-knit team, whose players and
coaches had been anxious to see Strawberry and let him know he was
in their thoughts as they played on in the postseason without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all concerned about him,'' Cone said. ``We want to see
how he's doing. We want to let him know that we got the message and
we did what he asked us to do. It will be nice to see him face to
face and tell him how much we care.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry had videotaped a message to the Yankees on Friday in
which he said: ``Go get 'em tonight, guys. Get 'em.'' The Yankees
listened, and then they throttled the Texas Rangers, 4-0, in Game 3
of the division series in Arlington, Texas. They face the Cleveland
Indians in Game 1 of the American League Championship Series
Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Before Cone, Torre and others, including Andy Pettitte, Chili
Davis, Derek Jeter, Tim Raines and Tino Martinez, met with
Strawberry for about an hour Sunday afternoon after a workout at
Yankee Stadium, he had sent them another message through Dr. Stuart
Hershon. Hershon, the Yankees' team physician, met with Strawberry
in the hospital Sunday and then spoke with the players at the
stadium about Strawberry's condition. Doctors said there was no
visible evidence during surgery that the cancer had spread beyond
the area of the bowel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Hershon was in to see Darryl this morning,'' Torre said.
``He said that he felt good, very alert. He's obviously sore, but
very upbeat about the news that everything was fine. Again, he
reiterated to Dr. Hershon about finishing the job we started.''
</P>
<P>
   That job is winning the World Series. That would satisfy George
Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, who spent five hours
with Strawberry and his wife, Charisse, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really want to get into it, but he's up,''
Steinbrenner said Sunday. ``He's upbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   The reserve infielder Luis Sojo was not part of the contingent
that visited Strawberry Sunday, but he said the entire team planned
to visit Strawberry at Columbia-Presbyterian after Monday's workout
if it is feasible for Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want to see him in person,'' Sojo said. ``We all want
to see how he's doing. Tomorrow, after the workout, we're all going
to go up.''
</P>
<P>
   Sojo was one of several Yankees who flipped from channel to
channel Saturday searching for any news on Strawberry's condition.
On their flight from Dallas to New York that morning, the Yankees
had talked about how Strawberry was scheduled to begin his surgery
as they were flying home. Once the players learned that doctors had
deemed Strawberry's three-hour surgery successful, some of their
anxieties dissipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a lot of sense of relief,'' Martinez said.
``We know he has a lot of work to do. It's a better feeling in here
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sojo added: ``The first thing I did when I got home was turn on
the TV. When I heard them say he was fine, it kind of completed my
day.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, the Yankees were cautious about what they said. As
relieved as they were by the doctors' positive statements, they
realized it would be about a week before key pathology tests would
allow doctors to classify the severity of the cancer, and determine
what kind of therapy, such as drugs and radiation, to recommend. So
Strawberry and the Yankees must wait for more news about his
condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can talk all we want to, but it's a scary situation,'' Paul
O'Neill said. ``It started off on a good note, obviously. The
surgery is the No. 1 step. From what the doctors said, there were
no setbacks. You go on from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's teammates are not the only people who are concerned
about him. Danny Mecka, a 12-year-old Little Leaguer from Lodi,
N.J., played second base in a game Sunday and then switched to a
Yankee cap and ventured to Columbia-Presbyterian. Mecka left an
oversized get-well card for Strawberry at the front desk of the
hospital, a card that stated simply what many others are thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Strawberry,'' the card read, ``I always looked up to you
when I was young. Get well.''

TYSON'S WORDS RAISE CONCERN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fact Mike Tyson is disturbed is no secret to anyone who is
conscious. However, an interview with the former champion in
Playboy magazine this month gives the Nevada State Athletic
Commission more reason than ever to be concerned about his
stability.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, he comes off as more enraged than ever in
spite of what he says are constant efforts to keep his
unpredictable emotions in check.
</P>
<P>
   One comment alone should give pause to Nevada commissioners, who
are considering whether to relicense Tyson after he chewed off a
portion of Evander Holyfield's ear last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm going to blow one day,'' he told the magazine.
``But I'm going to make sure that when I blow, my kids are fine.
There's not much more of this (bleep) I can take. I'm going to blow
one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try very hard, I'm doing a very good job, sir. I'm doing a
very good job. I'm just really angry these days. Really, really
angry. This whole year has been a total retrospect of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it's difficult to understand what Tyson says.
However, his tone is clear.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson !ital!is!off! ready to blow any minute. It could happen
anywhere _ including the ring.
</P>
<P>
   __ More Tyson: The situation in Nevada is a mess.
</P>
<P>
   First, the commission implies Tyson will be reinstated if he
receives a satisfactory evaluation from an independent
psychiatrist. Then, after he's tested, they say he has to explain
an alleged assault.
</P>
<P>
   Then Tyson's handlers are unable to get the evaluation to the
commission in time for the scheduled Oct. 3 hearing, which is
postponed to Oct. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Then Tyson's people decide they don't want the results of the
evaluation released to the public, even though he agreed to do so
at a hearing in Nevada last month. Then a judge says he can't
prevent the commission from making the evaluation public, a
decision that has been appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the doctor who performed the evaluation said he
doesn't want to release it because of doctor-patient
confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   And Tyson's people are reportedly attempting to settle the
assault charge out of court to make it go away.
</P>
<P>
   It's an absolute circus with an overabundance of clowns. It
didn't have to be this complicated. This is boxing, though.
</P>
<P>
   __ Class act: With his loss to Floyd Mayweather, we might have
seen the last of Genaro Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   If so, he should be remembered as one of the finest boxers and
one of the classiest gentlemen of his era. He handled himself with
remarkable grace over a long career, in which he was champion for
all or parts of seven years.
</P>
<P>
   His comments after Saturday's fight are typical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Father Time caught up with us,'' he said. ``He's a true
champion and he'll be champion for a long time. He was just too
quick for me. I've been with inexperienced fighters before, but
nobody was as quick as him. I intended to go out there and beat the
best and he proved that he was better than the best.''
</P>
<P>
   No fighter has more to be proud of than Hernandez _ even if he
was largely overlooked by the public.
</P>
<P>
   __ Floyd the champ: With his victory over Hernandez, the new WBC
super featherweight champion became the first 1996 Olympian to hold
a world title.
</P>
<P>
   Mayweather, 21, surprised some people who believed he needed
more seasoning to beat Hernandez, but he certainly has the natural
ability. The nephew of former champ Roger Mayweather has uncommon
boxing skills and quickness.
</P>
<P>
   Now, does he have enough ability to beat a top-flight opponent
nearer his own age, Angel Manfredy, against whom he might defend
his title in December? The same doubters will be out for that one:
Manfredy is a complete and resilient fighter. And he's only 23.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be another fascinating matchup. And, if Mayweather takes
it in lieu of a mismatch that could earn him a few easy dollars, he
should be commended. Boxing needs more brash young boxers willing
to fight anyone.
</P>
<P>
   __ Whitaker back: Unbeaten heavyweight Lance Whitaker of Mission
Hills, out since May because of a cut, is scheduled to face Dan
Conway on the undercard of the Alex Stewart-Ezra Sellers card on
Thursday in Kansas City, Mo., on Fox Sports Net.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker (16-0, with 14 knockouts) was cut during his May 1 bout
against Ray Butler, whom he stopped in six rounds. The wound healed
but was reopened while he was sparring with Everton Davis a few
months later. All together, Whitaker has had 25 stitches.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-8, 245-pounder was depressed after the second
incident and, even when it healed, worried it would happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``After sparring, I would look in the mirror and see if I was
OK. Every time,'' he said. ``I wanted to see if it had healed,
whether I gave it enough time. It was hard, it really was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it's OK, though. My right hand was hurting. The time off
gave that time to heal and I worked on some (noncontact) things in
the gym. I think the layoff probably did me some good.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker believes he'll be ready to face a top-10 contender next
year but is in no hurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really just looking forward to this fight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Goossen-Camacho fight nearer: Pat Goossen, the father and
trainer of P.J. Goossen of North Hollywood, said a deal to fight
Hector ``Macho'' Camacho on Dec. 12 is near completion, but he is
taking nothing for granted in this unpredictable business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll believe it when P.J. is in the ring,'' he said.

   CULLMAN, Ala. _ Five thousand miles away, at the real
Oktoberfest, the mayor of Munich, Germany, kicked things off this
year, as is the solemn tradition, by pounding a bent bronze spout
into a keg of golden brew and declaring ``O'zapft is,'' or ``It has
been tapped.'' So began the two-week quest to see whether this
year's celebrants would exceed last year's consumption of 5.6
million liters of beer, which is, after all, the whole point.
</P>
<P>
   But at Cullman's 17th annual Oktoberfest, which began Sunday,
there were no such beery pronouncements. In fact, the celebrants
were fortified with nothing stronger than tart lemonade. And that
will be the case throughout the weeklong festival. No beer at the
Friday night street dance. No beer with the bratwurst and schnitzel
at the daily German lunches and dinners. Not a drop.
</P>
<P>
   Cullman County is dry, bone dry, and has been for 60 years. And
that creates something of a culture clash at this time each year,
as the descendants of the German immigrants who settled this area
honor their heritage in a way that the volk from the old country
simply would not understand. It is a far different scene from the
one on the Theresienweise in Munich, where thousands of revelers
cram into cavernous brewery tents to quaff strong beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really would not comprehend it, that you could have an
Oktoberfest without any alcoholic beverages,'' said Fred Abt, who
served as the burgermeister of last year's celebration in Cullman,
a town that had 13,367 people in the last census. ``But we still
have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Abt is right, of course. A number of Germans and several experts
on German culture interviewed in recent days seemed unable to fully
digest the notion of a beerless version of Oktoberfest, the street
party that began in 1810 as a royal wedding celebration. Someone
might as well have announced that there would now be speed limits
on the autobahn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit impossible,'' said Klaus Kries, a Munich
engineer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it is not Oktoberfest!'' declared Gabi Papke, a
spokeswoman for the Munich Tourist Office.
</P>
<P>
   James McMahon, a professor of German at Emory University,
explained that ``having Oktoberfest without beer is like having the
Fourth of July without fireworks.''
</P>
<P>
   That being said, the 150 people who attended Sunday afternoon's
ceremonies seemed to be enjoying themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Cullman High School German band, in new uniforms of
lederhosen and dirndls, admirably performed a medley of oompah
songs, including, somewhat subversively, ``Roll Out the Barrel.''
The 1998 burgermeister, the Rev. Harold Hermetz of St. Paul's
Lutheran Church, was installed, using his brief speech to extol the
importance of hard work.
</P>
<P>
   The new Miss Oktoberfest, Emma Hohenberger, was selected in a
rather nontraditional way. Each of nine contestants was handed a
chocolate frosted cupcake and told to bite into the middle. The
winner would be the one who found a pretzel inside. ``Oh, my God!''
Miss Hohenberger exclaimed as she chomped down, her voice muffled
by the dry cake she was trying to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   And then Stanley Johnson, the great-great nephew of Col. John
Gottfried Cullman, the town's venerated founder, regaled the crowd
with town history. It seems that Cullman, a Bavarian merchant who
fled Bismarck's Germany, was searching for unsettled farmland near
the newly laid L&AMP;N Railroad tracks to establish a community for
other German refugees. He brought the first five families here in
1873. More than 10,000 German immigrants followed.
</P>
<P>
   While intermarriage has diluted the bloodlines, cultural
vestiges have survived in Cullman's restaurants and Lutheran
churches. And recently there has been Oktoberfest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us a chance to retain our German heritage,'' said
Abt, who chose not to wear lederhosen Sunday only because his wife
said his legs looked too white. ``It's a fun time when we can
reminisce about our ancestors and the newcomers can enjoy the
fellowship and food, even though it's only with coffee, tea and
cold drinks.''
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of drinking here in the old days, with saloons
and a traveling schnapps wagon that sold beer for a dime. But as
Baptists infiltrated the region, the county voted itself dry in the
late 1930s. Frequent referendums to overturn the prohibition have
all failed.
</P>
<P>
   The Chamber of Commerce supports a reversal, which it says would
help Cullman lure meetings and new restaurants. Many here are
convinced that because the county is dry, Cullman lost the giant
Mercedes plant that located near Tuscaloosa a few years ago.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several years ago, the owners of Stiefelmeyer's Deli smuggled in
a keg of beer for an Oktoberfest party, drawing a large crowd until
the police arrived to haul the owners to jail. And even today,
several residents said, it is not uncommon for Oktoberfest
celebrants to disappear mysteriously for a few moments after
explaining that they need to check on something in their cars.
</P>
<P>
   But tourism officials do their best by promoting the festival as
a unique opportunity for family fun. And town fathers say that in
the end the real meaning of Oktoberfest is not lost in all the
sobriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are so busy these days that they don't spend time
together,'' Hermetz said. ``The emphasis here is just on good
fellowship and getting to know your neighbors.''

STARR'S EFFORTS TO EXPAND INQUIRY RAISE DOUBTS, WHITE HOUSE SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House said Sunday that ``troubling
questions'' had been raised about the actions of Whitewater
independent counsel Kenneth Starr and his office in seeking to
expand its original inquiry to include accusations of a
relationship between President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was responding to an article on Sunday in The
New York Times reporting that a lawyer involved in the Paula Jones
sexual misconduct lawsuit provided the first tip to Starr's office
about the president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, a former
White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   In the Whitewater independent counsel's impeachment report to
Congress, though, Starr said that his office was first informed
about the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship by Linda Tripp, who had
been a Pentagon colleague of Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential adviser James Kennedy said in a statement issued
Sunday that the Times article prompted new questions about the work
of Starr's office. ``In sum, what did the OIC know, and when did it
know it?'' Kennedy asked.
</P>
<P>
   He said the White House would review whether Starr was
``complete and accurate in disclosing information'' to Attorney
General Janet Reno when he sought permission, which was quickly
granted, to expand his inquiry into the president's finances to
include the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that the White House plans to make the question a
major issue, presidential aides were weighing Sunday the
implications of the disclosures and how to draw further public
attention to them.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was taken up Sunday by Democrats on Capitol Hill,
where the House Judiciary Committee is to begin debate Monday on
whether to recommend formal impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   James Jordan, a spokesman for the Democrats on the Judiciary
Committee, said that Starr has shown a consistent pattern of making
misleading statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken Starr has engaged in precisely the same conduct _ that is,
making statements that are technically accurate but intentionally
misleading _ that he contends are grounds for impeachment for the
president of the United States,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Times article, at least a week before Mrs.
Tripp contacted Starr's office on Jan. 12, Jerome Marcus, a
Philadelphia lawyer, informed a law-school friend working for Starr
of the accusations related to Clinton's relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Starr might have used the tip to prepare an early strategy to
persuade the Justice Department to expand the scope of the stalled
Whitewater inquiry. The strategy was based on pursuing a purported
pattern by Clinton of silencing potentially harmful witnesses
through job offers organized by Clinton's friend, Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus is one of a group of conservative lawyers who helped the
Jones legal team and then secretly helped Mrs. Tripp find a lawyer
and bring her accusations to Starr's attention. The group included
Richard Porter, a law partner of Starr's at the Chicago firm of
Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, and George Conway, a partner at Wachtell Lipton
Rosen &AMP; Katz in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers, political aides and Hillary Rodham Clinton
have complained for months of a right-wing conspiracy against the
president, contending that Mrs. Jones' lawyers fed Starr's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department had no official comment Sunday on the
Times article.
</P>
<P>
   But the Justice Department's position has been that barring
convincing evidence that Starr's office knowingly and materially
misled Justice Department officials, there is no reason to reopen
the question of whether it was correct to expand Starr's mandate to
include Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly denied any impropriety or effort
to mislead. He said that the office did receive a ``heads-up call
that some information may be coming or may be out there.'' But he
would not specify who made the call or who received it, and he
characterized the information provided as ``vague'' and
``sketchy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly insisted, ``As far as we were concerned, we didn't get
this information until the 12th, until Linda Tripp called.''

MARINO, JETS' ARCH-NEMESIS, IS BATTERED
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It was another step forward, and perhaps
a wave goodbye to a negative history that is fading fast.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, who had not known since 1993 what it was to stop Dan
Marino, played a remarkable game Sunday in producing a 20-9 victory
over the previously unbeaten Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   They battered Marino after his running game failed. And they
outmaneuvered the league's second-stingiest defense with a clever
rushing and passing offense as Vinny Testaverde chased at least one
demon out of his erratic past.
</P>
<P>
   Even the old pro, Keith Byars, 10 days shy of his 35th birthday,
was cavorting as he led all receivers with six receptions for 71
yards to set a National Football League career record for passes
caught by a running back with 593.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets came in sky-high, after reaching a peak on the practice
field last Thursday. It is a team that desperately needed Sunday's
victory and is now 2-2 with a second straight triumph, while
remaining undefeated in division play.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Coach Bill Parcells read the riot act to the Jets
after such a display.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells told his players that he was angry at the way some of
them committed dumb penalties or performed in ways that showed they
were not thinking _ such as Curtis Martin inadvertently running out
of bounds to stop the clock in the final minute, while the Jets
were trying to keep it going.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed almost not to matter that Martin generated a second
straight powerful performance _ 36 carries for 108 yards and his
first touchdown as a Jet.
</P>
<P>
   And Parcells warned the Jets that the St. Louis Rams, whom the
Jets face next Sunday, have been waiting, have been resting during
a bye week _ and if the Jets think they are anybody special, they
had better start proving it next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Coach Parcells was saying, `how far can we go?''' said
linebacker Pepper Johnson, a veteran of the coach's years with the
Giants. ``Are we burning up our energy, or can we keep it going to
St. Louis?'' Johnson often smiled as he thought of the Parcells way
of keeping a team on edge.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, at any rate, the Jets were mostly smart, and good,
and often cute.
</P>
<P>
   They allowed Karim Abdul-Jabbar only 16 yards on nine runs for a
1.8-yard per carry average.
</P>
<P>
   And the great Marino?
</P>
<P>
   He was stumped. Oh, he had one fine drive toward the end of the
game that led to a touchdown. That took the Jets' edge down to
17-9. But it was more a stroll down memory lane, because the
Dolphins of 1998 insist on running the ball.
</P>
<P>
   When was the last time anyone saw Marino hand the ball off three
straight times in the third quarter with his team trailing? This
was what he was ordered to do, when the Dolphins could get the
signals straight.
</P>
<P>
   They had been bothered throughout the game with a faulty
communications system in which the coaches on the sideline could
not communicate directly with the quarterback through his headset.
So the Dolphins had to shuttle players in and out, often using the
important receiver, O.J. McDuffie. Thus, he was not always
available.
</P>
<P>
   Marino was held to only 13 completions in 31 attempts for 121
yards. He was sacked three times. He was intercepted twice. These
sorts of things rarely happen to him, at least not at the hands of
the Jets. He had beaten them seven straight times going back to the
1994 season. He had never before had such a poor completion
percentage against them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there is Testaverde. He would not comment on starting
again in place of Glenn Foley, saying, ``I don't want to be a thorn
in anyone's side,'' but would dearly love to remain the starting
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells was his usual noncommittal self. ``Nothing has
changed,'' he said, when asked whether Foley, who may or may not be
still nursing sore ribs, can return at starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   After consecutive clutch victories, however, it would be hard to
imagine Testaverde going to the bench.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Testaverde has been a Jet only for this season, but he has his
own baggage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad finally to get the tag off me that I can't beat
Jimmy Johnson; I was 0-3 against his teams,'' said the quarterback,
who played college ball for Johnson at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' defense, meanwhile, was tough Sunday. Miami had not
trailed in the second half this season. It had put games away by
averaging almost 12 points in the second quarter. But after Olindo
Mare had given the Dolphins a 3-0 first-quarter lead on a 46-yard
field goal, the Dolphins got no more points until Marino's late
drive was capped by a 2-yard scoring pass to tight end Troy
Drayton.
</P>
<P>
   In between, it was all Jets, offensively and defensively.
Keyshawn Johnson produced his fifth touchdown of the season _ he is
now at a Jerry Rice rate _ by snaring a 10-yard Testaverde pass in
the second quarter. It was a play that Testaverde and Johnson had
worked on after practice all week _ Testaverde tossing it deep into
the end zone, over a defender. This time he did it over Dolphins
cornerback Terrell Buckley.
</P>
<P>
   John Hall followed that later in the period with a 47-yard field
goal for a 10-3 lead. The drive that led to the field goal remained
alive after it had apparently been ended by an interception by
Miami's Brian Walker. But the Dolphins' Patrick Surtain was called
for interference on the play.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, strong safety Victor Green picked off a
Marino pass that positioned Martin's 6-yard touchdown run for a
17-3 lead. That marked the first time this season that a Miami
turnover had been converted into a touchdown by the opposition and
it offset Drayton's touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's fourth-quarter 25-yard field goal with 48 seconds left
clinched the victory.
</P>
<P>
   This final score was one of the most enjoyable for the
third-largest home crowd in Jets' history _ 75,257.
</P>
<P>
   It followed a drive that began when Testaverde, on his 25, was
looking for Martin. As the quarterback set to throw, someone
grabbed Testaverde's right arm. So he flipped the ball with his
left, the shovel pass to Martin went 13 yards, complete, and the
Jets were on their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect this to happen,'' Testaverde said of starting
the last two games. Asked how he would feel if this were taken away
from him, he didn't want to think about that. ``I'm having too much
fun,'' he said.

COMMENTARY: THE `PROCESS' BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here are seven questions overlooked in the torrent
of testimony.
</P>
<P>
   1. Why, amid all the supplementary boxes of referrals to
Congress by the independent counsel, is there not one word about
the harassment and intimidation of Kathleen Willey?
</P>
<P>
   In President Clinton's grand jury appearance, we witnessed his
direct contradiction of Willey's assertions about nonconsensual
Oval Office groping. But her testimony about that and subsequent
pressure is still being withheld. My surmise is that an indictment
may be forthcoming about what was done to her by aides after the
alleged pass. Prosecutors, under Justice guidelines, tend to delay
indictments until after elections.
</P>
<P>
   2. Did Monica tell the whole truth?
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that she has not. On her volunteered statement that
``nobody told me to lie,'' which Clinton lawyers seized upon as
exculpatory: of course nobody said to her, ``Monica _ lie!'' But
she was directed to a common cover story and encouraged to submit a
false affidavit, which is joining a conspiracy to lie.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the ``talking points'' urging her friend Linda
Tripp to testify falsely, and backing it up with a cash inducement?
Monica swears she wrote that document with no legal help, and
Clinton lawyers (who still claim she lies about their client ever
even touching her) insist we take as gospel truth her protection of
the president and his aides on this. Now that we can compare
writing styles, it is hard to argue that the Monica who wrote the
notes and letters is the unaided author of the legalistic talking
points.
</P>
<P>
   3. Why are House Democrats pushing the notion that the Judiciary
Committee should deal only with sex?
</P>
<P>
   No committee of Congress should be forced to concentrate solely
on crimes to cover up sex. Where is it written that impeachment
inquiries be limited to prurient material provided by outside
prosecutors? Cries of ``no fishing expedition'' mean ``don't dig
any more deeply'' and should be met with ``don't fence us in.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Why is Henry Hyde's legal eagle reportedly throwing away
Clinton's abuse of executive privilege as an impeachment count?
</P>
<P>
   Rarely has our doctrine of checks and balances been so
egregiously challenged as in Clinton's pattern of refusal to answer
questions by the co-equal judicial and legislative branches. If
this president were allowed the power he claims to direct a
publicly paid aide not to reveal to a criminal grand jury any
conversation with someone outside government, that would set a
precedent transferring excessive power to the executive. Not sexy
enough? This issue could affect the removal votes of a half-dozen
Democratic senators.
</P>
<P>
   5. Where, as actor Ronald Reagan famously asked, is the rest of
me?
</P>
<P>
   We have a legless referral: Ken Starr has sent over Chapter I of
a five-chapter book. The three-judge panel overseeing independent
counsels should direct Starr to indict, expose or exonerate those
involved in Whitewater, Filegate and Travelgate affairs by a
specified date, perhaps tied to a coming Supreme Court decision
ending Clinton delays by spurious claims of executive privilege.
Then, as the next Congress convenes, two other House committees and
a Manhattan prosecutor will send reports on campaign finance
depredations directly affecting a national election.
</P>
<P>
   6. Why is no outrage or dismay expressed by Clinton's
traditional supporters at his unceasing degradation of Betty
Currie?
</P>
<P>
   Here is a woman known for her good character cynically used by
the president to facilitate acts of bad character, and a person
known for strong religious values induced by peer pressure to
ever-increasing forgetfulness while under an oath before her God.
That offense by Clinton to a loyal and trusting human being may be
unimpeachable, but it is unforgivable.
</P>
<P>
   7. Why are we allowing White House spinmeisters to rig the
coming evaluation of this ``impeachment election''?
</P>
<P>
   American voters will decide on Nov. 3 if Clinton will be
impeached. But the Clinton line is if Democrats merely ``hold their
own,'' that is to be interpreted as a ringing vote of confidence as
if this were a normal midterm election. No sale. If Democrats gain
strength in Congress, Clinton wins. If Republicans extend their
majorities, he loses, because the voters' message to the House will
be: impeach. If it's a breakeven, it's a wash, and unsignaled
Senate jurors would just have to vote their consciences.

BYARS, LIKE THE OLD PRO HE IS, KNEW NO. 13'S MIND-SET
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ When they were Dolphins teammates for
four seasons, Keith Byars often saw that look in Dan Marino's eyes.
And when he saw that look again Sunday on Marino's 2-yard touchdown
pass to Troy Drayton with more than five minutes remaining, he
warned his Jets teammates about the 37-year-old quarterback who
still throws lasers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the mind-set of No. 13,'' Byars said later, alluding to
Marino. ``We'd given him one opportunity. I knew we couldn't give
him another opportunity. I knew we had to put a drive together.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Jets' offense did just that. Vinny Testaverde moved the
ball 68 yards in 11 plays to position John Hall's 25-yard field
goal that assured a 20-9 victory. On two of those plays, Byars
caught passes for 17 and 11 yards. Overall, he had six catches for
71 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's lost a step or two,'' Jets Coach Bill Parcells said later
of the 34-year-old Byars, ``but this guy can make plays when it
counts.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Parcells has hired Byars twice _ in 1996 for the New
England Patriots after the Dolphins released him, and again early
this year after the Patriots released him. Parcells had remembered
Byars from his years as the Giants' coach when Byars was on the
Philadelphia Eagles. ``He knows how to play the game,'' Parcells
said.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 1,500 players in pro football, but that
doesn't mean each one is a professional football player in the real
sense of the phrase. Byars is a professional football player, an
old pro who seldom makes a mistake, who understands the psychology
of the long, grinding season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 2-2 after one quarter of the season,'' he said, ``but to
me the games from 5 through 10 are the most important. Everybody
gets excited at the beginning and again at the end, but Games 5
through 10 are when teams get separated. You've got to be excited
then, too.''
</P>
<P>
   At a bull-shouldered 257 pounds, Byars is listed as the Jets'
backup fullback behind Jerald Sowell, but Sunday he was the
starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people, `I just play offense,''' Byars said. ``Running
back, tight end, pass receiver, whatever helps my team win.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his 3,088 career rushing yards, Byars has caught
593 passes, six more than Marcus Allen, the former Chief and
Raider, with whom he had shared the unofficial record for most
receptions by a running back. Roger Craig, the former 49er, had 566
and Tony Galbreath, a Giant near the end of his career, had 490.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember playing against Galbreath,'' Byars said. ``I'd say,
`Don't throw it to that guy; he can make a play.' I wanted to be
one of those guys you could count on to make a play.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells remembered Byars throwing an option pass for the Eagles
that beat the Giants. He also remembered Byars knocking out Pepper
Johnson, then a Giant linebacker, with a block. Johnson, who was
Byars' teammate at Ohio State, remembered that knockout, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was chasing Randall Cunningham,'' Johnson recalled, ``and
Keith took me out. But after the game, we went out to dinner.
Playing against him in the NFL was the scariest part because we
never blocked or tackled each other in college.''
</P>
<P>
   Now both Johnson and Byars are the old-pro type that Parcells
cherishes. One of Parcells' first moves as the Jets' major-domo was
to sign Johnson, the linebacker who had been on both Giants teams
that won the Super Bowl under him. And when Byars was at liberty,
Parcells grabbed him.
</P>
<P>
   On a Jets team with so many young players, Byars and Johnson are
worth their weight in wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do some awfully dumb things,'' Parcells said, without
naming Sunday's culprits. ``Some of these players that continue to
do them, they're going to have to either change their ways or I'm
not going to be playing them anymore, because it's about to cost
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets can't risk doing dumb things on Sunday in St. Louis,
where the Rams are 1-3, before their Oct. 19 Monday night visit to
New England. The Patriots, who are 3-1 after a 30-27 overtime scare
in New Orleans, share first place in the American Football
Conference East with Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to do some things in January, we have to take care
of business now,'' Byars said. ``You can't put off for next week
what you can do now.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a professional football player speaking. And that's why
Bill Parcells wanted Keith Byars on the Jets: to show the younger
players how a professional football player performs, especially in
the last five minutes of a tense game when he recognized the
mind-set of the opposing quarterback wearing No. 13.

INCUMBENT PRESIDENT TAKES COMFORTABLE LEAD IN BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for general rewrite, including new top with updated voting
results)  (mk) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Brazilian voters gave President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso a comfortable lead in the first round of
balloting Sunday, apparently maintaining the leadership of a
country struggling against economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   With 22 percent of the vote counted, Cardoso appeared to have
won 51 percent of the vote, compared with 34 percent for his main
rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the three-time presidential
candidate of the leftist Workers Party.
</P>
<P>
   If he still has a majority when returns are complete, Cardoso
will be declared re-elected without facing a runoff. Exit polls
indicated that he might win as much as 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Cabinet members gathering at the presidential palace in Brasilia
Sunday night called the vote a mandate for the economic measures
that the president is under national and international pressure to
carry out.
</P>
<P>
   With $30 billion having drained from federal reserves since
Russia's economic collapse in late August, and with the Sao Paulo
stock market down more than 40 percent this year, the Brazilian
government has been close to paralyzed by the approach of the
election.
</P>
<P>
   It has been negotiating a bailout with the International
Monetary Fund but has been unable to show progress on structural
changes that would cut government expenses over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   The waiting is probably not over yet, though. The size of his
victory strengthens Cardoso's hand for the politically sensitive
social security, civil service and tax overhauls ahead. But
political analysts said Congress would probably not convene to
consider the painful economic measures before important
gubernatorial runoffs on Oct. 25 because the legislators will be
busy campaigning for their parties' gubernatorial candidates.
</P>
<P>
   With policy-makers at meetings of the Group of Seven industrial
nations and the International Monetary Fund in Washington seeking
permanent solutions to ward off the volatility that is threatening
Brazil after devastating Asia and Russia, Cardoso is under
considerable pressure to put Brazil's accounts in order.
</P>
<P>
   But Gregg Smith, chief investment strategist at Prudential
Securities in New York, said the international financial markets
were not necessarily expecting major changes from Brazil in the
next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next thing everybody's going to be watching is whether
there is an IMF and World Bank package to support Brazil, and
whether the Brazilians are starting to take actions to work on the
budget deficit,'' he said. ``If those two things look like they're
moving in the right direction, it will begin to calm financial
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Carlos Alkimin, a political science professor at
Catholic University in Rio de Janeiro and chief of population
studies at the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics,
said he did not expect that Cardoso could make progress toward
restructuring the government before Oct. 25, because such measures
would require legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he can do is take measures on the administrative level to
cut costs or to play with controls on currency,'' Alkimin said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's balloting was somewhat confused, with about half of the
country voting on small shoebox-sized computers that elderly voters
had trouble mastering. Though electioneering was required to end
before polls opened Sunday, most candidates appeared to ignore the
prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   At Rocinha, in Rio de Janeiro, believed to be the largest slum
in South America with about 300,000 residents, palm-size photos of
candidates fluttered like autumn leaves through the air and
carpeted the streets. People waited more than an hour to cast their
votes, with many supporting Cardoso.
</P>
<P>
   Luiz Claudio Silveira, 34, a horse trainer who voted in Rocinha,
said he planned to vote for Cardoso, largely because the president
had ended inflation. ``If you go to the supermarket, you can buy
whatever you need now,'' Silveira said. ``Four years is not enough
to change a country as big as ours. I really believe in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rute Vicente Oliveira, 48, a manicurist, also planned to vote
for Cardoso. For most of her life, she said, her family lived in a
lean-to, too poor to build a proper home. Her father dreamed of
giving his family solid, sturdy shelter, Ms. Oliveira said, but he
died before concrete blocks replaced the family's plywood slats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the house is almost done,'' she said. ``It's almost
completely in order.''
</P>
<P>
   Many voters appeared to be unaware of the fiscal adjustments
ahead, though the president announced less than two weeks before
the election that government belt-tightening measures would be
inevitable. Of the 106 million Brazilians eligible to vote Sunday,
nearly 70 percent have less than an elementary school education,
and 35 percent are barely literate.
</P>
<P>
   Gilberto Manuel da Silva, 40, who owns an ice cream parlor, said
that he expected the economic adjustments to hurt him personally
but that he was prepared to sacrifice to stabilize Brazil's
economy. The president said he would cut government costs, crack
down on tax evaders and, if necessary, raise taxes to increase
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking more about the situation of the country than of
myself,'' da Silva said. ``With a stable money, our situation will
get better.''

NOTHING WORKS ON DISMAL DAY FOR GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ It was in the second quarter Sunday, when 15
Giants plays netted 1 yard, that the suspicion grew on the Giants'
bench that something drastic would have to be done to try to
resurrect the team's offense.
</P>
<P>
   So at the beginning of the second half against Tampa Bay, the
Giants came out throwing, attempting four passes in six plays. It
made little difference. Another drive died in the Giants' end of
the field. Another punt followed.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the Giants' defense would create a turnover, giving the
offense the football at the Tampa Bay 10-yard line. The Giants
advanced 5 yards and netted a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing the Giants tried could save them in an ignominious 20-3
loss to the Buccaneers. A clumsy, befuddled Giants offense,
stumbling before this game, had by far its worst day of the season,
incapable of mounting a drive longer than 39 yards.
</P>
<P>
   It was a performance so inept it left Giants quarterback Danny
Kanell, who threw an interception that was run back for a touchdown
on the game's third play, apologizing to his teammates on defense
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   It left Giants Coach Jim Fassel dumbfounded.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what was wrong with his team's offense, Fassel, whose
career was built designing and operating offensive football,
answered: ``I don't know. It's pretty hard for me to figure out,
too. It's going to take a lot of searching and looking at things.
We've got to come up with something.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than the sequence that led to their field goal, the
farthest the Giants (2-3) advanced was the 21-yard line of Tampa
Bay (2-3). And that drive ended with one of Kanell's three
interceptions. One Giants series _ three incompletions _ lasted 18
seconds of playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell, who sat out portions of two practices last week because
of what Fassel termed general soreness, said he was healthy and
that nothing physical contributed to his dismal performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt horrible, but only because of how I played,'' said
Kanell, who finished the game with 83 yards passing, completing 10
of 27. ``I feel responsible. I feel like we let the defense down. I
had to apologize to them. But they realize I'm struggling to make
it better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' running game, the main source of the team's problems
this season, generated less yardage than Kanell. Fullback Charles
Way had one carry for no yards. Tiki Barber had two carries for
minus-2 yards. Gary Brown gained 67 yards on 17 carries, but his
running was not enough to get the Giants out of constant trouble on
third down, when they converted just two of 12 attempts to pick up
a first down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our troubles are pretty much across the board,'' Kanell said.
``It's a little bit of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   A little bit of everything that added up to very little.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kanell may not have been bothered by any physical ailment, but
he threw as if he were either rusty from a lack of practice or
otherwise impaired. His second pass was thrown well behind Barber,
who was running across the middle. Tampa Bay safety Charles Mincy
intercepted the poorly aimed pass and returned it 22 yards for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny was rushed on the play,'' Barber said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Fassel: ``Obviously, that's not where that ball is supposed
to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants did little to recover offensively. Their defense,
meanwhile, continued to play well, as it has for most of the
season. In the first half, while their offensive mates were failing
to make a serious threat, the defense held the Buccaneers to a
35-yard field goal by Michael Husted late in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It remained a 10-0 game throughout the third quarter in part
because the Giants botched a 45-yard field goal attempt. Punter
Brad Maynard, who is the Giants' holder on place kicks, did not
position the ball cleanly at first, and place-kicker Brad Daluiso
did not attempt to kick the ball. An awkward Maynard pass followed.
Just another Giants incompletion.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the fourth quarter, a blitz by cornerback Carleton Gray
caused Tampa Bay quarterback Trent Dilfer to fumble the football at
his own 10-yard line. The turnover, however, led to a demoralizing
turn of events for the Giants. When the offense could not punch the
football into the end zone from so close _ when it could not make
it a 3-point game with a touchdown _ the Giants defense wilted.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay launched a 13-play drive that took up 8 minutes 18
seconds. Beginning at their 30-yard line, the Buccaneers got strong
efforts from the Pro Bowl fullback Mike Alstott and Warrick Dunn.
The pivotal play of the drive came on a third-and-6, when Dilfer
scrambled in the pocket and threw as he was falling down to Dunn,
who darted through the Giants secondary to get the first down.
</P>
<P>
   Husted kicked a 26-yard field goal to give Tampa Bay a 10-point
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Few on the Giants' sideline believed their offense was going to
rally for two scores in the final five minutes of the game. And on
the Giants' next possession, Kanell threw his third interception, a
pass tipped by tight end Howard Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Ronde Barber, Tiki's twin brother, grabbed the pass, his first
National Football League interception.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel acknowledged that it was possible that the offense's
failure to score a touchdown after the Dilfer fumble affected team
morale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense has to help,'' Fassel said. ``We've got to get
some of those into the end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Fassel and several of his players insisted there
would be no dissension on the team. Carping between the defense and
offense existed in previous Giants teams under Dan Reeves, who
brings his 3-1 Atlanta Falcons to Giants Stadium next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Coach Fassel won't let that happen,'' said safety Percy
Ellsworth. ``He nipped that in the bud when we were 1-3 last year.
We were worse off then.''
</P>
<P>
   Added linebacker Jessie Armstead: ``We are a family. I know
Danny didn't play like he wanted to. But he just had a bad day on
the job. It happens.''

THE ISLANDERS ARE BACK, BUT THE FANS ARE NOT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ One week after they were ordered back into
Nassau Coliseum by a judge, the Islanders played in the arena
Sunday for the first time since last season.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no confetti, no streamers welcoming them home.
Instead, there was a small crowd of angry fans.
</P>
<P>
   Some booed, some wore hard hats and others held up signs
expressing frustration or disappointment aimed at the ownership,
which has tried to move the teams' home games and has yet to sign
Zigmund Palffy or Trevor Linden, two of their best players. Even at
$10 a seat _ season ticket-holders got in free _ fewer than 3,000
people showed up Sunday night to watch the Islanders lose a
preseason game to the Washington Capitals, 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Many fans feel alienated by the Islanders' new owners, who for
the past month tried unsuccessfully to move their team's home games
all over the East Coast. The Islanders said the scoreboard at the
Coliseum was in danger of falling from the ceiling. Engineers hired
by the National Hockey League and Nassau County later rebuffed that
contention, making the owners' allegations of unsafe conditions
seem like a plan to void their lease.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very angry,'' said 28-year- old Pete Minichiello of
White Plains, who said he was a season ticket holder the past four
years. ``The new owners have promised so much, but they haven't
done anything. They don't care. It's ridiculous, a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans' anger seemed to be directed more at the Islanders'
organization than Nassau County or SMG, the company that maintains
the 26-year-old Nassau Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   A young girl, wearing a sweater autographed by every member of
the Islanders, held up a sign with the message: ``Stop wrecking our
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the second period, with Islanders trailing 2-1,
the crowd began to chant: ``We want Ziggy. We want Ziggy.'' But it
seems the only way they'll have him now is if the Islanders pay the
26-year-old right wing, who scored 87 points last season, the $6.8
million per season he is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's upsetting,'' said Dave Burrus, who is from Yonkers and
bought season tickets for the first time earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the owners are as devoted as they said they
were. It seems to me that they are willing to throw the whole
season away over a bad lease.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Doug Magee, another season-ticket holder, said he sent four
letters pleading for the team to play its games on Long Island, and
for the Islanders to sign Palffy and Linden and did not receive a
single response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know and I don't really care,'' the Islanders
Coach and General Manager Mike Milbury said before Sunday night's
game, referring to the number of fans he expected to attend. ``I'm
not concerned about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played games in sparse buildings before,'' Milbury
added. ``Hopefully, we've got enough veterans to handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   The line of questioning caused Milbury to lose his patience.
``Ask me some hockey questions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected this size crowd,'' said Islanders president David
Seldin. ``I can understand why the fans feel angry and frustrated.
It's been a tough road for our fans and we haven't done right by
them.''

THIS USC TEAM WILL NOT BE FAZED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the exhilaration that followed USC's 35-24
victory over Arizona State, it's only natural that a few brash
answers flow off the lips of players and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know this is a long season, but the goal is crystal clear _
to make it to Pasadena,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on our way to the Rose Bowl,'' echoed linebacker David
Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   No need to dampen anyone's enthusiasm, but it seemed like nearly
everyone forgot the Trojans had just defeated a 2-2 team playing on
the road without its star quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Or that a running back (J.R. Redmond) had sliced through the
Trojans' defense for more yards (214) than all but five tailbacks
in the 988 games USC has played football.
</P>
<P>
   Or that USC was inexplicably lined up to kick an extra point
while trailing 24-19 in the third quarter. Only an Arizona State
penalty allowed the Trojans to come to their senses and attempt a
successful two-point conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Or that freshman quarterback Carson Palmer seemed to be coming
in awfully late to provide a lift to the struggling offense.
</P>
<P>
   Or that the Trojans were flagged for another 108 yards in
penalties, including three infractions that occurred on a kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   These are just minor inconveniences, apparently, because USC
clearly believes it can win games this year. It doesn't matter how
many minutes the defense is forced to stay on the field each week,
it never gives up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has to go down and it's not going to be us,'' free
safety Rashard Cook said. ``Sometimes, it might get to you (being
on the field so long), but a teammate might tell you, `We've got to
stop them.'''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter how long the offense fails to score points,
its confidence remains unshaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making progress,'' Hackett said. ``It is slow on
offense, but it is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Where recent editions of USC teams might be considered a little
weak on character, this year's version has no such problem. It's
the main reason the Trojans always believe they can overpower a
team in the fourth quarter _ unless it's Florida State, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Credit the strong mental makeup to Hackett. Some of his
decisions might be questionable _ like the clock management at the
end of the first half _ but Hackett has rebuilt the Trojans'
eroding confidence. USC (4-1, 2-0) believes it can win games again,
even if the early breaks go against the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no way we were going to let Arizona State come into
our house and beat us,'' Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   This might still prove to be a rebuilding year, but it's fair to
say the Trojans might not drop a game this season to an inferior
opponent. Big deal? Well, remember the loss to Cal in 1996? That
game drained much of the enthusiasm away from the Trojans and was
hugely responsible for a 6-6 season.
</P>
<P>
   Even last year's loss to Washington State jarred the team's
confidence. The Cougars went to the Rose Bowl, but it was a painful
experience to lose to Washington State in Los Angeles for the first
time in 41 years.
</P>
<P>
   So far, USC is beating the teams it is supposed to beat. Arizona
State (2-3, 1-2) is in a free fall right now, but most of the USC
players had never experienced a victory over the Sun Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't beaten them in two years,'' wide receiver R. Jay
Soward said. ``It feels good to beat Arizona State.''
</P>
<P>
   And right now, USC is feeling good about itself. &QL;

   QUARTERBACKS _ So Mike Van Raaphorst is the starter and Carson
Palmer is the closer? Next time, the Trojans better not wait until
they're trailing in the eighth inning to bring in the closer. B

<P>
   RUNNING BACKS _ Chad Morton better get healthy fast. On the
bright side, Ted Iacenda made the catch of the night on the
two-point conversion. D
</P>
<P>
   RECEIVERS _ While everyone watches R. Jay Soward, Larry Parker
quietly made all the important early catches. Can someone please
find Mike Bastianelli? B+
</P>
<P>
   OFFENSIVE LINE _ As long as the quarterback escapes a major
injury, it's breathe-a-sigh-of-relief time. The pass protection
seems to be getting better, sort of. C-
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSIVE LINE _ Marc Matock's broken ankle will be a big loss
since the Trojans are weakest at tackle. And just when Ennis Davis
is developing into an impact player. C
</P>
<P>
   LINEBACKERS _ Ho hum. Chris Claiborne had two sacks and knocked
out ASU QB Ryan Kealy. David Gibson broke up three passes and
returned an interception for a TD. This is where the Trojans are
winning games. A-
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSIVE BACKS _ Thankfully, they never had to see what Kealy
might have done. At least they held star receiver Lenzie Jackson to
a pair of catches. C+
</P>
<P>
   SPECIAL TEAMS _ Antuan Simmons' blocked punt sealed Arizona
State's fate, and was his second blocked kick of the season. This
is a major improvement area from last season. B+
</P>
<P>
   COACHING _ Why were they trying to kick an extra point down
24-19, before ASU committed a silly penalty? All that matters is
that the players now have a winning attitude. B-

   WASHINGTON _ Citing public ``horror'' at the political maelstrom
surrounding President Clinton's sex scandal, Representative Henry
J. Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, expressed a
``hope and prayer'' Sunday that the panel would decide by New
Year's Day whether to seek Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's panel will vote Monday or Tuesday on whether to recommend
initiating the second impeachment inquiry of a president this
century _ and the first since Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   With several polls finding that the public favors a swift
congressional response to Clinton's crisis, Hyde issued his ``New
Year's resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats, meanwhile, said that Speaker Newt Gingrich is
controlling the impeachment process and trying to prolong the
inquiry into the 2000 presidential election season for political
gain.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee is likely to reject a Democratic
proposal that would set a Thanksgiving deadline to complete the
investigation. Under the GOP plan, which is expected to be approved
by the committee by tomorrow and the full House by Friday, the
panel would conduct an open-ended inquiry into allegations that
Clinton committed perjury, obstruction of justice, and witness
tampering stemming from his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how New Year's resolutions sometimes get broken, but
it's my hope and prayer that we could finish by New Year's,'' Hyde
said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet with Hyde holding out the possibility of expanding the
investigation to several other matters, Democrats on the Judiciary
Committee said the inquiry could drag on indefinitely. ``If all you
do is Lewinsky, you can't make that last more than a couple of
months,'' Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Newton, said on
ABC's ``This Week.'' ``What I am afraid we are going to get is an
impeachment in search of a high crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, 74, an Illinois Republican, said he recognizes how much
damage the matter has already caused the country and how
devastating the future consequences could be. Hyde was elected to
the House in 1974, just months after the Judiciary Committee voted
to impeach President Nixon, which led to Nixon's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our politics'' has suffered ``a serious blow,'' Hyde said.
``The name-calling, the negativity, the throwing of mud, the
institution of the White House, the presidency and Congress itself
_ people are looking at this in horror.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as Hyde prepared to preside over the impeachment
hearings, he said that if the House votes to impeach Clinton, the
Senate would not convict him in the current climate. A conviction
would require a vote of two-thirds of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't get that two-thirds bipartisan vote in the Senate''
in the current atmosphere, Hyde said. ``They won't do that until
the American people move, and they have to move from where they
apparently are, if the polls are true.''
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment proceedings are likely to produce moments of
high drama and low comedy as the Judiciary Committee enters a new
frontier in considering allegations stemming from a president's
sexual life in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But there will also be political sideshows, as several
developments underscored Sunday. Notable among them was a full-page
ad in The Washington Post in which Hustler magazine and its
publisher, Larry Flynt, offered as much as $1 million to
individuals who can prove they committed adultery with members of
Congress or high-ranking government officials.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire and former
presidential candidate, pressed his campaign for Clinton's
resignation by likening Clinton's ``lust for power'' to Adolf
Hitler's and alleging that Clinton's affair with Lewinsky may have
been associated with drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Perot, appearing on C-SPAN's ``Washington Journal,'' provided no
evidence to support his claim of possible drug use.
</P>
<P>
   The White House did not respond directly to Perot's remarks but
cited a statement last week by former spokesman Michael D. McCurry.
He said Perot's comments ``indicate the good judgment the American
people had when they failed to elect him president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, former President Gerald R. Ford broke his silence on
the Clinton scandal by laying out a scenario to resolve the matter
without impeaching Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine ... a Presidential appearance in the closing days of
this year, not at the rostrum familiar to viewers from moments of
triumph, but in the well of the House. Imagine a President
receiving not an ovation from the people's representatives, but a
harshly worded rebuke as rendered by members of both parties,''
Ford wrote in an op-ed article Sunday in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Many Clinton allies support Ford's plan, but Republican leaders
are balking. ``I don't think you should start advocating what the
punishment might be until you know what the facts are,'' said
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Lott also said he was not sure he could trust the Clinton
administration in pending budget talks because, he said, White
House officials have privately threatened to shut down the
government for political gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``They basically have told me, `We'll wait and see. If it is to
our advantage to shut down the government we will; if it is not, we
won't,''' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokeswoman, Linda Ricci, denied Lott's
allegation. ``The administration has been very clear we do not seek
or advocate a shutdown,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Judiciary Committee meets Monday, the panel's chief
lawyer for Republican members, David P. Schippers, is expected to
recommend dropping one or more of 11 allegations against Clinton
that the committee received last month from independent counsel
Kenneth W. Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Members of both parties have said they see insufficient
evidence, for example, to support Starr's assertion that Clinton
abused the power of his office when he invoked executive privilege
to try to prevent his lawyers from testifying before a grand jury
about their personal conversations with him.
</P>
<P>
   However, Schippers also plans to recommend investigating
additional charges that Clinton lied under oath in testifying
before a federal grand jury and in a civil deposition in the Paula
Corbin Jones lawsuit.

 &HT;    By any name, Saturday slate will be critical
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You can call it ``Showdown Saturday'' or you can call
it ``Shakedown Saturday.'' No matter what you call it, if you're a
college football fan, you better watch at least one of these games
during the coming weekend. After this Saturday, the national
championship race will begin to take shape:
</P>
<P>
   --Tennessee (4-0) at Georgia (4-0): The winner has the inside
track to the SEC East championship and will be the league's best
hope of placing a team in the Fiesta Bowl. The last time the
Bulldogs beat the Vols (1988), Vince Dooley was beginning his last
season as coach. ESPN's Game Day is coming to the biggest home game
in Athens since Tennessee-Georgia in '92.
</P>
<P>
   --LSU (3-1) at Florida (4-1): LSU is still licking its wounds
after Saturday night's 28-27 loss to Georgia and can't be looking
forward to going to The Swamp, where the Tigers were pummeled 56-10
two seasons ago. ``We can mope the rest of the season or we can try
to come back,'' said coach Gerry DiNardo. Florida was lucky to
escape with a 16-10 win at Alabama and coach Steve Spurrier knows
it. This will not be a fun week around Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   --UCLA (3-0) at Arizona (5-0): Arizona has become the dark horse
team in the Pac-10 after Saturday night's dramatic 31-28 win over
Washington. UCLA has better talent, but could struggle at Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   --Nebraska (5-0) at Texas A&AMP;M (4-1): After struggling to beat
Oklahoma State 24-17 Saturday night, the No. 2 Cornhuskers should
bounce back and spank the Aggies, who also looked lackluster in
beating Kansas 24-21.
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning quarterback
</P>
<P>
   Expect Spurrier to decide on a quarterback and stick with him
before Saturday's game with LSU. After scoring only one touchdown
at Alabama Saturday, Spurrier is finally convinced that alternating
Doug Johnson and Jesse Palmer is killing offensive consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of this zig-zagging around,'' said Spurrier. Our
money is on Johnson, who completed 10 of 20 passes for 187 yards.
</P>
<P>
   --The mood was not much better at Florida State after the
Seminoles needed a school-record five field goals from Sebastian
Janikowski to beat Maryland 24-10. ``It felt worse than a loss,''
said defensive end Tony Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   --Auburn now has a quarterback controversy. Regardless of how
fast sophomore Ben Leard comes back from an elbow injury suffered
against Tennessee, there will be pressure to play true freshman
Gabe Gross, who came off the bench and did some good things in the
17-9 loss to the Volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks like Ben has a battle on his hands,'' conceded coach
Terry Bowden. Gross was 7-of-15 for 112 yards. The injury to Leard
was so unexpected that Gross was out on the field not knowing a lot
of the Auburn offense. ``I didn't think he knew what any play
was,'' said Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   Worth noting
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee quarterback Tee Martin almost got hit in the head with
a full soft drink bottle after Saturday's game at Auburn. Someone
from the upper deck of Jordan-Hare Stadium dropped the bottle near
Tennessee's postgame interview area behind the stadium. Later,
Tennessee running back Jamal Lewis left the locker room with a
police escort and did not give interviews. He had an ice bag taped
to his right knee but his injury is not believed to be serious.
</P>
<P>
   --With 350 yards and five touchdowns in Saturday's 54-33 win
over Iowa State, Ricky Williams of Texas is now fourth on the NCAA
career rushing list with 5,241 yards. He's 841 yards shy of Tony
Dorsett's career record of 6,082. He needs to average 140 yards in
his final six games to reach that mark.
</P>
<P>
   --Keep an eye on Tulane, 4-0 after Saturday's big 21-7 win over
Southern Mississippi. The Green Wave forced six turnovers and won
even though quarterback Shaun King played with a cast on his left
wrist. Also keep an eye on coach Tommy Bowden, who is being
mentioned as a possible candidate at Clemson or South Carolina if
either makes a change.
</P>
<P>
   --While you were sleeping, Arizona QB Ortege Jenkins made one of
the plays of the year. Jenkins scored on a 9-yard run with four
seconds remaining when he somersaulted over three Washington
defenders into the end zone. The acrobatic play gave the Wildcats a
24-20 win and kept them undefeated going into Saturday's game with
UCLA.

 &HT;    Freshman QB leads Georgia to 28-27 upset of sixth-ranked LSU
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. _ Last week, Hurricane Georges swept just east
of the Louisiana coast, leaving LSU and Baton Rouge pretty much
unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, the sixth-ranked Tigers weren't so fortunate
with Quincy.
</P>
<P>
   Quincy Carter, Georgia's freshman quarterback, whipped through
Baton Rouge with a fury, leading the 12th-ranked Bulldogs to a
shocking 28-27 upset of LSU. Carter, making only his fourth career
start, passed for 318 yards and two touchdowns to stun a crowd of
80,792, the second-largest ever at Tiger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, 4-0 overall 2-0 in the Southeastern Conference, now
faces a much-anticipated showdown next week with third-ranked
Tennessee in Athens. If Georgia vaults into the top 10 today as
expected, it would be the first matchup of top 10 teams in Sanford
Stadium since No. 3 Auburn and No. 4 Georgia met in 1983.
``Tennessee is a big one,'' senior defensive end Antonio Cochran
said. ``It's been a long time coming. They've beaten us seven
straight times and it's about time it should end.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia could have its best shot in recent years with Carter,
the former Parade All-American from Southwest DeKalb High. Carter,
who entered the game as the nation's ninth-rated passer, thrust
himself among the nation's best, using his toughest test to date as
a coming-out party in front of a national television audience on
ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Carter completed his first 15 passes, tying Eric Zeier for the
Georgia record, and led the Bulldogs to touchdowns on their first
three drives. He completed 27 of 34 passes, and added 41 rushing
yards on 14 attempts. Carter even had a 36-yard reception on a
halfback pass to set up Georgia's third touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's apparent that Quincy can make all the plays a lot of
other guys can't,'' Georgia coach Jim Donnan said. ''I knew he was
a good player, but that was big, going out and playing like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's saavy and poise in Georgia's final drive was uncanny.
</P>
<P>
   Facing third-and-6 at the Bulldogs' 24 with less than three
minutes remaining, Carter barely got away a pass as he was hit by
LSU nose guard Anthony McFarland. Georgia's two-way player and
Heisman Trophy candidate, junior Champ Bailey, beat free safety
Mark Roman for the pass, giving the Bulldogs a clinching first down
at the Dogs' 45.
</P>
<P>
   ''Quincy just threw it up there for me to go get it,'' Bailey
said. ''It was right where it needed to be, where the defensive
back couldn't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Five plays later, Georgia running back Robert Arnaud gained 6
yards on third-and-3 at the LSU 37 for a first down, which sent the
large contingency of Georgia fans in the south end zone into a
frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was good to see us operate like that,'' said Donnan, who
huddled his team on the sidelines before its final drive. ''With
the game on the line and in the clutch, we didn't give them the
ball back. I just told the team that the game was on the line and
we couldn't give the ball back. I told them we needed to get three
first downs, but I didn't think we'd get them like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter was the story of the game, but Georgia's defense, porous
throughout the entire contest against LSU's one-two punch of
quarterback Herb Tyler and tailback Kevin Faulk, came up big late.
</P>
<P>
   On consecutive possessions in the fourth quarter, the Bulldogs
forced LSU into field goals after the Tigers drove inside the
Georgia 20. Chris Chauvin kicked a 41-yard field goal with 5:08
left to pull LSU within one, 28-27.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Chauvin kicked a 34-yard field goal with 10:27 left to
make it 28-24.
</P>
<P>
   ''The defense in the second half was just what we had to do,''
Donnan said. ''We gave up some yards, but we held them to two field
goals.''
</P>
<P>
   After a wild first half, in which touchdowns were scored on the
first five possessions and the teams left tied at 21-21, Georgia
opened the third quarter by holding LSU to a punt, only its second
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs took over at their own 25 and moved deep into LSU
territory. On second-and-10 from the LSU 17, Carter threw for
senior flanker Tony Small in the end zone. Small, who finished with
eight catches for 81 yards, pulled the ball away from free safety
Ryan Clark for a 17-yard touchdown. Hap Hines' extra point made it
28-21 with 8:16 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's defense struggled in the first half, but held Faulk to
only 88 yards on 17 carries. Tyler completed 16 of 26 attempts for
205 yards and two touchdowns, but in the fourth quarter, he was
incomplete on his only attempts and was sacked twice.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's our job to keep them out of the end zone,'' Cochran said.
''This was a big game, but the next one is even bigger. It's going
to determine who's ahead in the SEC East and it's big. It's really
big.''

 &HT;    Donnan again accuses Tennessee of running up score last season
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS _ Georgia football coach Jim Donnan wasted little time
Sunday in throwing the first stone in the Bulldogs' growing rivalry
with Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan, who was visibly upset with Volunteers coach Phillip
Fulmer in the final minutes of last year's game in Knoxville, again
accused the Tennessee coach of running up the score in the Dogs'
38-13 loss.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 7 Bulldogs meet No. 4 Tennessee in a critical SEC
showdown Saturday in Sanford Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel like we conceded the game when we punted (on
Georgia's final possession),'' Donnan said. ``My opinion was that
the game was over, so why did he go and put his No. 1 quarterback
in there? But that's his preogative and he's got to run his team.''
</P>
<P>
   With Tennessee holding a 31-13 lead with less than two minutes
remaining last year, Fulmer stayed with Heisman Trophy candidate
Peyton Manning at quarterback. Manning threw a 15-yard touchdown
pass with 1:44 left. Fulmer defended the action during a media
conference call Sunday, saying Manning wouldn't have thrown if
Georgia hadn't blitzed.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan stood on the Georgia sideline shouting across the field
at Fulmer. After the game, Donnan angrily spoke with Fulmer at
midfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I regret was the fact that he made it public when I
whispered it in his ear,'' Donnan said. ``I would have never said
that publicly to someone. If he told anybody, it was because he
wanted someone to hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer wouldn't elaborate on the incident, saying only that
Donnan hasn't offered an apology.

 &HT;    Do the Falcons make the grade?
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OFFENSE
</P>
<P>
   PASSING GAME: B
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Chris Chandler had touchdown passes of 30 yards to
Tony Martin and 26 to seldom-used tight end O.J. Santiago, as well
as key long gainers to Jamal Anderson (27 on a screen) and Terance
Mathis (38 on play action). He also had his first career reception,
catching a 22-yarder on a halfback option from Tim Dwight. The
downside was two interceptions (Rod Smith and Greg Lloyd) and a
near third pickoff that was dropped by Smith. Pass protection gets
high marks, as Carolina was limited to one sack.
</P>
<P>
   RUNNING GAME: A
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Anderson rushed for more than 100 yards (117 on 31
attempts) in consecutive weeks for the first time in his career.
The long runs of 20 yards came early (Atlanta's first offensive
possession, a touchdown drive) and late (a 20-yard touchdown on a
draw play). The effectiveness of the running game early made
Carolina more tentative with its blitz. The line blocked well,
particularly between the tackles.
</P>
<P>
   RETURN GAME: A-MINUS
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Tim Dwight, a fourth-round pick, has been one of the
great finds in the draft. He returned the opening kickoff 93 yards
for a touchdown and averaged 25.3 yards on his other three
runbacks. The only blunder on a return came in the second quarter,
when Devin Bush, playing in his first game of the year, was ejected
for cheap-shotting Leonard Wheeler after the whistle on a punt
return. Morten Andersen made all three of his field goal attempts
(23, 25, 28).
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   VS. THE PASS: C
</P>
<P>
   Granted, many of the Panthers' yards came when the game was out
of reach. But the Falcons' secondary took some hits, as Kerry
Collins threw for 302 yards and three touchdowns. Big plays
included Raghib Ismail beating Ray Buchanan (46 yards), Wesley
Walls beating Jessie Tuggle (24-yard touchdown) and Muhsin Muhammad
beating Ronnie Bradford (72-yard touchdown). On the plus side,
Buchanan had an interception at the goal line when the Falcons led
14-3. William White had three big plays in the second half _ an
18-yard fumble return for a TD (Muhammad dropped the ball after a
reception), an interception with a 36-yard return and a forced
fumble against tight end Luther Broughton that Ronnie Bradford
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   VS. THE RUN: B-MINUS
</P>
<P>
   Carolina's Fred Lane ran the ball well early, but the Panthers
had to abandon the running game when the score became lopsided. The
Falcons also had two dumb penalties on running plays _ a face mask
by Eugene Robinson and an unnecessary roughness by Lester
Archambeau.
</P>
<P>
   COVERAGE GAME: A
</P>
<P>
   Carolina did not have a significant kickoff return all game and
did not bring back a punt against Dan Stryzinski. Travis Hall
blocked his second PAT attempt of the season.

   FIRST HALF ROUNDUP
</P>
<P>
   FIRST QUARTER: The Falcons took advantage of Carolina's special
teams miscues to bolt to a 14-0 lead less than 6:30 into the
quarter. WR Tim Dwight returned the opening kickoff 93 yards for a
score. After Panthers PK John Kasay missed a 54-yard field goal,
Atlanta drove 56 yards on five plays, scoring when WR Tony Martin
beat FS Brent Alexander on a deep post to take a 30-yard touchdown
pass from QB Chris Chandler. Score: Falcons 14, Carolina 3.
</P>
<P>
   SECOND QUARTER: Carolina continued to miss opportunities to get
back into the game. The Panthers failed to recover a fumble at the
Atlanta 13-yard line after LB Kevin Greene overwhelmed a
double-team block by OT Ephraim Salaam and FB Gary Downs. A few
minutes later, QB Kerry Collins underthrew TE Wesley Walls in the

 &HT;    The Dwight stuff: Falcons' rookie starts 51-23 assault on
Carolina
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When rookie Tim Dwight showed up at Falcons passing
camp in June, teammates noticed right away that he was different.
So Atlanta Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler hung a nickname on
him in no time flat. ``Mutt,'' Chandler called him, and the moniker
seems to fit.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight, a 5-foot-8, 181-pounder from Iowa and the Falcons'
smallest player, stood out again Sunday in the Georgia Dome. His
93-yard touchdown on the opening kickoff opened the floodgates, and
Atlanta proceeded to massacre the Carolina Panthers 51-23.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, which included an NFL-record three touchdowns in 48
seconds to start the second half, had the Falcons (3-1) tied atop
the NFC West standings with San Francisco and New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, who caught a 22-yard pass from Dwight off a reverse
play to set up a Morten Andersen field goal and a 17-3 halftime
lead, was smiling about Dwight's performance after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight, after all, is not like his teammates. They drive
luxurious cars; he drives an old Isuzu Pup pickup truck. The truck
is borrowed from a friend at the University of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes there's a tendency for rookies to not go all out
because they're still learning,'' Chandler said after completing
12-of-20 passes for 189 yards, two TDs and two interceptions.
``Mutt's come in here and been a live wire. He's a funny little
sucker to be around, too. He just goes all out.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwight, who returned four kickoffs for 169 yards, rushed twice
for 7 yards from the tailback position and completed the first pass
of his career, seemed unfazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just call me a utility man,'' he said. ``I don't care where I
play; just put me on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' first-ever sweep of Carolina didn't sit well with
the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like when you were a kid and your mom sent you to karate
class and the bully slapped you anyway,'' said Carolina linebacker
Michael Barrow. ``Tell everybody to pray for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' onslaught was that bad.
</P>
<P>
   On the first possession after Dwight's kickoff return, Atlanta
drove 56 yards in five plays and took a 14-0 lead on a 30-yard pass
over the middle to wide receiver Tony Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Then things got ugly after halftime.
</P>
<P>
   After catching a 13-yard pass, Carolina reserve tight end Luther
Broughton got hit by strong safety William White and defensive end
Lester Archambeau and fumbled the ball into the hands of Falcons
cornerback Ronnie Bradford.
</P>
<P>
   An 11-play, 78-yard drive ended with a 1-yard touchdown run by
fullback Bob Christian, and Atlanta led 24-3 with 6:27 left in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina running back Fred Lane turned the ball over on the next
play from scrimmage after Archambeau caused, and recovered, the
fumble. Chandler passed to tight end O.J. Santiago down the middle
for a 26-yard scoring pass to give the Falcons a 31-3 lead with
6:01 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On the Panthers' next play from scrimmage, wide receiver Muhsin
Muhammad caught a short pass over the middle, tripped over his own
feet, and fumbled into the hands of a stunned White, who returned
it 18 yards down the left sideline for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got our butts beat,'' Carolina quarterback Kerry Collins
said. ``We're terrible. We're bad. I don't know what to say. We're
embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolina had called the Falcons 19-14 victory on Sept. 6 a
fluke, and the Falcons appeared motivated by the statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't go out and say things about a team you have to play
again,'' Falcons middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To read something like that,'' said Atlanta running back Jamal
Anderson, who had 117 yards for the first back-to-back 100-yard
games of his career, ``'it's disappointing when somebody blatantly
disrespects you like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, White, who added an interception in the fourth
quarter, was talking about how good everybody is feeling right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we keep believing, and going out and playing the
way we're capable of playing, everyone will jump on the
bandwagon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The next step comes in New York on Sunday, when the Falcons play
coach Dan Reeves' old team, the Giants, in the ESPN Sunday night
game. The Giants (2-3) pose another hurdle for a Falcons team that
is trying to prove itself. Atlanta has won nine of 12 since last
season's 1-7 start, but has yet to bet a team with a winning
record.
</P>
<P>
   Their three victories have come against teams that are a
combined 0-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the middle of last year, we've beaten the teams we're
kind of supposed to beat,'' Reeves said. ``If you want to take that
next step . . . we got to start beating some of the better teams,
some of the teams that are in the playoff hunt. (The Giants) were a
playoff team last year, and they're . . . the defending NFC East
champions.

 &HT;    Just who are these guys, anyway?
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE MOUNTAIN, Ga. _ What kind of a tournament field is this?
Ben Crenshaw and Tom Kite, Ryder Cup captains past and present; Tom
Watson, Sandy Lyle, David Frost, Jim Furyk and Jay Haas can't make
the cut, then we wind up with a dogfight down the stretch between a
player who got his start coaching a college team, Willie Nelson's
personal pro, the pro from surgery and the only Aussie in Harris
County. Oh, and the ever-present Skip Kendall, who always seems to
pop up, popped up again with a 63 while nobody was looking.
</P>
<P>
   So at the end of a weathery Sunday, the defenseless old Mountain
View course heaved mightily, rejoicing to see the 1998 Buick
Challenge tournament cast get out of town. Callaway Gardens hadn't
seen such a field as this since the PGA moved its tournament to
this family resort, and when all was done, the Australian took home
the loot. It was the second time Steve Elkington had won this
tournament, but this time he had to take it one more hole.
</P>
<P>
   For the first 54 holes, the tournament belonged to Fred Funk,
the former coach from Maryland. Over the last 18, Elkington caught
and blew past like the cartoon critter, the roadrunner. The playoff
lasted one hole, on which Funk hit his tee shot in a fairway
bunker, his escape shot caught the lip and the rest was purely
academic. In fact, Funk started to shake Elkington's hand in
surrender before he holed out his par putt.
</P>
<P>
   It was ironic, for Funk is known for his driving accuracy, if
not his distance. ``Hitting straight has been my bread and
butter,'' he said, ``and two bad drives kept me from winning in
regulation, then I hit my worst drive of the week on the playoff
hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Weather was the players' best friend. Heavy rain left the
fairways soft, the greens receptive and the air oppressively humid.
Early morning fog nearly delayed first tee times. If it had been an
airport, planes couldn't have landed. Then near the conclusion, sun
shining bright, streaks of lightning broke through and held up play
a short time. Only the leaders were left on course, Elkington,
Funk, Bill Glasson, the star from surgery, and J.L. Lewis, the
Texas pro from Willie Nelson. Elkington himself might be called the
pro from Buick, for he is a member of the carmaker's stable of
players.
</P>
<P>
   He birdied 17 and 18 for 65. Funk birdied 17 but was a foot wide
on 18 for a 69, a tie at 267, setting up the playoff. Still, ``Just
get in a playoff, I said to myself,'' Elkington said. ``Jack Burke
(a great name from another era and neighbor near Houston) once told
me, `There's nothing wrong with a playoff. It's just two of you.
You eliminate 140 other guys.' So I was really hoping for a
playoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Elkington had won here four years ago, Funk a year later, but
this one hurt, cut him deeply. Conditions were perfect for scoring.
Of those who made the cut, only two players finished over par, Guy
Boros, whose daddy was Julius, and Iain Steel, a rookie from
Scotland. As for the Tour Championship, coming up later this month
at East Lake, there was little movement in the field, though
Kendall's 63 did move him up within easy striking distance. And
Funk won't go home and lick his wounds. Second place moved him
safely into the field for the pot-at-the-end-of-the-rainbow
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Elkington has a long-shot's chance, but for now it's on to
Scotland for the Dunhill Cup, one of those international affairs.
He'll represent Australia with Craig Parry and Stuart Appleby.

 &HT;    Connors uses BTI final to finally defeat Wilander
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jimmy Connors achieved Sunday what 20 years on the ATP
Tour never wrought _ a victory over Mats Wilander. Connors won 6-2,
6-1 in the final of the BTI Champions, ending a five-match losing
streak in a rivalry that's been dormant for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of my better matches in about six years,'' Connors
said. ``That's a day that maybe you have once or twice a year,
where you go out and everything works, and even when you're late
you hit a shot good enough to keep you in.''
</P>
<P>
   Connors, 46, is 15-3 on the tour this season, and two of the
losses came when he withdrew with a foot injury. He's won five of
the eight tournaments he's entered and took over first place in the
points standings from John McEnroe with this victory.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first Nuveen Tour event for Wilander, who must be
granted wild cards to play until he turns 35 next August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't kid yourself, he'll get better in a hurry,'' Connors
said. ``He hasn't played that many matches. He's been away from
tennis for a while, and he's no different than anyone else. It'll
take him a while.''
</P>
<P>
   All five previous Connors-Wilander matches were played between
1984 and '88, after Connors had turned 32. Wilander won five Grand
Slam singles titles in that span and reached No. 1 in the world for
20 weeks at the end of 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never felt like anyone was stronger than me mentally then,
and I didn't think Jimmy Connors was,'' Wilander said. ``I had a
game where I could run his balls down, I could mix my game up, play
topspin and hit a lot of slices, and I could do it on different
surfaces. ... I realize now that's why I was as good as I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilander didn't seem surprised, though, that a man 12 years
older than him could win so decisively.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, Jimmy was in the semifinals of the U.S. Open
seven years ago, and that was the last year I played the tour
full-time,'' Wilander said. ``He's one of the few guys that's kept
playing the whole time and never put his racquet down for more than
a month or two, which is very wise. He's not much different now. He
played unbelievably.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: Johan Kriek and Mel Purcell defeated local qualifiers Ned
Caswell and Howard Herr 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) in the doubles final.
Caswell and Herr, both teaching pros, split $4,000 for the week....
Sunday's announced attendance was 2,160, bringing the week's
eight-session total to 12,826, the lowest among the 11 U.S. stops
this season.

CLINTON TO JOIN EXTRAORDINARY IMF SESSION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER   AND PETER G. GOSSELIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton joins an extraordinary meeting
Monday of 22 nations on the global financial crisis, there are new
pressures on a bedrock principle that has guided US economic policy
for the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Cold War ended, the United States has argued that
investors should be able to move their money to companies anywhere
in the world that will use it productively, and that governments
should get out of the way most of the time. Through the free
movement of capital, the reasoning went, the wealth of industrial
nations could help emerging nations build strong factories, labor
forces, and economies.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, top finance officials from the seven major
industrial nations meet here with counterparts from 15 developing
nations to survey a far different world from the one that US policy
envisioned. One-quarter of the globe is in recession, and millions
of people have slipped into poverty. US job growth is slowing, and
fears of a worldwide slump have cut stock values worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even some US allies are calling for new constraints on
markets and on investors, whom they blame for making the Asian
crisis worse by their panic withdrawal of billions of dollars from
Asian nations, leaving companies bankrupt and workers without jobs.
</P>
<P>
   France said Sunday that some nations, in times of crisis, should
be able to restrict investors from moving money into or out of a
country.
</P>
<P>
   The Commonwealth of 54 countries, which includes Britain and its
former colonies, said nations should be able to suspend debt
payments in a crisis without triggering default. And some people,
including leaders of developing nations and economists well in the
US academic mainstream, are proposing more radical solutions, such
as a more powerful International Monetary Fund or a global Federal
Reserve Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, nobody knows what the one true path is, and I'd
like to see a somewhat forgiving attitude toward countries that try
different policies to find out what that path is,'' Paul Krugman,
an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has
become a leading thinker on the crisis, said in a speech Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very contentious thing,'' said Morris Goldstein, a
former IMF official who is now with the Institute for International
Economics, a Washington think tank. ``For a lot of these countries,
this is their Great Depression. As people get more desperate, you
get more desperate solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial crisis, which began in Thailand 16 months ago and
spread to Russia, Brazil, and elsewhere, challenges the US position
that investors should be able to place their money freely or to buy
and sell any currency. It is a relatively new idea. While
supporting free trade in goods, many nations, including industrial
countries, maintained restrictions on money flows and investment
into the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Challenging the US view, countries with relatively closed
economies, such as China and India, have remained relatively stable
in the current crisis, while disaster has struck South Korea,
Thailand, and other nations that opened themselves to foreign
investors. These nations suffered as investors, who poured $100
billion into emerging Asian nations in 1996, caused havoc by
withdrawing that amount in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Prompting alarm in the West, Malaysia recently followed the path
of China and India, suspending trading in its currency while
invoking tough new limits on removing money from the country. Some
Western leaders expressed fear that other nations would decide to
``check out'' of the global economy in desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's meeting was called six months ago as ripples from the
Asian crisis spread across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   It will bring the so-called Group of Seven industrial nations _
the United States, Japan, Britain, Germany, France, Italy, and
Canada _ together with 15 emerging market nations to discuss the
``global financial architecture,'' a broad term that refers to the
IMF, the World Bank, and other agencies that were created to keep
the world economy running smoothly and to help developing nations.
The ``architecture'' also refers to a range of laws, as well as
business practices of private companies, for carrying out global
investment.
</P>
<P>
   These nations are considering many proposals that could help the
world economy in the short run.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Japan have lowered interest rates in
recent weeks, which spurs economic activity in those countries, and
European nations are under pressure to do the same. Japan has
proposed spending $30 billion of its own money to aid the ailing
economies of its East Asian neighbors. And Western nations appear
to be backing a package of rescue loans from the IMF, which they
largely control, to Brazil, the largest economy in South America,
which threatens to become the next victim of the financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday's meeting is likely to consider proposals that will
help the world economy in the long term, ideas aimed at preventing
the next global crisis. Generally, the people trying to fashion a
new system fall into three camps, divided by their view of free
markets and liberal investment rules:
</P>
<P>
   _The Incrementalists. They include many Western officials, such
as Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. In their view, free markets
generally work well. The main problem, they argue is that investors
sometimes make bad decisions because they are deprived of good
information by banks, companies, and governments, particularly in
developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, a host of anti-fraud rules and the
Securities and Exchange Commission allow people to invest with
confidence. Rubin and others want the global finance system to
develop something equivalent. They talk of requiring more
``transparency,'' which generally calls on foreign companies to
adopt American-style accounting practices that allow investors and
lenders to see more clearly into the financial workings of their
business partners.
</P>
<P>
   They also focus on the need for US-style bank regulation to
prevent the kind of reckless borrowing and lending that many said
was at the root of the Asian collapse.
</P>
<P>
   _Freer-marketers. Broadly speaking, they want to remove all
controls on investors, and they tend to believe that agencies like
the IMF distort markets and force investors to make bad decisions.
Representative Jim Saxton, Republican of New Jersey, one of the
leading IMF critics in Congress, said emergency loans, like the
type the IMF offered last year to South Korea, Thailand, and
Indonesia, are counterproductive, as they encourage investors to
place risky bets in the belief that the international community
will bail them out.
</P>
<P>
   _The ``Plan B'' types. Like Krugman, the MIT economist, they say
the Western prescription has failed, and it is time to try a Plan
B. Generally, they say governments should be able to put more
constraints on markets and investors.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocate capital controls to keep ``hot money'' from
flowing too quickly in or out of a country. A country could impose
a tax on investment or follow Chile, which until recently required
companies that borrowed foreign money to place 30 percent in the
Chilean central bank as a reserve that could be used if conditions
worsen. Others are calling for a ``super-IMF'' or global Federal
Reserve Bank, which would bring the same kind of stability to the
world economy that the US Fed has to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Another set of proposals would address the fact that many
emerging nations are mired in debt, which has only become harder to
pay off as their currencies have fallen in value. Some nations owe
so much to lenders that they have little money to spend in their
own economies to spur growth. These nations might be able to set
new terms for repaying their debt, or even suspend payments without
incurring penalties from the IMF or other global institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Although US officials have been vague about their plans, some
analysts said they expect the United States will eventually endorse
an approach similar to that used during the debt crisis of the
early 1980s. The United States agreed to partly guarantee what was
called ``Brady bonds,'' which were issued by the debtor nations and
given to lenders in return for writing off their loans.

CARDOSO HEADED FOR REELECTION IN BRAZIL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO _ President Fernando Henrique Cardoso appeared to
be headed for victory Sunday in his bid to become Brazil's first
re-elected leader, in elections that seemed driven more by economic
worries than by political ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's Superior Electoral Tribunal said early in the evening
that with 16.3 percent of ballots counted, Cardoso had 50.9 percent
of valid votes, just enough to avoid a second-round runoff. A
leftist candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, had 34.4 percent of
valid votes, according to the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   There has been little doubt in this country of 164 million that
the 67-year-old Cardoso, a popular Social Democrat, would win. But
his victory demonstrated the hope by Brazilians that he could
strengthen an $800 billion economy that has been rocked over the
past two months by crises in Asia and Russia, and whose collapse
could threaten markets and companies in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has lost nearly $30 billion in foreign capital since
August, prompting a steep rise in interest rates. The country's
currency, the real, appears headed for devaluation. Government
officials have met recently with the International Monetary Fund
and other agencies to negotiate a package of loans, but no
agreement has been announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard from people in places like New York's stock
market speak about Brazil'' by pulling out their investments, said
Joao Mendonca, 22, a local worker for Cardoso's Social Democratic
Party. ``Now it's time for Brazilian people to speak up with their
votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso, a former finance minister, was the architect of the
1994 anti-inflation plan that now appears to be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   He persuaded Congress last year to lift a ban that had
prohibited executive office holders from serving two consecutive
terms. Now Cardoso needs congressional approval for three new
constitutional changes he has proposed to slow the government's
growing deficit and to restore investor confidence in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   As an intense sun bore down on this beach-ringed resort city of
5 million residents Sunday, voters dutifully cast their votes as
the law demands for citizens over 18. Throughout the country,
Brazilians reported to elementary schools, government bank branches
and post offices, which for the day were converted into polling
precincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been cloudy lately, so the sun feels especially good,''
said Yvonne Rodrigues, an ebony-haired 24-year-old hotel worker who
cast her ballot in the morning and spent the afternoon at
Copacabana beach with two friends. ``The beach can either be a
distraction from voting or it can be your reward, depending on what
kind of person you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Even along Avenida Atlantico, the glittery drive that runs the
length of Impanema and Copacabana beaches, there was plenty of
politics to be seen and heard. Youngsters waved larger-than-life
banners promoting candidates, beach vendors peddling peanuts and
beer wore campaign hats, and the white marbled sidewalks were
coated with flyers.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Protasio cast his ballot the way most urban voters do,
electronically, by punching a number into a small box. An image of
the candidate assigned to that number appeared on a screen. Another
button must be pressed to confirm the selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the most important issue is our ecology and making sure
we use our resources in the best way possible,'' said Protasio, a
28-year-old computer worker and volunteer for the Green Party who
voted for one Cardoso's opponents, Ciro Gomes. ``Yes the economy is
important, but it's all tied together, economy and ecology.
</P>
<P>
   After casting their ballots, voters receive government-issued
receipts as proof of their vote. Those who do not vote run the risk
of being called before an administrative judge and cut off from
some public services, such as obtaining a passport.
</P>
<P>
   Marinha Lopes, a 55-year-old waitress in a family-owned
restaurant, did not mind the voting requirement on a day when it
seemed that most everyone headed for the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the beach type because I don't really have the body
for it,'' said Lopes, who voted for Cardoso. ``Besides, I think
it's important to vote and to help keep the economy going strong.
He's the only one who can do that.''

ON BASEBALL: IT'S OCTOBER, SO EXPECT THE SECOND-GUESSERS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Yankees were only four outs from advancing to the American
League Championship Series for the second straight season last year
when Sandy Alomar Jr. swatted a stunning, game-tying home run off
Mariano Rivera. The Cleveland Indians scored the winning run the
next inning, won the next day as well and went on to win the
American League pennant.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians were two outs away from winning the World Series
when Jose Mesa, their Mariano Rivera, gave up the game-tying run.
The Florida Marlins won the game in the 11th inning, and they, not
the Indians, succeeded the Yankees as World Series champions.
</P>
<P>
   Life in postseason baseball is that fragile. The high wire blows
wildly in the wind, and the best collection of players doesn't
always make it safely to the other side.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves have learned that reality all too often in
this decade. They have reached the National League Championship
Series this season for an unprecedented seventh successive time,
and they have only one World Series championship to show for their
success.
</P>
<P>
   That development has prompted some blurry-minded critics to
belittle the Braves as underachievers. The same mentality is
starting to go after the Indians, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians are in the playoffs for the fourth consecutive year.
In their first three October trips, they reached the World Series
twice. They won neither time, losing a year ago to the Marlins
after affording the Braves their lone conquest in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who block the Indians' way to this year's World
Series and look as formidable as the former Berlin wall, could
invite their own line of criticism should they fail to beat the
Indians. They would be belittled for falling short of the level
that a team with 114 regular-season victories should achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Critics are everywhere. Frankly, John Schuerholz is tired of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't help people if they're going to continue to use World
Series wins as the criteria for what your ultimate success has
been,'' Schuerholz, the Atlanta general manager, said Sunday, not
24 hours after the Braves completed their three-game sweep of the
wild-card Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think appearing in seven consecutive National League
Championship Series is fairly remarkable on its own. No one's ever
done that. I think with the wild card it will be even harder for
people to do. We had talented enough teams to win another World
Series or two. We didn't. I'd like to win another World Series or
two so I don't have to answer this question.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeating as World Series champions has basically been
eliminated from the realm of the likely. In the past 20 years only
the Toronto Blue Jays of 1992 and '93 won successive World Series.
The path to the ultimate round of postseason games is rife with
potholes, if not mines.
</P>
<P>
   Many baseball people say only the wealthiest teams have a chance
to reach the postseason, let alone the World Series, but money can
only buy a ticket to watch the World Series games, not play in
them. The Baltimore Orioles could have bought a lot of tickets with
the nearly $70 million they spent on players' salaries this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one more layer of survival demanded of you,''
Schuerholz said by telephone from his home in Atlanta, referring to
the division series that was implemented along with the wild card
in 1995. ``It's a 15-round heavyweight fight instead of a 10-round
heavyweight fight. It's challenging.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have managed to survive the new first round each
year, executing three-game sweeps the last three years. But they
have struggled in the last two league championship rounds, rallying
from a three-games-to-one deficit to knock off St. Louis in 1996,
then falling to Florida last year, 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't understand how very difficult it is to put
yourself in position to be in contention for that `ultimate'
measuring criterion, that is, a world championship,'' Schuerholz
said. ``There's no denying it would be a lot nicer and simpler had
we won in '91, which maybe we should have or would have except for
some bad base-running, or in '96 when we had a two-games-to-none
lead. Then all of this would be moot. But we didn't, so the
question keeps being asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Braves have won only the 1995 World Series, their
manager, Bobby Cox, suffers criticism for alleged failure instead
of receiving recognition for keeping complacency out of his
clubhouse and keeping his players focused on returning to October
each year.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hargrove has begun to be labeled with some of the same
unfair talk that Cox has heard. If Cleveland falls short again this
season _ and the Yankees are certainly expected to end the Indians'
season in the next four to seven games _ some people may even call
for Hargrove's head. His dismissal, at least.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams, the Boston manager, was criticized for starting
Pete Schourek instead of Pedro Martinez in Saturday's fourth game
with the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   But after Schourek pitched well enough for the Red Sox to win,
he was questioned for having Tom Gordon, his closer, pitch two
innings instead of one, as he had all season.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with the second second-guess was that Gordon
gave up the two runs that decided the game in his first inning of
work, not his second.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is Hargrove whose decisions will be scrutinized against
the Yankees, and Cox's whose moves will receive the same treatment
in the National League pennant playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be talented first, and somewhat fortunate as
well,'' Schuerholz said. ``I think we have the talent this year.
Hopefully we'll have good fortune as well.''

HYDE SAYS HE HOPES TO CONCLUDE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY BY YEAR'S END
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Citing public ``horror'' at the political maelstrom
surrounding President Clinton's sex scandal, Representative Henry
J. Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, expressed a
``hope and prayer'' Sunday that the panel would decide by New
Year's Day whether to seek Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's panel will vote Monday or Tuesday on whether to recommend
initiating the second impeachment inquiry of a president this
century _ and the first since Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   With several polls finding that the public favors a swift
congressional response to Clinton's crisis, Hyde issued his ``New
Year's resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats, meanwhile, said that Speaker Newt Gingrich is
controlling the impeachment process and trying to prolong the
inquiry into the 2000 presidential election season for political
gain.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee is likely to reject a Democratic
proposal that would set a Thanksgiving deadline to complete the
investigation. Under the GOP plan, which is expected to be approved
by the committee by tomorrow and the full House by Friday, the
panel would conduct an open-ended inquiry into allegations that
Clinton committed perjury, obstruction of justice, and witness
tampering stemming from his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how New Year's resolutions sometimes get broken, but
it's my hope and prayer that we could finish by New Year's,'' Hyde
said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet with Hyde holding out the possibility of expanding the
investigation to several other matters, Democrats on the Judiciary
Committee said the inquiry could drag on indefinitely. ``If all you
do is Lewinsky, you can't make that last more than a couple of
months,'' Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Newton, said on
ABC's ``This Week.'' ``What I am afraid we are going to get is an
impeachment in search of a high crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, 74, an Illinois Republican, said he recognizes how much
damage the matter has already caused the country and how
devastating the future consequences could be. Hyde was elected to
the House in 1974, just months after the Judiciary Committee voted
to impeach President Nixon, which led to Nixon's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our politics'' has suffered ``a serious blow,'' Hyde said.
``The name-calling, the negativity, the throwing of mud, the
institution of the White House, the presidency and Congress itself
_ people are looking at this in horror.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as Hyde prepared to preside over the impeachment
hearings, he said that if the House votes to impeach Clinton, the
Senate would not convict him in the current climate. A conviction
would require a vote of two-thirds of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't get that two-thirds bipartisan vote in the Senate''
in the current atmosphere, Hyde said. ``They won't do that until
the American people move, and they have to move from where they
apparently are, if the polls are true.''
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment proceedings are likely to produce moments of
high drama and low comedy as the Judiciary Committee enters a new
frontier in considering allegations stemming from a president's
sexual life in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But there will also be political sideshows, as several
developments underscored Sunday. Notable among them was a full-page
ad in The Washington Post in which Hustler magazine and its
publisher, Larry Flynt, offered as much as $1 million to
individuals who can prove they committed adultery with members of
Congress or high-ranking government officials.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire and former
presidential candidate, pressed his campaign for Clinton's
resignation by likening Clinton's ``lust for power'' to Adolf
Hitler's and alleging that Clinton's affair with Lewinsky may have
been associated with drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Perot, appearing on C-SPAN's ``Washington Journal,'' provided no
evidence to support his claim of possible drug use.
</P>
<P>
   The White House did not respond directly to Perot's remarks but
cited a statement last week by former spokesman Michael D. McCurry.
He said Perot's comments ``indicate the good judgment the American
people had when they failed to elect him president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, former President Gerald R. Ford broke his silence on
the Clinton scandal by laying out a scenario to resolve the matter
without impeaching Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine ... a Presidential appearance in the closing days of
this year, not at the rostrum familiar to viewers from moments of
triumph, but in the well of the House. Imagine a President
receiving not an ovation from the people's representatives, but a
harshly worded rebuke as rendered by members of both parties,''
Ford wrote in an op-ed article Sunday in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Many Clinton allies support Ford's plan, but Republican leaders
are balking. ``I don't think you should start advocating what the
punishment might be until you know what the facts are,'' said
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Lott also said he was not sure he could trust the Clinton
administration in pending budget talks because, he said, White
House officials have privately threatened to shut down the
government for political gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``They basically have told me, `We'll wait and see. If it is to
our advantage to shut down the government we will; if it is not, we
won't,''' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokeswoman, Linda Ricci, denied Lott's
allegation. ``The administration has been very clear we do not seek
or advocate a shutdown,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Judiciary Committee meets Monday, the panel's chief
lawyer for Republican members, David P. Schippers, is expected to
recommend dropping one or more of 11 allegations against Clinton
that the committee received last month from independent counsel
Kenneth W. Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Members of both parties have said they see insufficient
evidence, for example, to support Starr's assertion that Clinton
abused the power of his office when he invoked executive privilege
to try to prevent his lawyers from testifying before a grand jury
about their personal conversations with him.
</P>
<P>
   However, Schippers also plans to recommend investigating
additional charges that Clinton lied under oath in testifying
before a federal grand jury and in a civil deposition in the Paula
Corbin Jones lawsuit.

FOR ONCE, THE FRUSTRATION IS MARINO'S
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ In the closing minutes Sunday, as the
Jets were running the clock down to almost nothing and putting the
game out of reach, Dan Marino stood near midfield, away from his
Miami Dolphins teammates, one foot on the field. He was anxiously
waiting for another chance that never came.
</P>
<P>
   As anxious as Marino might have been, the Jets were equally
anxious. Marino has been a Jet killer over his career, dominating
them in a way that no other quarterback has dominated an opponent.
And after spending most of the game handing off and looking very
ordinary, in the fourth quarter he was starting to look like the
Marino that the Jets know and fear. But after he pulled the
Dolphins within a touchdown, the Jets put the game away with a
field goal in the final minute, stranding Marino on the sideline in
a 20-9 Jets victory.
</P>
<P>
   Marino, 37, has been a different quarterback this season,
deferring to an improved running game as Miami has strived for
balance on offense rather than relying on his arm. On the last
drive of the third quarter, the Dolphins ran the ball three
straight times. It wasn't until the fourth quarter, with the
Dolphins trailing by 17-3, that Marino opened up the offense,
completing 6-of-13 passes for 80 yards in a drive that cut the
deficit to 17-9. It was the 23rd consecutive game that he had
thrown a touchdown pass against the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our game plan was to be balanced, and it's going to probably
continue to be that,'' Marino said. ``I don't know how many times
we threw it, but we were talking about trying to open it up some.
Coming in, we thought that we would be able to run the ball better
than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami's running game was ineffective, producing just 34 yards on
15 carries, and for once, the Jets got the better of Marino,
sacking him three times. The last time the Jets got to Marino more
than once in a game was Sept. 12, 1993 _ not coincidentally, the
last time that they beat him. He had recorded seven consecutive
victories over the Jets since then.
</P>
<P>
   Marino completed just 13-of-31 passes Sunday, his worst
completion percentage ever against the Jets, and was picked off
twice, once on a desperation pass at the end of the first half.
Marino credited the Jets, rather than blaming Coach Jimmy Johnson's
conservative game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm frustrated when we lose,'' Marino said. ``There were
chances where I could have made throws. They had a pretty good
scheme. I've got to find a way to make some throws that are going
to help this team. We just didn't have enough offense today to stay
in the game.''

THIS IS FISHER'S PRICE TO PAY
</HEADLINE>
 THE WALL-COLUMN-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The poster outside the Sears store at the Media City Center in
Burbank, Calif., invited customers in Sunday to the store's new
licensed-apparel section to meet Derek Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers' new starting guard?
</P>
<P>
   Well, around here, he's known as ``Guard, Basketball Star.''
</P>
<P>
   He plays for the Lakers, but nowhere did it _ or could it _ say
so. NBA lockout rules were strictly enforced.
</P>
<P>
   The photos he signed for a steady stream of fans showed him
dribbling a ball in what unmistakably looks like a Lakers uniform.
Except the team name is erased.
</P>
<P>
   On the racks around the table at which he sat, there was more
NFL gear than NBA stuff. In fact, there was nothing with the Lakers
name on it except for a few stacks of hats that they found in the
warehouse and brought out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NBA won't ship any licensed merchandise right now,'' said
a store rep. ``Otherwise we'd be selling out.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, a relative pauper in a league of ruthless
multimillionaires, could only half smile when anyone asked when
he'd be back with ... that team we're not supposed to mention. And
many asked, especially the hundred or so who lined up an hour
before his 1 p.m. arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Four-year-old Rudy Rodriguez of Sun Valley, whose parents
brought him all decked out in a Lakers uniform, got his gold shorts
signed, shook Fisher's hand and said: ``We'll see you at the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' said Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Fisher admitted: ``It affects more people than you think.
When they ask, all I try to do is keep the conversation going
somewhere else. I mean, I've done three of these store signings in
the last few months, and I love meeting people, but I don't want to
be doing this all winter.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Then we have Magic Johnson, who isn't that far removed as an
NBA player and will always be a heartbeat away from another
comeback. He owns 1/20th of the Lakers _ so does that mean he even
covers one of the 12 players' full salary?
</P>
<P>
   So the guy who should've given up public speaking when his
talk-show producers muzzled him a few months ago shows up on CNN to
rap about the NBA lockout and exclaims: ``The owners are doing
their part ... we're doing our part.'' He follows it up with:
``We're the ones flying them on private planes all over the place.
When I played, we had to get up at 4 or 5 in the morning to catch
6:30 or 7 a.m. flights. We had to go through the airport, eat the
airport food like everybody else. Now ... they don't have to mess
with their bags like we did when I played....''
</P>
<P>
   First, save it for someone who owns a Stradivarius. Second, you
left out the part about how sometimes, when they had unheated spas
at the team hotel, the players had to walk 10 miles through the
snow to use the whirlpool at the arenas....
</P>
<P>
   __ Meet Jim Rome Thursday at Tower Records on the Sunset Strip.
Bring cache....
</P>
<P>
   __ Meet Mark McGwire tonight on ``Late Show with David
Letterman.'' Maybe Mr. Mighty-Mite will show Dave his own ``stupid
human trick:'' _ he can made 70 baseballs disappear....
</P>
<P>
   __ We don't need no stinkin' Jim Leyland anyway. Not in our
smoke-free dugout....
</P>
<P>
   __ The wrongful termination lawsuit that former AM-1150
nighttime co-host Joey Haim filed against the station and the
Dodgers will be allowed to proceed in the state court rather than
federal court, a judge has ruled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dodgers will do no better in Joey's case than they did
this season,'' said attorney Steven Siegal.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Haim: ``I appreciate people who've said they miss me on the
air and I'm sorry listeners have to stomach the new nighttime
snoreathon.''...
</P>

<P>
   __ Get past the fact Mike Tyson uses the naughty word 67 times

`ANTZ' HAS VIEWERS MARCHING IN, SETS OCTOBER RECORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Moviegoers swarmed the nation's multiplexes to
view ``Antz'' as the computer-animated comedy topped a robust box
office by setting an October record with an estimated
$16.8 &UR;  &LR; million &UR;  &LR; weekend total, studio sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of ``Antz,'' the much-anticipated first animated
film from DreamWorks SKG, was showing at 2,449 theaters and
eclipsed the $16.6 &UR;  &LR; million roll-out for ``Stargate'' in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   It also edged the opening of Robin Williams' spiritual drama,
``What Dreams May Come,'' which debuted with $15.5 &UR;  &LR; million at
2,526 theaters, and the third weekend of the action-comedy ``Rush
Hour,'' which brought in $15 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,701 sites.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's other major opening, slapstick comedy ``A Night at
the Roxbury,'' also turned in a solid performance in fourth place
with $10 &UR;  &LR; million at 1,865 theaters, underscoring the strength of
the market during what is traditionally a slow period. Weekend
overall grosses were up 29 percent over the same weekend last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``These results feel just like a summer weekend, and they're
incredible numbers for October,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, president
of the Reel Source forecasting service.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has become a 12-month-a-year business with enough variety
of genres for all audiences,'' noted analyst Arthur Rockwell of
Drake &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antz,'' featuring the voices of Woody Allen and Sharon Stone,
opened six months earlier than originally planned and has a
seven-week lead on The Walt Disney Co.'s computer-animated comedy
``A Bug's Life,'' co-produced with ``Toy Story'' creator Pixar
Animation. Analysts said the early success of ``Antz'' is unlikely
to detract from ``A Bug's Life,'' expected to be one of the holiday
season's top performers.
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR;  &LR; `Antz' has obviously succeeded very well for a non-Disney
animated film, but I don't think it will have much impact on `A
Bug's Life,' which has a built-in audience and a strong buzz,''
Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum predicted ``Antz'' will beat the $63 &UR;  &LR; million taken in
by ``Beavis and Butt-head Do America,'' the top non-Disney animated
movie, due to strong support among all audiences.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks distribution chief James Tharp said ``Antz''
attracted strong support in all regions and age groups, leading to
the addition of an additional 250 theaters next weekend, which is a
three-day holiday for many filmgoers due to Columbus Day on Monday.
``We think we'll hold interest very well,'' Tharp added.
</P>
<P>
   The performance by ``Antz'' came amid competition from Major
League Baseball playoffs and surprisingly strong interest in ``What
Dreams May Come,'' a PolyGram release delayed from the summer.
Bucksbaum said the solid numbers for ``Dreams,'' in which Williams
seeks reunification with his wife in the afterlife, reflect
audiences' strong interest in films with spiritual themes such as
``City of Angels'' and ``Michael.''
</P>
<P>
   New Line's ``Rush Hour'' also continued to draw well, going past
the $84 million mark after only 17 days. Within the next two weeks,
it should become the 10th movie this year and 176th in Hollywood
history to join the list of films topping $100 million in domestic
grosses.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said ``A Night at the Roxbury,'' based on characters
created by ``Saturday Night Live'' stars Will Ferrell and Chris
Kattan, benefited from Paramount's strong trailer and the absence
of other new films aimed at the teen-age market.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of thrillers in their second weekends took the next two
spots, with MGM's ``Ronin'' grossing $7.2 million at 2,487 sites to
edge Sony's ``Urban Legend'' with $7 million at 2,257 locations.
Finishing a still-strong seventh was ``There's Something About
Mary'' with $3.6 million at 2,177 theaters to bring the comedy's
82-day total to $158.2 million for 20th Century Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary,'' in its 12th week, is now the 51st-highest domestic
grosser ever after ``The Firm.''
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top 10 were the third weekend of Universal's
family drama ``One True Thing'' with $2.7 million at 1,620
theaters, DreamWorks' 11th weekend of ``Saving Private Ryan'' with
$1.7 million at 1,510 screens and Disney's fourth weekend of
``Simon Birch'' with $1.5 million at 930 theaters. The fourth
weekend of Miramax's fast-fading ``Rounders'' was 11th with $1.1
million at 1,475 sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' has grossed $184.3 million after 66 days
and is now the 29th highest domestic grosser after ``Snow White and
the Seven Dwarfs.''
</P>
<P>
   Artisan's limited opening of horror-thriller ``Dee Snyder's
Strange Land'' generated unimpressive returns with $355,000 at 315
theaters, while Fox Searchlight's shipboard comedy ``The
Imposters'' debuted with a moderate $325,000 at 66 sites.
</P>
<P>
   Year-to-date business is near $5.1 billion and 12 percent ahead
of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antz,'' ``What Dreams May Come'' and ``Rush Hour'' will face
competition next weekend from the opening of Disney's ``Holy Man''
with Eddie Murphy. Disney is also generating strong early buzz for
the Oct. 16 debut of ``Beloved,'' starring Oprah Winfrey as a
runaway slave.

   TAMPA, Fla. _ When Warren Sapp watched a teammate return a New
York Giants pass for an early Tampa Bay touchdown Sunday, the
defensive tackle started yelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's up to us,'' Sapp told his defensive teammates.
``Let's hunker down against the run. Danny Kanell is not going to
beat us passing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sapp's words came true. Kanell settled for just 83 yards
passing, on 10 of 27 accuracy, as the Buccaneers' defense was the
difference in a 20-3 victory over the Giants before 64,989 fans at
Raymond James Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have mirrorlike teams,'' Sapp said. ``We're not going to
ask our quarterback to throw the ball 40 times to beat somebody.
Neither are they. We're going to run the ball. They're going to run
the ball. It boiled down to which defense was going to play the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs' defensive superiority became evident only in the final
quarter as the tough Giant defense began wearing down in the
86-degree heat. That's when the hosts managed their only offensive
touchdown, a 1-yard run by Mike Alstott.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in the heat and we practice in the heat,'' Tampa Bay
Coach Tony Dungy said. ``Call it a home-field advantage if you
like.''
</P>
<P>
   Dungy, stung by his team's 1-3 start after last season's taste
of the playoffs, actually told his players on Wednesday that
Sunday's game was a must-win.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very much unlike Tony to say something like that,''
cornerback Donnie Abraham said. ``So we knew we all had to dig a
little deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   Free safety Charles Mincy provided just the jump-start the Bucs
needed with his 22-yard interception of a Kanell pass for a
touchdown just 1 minute 34 seconds into the game.
</P>
<P>
   It was the team's first defensive touchdown since Dungy became
head coach three seasons ago with a reputation for having
opportunistic defenses. And it was the first Bucs touchdown for
Mincy, an eighth-year pro, who followed Dungy from Kansas City to
Minnesota and now here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a relief more than anything,'' Mincy said. ``That's
what we've been looking to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mincy said Giants running back Tiki Barber simply turned one way
on a pass pattern and the pass went the other way _ right to Mincy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't look up until the ball was on me,'' he said. ``I'm a
little surprised I caught it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sapp added, ``I don't know what Kanell was thinking, but thank
you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs had tricked the Giants into thinking they were playing
zone defense. ``Normally we play zone early in games,'' Dungy said.
``But on that play, we jumped into man-to-man.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa Bay coach came in leery of the Giants' defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a tough front seven to get anything done against,''
Dungy said. ``They jump into a lot of different fronts and they
work together well. We really didn't do much against them today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs could manage just a field goal offensively against that
defense until the game's late stages.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think when you look at it, our defense shut down their
offense better than vice versa,'' said Abraham, the cornerback.
``When their offense had to make plays against us, they couldn't do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tampa Bay's ground-oriented offense put the game away
in the fading minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we put a rushing game together like we did today, and
stick to it, we're tough for anybody to beat,'' Alstott said. ``I
do think we wore them down. You could see some of them were getting
pretty tired. We're the type of offense that comes at you for
eight, 10, 12 plays, most of them runs. That's tough to defend
after a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Alstott rushed for 86 yards, while Warrick Dunn added 63.
</P>
<P>
   Bucs quarterback Trent Dilfer was under no illusion about the
main reason his team prevailed. ``It would have been difficult to
win this game if our defense had not played as well as they
played,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mincy's touchdown shed light on just what a drought the Tampa
Bay offense has been in this season. It was the team's first
touchdown in the first half of any game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they say those types of things run in bunches,'' Dungy
said. ``So that makes me hopeful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs now have a week off to mull over their good fortune
against the Giants. Sapp said he could only surmise what the team
atmosphere would be like if it had lost Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, it might have driven a wedge between this
team,'' he said. ``I'm just glad I don't have to find out.''

YANKS RELIEVED, RELAXED AND READY FOR REVENGE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ George Steinbrenner elicited smiles easily from Derek
Jeter and Tino Martinez as they chatted behind the batting cage.
Tim Raines and Jorge Posada, who are normally nowhere near second
base during real games, turned fancy double plays. Teammates teased
Hideki Irabu and Orlando Hernandez whenever one of their offerings
was torched during rare batting practice sessions for both restless
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day of R and R for the Yankees, relief and relaxation.
They were relieved to return to Yankee Stadium knowing Darryl
Strawberry had what doctors termed successful surgery to remove a
cancerous tumor from his colon on Saturday, and they were relieved
to be pondering Tuesday's opener of the American League
Championship Series against Cleveland. That is why a team that had
looked tense on Thursday and even early in Friday's game looked so
relaxed in a drizzling rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing to do now,'' Manager Joe Torre said, ``is to get
back to the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish that, the favored Yankees must defeat the team
that bounced them from the division series last season. It was
memorable and painful and, no matter how the Yankees minimized the
revenge questions, those feelings surely exist. How could they not
feel vengeful when the Indians prevented the Yankees from staying
alive to possibly win their second straight title by dramatically
swiping the last two games of a five-game series?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly something that you could speculate about, that
if we had gotten by Cleveland and got to the World Series, we could
be going for No. 3,'' said David Cone, who was flip-flopped with
Andy Pettitte in the rotation and will start Game 2. ``But it
didn't happen. Maybe that is why we won 114 games. Maybe last year
was such a slap in the face that guys were motivated in the off
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Motivation will not be a problem, not with Strawberry watching
from Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center and not with the Indians'
Jaret Wright opposing David Wells in Game 1. Wright, who tamed the
Yankees twice in the division series last year and who perturbed
them by throwing inside so recklessly that he broke Luis Sojo's
left hand in a spring training game in March, may be the player
most disliked within the Yankee clubhouse. Torre initially feigned
ignorance when asked about Wright's failure to appear on any
Christmas card lists in the Bronx, and most Yankees bit their
tongues regarding the 22-year-old pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tried to hit me in the face,'' Sojo said. ``He never said
nothing to me after that. If you're going to hit somebody, don't do
that. We all have families. The best way to deal with it is to
sweep these guys, win this thing and get to the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential path to that goal changed as Torre tweaked his
rotation from the division series by switching Cone and Pettitte.
Cone will start Game 2 on Wednesday afternoon against Charles Nagy
and Pettitte will pitch Game 3 in Cleveland versus Dwight Gooden on
Friday, so Cone will get an extra day of rest before a potential
Game 6 and avoid what is bound to be colder weather at Jacobs
Field. Hernandez will face Bartolo Colon in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to make sense,'' said Cone, who has a 1.57 ERA since
May in starts with five or more days of rest. ``Joe has pushed all
the right buttons. He's a great manager. If he feels that's the way
we should go, we all agree.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte cringed as he talked about going nine days between
starts, instead of seven days if he would pitch Game 2. Still,
Pettitte is targeted to pitch a decisive Game 7, a solid vote of
confidence for a starter who entered the post-season perilously
after going 3-5 with a 6.14 ERA in August and September. But he
pitched splendidly in a 3-1 victory over Texas in Game 2 and would
be handed the baseball if the Yankees faced elimination in a Game 7
in this round.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question,'' Torre said, ``I'm very confident in that.''
</P>
<P>
   So are the Yankees entering the ALCS. The Yankees dominated the
dangerous Texas offense by limiting the Rangers to one run in three
games and feel secure that they can handle the Indians if their
pitching comes even close to being as stingy and the middle of
their lineup joins Shane Spencer in producing consistently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we can start hitting the ball and give Shane a
little help,'' said Torre, whose words brought laughter on a day
when the Yankees were relaxed and relieved.

 &HT;    Breaking down the UAW-GM 500
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first 100: Wild and wet. Jerry Nadeau got it started,
hitting the wall in the fourth turn on the first lap. Steve Grissom
followed, slapping the wall in turn two on lap 11. Then came Jeff
Gordon, who started 26th and moved to the front on lap 70, beating
Mark Martin out of the pits. Next came the weird part. The race was
red-flagged on lap 94 due to water seeping under the wall on the
backstretch. And, would you believe that Darrell Waltrip started
43rd and was 13th when the race was red-flagged. Racing resumed
after a 42-minute delay.
</P>
<P>
   Lap leaders: Martin (60), Ernie Irvan (14), Ward Burton (10),
Gordon (7), Derrike Cope (6), Bobby Labonte (3). Retired: David
Green. Under caution: 24 laps.
</P>
<P>
   The second 100: On the restart, Gordon went backward before
settling into third behind the Pontiacs of Ward Burton and Irvan.
Waltrip's ride lasted only three more laps before an oil pressure
problem put him behind the wall and the race under caution. Ward
Burton again led on the restart, followed by Irvan. Gordon settled
into third while Martin remained fifth. Waltrip returned to the
race on lap 126, but three laps down. Caution on lap 132 and on
restart Gordon regained the lead. This time Martin came out right
behind Gordon and regained the lead on lap 148 and opened a five
car-length lead. Gordon comes back on lap 171 to lead. The demons
that sidelined Dale Jarrett last week at Martinsville turned up
here on lap 174 with an over-heating problem in his Taurus causing
him to go a lap down.
</P>
<P>
   Lap leaders: Martin (22), Gordon (40), Ward Burton (25), Irvan
(12), Brett Bodine (1). Retired: Bobby Labonte, Dick Trickle. Under
caution: 44 laps:
</P>
<P>
   The third 100, plus 34Martin regained the lead on restart caused
by the cars of Johnny Benson and Rick Mast wrecking in turn two.
That was nothing compared to the 10-car pileup which followed on
lap 203. It was started by Bobby Labonte, who lost control, got
sideways and slammed into the wall, and everybody wrecked behind
him _ Terry Labonte, Ricky Rudd, Rusty Wallace, Jeremy Mayfield,
Kyle Petty, Dale Earnhardt, Sterling Marlin, Mike Skinner and Kenny
Irwin. When the dust settled, Martin took the lead on the restart,
pulling away to a six-car lead, while Gordon slowed, falling to
sixth, apparently due to a deep dent on the left side of his
bumper. Jerry Nadeau became his salvation, bringing out the
caution. It didn't help Gordon, however. His crew could not repair
the dent, leaving his spoiler an inch short.
</P>
<P>
   Lap leaders: Martin (133), Michael Waltrip (1). Retired: Nadeau,
Irvan, Rudd. Under caution: 67 laps
</P>
<P>
   Today's impactIf you call Martin gaining 39 points on Gordon an
impact, this is it.
</P>
<P>
   Who was hot Martin totally dominated this one. He led six times
for 215 laps and won by 1.110 seconds, an eternity in this sport.
</P>
<P>
   Who was not Jarrett ran into hard luck again. He blew an engine
last week at Martinsville and finished 42nd, burying his Winston
Cup championship hopes, and was 24th Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Points update The top five: Gordon, 4475; Martin, 4283; Jarrett,
3918; Wallace, 3,801; Jeff Burton, 3,672.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know? Bill Elliott started 29th and finished a
hard-earned 11th. . . Asked if he had any close calls Sunday, Jimmy
Spencer answered, ``Oh yeah, I drug a spoiler around the race
track, some hood came underneath my car from Johnny Benson. I
missed Dick Trickle and Ernie Irvan by the skin of my teeth when
they wrecked, and I missed a bunch of other accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week's story line It's on to Talladega and restrictor-plate
racing, which neither Gordon nor Martin hold close to their hearts.
Of the two, Gordon may be the best-prepared.

 &HT;    Mark it down: Martin's on a roll after seventh win
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Mark Martin pulled off his best imitation of
Jeff Gordon and then some Sunday, leading 215 of the 334 laps and
driving away from the field to win the UAW-GM Quality 500 at
Charlotte Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was Martin's seventh of the year and third in the
last six weeks. And it cut 35 points from Jeff Gordon's Winston Cup
lead as the season turns the final bend with six to go.
</P>
<P>
   His margin of victory was 1.110 seconds over runner-up Ward
Burton. There were 11 cautions for 65 laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Track position was everything and we had good track position
most of the day,'' Martin said. ``There were an awful lot of good
cars today that could have had a chance to win. But most of them
had trouble today.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was one of them. He started 26th and it wasn't until lap
76 that he led for the first time. He would lead three other times,
but never in a dominating manner as he has in previous races. He
was slow to get started on restarts and his long runs were often
cut short by the 11 cautions that ate 65 laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we dodged a lot of bullets today,'' Gordon said.
``We were fortunate to get the car back to fifth. We got some
damage on one of those wrecks, and the car just wasn't the same
after that. I thought it was going to be a great battle here for
the championship and a great battle for the race until that
point.''
</P>
<P>
   It likely would not have mattered. Martin drove as on a rail,
taking his Taurus wherever he wanted. And over the final 133 laps,
he led all but one.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how frustrating it is to win and not be able to shake
Gordon, Martin laughed and said, ``Do I look frustrated? This is
the greatest year of my life. I don't see how anybody can could
look at this year and think it was a failure. Today was a great day
for this race team.''
</P>
<P>
   It was almost a great day for Ward Burton, who seemed most
capable of filling up Martin's rear view mirror. He tracked him
over the final 90 laps, but never got to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guys have some awesome motors, and it showed today. But I
was a little bit loose going in (the turns) all day,'' Burton said.
``I know we had him beat on motor. We were just off on chassis a
little bit. I can't complain.

   The New York Times' computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a very large
difference Ohio State (No. 1) and Nebraska (No. 2), but almost no
difference between Kansas State (No. 4) and UCLA (No. 5).

GOODEN BACK AT THE BEGINNING
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the celebratory rhythm and blues music blaring and his
Cleveland Indians teammates rejoicing, Dwight Gooden felt so good
Saturday night that he forgot about his nightmarish experience
three days earlier in Game 2 of the division series. His feud with
umpire Joe Brinkman behind him, Gooden looked forward to returning
to New York City, the birthplace of his stardom, where the Indians
will face the Yankees in the American League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great, you couldn't have written a better script for
me personally,'' said Gooden, moments after the Indians finished
off the Boston Red Sox, three games to one. ``To get the
opportunity to go back and pitch in the post-season against a team
that I played for for two years and in a city that I played my
whole career in is unbelievable. The main thing for me when I take
the mound is to keep my emotions down so I can give a good
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooden may not get to take the mound in Yankee Stadium. Indians
Manager Mike Hargrove had yet to announce his rotation, but Gooden,
who started Game 2 against Boston before Brinkman ejected him in
the first inning for shouting an expletive, is scheduled to start
Game 3 in Cleveland. Still, the memories, perhaps both good and
bad, will come in bunches when Gooden walks into the stadium to
face the team that saw past his history of substance abuse and
enabled him to return to the major leagues in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be ready,'' said an obviously excited Gooden, who posted
an 8-6 record with a 3.76 ERA for the Indians. ``I'm waiting to
hear the official word on which day I have.''
</P>
<P>
   New York has always seen the best and worst of Gooden. He
pitched the only no-hitter of his career at Yankee Stadium in 1996
and went 12-4 in the Bronx in 1996 and 1997. Of course, Mets fans
saw Gooden at his most overpowering, when he went 132-44 from 1984
to 1991, becoming the youngest player ever to win the Cy Young
award in 1985 and helping the Mets win the World Series in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   But there was also the drug and alcohol abuse that turned him
into a losing pitcher for the Mets from 1992 to 1994, cost him the
entire 1995 season and threatened to end his career. Now a new man
and a clean man, Gooden is continuing the successful comeback that
he began with the Yankees. After beginning this year on the
disabled list because of tendinitis in his right shoulder and
struggling through a couple of tough starts, Gooden went 8-4 with a
3.59 ERA from June through the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   He said the abbreviated season has left his arm feeling great.
``I came back and had a strong second half,'' Gooden said. ``I
don't throw as hard as I once did on a consistent basis, but I
still get up there once in a while. Now, I rely more on location
and changing speeds.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his accomplishments, Gooden has never won a post-season
game. He has not been terrible, as his ERA of 3.06 attests, but in
eight starts, he has gone 0-3. While Gooden said he ``couldn't ask
for anything more'' than a post-season start against the Yankees,
he will undoubtedly ask for that first victory to come against New
York, as well.

MILITARY WINS IN CLOSE CALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ It took 10 minutes Sunday to identify
California's best hope for next month's Breeders' Cup Turf _ 2
minutes, 2 seconds to run the Oak Tree Turf Championship and 8
minutes to pore over the photo finish.
</P>
<P>
   Military, the front runner with Corey Nakatani riding, and
Bonapartiste, a French-bred with Chris McCarron aboard, hit the
wire together after 1\ miles. Santa Anita officials called for
three prints of the black-and-white photo before certifying that
Military was the winner by half a nostril.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the longer ones,'' steward George Slender said
of the deliberation.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Military's number 2 was posted on the tote board,
most in the crowd were guessing it was a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have been happy with a dead heat,'' said Wally Dollase,
trainer of Saudi Prince Ahmed bin Salman's Military.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-year-old son of Danzig was the fans' 3-1 third choice
behind 5-2 Bonapartiste and 4-5 River Bay, who'd finished first and
second in front of Military in the Del Mar Handicap last month.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Del Mar defeat, Military had won a pair of minor
races, his first since coming over from England.
</P>
<P>
   Dollase thought correctly that Military would improve with the
move to Santa Anita, reasoning his European temperament would
prefer the serenity of the larger backstretch and his long body
would prefer the gentler turns.
</P>
<P>
   Nakatani took full advantage of Military's edge in early speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping he'd be three lengths in front at the top of the
stretch, and gosh-darn it if he didn't do it,'' Dollase said. ``I
thought that guy (Bonapartiste) was going to go by him, but he dug
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonapartiste made it close. River Bay finished a distant third
in the five-horse race, giving jockey Pat Day another high-profile
flop in Southern California this year, to go with Gentlemen and
Touch Gold.
</P>
<P>
   The $300,000 Oak Tree Turf Championship, which was known as the
Oak Tree Invitational when it produced Breeders' Cup Turf winners
Great Communicator (1988), Kotashaan ('93) and Northern Spur ('95),
is the first Breeders' Cup prep on the Santa Anita schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Next are Saturday's Oak Leaf for 2-year-old fillies and Sunday's
Norfolk for 2-year-olds, and the Oct. 17 Goodwood Handicap. Silver
Charm returned from Kentucky to Santa Anita Saturday night to train
for the Goodwood.
</P>
<P>
   The seven Breeders' Cup races will be run Nov. 7 at Churchill
Downs.
</P>
<P>
   Dollase said he expects to run Military in the $2 million
Breeders' Cup Turf, though he acknowledged the 1{-mile distance
might be too much for the colt.
</P>
<P>
   Military gave Dollase and Prince Salman their second stakes
victory Sunday. Sapphire Ring, ridden by Gary Stevens, won the
$73,230 Possibly Perfect for 3-year-old fillies.
</P>
<P>
   Two-year-old Proud Louie and jockey Jose Valdivia Jr. won the
$100,000 California Sires Stakes by nine lengths for trainer Jose
Silva and Tricar Stables.

AT LEAST FOR ONE DAY, IT'S EASY BEING GREEN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ He floated to the Jets in 1993 as a free
agent from the University of Akron Zips. Who knew zip about safety
Victor Green? He landed in training camp that season among 15 Jets
defensive backs, a bunch that included Ronnie Lott, Lonnie Young,
Dennis Price, Brian Washington and James Hasty. All bigger names.
Supposedly, better players, too.
</P>
<P>
   So, Green knew he had to do something to separate himself. To be
noticed.
</P>
<P>
   He did, hammering his way through on special teams. And that was
how he made the Jets, on the 1993 practice squad, as a guy who
would later deliver on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Four Jets head coaches _ Bruce Coslet, Pete Carroll, Rich Kotite
and now Bill Parcells _ would have the chance over the next five
years to cut Victor Green, who kept improving and eventually found
himself a starter at safety.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking could easily have gone: OK, he made a nice little
run, but let's get real. Let's get real players. A Zip free agent?
The guy is only 5 feet 11 inches and 205 pounds. Playing safety?
Let's draft some real safeties, some big guys from big schools. But
none of these coaches could cut him.
</P>
<P>
   You can't cut a real player.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, Green knew that he had already done something
that would separate him. Something that would make him rise and be
noticed. Back in training camp, he had pulled off his shirt,
plopped a white construction helmet on his head that featured the
Jets logo and picked up a sledgehammer. The demolition man _ the
guy who hits and hits and packs a punch. That was the theme. Photos
were taken. And Sunday, one of those ran on the cover of the
program for the Miami game at Giants Stadium. Each of the 75,257
fans who entered the stadium must have taken a peek. Must have
noticed. And then the game started.
</P>
<P>
   It was time for Green to separate himself. To rise and be
noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Jets cornerback Ray Mickens had intercepted Dan Marino's
last-gasp, half-ending bomb before the Dolphins left the field at
halftime, trailing by 10-3. It was the first interception Marino
had thrown this season.
</P>
<P>
   Then Marino and Miami returned for the third quarter and it was
New York ball, Miami ball, New York ball, Miami ball and it was a
stalemate. And then Green, on that second Miami possession,
intercepted Marino at the Miami 43. He closed on the ball and on
receiver Lamar Thomas and took it, with 7 minutes 36 seconds left
in the third quarter. And four minutes later the Jets had traveled
43 yards the other way for a touchdown and a 17-3 lead. Enough to
win.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, on a day the Jets rose to a 20-9 victory, so did Green. Or
maybe it was the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets injected energy into their season, climbing to 2-2,
reaching a 2-0 division record after finishing 2-6 in the division
last year. As some Jets put it, they made Miami calm down. The
Dolphins were performing too many flips. Miami was unbeaten
entering the game, and talk of its dominating defense was a
nuisance to the Jets. So were Miami's four straight victories over
the Jets and seven straight with Marino in the pocket. The hex is
over now, and the Dolphins (3-1) have been calmed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Miami offense entered Sunday's game with a big running game
and it, too, was calmed. The Miami defense entered ranked No. 2 and
the Jets were ranked 30th, but the Jets did the flipping there.
Miami Coach Jimmy Johnson said ``everything looked messed up.''
That's the result whenever the script is flipped.
</P>
<P>
   Green played the run, played the pass, played the game with a
nonstop motor, as did most of his teammates, who beat Miami to the
punch, outguessed them and then kept playing with force. They
played from start to finish to win. To be noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from Americus, Ga., a small town, and to get out of
there you have to work hard to be noticed,'' Green said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Green added: ``I think when I first came to the Jets everybody
thought I was a long shot. Sort of like today. Miami was riding
high and they were doing some good things. They looked good. But we
had two weeks to prepare because of the bye and we had two weeks to
get the right attitude. You saw a lot of attitude and desire out
there today. I saw Dan Marino arguing with his linemen and us
finally getting some pressure on him. That has not happened often.
He doesn't like to get hit.''
</P>
<P>
   That is Green's specialty. He didn't get to hit Marino Sunday,
but he made plenty of other crushing hits. He helped the Jets limit
Miami to 2 of 12 third-down conversions (17 percent); to 52
offensive plays compared with the Jets 72; to seven Miami punts.
That is a lot of punts.
</P>
<P>
   But Green does more than hit. He can cover. He can tackle. He
plays with solid fundamentals mixed with toughness. He led the Jets
in tackles in each of the last two seasons. Two years ago, he led
the league with 206 tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Thomas, the Dolphins receiver, said of the Jets'
secondary: ``Aaron Glenn is the only guy back there who stands out.
They ask Glenn to cover single all day at cornerback and the other
guys just fill in and do their roles. They do a nice job together.
But Glenn is the only special guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Green listened. He was disappointed. He was calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much I guess he does not see,'' Green said. ``You
look at me and other players in our secondary and we are all asked
to do some special things. I want to do more. That is already
happening. So, I'll keep doing the things I do and I know that
people will notice. One day I will make my dream and make the Pro
Bowl and this team will win a Super Bowl and there will be enough
for everyone to notice. We'll all make a name for ourselves. Just
keep watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Some already notice. A free agent turned starter now turning
into a star.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Green is separating himself, rising and knocking down
walls. He does not need a sledgehammer to do it. No, more hard work
will do.

   BOSTON _ Don't look now, but the Arizona Wildcats are on the
move again. Most people figured that if a team from Arizona was
going to wind up in the Fiesta Bowl in Tempe this season, it would
be the Arizona State Sun Devils, but a last-second loss to
Washington in the season opener basically took all the devil out of
ASU, which never did recover, with Saturday night's loss to
Southern California the latest effort in futility.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State has dropped so low coach Bruce Snyder's team must
worry about finishing above .500, never mind the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the team in Tucson. The Wildcats have quietly
been winning each week and steadily climbing in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Their latest triumph has vaulted the Wildcats from 14th to 10th
in the AP writers poll and 11th in the coaches poll (coaches always
are a little slow in making jumps like that, most likely because
they have to study the films first).
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake. The Wildcats are climbing. And if you
happened to catch the ending of Saturday night's remarkable
come-from-behind 31-28 win over Washington, climbing can be taken
literally.
</P>
<P>
   Here was the situation: Washington leading, 28-24; Arizona on
the Husky 9-yard line; 4 seconds left. Arizona quarterback Ortege
Jenkins, with nowhere to throw the ball, took off on a desperate
final sprint to the end zone. He reached the 4 and was about to be
sandwiched by three Washington players.
</P>
<P>
   But in a you-had-to-see-it-to-believe-it move (and even then
it's hard to accept), Jenkins somersaulted over the Huskies'
Marques Hairston and Brendan Jones into the end zone for the
winning score.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get him in the gymnastics program,'' said teammate
Marcus Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins had a perfectly logical explanation for his move. ``I
wasn't going through them,'' he said. ``So I went over them.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever or however, Arizona is 5-0, has won nine games in
succession over the last two seasons and can make itself the major
contender in the Pac-10 and perhaps even a long shot to make it to
the Fiesta Bowl if it beats No. 3 UCLA Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Before you write off Arizona against the Bruins, consider this.
The teams have split the last 10 meetings and next week's game will
be played in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Another out-of-the-pack team is Georgia, which also is unbeaten
and eked out a 28-27 win at Louisiana State Saturday night. A win
over No. 4 Tennessee Saturday will put the Bulldogs in prime
position to get to the SEC title game in Atlanta in December.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Normally, we don't approve of coaches putting a gag order on
their players with the media after their games, but Washington
coach  &UR; Jim Lambright's  &LR; explanation made sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm protecting them from the stupidity of what went on,'' said
Lambright after enduring his second loss in succession.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of stupidity, the NCAA has struck again, according to
Arizona officials. Arizona cornerback  &UR; Chris McAlister  &LR; has to miss
the UCLA game. Why? Because he took out a loan to buy disability
insurance, which the NCAA said is fine. But McAlister took out a
loan for $3,000 more than the $11,000 disability payment, which the
NCAA said is a violation, so McAlister has to sit out a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody ought to be angry,'' said Arizona coach  &UR; Dick
Tomey &LR; . ``It's unfair and a gross abuse of power.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Winning is winning at any level and two-time defending Division
3 national champion Mount Union is still at it, with a 32-game
winning streak that is the longest in college football ... Ohio
State's 27-9 victory over Penn State Saturday gave coach  &UR; John
Cooper  &LR; a 23-22-3 record against ranked teams in his 11 seasons in
Columbus, which doesn't sound all that impressive for a perennial
contender like the Buckeyes. But after the 1992 season, the
Buckeyes were only 3-13-2 against ranked teams under Cooper ...
UCLA's 49-17 win over Washington State was only the second time in
eight seasons the Bruins have won their Pac-10 opener ... When
Colorado beat Oklahoma Saturday, it marked the fifth straight time
the Buffaloes have beaten the Sooners. No other team _ including
Nebraska _ has been able to beat Oklahoma more than three straight
times ... Navy's loss to West Virginia marked the 22d straight loss
against a ranked team for the Midshipmen.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame has had first-half problems all season, getting
outscored, 79-23, in the first half of its first three games. That
was not a problem against Stanford, however, as the Irish rolled to
a 28-3 halftime lead before coasting home, 35-17 ... Is anyone
surprised that Syracuse is 2-2 after the first month? ... Curry has
won two games in the last three weeks after going winless last
season. Just shows you what a good coach _  &UR; Steve Nelson  &LR; _ can do
for a team ... Florida coach  &UR; Steve Spurrier  &LR; was not happy after
the Gators' lackluster 16-10 win over Alabama. ``The Gators don't
play like champions anymore,'' muttered Spurrier ... Game of the
Year in the Big East is looming on Halloween _ Temple, which has
yet to win a game, against hapless Rutgers, which has a 1-point win
over 1-AA Richmond and a victory over Army ... Wonder what would
have happened to Oklahoma State if its ``home'' game had been
played in Stillwater, instead of Kansas City's Arrowhead Stadium,
where Nebraska's crowd gave the Huskers a home-field edge, one they
needed in a 24-17 win that ended with Oklahoma State on the Husker
1-yard line.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ At the start of the '90s, when employers'
health insurance costs were surging 15 percent a year, the giant
Sprint Corp. was quick to shift to health maintenance organizations
and their businesslike management of medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's costs promptly stabilized. Today, its comprehensive
benefit program stands as a model of what Congress and industry
envisioned four years ago when they rejected President Clinton's
health plan and left the health care system to the tides of the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Yet along the hallways at Sprint headquarters here, the great
expectations for managed care have dimmed. In a score of interviews
with workers and managers, no one recounted the kind of HMO horror
story that makes headlines: The wrong leg amputated, a child denied
a transplant. Instead, they said they had found managed care to be
exasperating, callous and sometimes just senseless.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Leroy, a Sprint sales compensation manager, says his HMO,
Cigna, saved his 10-year-old daughter's life with months of
hospitalization to help her conquer a mysterious immune system
disorder. But it also required him to interrupt three days of work
to get a third doctor's opinion before authorizing hernia surgery
for him.
</P>
<P>
   The toddler son of Elsa Wong, a project manager, suffered an ear
infection for a year before her HMO primary-care physician sent him
to a specialist. When Phyllis Van Kamp, a secretary, had the fever
and deep cough of bronchitis, a clinician told her over the phone
to try aspirin for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Today managed care plans are entrenched in the economy,
enrolling 61 percent of the population, according to the American
Association of Health Plans. But managed care has lost its luster
as an industry and as the answer to the nation's health care needs.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care has so far served as a different way to pay for
medical care, not a better way to provide it. Its savings to large
employers have been real, contributing significantly to the current
economic boom, but they are likely to prove temporary, while
coverage has become more expensive for small businesses and the
self-employed. Perhaps most important, managed care has shifted
many consumers' concern from cost to quality.
</P>
<P>
   In a New York Times poll in July, 85 percent of respondents said
the health care system needs fundamental change, barely below the
90 percent who said the same thing in a Times/CBS News poll in 1994
before the Clinton health plan died. Although 68 percent said they
were satisfied with the quality of their family's health care, 30
percent said they were not, up from 19 percent in 1994. And the
percentage dissatisfied with the cost of health care was
practically unchanged, 46 percent now compared with 47 percent
then.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about health maintenance organizations, 58 percent of
respondents said the HMOs had impeded doctors' ability to control
treatment, compared with 17 percent who said they had improved it.
And though a 1995 Harris Poll found more people saying managed care
would improve the quality of care rather than harm it, the Times
poll found a sharp reversal, 50 percent saying care would be harmed
and only 32 percent saying it would be improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four and a half years ago, the country was at a watershed and
didn't know it,'' said Dr. Leo Henikoff, chief executive of the
Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's hospital system in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``One option,'' he said, ``was a highly government-regulated
system. That was the Clinton plan, and the country abhorred it.
They took the other option, to throw health care to the
marketplace, and four years later, people don't like what they're
getting.''
</P>
<P>
   The discontent at one time had put health care back at the
center of political debate, with Democrats especially seizing on
the issue. But more recently it has been eclipsed in Congress by
the scandal involving President Clinton, and although both the
White House and Congress had been considering ``patient
protection'' laws, nothing is likely to emerge this year.
</P>
<P>
   At the state level, more than 40 states have chipped away at the
marketplace model with new regulations. But no two states have
adopted the same restraints and there is no agreement on a
comprehensive system that might work better. Within the health
profession itself, experts are predicting a far more wrenching
debate focusing on ways to improve health care, not the system that
pays for it.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care was promoted as a means of reducing costs by
emphasizing preventive care and purging redundant and unnecessary
care. But now the practice of managed care is seen as little more
than a short-sighted way to manage costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managed care so far is largely an insurance phenomenon,'' said
David Lawrence, chief executive of Kaiser Permanente of Oakland,
Calif., the nation's largest nonprofit health maintenance
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, we've had not much impact on the quality of care,'' he
said. ``Ironically, the way to do that is by improving care, not by
withholding it.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the populist vilification of managed care companies
like Aetna and United Health Care, Cigna and Kaiser, the companies
work within constraints set by other, often mightier, businesses.
These are the nation's largest employers, its Sprints.
</P>
<P>
   A study published in the April issue of The New England Journal
of Medicine said, ``Large portions of the health care system have
undergone revolutionary change, and not for the purpose of
improving health care, but in order to reduce the cost of doing
business for large corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Ellwood, a retired pediatric neurologist in Jackson
Hole, Wyo., and an early proponent of managed care, said there is
``a misconception about who's in charge. It's not the HMOs. It's
the large corporate buyers of medical care.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporations with tens of thousands of employees know they can
break an HMO by terminating its contract, so they can draw the line
on what they will pay. That, more than the much scorned HMO
``utilization manager'' who must approve doctors' procedures,
defines the services that employees get and those they are denied.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Prescription plans, for example, often limit the medications
that are covered, because employers object to the cost of covering
all medications, said Donald Brain Jr., a consultant in Kansas City
who negotiates plans for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Such a plan, Brain said, might include one antidepressant,
Prozac, but not another, Zoloft. So if a physician decides Zoloft
is more suitable for a patient, the patient will have to pay for it
himself if he wants it.
</P>
<P>
   The patient blames the HMO, Brain said, ``but it's the employer
who makes the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Large corporations can also use their leverage to obtain a good
mix of care and prices. ``We're trying to provide a healthy work
force to the best of our ability, provide choice to the best of our
ability and attract good people and keep them,'' said J. Robert
Dinneen Jr., assistant vice president for corporate benefits at
Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Not all employees, however, are benefiting. While workers for
big companies like Sprint get a break on the cost of their health
insurance, tens of millions of others, the employees of small
businesses that lack Sprint's negotiating clout, have seen their
costs continue to rise at the 1980s rate.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey last year of companies with fewer than 200 workers,
the journal Health Affairs found that the average monthly payroll
deduction for family health insurance had leaped from $34 in 1988
to $175 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Thornton, the owner of National Consulting Services near
Kansas City, a firm with eight full-time employees, ended his
contract with Humana last year after it told him his premium would
go up nearly 50 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   After considering six other health plans, his employees chose
United Healthcare, which offered more benefits and more choice than
Humana but still raised their premiums 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Because Thornton says he can afford to pay just 50 percent of
the premiums for his employees, they pay $75 to $600 a month for
health insurance, depending on their age and coverage. That is five
to 10 times more than workers pay at Sprint, which covers 90
percent of premiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think that you're going to get anywhere near the
benefits or costs and resulting value that a large business such as
Sprint is going to receive,'' Thornton said of small businesses,
``you will be woefully disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are limits to how much large employers can squeeze
managed care companies, and corporations like Sprint are starting
to accept larger increases in premiums in return for improved
services and more options.
</P>
<P>
   This year Sprint accepted a 3.8 percent increase, after three
years when increases totaled 3.2 percent. An increase of 5 percent
to 6 percent is likely for next year, Dinneen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're giving up some clout for choice,'' he said. ``We're
assuming it will be much tougher this year to keep rates at as
modest an increase as they have been in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Increases are likely in any case, however, because in their race
to enroll the work force, 49 percent of the nation's 650 HMOs lost
money through September last year, said InterStudy Publications in
Minneapolis, which tracks the industry. Four years ago, InterStudy
said, 90 percent were profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Ominously for the economy, employers and subscribers, HMOs are
trying to rebuild their profits with higher premiums.
</P>
<P>
   As the Kansas City area's largest private employer, Sprint has
immense leverage over HMOs that want its business, but there is
still tension between its goals: keeping costs down, and keeping
employees not only healthy and productive but also happy with their
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The formula Sprint has settled on works, to a point. Employees
say they usually get the care they need. But they say that under
managed care, routine events like having blood drawn or having a
baby can become exasperating and, if they drop their guard,
something worse.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Ott would seem to have an edge on the system as human
resources director for the Local Telecommunications Division. But
halfway through her second pregnancy, her HMO, Cigna, switched her
from St. Joseph's Hospital near her home in Overland Park, Kan., to
Baptist Hospital in Kansas City, Mo., 45 minutes away.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ott had gestational diabetes and had to have blood drawn
once and sometimes twice a week, and Cigna required that she use
Baptist. Finally she complained to her obstetrician, so he did it
in his office.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ott still had to go to Baptist to deliver, however. She was
in for another surprise. ``I was checked in and out in 23 hours,''
she said. ``I was John Wayne, walking down the hall with my
newborn.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress later mandated that hospitals allow two days for
births, but Ms. Ott had already had enough of Cigna. She switched
to another HMO with a Sprint contract.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint offers an unusually large range of choices: five managed
care plans and HMOs, plus two traditional fee-for-service plans,
which permit employees to seek whatever care they want wherever
they want. That option can be expensive, however, costing a family
needing a lot of care as much as $6,000 a year, so less than 20
percent of the work force chooses it.
</P>
<P>
   In managed care plans, each subscriber typically has a primary
care ``gatekeeper,'' the physician who provides all routine care,
keeps his charts and refers him to specialists. Sprint employees,
though, have stumbled upon a peculiar feature of many HMOs: the
phantom gatekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   The gatekeeper function survives: Charts are kept, medicines are
prescribed and referrals are made. But when a patient visits the
clinic, he sees whoever is available. It is rarely the same doctor,
and sometimes it is a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Having little confidence that anyone really knows them or their
conditions, some Sprint workers have devised a strategy to make the
plans work for them. They trust their own instincts. They do their
own research. They don't accept no for an answer. They persist. In
effect, they manage their managed care.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Tasby and her family have been covered by Kaiser for 11
years. ``I love my primary care physician,'' said Ms. Tasby, a
Sprint human resources manager. Kaiser was instrumental in helping
her stop smoking and lose weight, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then last year, she brought in her 13-year-old son because his
left leg was bowing. A doctor correctly diagnosed it as Blount's
disease, a condition in which the upper shin bone stops producing
bone tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they didn't tell me anything about it,'' Ms. Tasby said.
``I went on the Internet and found information myself.'' When she
went back to Kaiser and asked about corrective surgery, ``They told
me I shouldn't do anything until he was 16.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So I went outside Kaiser,'' she said. ``I paid $350 to a
specialist. He told me I should do the surgery now.'' Again she
returned to Kaiser, and this time she was referred to a Kaiser
orthopedist, who also recommended surgery. The boy had the
operation in January and Kaiser covered it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't quit Kaiser,'' Ms. Tasby said. But she has learned
something about life with an HMO. ``They think, `What the customer
doesn't know won't hurt. If they ask, we'll give it to them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of managed care say that so far the marketplace has been
a ham-handed manager of medicine. In cutting premiums to attract
employers and patients, in chipping away at excess and in wringing
discounts from its physicians, hospitals and drug companies, HMOs
have produced scant evidence that care itself is actually managed,
or that the health plans' customers are any healthier.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of evidence that some hospitals and their
doctors are providing erroneous, excessive and inappropriate care,
while others do much better.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lawrence of Kaiser, for example, said some hospitals deliver
five times as many babies by Caesarean section as others, most of
them unnecessary. The New England Journal of Medicine has found
that 34.5 percent of all women who get mammograms in their 40s
receive false positive results and then often are treated
unnecessarily. Estimates of preventable deaths in hospitals, those
arising from mistakes and mistreatment, range from 120,000 a year
to 180,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sloppy care is not cheap care,'' said Bruce Fried, a former
assistant secretary in the Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that true management of care can curb the cost of
errors and excess. They look to the developing discipline of
evidence-based medicine to enable doctors make better decisions on
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Kaiser has begun recording patients' charts, treatments
and treatment results in computers across its entire network with
the goal of learning what practices and treatments work best.
</P>
<P>
   Shifting to evidence-based medicine, however, will require
immense investments in computers and great changes in how HMOs and
doctors do business. And so its proponents are not making the kinds
of sweeping promises that HMOs made in the '80s, when managed care
was still a movement, before the nation's giant insurance companies
stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of evidence-based medicine will be a while coming,
cautioned Uwe Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton
University. Its best hope? ``That after two or three years of
premium increases, business and government will say, `This doesn't
work,' and that will wake us up.''

AND SO, CUBS GO BACK TO POOH CORNER AS BRAVES ROLL ON
</HEADLINE>

   CHICAGO _ Asked to explain how the Atlanta Braves swept the
Chicago Cubs, Sammy Sosa was succinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a better team and better pitching,'' said Sosa,
Chicago's star right fielder, after Atlanta ended the Cubs' season
with a 6-2 victory Saturday night at Wrigley Field. ``When you face
pitchers like Greg Maddux, John Smoltz and Tom Glavine, they are
not going to make many mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Riding the strength of their top three pitchers, and hitting
home runs in key situations, the Braves have advanced to the
National League Championship Series for the seventh time this
decade. And some believe that this Atlanta team, which won a
team-record 106 games during the regular season, is the best Braves
team in club history.
</P>
<P>
   They have pitching. They have power. They have defense. They
have experience. The Braves hope all of those strengths are enough
to get to the World Series. They open the four-of-seven-game
championship series on Wednesday night at Turner Field against the
winner of the Houston-San Diego series, and according to the
Braves, it does not matter which team they face. When you have as
much pitching as the Braves do, why worry?
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe good pitching beats good hitting,'' said Maddux, a
four-time Cy Young award winner, who held Chicago scoreless through
seven innings en route to Saturday night's victory. ``If you pitch
a good game, you can beat anybody. If you pitch a bad game, anybody
can beat you.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step figures to be harder for the Braves, who have only
won one World Series (1995) during their incredible run this
decade. Last year, the Braves were beaten in the NLCS by the
Florida Marlins, who went on to win the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Braves seem deeper and more versatile this year. The
pitching remains brilliant, with Smoltz, Glavine and Maddux all
throwing at least seven strong innings against the Cubs in their
starts. Meanwhile, replacing Fred McGriff at first base with Andres
Galarraga, who was signed as free agent during the off season, has
added more pop and another dangerous right-handed hitter to the
lineup. The Braves set a team record for home runs this year, and
that power was instrumental in beating the Cubs, as Atlanta homered
in every game. Ryan Klesko hit a grand slam to break open Game 1
and Eddie Lopez hit a grand slam Saturday night to break open Game
3.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the biggest blow of the series came in Game 2, when
Javy Lopez hit a homer with one out in the ninth inning to tie the
game, which Atlanta won, 2-1, in the 10th inning. Kevin Tapani was
two outs away from a complete-game shutout, but when Lopez struck,
it deflated the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who had a remarkable year with 66 home runs, was contained
by Atlanta, going 2 for 11 with no home runs and no runs batted in.
Mark Grace was 1 for 12, and Gary Gaetti was 1 for 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not very happy about the way we played the last three
games,'' Sosa said. ``I feel like if I could give my life to make
it to the World Series, I would do that. I am getting ready for
next year, and we will do better next season.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the Braves, this season is still alive. And they hope
the best times are yet to come. &QL;

each year, as the descendants of the German immigrants who settled
this area honor their heritage in a way that the volk from the old
country simply would not understand. The county voted itself dry in
the late 1930s. (Alan S. Weiner/New York Times Photo)

<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   I heard this exchange in the breakfast room of my hotel during a
recent trip to London. Over the hubbub of Japanese, French and
Saudi guests ordering from Greek and Pakistani waiters, a woman was
explaining the scene to her young daughter. ``Darling,'' she said.
``It's just like New York; no one speaks English.''

   A typical New York example of anthropomorphism, overheard by

   When Wilma Askinas' husband, Milton, decided to take a memory

prepared themselves, he with a book on memory, she with a tool
chest filled with shiny new tools. On the appropriate night, Mrs.
Askinas went off to her class. When she returned, she found her
husband asleep on the couch. ``How was the course?'' she asked. ``I

graduating psychiatry residents. A man whose wife was one of the
graduates was left on his own for a short time. The man, who wishes
to remain anonymous, was surrounded by what he called a
sophisticated group of well-known professors, residents, spouses
and other members of the psychiatric community. He was amused and
impressed at the exchange he overheard between two of the
professors.

that I've been rather short with you. I haven't been supportive of
your work and I don't think that I've treated you with the respect
that you deserve. But I just wanted you to know that this has
nothing to do with you. I've been having some personal problems and
I never meant to bring these problems to work.

floor-length white wedding dress and veil. The huge crowd burst
into spontaneous applause as she made her way down the walkway.

<P>
   When she got to the end, she started back. At that moment, a
young man, holding a small bouquet of flowers, came out of the
crowd. As he shyly touched her arm, she turned to him and they
embraced. We burst into applause once again, but as the couple
walked out, we were left with questions:

<P>
   Was this her intended? Was this their first meeting? Were they
going directly to the wedding ceremony? Where was her luggage?

   My wife thought it would be nice if I picked out a perfume for

when I walked into Bloomingdale's perfume department. I endured

and women handed me after spritzing them with the corresponding

to clean my nose's palette.

<P>
   After half an hour, during which I sampled 24 different
perfumes, I could barely discern the nuances among scents _
citrusy, flowery, earthy. I finally settled at one counter and
spent about 10 minutes among five different perfumes.
</P>
<P>
   After much thought, I made my decision. Later that day, proud of
my accomplishment, I called my wife. She began laughing when I told
her what I had selected. It was the perfume she always wore.

GIANTS STILL LOOKING FOR THE ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Jim Fassel has a problem. In his brief tenure as
Giants head coach, he has gone through a number of philosophic
evolutions before the season in an attempt to restore the Giants to
their previous glory.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer he vowed to open the offense up a little more, put
more faith in his starting quarterback, Danny Kanell, and allow the
offense to become a bit more intricate. In the wake of a disastrous
loss to Dallas two weeks ago, Fassel vowed to go back to basics:
The Giants responded with a lopsided victory in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of a demoralizing 20-3 loss to Tampa Bay Sunday,
Fassel is confronted, haunted actually, by a looming question that
he can't answer: Now what?
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' offense cannot run, cannot pass consistently. It
cannot consistently do anything. After the Dallas loss, Fassel
admitted that he was baffled. Sunday night he sounded beyond
baffled; he couldn't explain the sudden loss of air from what
seemed to be a rising Giants balloon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been associated with an offense where it's so hard
to figure out what's best for us to do,'' Fassel said. ``I'm going
to do a lot of searching and looking and figuring some things out.
I'm tired of trying to psychoanalyze some guys. I just know one
thing: We're the New York Giants and we've got to play better on
offense, we've got to have more production. Any time you're not
moving the ball, generally speaking, there's not enough guys doing
their job. No matter what it takes, I'll figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel added: ``That's my job, I'll take the responsibility.
I've got to come up with something that gives us the best
opportunity to put points on the board. Every time I try to get
back to basics, get the execution down, give us some opportunities,
obviously I'm not getting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's loss has to be deeply troubling for Fassel and his
staff. Last week, Fassel felt that the Giants had finally broken
through in the impressive victory over San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that we had kind of found ourselves a little bit last
week,'' he said. ``The inconsistencies right now are in what we're
doing. We can run it, then we can't run. We protect, then we don't
protect. We throw it complete, then we don't. It's just hard to get
in a groove that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are in a rut. A punchless, listless rut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense has to help,'' Fassel said. ``At some point in
time you've got to block, you've got to run, you've got to hit the
right hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week everyone was all smiles. The victory over San Diego
made everything seem like it was in working condition in Giants
land. The runners were running, linemen were blocking and Kanell
was stellar. Kanell felt the team had finally hit its stride.
``That's why this is so discouraging,'' he said. ``You can't afford
to fluctuate in this league. You have to have some consistency. You
have to be able to perform week in, week out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants finally scored 3 points with 13 minutes 20 seconds
left. Kanell said he apologized to the defense after the game and
promised it would never happen again.
</P>
<P>
   The defense played valiantly, but struggled in the muggy heat
and with Mike Alstott, the 6-foot-1-inch, 248-pound fullback,
plowing into the line, the defense finally gave in. The Bucs scored
to make it 20-3 on a 1-yard run by Alstott.
</P>
<P>
   What ails the Giants may go beyond X's and O's and have
something to do with a festering wound. Fassel has to decide, once
and for all, what to do with Tyrone Wheatley, the veteran running
back. The coach apparently doesn't care for Wheatley. At the same
time, Fassel can't afford to be without him because the offense has
no weight.
</P>
<P>
   One of the ridiculous scenes of the game: the Giants' futile
running game going nowhere and Wheatley standing on the sideline in
civilian clothes _ also going nowhere. Play Wheatley: if he doesn't
cut it, relegate him to the bench for eternity.
</P>
<P>
   Player and coach don't have to go to lunch with each other; the
fact of the matter is that the Giants' offense is being routinely
handed its lunch.
</P>
<P>
   As for Kanell, the 25-year-old in his first full year as a
starter, he is continuing to discover how difficult it is just to
be consistently ordinary in the National Football League: One week
he's neutralized by Dallas, the next week he's a star in San Diego,
the next week he's a goat in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   On the third play Sunday, Kanell threw an interception that
Charles Mincy returned for a 22-yard touchdown. ``That's life as a
QB in the NFL,'' Kanell said. ``You try to bounce back. I'll be
back firing next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming off the bench to save the day is one thing; making the
day from start to finish is quite another matter.

PADRES DEFEAT JOHNSON; NEXT UP _ THE BRAVES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The Houston Astros traded for Randy Johnson hoping
that he could lead them to a World Series.
</P>
<P>
   But the Astros' vaunted offense scored just two runs for him in
two division series games, and Sunday night the San Diego Padres
defeated him again, 6-1, to advance to the National League
Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres, who had beaten Johnson by 2-1 in Game 1, won the
three-of-five-game series, 3-1, and will face the Braves in Atlanta
on Wednesday in Game 1 of the NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Leyritz continued his post-season heroics with a
second-inning home run off Johnson, and the Padres nicked Johnson
for an unearned run in the bottom of the sixth inning to break a
1-1 tie in front of 64,898 at Qualcomm Stadium. And after
pinch-hitter John Vander Wal tripled and Wally Joyner homered in a
four-run eighth, the Padres had advanced to their first
championship series in 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the first three games in this series were decided by one
run. On Saturday, San Diego Manager Bruce Bochy had gambled by
starting Kevin Brown, who pitched in Game 1, on three days' rest.
San Diego won that game on Leyritz's seventh-inning home run.
Houston Manager Larry Dierker had saved Johnson for an elimination
situation. And Dierker was hoping Sunday that Johnson could get the
series back to Houston for a deciding game Monday night, where
Shane Reynolds had already flown home in anticipation of the Game 5
start.
</P>
<P>
   In his six innings, Johnson allowed just three hits and one walk
while striking out eight. But Johnson's defense failed him in the
sixth. Now, Johnson is 0-5 in his last six post-season starts
dating to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Astros General Manager Gerry Hunsicker, who acquired Johnson
minutes before the trading deadline on July 31, said before
Sunday's game: ``That's the guy we were missing, that dominating
go-to guy when your back is to the wall and your season's on the
line. If we can beat them today, the momentum clearly shifts back
to us.''
</P>
<P>
   And if not?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't win this series, I won't have enjoyed this year,''
said Hunsicker, even though the Astros won their second consecutive
NL Central title with a franchise-record 102 victories.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres had acquired Leyritz from Boston on June 21, for two
relievers and a catcher, for altogether different reasons. San
Diego General Manager Kevin Towers said Sunday that his team
desperately needed some right-handed hitting help. And when he was
told by the Cardinals that Gary Gaetti was not available, Towers
pursued Leyritz, whose agent, Adam Katz, had told Towers his client
wanted a trade from the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz has a sparkling post-season history. But Sunday
afternoon, after Leyritz's second homer of the series had propelled
San Diego to a 2-1 victory in Game 3 on Saturday night, Padres
Manager Bruce Bochy said: ``Never in my wildest dreams did I think
he would be doing what he has done for us this past week.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, in his first at-bat Sunday against his old nemesis
Johnson, Leyritz went out and did it again.
</P>
<P>
   The animosity between Johnson and Leyritz began on May 31, 1995,
when Johnson, pitching for Seattle, hit Leyritz in the face with a
fastball to spark a brawl. Leyritz said earlier this week that he
and Johnson had cleared the air. But even though Leyritz had
collected a key sacrifice fly against Johnson in San Diego's Game 1
victory in Houston, Leyritz was just 5 for 40 (.125) with one
career home run against the imposing left-hander when Game 4 began.
</P>
<P>
   But in the post-season overall, Leyritz was 12 for 33 with five
home runs. And when Leyritz hit a belt-high fastball 422 feet to
left-center field to lead off the second, he had his sixth
post-season home run and the Padres had an early 1-0 lead against
Johnson, who was not throwing nearly as hard as he had in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's fastball was being clocked at only 91 to 93 mph for
most of the game. Sterling Hitchcock's fastball was not reaching
those speeds, but the left-hander was in synch with his personal
catcher, Leyritz, from the game's first pitch, and Hitchcock kept
the strongest lineup in the league off balance with an assortment
of fastballs, curveballs and splitters.

EDITORIAL: THE CERTAINTY OF REFORM
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 5:
</P>
<P>
   In the final days of a dismal session, Trent Lott appears to
have buried the best chance in years to clean up the nation's
corrupt election fund-raising system. The Senate majority leader's
last pirouette of hypocrisy included his recent description of
President Clinton as ``fund-raiser in chief'' for the Democrats,
offered even as Lott was raising bundles of money for Republicans
and serving as executioner in chief for the McCain-Feingold
campaign reform bill. But the cause of restoring integrity to the
American election process is not dead permanently. With majorities
in both the Senate and the House favoring change, it can only gain
momentum next year.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign reform was repeatedly declared finished over the past
year by the old hands in Washington, only to spring back to life.
Once lawmakers were forced to vote, many realized that they could
not deplore and investigate the excesses of the 1996 campaign while
doing nothing to prevent their recurrence. That is why the
Shays-Meehan bill, the House version of reform, passed 252 to 179,
with 61 Republicans defying Newt Gingrich to vote yes. In the
Senate, 7 Republicans lined up with 45 Democrats to favor change,
falling short of the 60 necessary to break the filibuster
engineered by Lott and his chief fund-raiser, Mitch McConnell of
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   This page urged Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Russell
Feingold of Wisconsin to keep trying to reintroduce their bill as
an amendment to various pieces of legislation, forcing repeated
votes that might embarrass some Republicans, especially those
running for re-election, into supporting reform. But McCain now
argues that doing so will alienate more Republicans than it
attracts, especially if the bill is attached to important spending
bills that need to pass before the end of the fiscal year. After a
promising performance earlier in the year, McCain has been
disappointingly deferential to the Republican leadership, perhaps
because of his presidential ambitions. But the hard reality is that
it may be too late to push the bill onto the agenda this year.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold may make another try, and we wish him well. He has
persisted in the cause of reform when others sneered. He may even
be paying a price. After promising to limit spending for his own
re-election campaign to $3.8 million, or a dollar for each voter in
Wisconsin, he has been flooded by generic ``issue ads'' paid for by
the tainted soft money harvested in Washington by Lott and
McConnell. Lott can score all the points he wants by accusing the
president of going to too many fund-raisers, but Lott plays host to
his own soft-money marathons, while making sure to hold up banking,
tobacco and health care legislation so as to squeeze every last
dollar out of special interests affected. So far in this election
cycle, Republican congressional campaign committees have raised $37
million, more than five times the amount four years ago and nearly
twice the sum raised by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In the last election cycle, more than $250 million in
unregulated ``soft money'' flowed to the political parties from
corporations, unions and rich donors to the parties. These
donations led to the biggest campaign scandals in a generation. It
is not hard to predict that, with even more soft money flowing in
the next two years, there will be even bigger scandals. Another
election tainted by money from wealthy and powerful interests will
turn off the electorate, and congressional leaders will wonder
disingenuously what they can do to alleviate public cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, the elected politicians will redeem the
public's trust and return to the spirit of their democracy. It is
only a matter of time.

STRESS FRACTURE TO CSUN'S SOUL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sean Beard, leaning on his crutches with his right
leg already in a cast, vowed after Cal State Northridge's 44-17
pummeling of Southern Utah on Saturday that he'd return this
season.
</P>
<P>
   It might be in four weeks, in six weeks or two months, but the
junior nose guard said his broken fibula won't end his season. He
said it with conviction. With belief. It was said more with emotion
than a sense of reality.
</P>
<P>
   That's Sean Beard. A psychological and inspirational cog in
CSUN's defense. Personnel-wise, someone else can take his place.
But what Beard offers on the intangible end is what makes this such
a damaging injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll hurt us in the long run just as far as emotional
support,'' CSUN safety Jeremy Golden said. ``Beard was a totally
emotional player. As long as he's there with us in the locker room
before the game, he'll still be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Beard is a down-and-dirty dog (in a flattering way) in the
trenches, a stocky 6-foot, 300-pound rock from Mt. San Antonio
College. He fills gaps, taking on two blockers on most plays. Then
he gets up and heads back to the huddle and does it again.
</P>
<P>
   Until he gets blocked high-low. Until he's engaged with one
offensive lineman high and another chops low at his legs.
</P>
<P>
   Illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got kind of ugly,'' CSUN coach Ron Ponciano said.
</P>
<P>
   Beard was wheeled off the field in the first quarter in a
makeshift chariot-like contraption, and by halftime his status was
known. Then the Matadors' third-string nose guard, Marcus Nance,
left with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just getting skinny there,'' CSUN defensive
coordinator Craig Wall said. ``That's going to be a big topic, what
we're going to do with it. Not only is (Beard) a good player, but
he's an emotional leader on or defense.''
</P>
<P>
   As former CSUN quarterback and current assistant coach Aaron
Flowers walked toward the field for the third quarter, he thought
back to a year ago, when he suffered the same injury. It took him
four weeks to return, a fact he passed on to Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's three to four weeks, but Aaron Flowers isn't 300
pounds,'' Beard said. ``He's a quarterback, but he's not 300
pounds. Every play I'm hit, and putting pressure on that leg. Our
plan is to go to the playoffs and that's where we're going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN has players to fill Beard's spot on the field. Backup nose
guard Jacob Mageo missed the game with a combination shoulder/neck
injury and Eric Falconer is close to returning after knee surgery.
However, none is Sean Beard.
</P>
<P>
   __ Polls apart: Publicly, the Matadors said all the right things
about not being ranked in either of last week's Division I-AA major
polls. Privately, CSUN was stunned it didn't crack the top 25. But
when the polls come out today, CSUN may just be biting mad if
doesn't gain its first ranking since moving to I-AA.
</P>
<P>
   In the ESPN/USA Today coaches' poll, CSUN (3-1) was 27th last
week. But No.14 Connecticut (3-1), No.18 Northern Arizona (3-2) _
which the Matadors routed 41-10 last month _ and No.20 Northern
Iowa (2-2) all lost. In the Sports Network poll, CSUN was 26th,
Northern Iowa 17th, UConn 18th and Northern Arizona 20th.

ROOM AT TOP? NOS. 1 AND 2 NOT DOMINANT

   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ The two college football coaches on top believe
they know something about staying there. Ohio State's John Cooper
said that piling up ``solid wins'' makes his team immune to the
whims of poll voters and the computer-ranking calculations.
Nebraska's Frank Solich said that achieving consistent excellence
is about winning the games you are supposed to win.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, the Buckeyes, ranked No. 1 in The Associated Press
media poll, the coaches poll and The New York Times computer
ranking, notched a solid, if not spectacular, 28-9 victory over Big
10 rival Penn State. And the Cornhuskers, ranked No. 2 in all
three, just barely won a game they should have won easily by
stopping Oklahoma State running back Nathan Simmons a foot short of
the goal line on the final play to preserve a 24-17 victory.
</P>
<P>
   But living up to a coach's adage is harder than it looks.
</P>
<P>
   Survey the current college football landscape for the evidence.
Better, consider that Cooper's and Solich's teams have to live up
to the other's axiom if the Buckeyes and the Cornhuskers are going
to meet in the Fiesta Bowl for the national title.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming weeks, Nebraska needs solid victories over ranked
teams Texas A&AMP;M, Missouri and Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State has beaten three Top 25 teams, but now heads into its
Big 10 schedule against seven teams that have a combined record of
16-17 _ none of them ranked, not even its traditional nemesis,
Michigan. Those are games the Buckeyes should win.
</P>
<P>
   How hard will that be? Louisiana State needed a solid victory
over Georgia on Saturday night to continue to climb in the polls.
LSU was at home in Tiger Stadium, one of the most difficult places
in the nation for a visitor to play, and twice late in the game the
Tigers drove deep into Georgia territory but came away with field
goals. They lost, 28-27.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Georgia's freshman quarterback, Quincy Carter, came up
bigger than LSU's senior Heisman Trophy candidate, Kevin Faulk.
While Faulk managed 88 yards on 17 carries, Carter completed 27 of
34 passes for 318 yards and 2 touchdowns. He led touchdown drives
in the Bulldogs' first three possessions. Carter also rushed for 41
yards, caught a pass for 36 yards and helped move his team up
solidly in both rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad that we were in position to make a move and we
haven't made it yet,'' LSU coach Gerry DiNardo said. ``Nothing is
permanent. We'll have another opportunity. I feel bad for the team,
but we have a lot of football left in us. It was fun being sixth
and trying to get higher, so we took a step back.''
</P>
<P>
   In the solid-victory category, UCLA beat Washington State,
49-17, and Arizona bested Washington, 31-28, when Wildcat
quarterback Ortege Jenkins somersaulted over three defenders into
the end zone with four seconds left to cap a highlight-ready 9-yard
scramble and the come-from-behind victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just wanted it more than the guys standing in the end
zone,'' Arizona Coach Dick Tomey said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Nebraska, Tennessee and Florida won games they should have
in very ugly fashion. The Volunteers had a 17-0 lead in the first
quarter but barely hung on, 17-9, courtesy of Auburn's three
turnovers. Six times, the Gators were inside Alabama's 12-yard
line. But they turned the ball over three times and settled for
three field goals to eke out a 16-10 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (4-0) dropped a spot to No. 4 in the AP poll, and to
seventh from third in the Times ranking, for the shaky performance.
Florida, whose only loss was to the Vols, was bumped up two spots
to No. 6 in the AP poll, but dropped to 21st from 14th in the Times
ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by Steve Spurrier's post-game remarks, the pollsters
were generous. ``We're extremely fortunate to win the ball game,''
the forlorn Florida coach said. ``I never had a ball game like this
in my life. The Gators don't play like champions anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Blame reputation for Nebraska not being penalized for barely
winning a game in which it was outplayed: Oklahoma State had 355
total yards to 215 for Nebraska and had the ball for 35 of the 60
minutes. Solich, in his first year, learned his ``win the ones you
should'' lesson from his mentor, Tom Osborne. Over 25 years,
Osborne lost only one game to a team that finished below .500 _ in
1992 to Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   Still, each season the Cornhuskers seem to survive a harrowing
experience. Last year against Missouri, on the final play of
regulation, a desperate Shevin Wiggins kicked a Scott Frost pass
into the end zone and into the arms of his teammate Matt Davison.
It sent the game into overtime, and Nebraska prevailed, 45-38.
</P>
<P>
   Against Oklahoma State, the break came when Cowboys lineman
Reynell Lavigne lined up in the wrong spot on the final play and
Nebraska's Mike Rucker knifed in to stop Simmons' plunge.
``Sometimes your whole season comes down to one play, and sometimes
it comes down to one foot,'' Rucker said.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes, meanwhile, can't lose focus as they march to their
season finale with Michigan. Ohio State doesn't play Wisconsin (No.
12 AP, No. 19 Times), and only Michigan State looks remotely
dangerous. The Buckeyes play a disappointing Michigan team at home.
Still, Ohio State is 1-8-1 against the Wolverines since 1987. Can
the Buckeyes win the games they should?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of motivation,'' Ohio State linebacker
Jerry Rudzinski said. ``We're 4-0 and still haven't played our best
game. I think that's enough motivation.'' &QL;

ISLANDERS ARE BACK, BUT MANY FANS ARE NOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ One week after they were ordered back into
Nassau Coliseum by a judge, the New York Islanders played there for
the first time since last season.
</P>
<P>
   But there was neither confetti nor streamers welcoming them
home. Even the four Stanley Cup championship banners were missing.
Instead, a small crowd of angry fans booed, wore hard hats and held
up signs expressing frustration or disappointment with the team's
ownership, which last month tried to move the teams' home games and
had not signed their two best players, Zigmund Palffy and Trevor
Linden.
</P>
<P>
   Even at $10 a seat _ season ticket-holders were admitted free _
there were fewer than 3,000 spectators at Sunday night's preseason
game against the Capitals, who won, 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Many fans have been alienated by the Islanders' new owners,
Steven Gluckstern and Howard Milstein, who said last month that the
Coliseum scoreboard was in danger of falling from the ceiling. The
team filed a $10 million lawsuit against SMG, the company that
manages the Coliseum, and moved out of the building.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers hired by the National Hockey League and Nassau County
later rebuffed the Islanders' argument and a bid to get out of the
lease. which is good through 2015 and does not give the team any
revenue from parking, concessions or advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's upsetting,'' said Dave Burrus of Yonkers, who bought
season tickets for the first time earlier this year. ``I don't
think the owners are as devoted as they said they were. It seems to
me that they are willing to throw the whole season away over a bad
lease.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Minichiello of White Plains, who has been a season
ticket-holder the past four years, was equally upset. ``The new
owners have promised so much, but they haven't done anything. They
don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans' anger seemed to be directed more at the Islanders'
organization than Nassau County or SMG, the company that maintains
the 26-year-old facility. A girl wearing a hockey sweater
autographed by every member of the Islanders held up a sign with
the message ``Stop wrecking our team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders were trailing the Capitals, 2-1, midway through
the second period when fans began to chant: ``We want Ziggy. We
want Ziggy.''
</P>
<P>
   But to have him in the lineup Saturday in the season opener
against Pittsburgh, the Islanders will have to pay $6.8 million per
season to the 26-year-old right wing, who scored 87 points last
season. The Islanders have not reached the postseason in four
years, and without Palffy or Linden they will surely struggle to
get there this season.
</P>
<P>
   The team is likely to struggle at the gate as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know and I don't really care,'' said Mike
Milbury, the Islanders' coach and general manager, when asked to
predict the size of the crowd for Sunday night's game.``I'm not
concerned about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The line of questioning caused Milbury to lose his patience.
``Ask me some hockey questions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the organization did answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected this size crowd,'' said David Seldin, Islanders
president.``I can understand why the fans feel angry and
frustrated. It's been a tough road for our fans and we haven't done
right by them.''

AN ALL-WORLD RUNNER, WHEN NOT RECOVERING
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By   MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. _ That smile on Robert Smith's face? It's a
grin of peace. Not contentment, but happiness knowing that maybe _
just maybe _ the most explosive running back you've hardly heard of
has put his injury-riddled past behind him.
</P>
<P>
   The closest Smith has come to a doctor recently was a visit to a
guy with Novocain in his hand. One morning last week, Smith took
off his Minnesota Vikings uniform, donned a bib and was told to
open wide. Three-quarters of a front tooth had been sheared off and
two other teeth were badly chipped. They had been shattered last
Sunday in Chicago after one of those high-stepping, jaw-dropping
Smith runs _ the ones he used to make between visits to the injured
reserve list. This time it was a 67-yard play on which Smith caught
a short pass and made like a speeding bullet. And when Smith does
that, he looks like a cross between Jim Brown and O.J. Simpson.
That's no exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   In the end zone, Smith was greeted by Vikings guard David Dixon,
who, at 352 pounds, is built like a World Trade Center. Dixon
opened his arms, blocking out the sun, and bearhugged Smith so hard
that he pushed the running back's face mask into his teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the only way I get hurt all season,'' Smith said,
``that's fine with me.''
</P>
<P>
   He can laugh now, but Smith's career has been one of the most
injury filled, yet fascinating, of any running back's in the 1990s.
Now, healthy for the first time in years _ knock on wood _ Smith
has established himself as an elite back, in the same class as
Barry Sanders, Terrell Davis and Curtis Martin. ``I definitely see
myself in that group,'' Smith said. ``But I'll leave that stuff up
to everybody else. It doesn't do any good if I consider myself in
that group and I don't help this team win ball games.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Vikings and Green Bay Packers play on Monday night at
Lambeau Field in a battle of 4-0 teams, it is Smith the Packers
will see as the biggest threat. As much as the Vikings' offense is
about their wide receivers _ Cris Carter, Jake Reed and the
explosive rookie Randy Moss _ Smith is the true key to whether
Minnesota can beat Green Bay and make a legitimate Super Bowl run.
</P>
<P>
   That is why it is so important that Smith stay healthy. A
first-round draft pick in 1993 after his sophomore year at Ohio
State, his rookie season in the National Football League was a
disaster because of two days in a hospital with chicken pox, an
inner-ear infection and, after 10 games, a season-ending knee
injury. A hip injury kept him out of several games in 1994; in
1995, it was a broken ankle. Torn knee ligaments in 1996 sent him
to the injured reserve. He played in nine games in 1995, eight in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Then came 1997. It was one of the quietest career years a
running back has ever had. Despite missing another two and a half
games because of an injured ankle, Smith set team records for
rushing yards in a season (1,266), 100-yard games in a season (6),
season rushing average (5.5) and consecutive carries without a
fumble (352). He also had two of the three longest runs in Vikings
history, blazing for 78 yards against Buffalo and 76 against
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings, thinking Smith was their ticket to a Super Bowl,
signed him to a five-year, $25 million contract in the off season.
Now, his wallet fat and his high-step back, Smith feels better than
he ever has. Coming into this weekend's games, Smith was third in
the NFL in rushing, with 384 yards on 75 carries and 2 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great,'' Smith said. ``I'm healthy, everything is good.
I'm not going to say I'll never get hurt again. That would be
stupidity. But I feel as good as I ever have in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's coaches like what they have seen this year. ``Robert is
a strong competitor,'' said the Vikings' running backs coach, Carl
Hargrave. ``Not only does he put pressure on the people around him,
he also puts it on himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Another thing that sets Smith apart, besides almost shocking
speed developed as a champion collegiate sprinter, is that he is
one of the most opinionated players in the NFL In a sport that
emphasizes the collective over the individual, Smith has managed to
keep his distinctiveness. He has never met a question he didn't
like.
</P>
<P>
   Smith on religion in the locker room: ``There are too many
players who are Christians who think because they're Christians,
they're better than other players. It's just like any other aspect
of society, when you have a majority group, and Christianity is the
majority in this country, that group has a tendency to think their
way is the right way. There is freedom of religion in this country,
and people shouldn't push Christianity on people who don't want to
be Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith on his teammate Moss, whose stock fell dramatically on
draft day because of off-field problems: ``We got the steal of the
draft. When are teams going to realize you can only hold a guy so
responsible for things he did when he was 19 or 20 years old? We've
all done things we're not proud of, that we wish we could take
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the problem is that many of the neighborhoods black
players grow up in, a lot of us get in trouble. That's no excuse.
That's just the environment we grew up in. It's darn near
impossible to avoid all the trouble. I mean, I was arrested a
couple of times before I even got to high school.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith on Vikings Coach Dennis Green, and why many Vikings
players think he has been treated unfairly by some fans and members
of the news media: ``Well, we're in Minnesota. The people here like
to think of themselves as liberal, but it's a pretty conservative
state. It's a predominantly white state. He's not a PR guy, he just
cares about getting the job done. And he's black. That plays a big
factor in some people's minds.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his own image, Smith knows there can be no long trips to
the trainer's room this season or it will be hard to erase that tag
of a player who can't stay healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about this season,'' Smith said. ``Both personally
and for our team.''
</P>
<P>
   His optimism is understandable. He's healthy, the Vikings are
winning, and he's a big reason why. &QL;

 &HT;    In violence of prison life, inmate clans offer security
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TENNESSEE COLONY, Texas _ Deep inside the Coffield prison, from
a tiny cage in a hallway, a young convict screams obscenities at
everyone. And no one.
</P>
<P>
   Down an adjacent corridor, an ``extraction team'' of guards in
riot
</P>
<P>
   helmets, padded vests and gas masks marches in lock step to a
cell where a convict has grabbed a mop from a trusty and is
threatening to hurt somebody. They spray him with tear gas and haul
him off in handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Across the way, a guard walks briskly, a plastic shield in front
of him at every step to avoid being splattered with urine and feces
that some convicts are throwing through their cell bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to animal house,'' says an unsmiling guard.
</P>
<P>
   Several corridors away, an identical cellblock holds hundreds of
other convicts whom prison officials deem just as dangerous. But
here, where the Barrio Azteca prison gang lives, the stillness is
broken only by bouncing basketballs in a recreation yard and the
``Jerry Springer Show'' blaring on a television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know how to do time,'' explains a gang member. ``We have
respect for each other. We enforce it.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the gangs are being blamed for increasing
violence in and out of prison, the reality in the maximum-security
lockups where gang members are segregated is orderly, almost
serene. The eerie calm highlights the central role gangs have come
to occupy in some Texas prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Even though gang activities are banned, membership has more than
quadrupled during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Even though prison officials' goal is to break up the gangs,
they house their members together because they're easier to manage
that way.
</P>
<P>
   And even though prison officials say they try to prevent gang
</P>
<P>
   activities, they have in some instances enlisted gang leaders in
efforts to maintain order.
</P>
<P>
   The Coffield Unit, about 60 miles southwest of Tyler, Texas,
holds about 1,000 of 5,000 confirmed gang members in Texas prisons,
more than any other unit. Entire cellblocks are filled with members
of Barrio Azteca, Mexican Mafia, Hermanos Pistoleros Latinos, Raza
Unida, Texas Mafia and Texas Syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   One convict to a cell. All mail is closely monitored. No one
leaves his cell without handcuffs and constant escort, and only
then for up to two hours, for a shower or for recreation with other
gang members.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there are increasing questions about whether the strict
rules are effective, about whether prison officials are doing
enough. ``In some cases, I think guards are encouraging and
allowing gang activity to happen,'' said Linda Reeves, with Texas
Inmate Family Association, an advocacy group. ``And that's not
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Scott, executive director of the Texas Department of
Criminal Justice, disagrees. ``Are we in charge? Absolutely. Are
these gangs calling the shots? Absolutely not,'' he said. ``By
keeping these gangs in a very controlled environment, we watch
everything they do. . . . They play by our rules.''
</P>
<P>
   On B Wing, where the Barrio Azteca members live, convicts say
the rules that count are those of the gang.
</P>
<P>
   Amid growing concern by police about the spreading influence of
prison gangs inside and outside prison, some legislative leaders
suggest that the segregation of gang members, in solitary
confinement with their colleagues, may not be the wisest choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we cage them in administrative segregation, label them gang
members and never deal with them, never offer them any programs to
change their attitude or life, which is what we seem to be doing
now . We're probably going to see worse criminals when they come
out,'' said state Sen. John Whitmire, chairman of the Senate
Criminal Justice Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials defend the system as practical and proven, one
that avoids the bloody trouble that might come from mixing gang
members, even in small groups, even in solitary cells, next to each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``They earn this level of incarceration by their behavior,''
Scott said. ``Gangs or not, we have one of the safest prison
systems in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Rules of the gangs
</P>
<P>
   Although the guards enforce one set of rules, the gangs have a
code that exists alongside it.
</P>
<P>
   Yelling or speaking disrespectfully to fellow gang members will
result in a warning, sometimes delivered orally, sometimes in a
written message delivered by ``fishing lines,'' string and long
poles fashioned out of rolled-up newspaper with a hook on the end
to pass communiques from cell to cell, even between floors.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't heed the warning, a beating may be in store,
</P>
<P>
   administered on a recreation court or day room by the small
groups of gang members who are allowed out at the same time for
recreation, the only group activity permitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internal discipline'' is the way Warden Keith Price and other
prison officials sometimes describe it.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, just as on the street, a gang member will break
the wrong rule, and a top member of the gang can order him killed.
At least three such death orders have been carried out this year in
Texas prisons, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Most recent: a July 3 stabbing at the Allred prison outside
Wichita Falls, where investigators suspect a Mexican Mafia member
was ordered killed. In June and July, gang members were responsible
for 94 major incidents in prison, ranging from assaults to weapon
possession to disobeying guards. Most were members of one gang
attacking members of another.
</P>
<P>
   With the growing gang numbers in prison has come growing
problems. Low parole rates and less time off for good behavior have
stripped away incentives to behave. More prisoners are serving more
time for more violent crimes. These conditions make prison a
fertile place for gangs, said Gary Johnson, director of the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice's prison division.
</P>
<P>
   And for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, officials say, pepper spray, tear gas grenades and
</P>
<P>
   physical force are being required to quell disturbances. In
recent
</P>
<P>
   months, more than two dozen prisons have experienced gang
problems.
</P>
<P>
   On July 19, guards used tear gas to subdue a fight between black
and Hispanic convicts in a dorm at the Segovia prison in South
Texas, but not before six combatants broke down a wall into an
adjacent dorm, according to a prison report.
</P>
<P>
   More common: a Sept. 9 stabbing at the Beto I Unit near
Tennessee Colony, one of 12 reported at the prison in a few weeks
involving members of the Puro Raza Mexicales gang and the rival
Tango Mexicales.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the violence, gang membership can offer protection from
</P>
<P>
   predators, even a sense of family, experts say. Or it can mean a
ticket to a unit with other members of their gang, such as Coffield
B Wing, where the Barrio Azteca members live in relative peace.
</P>
<P>
   Increased violence in prisons endangers not only gang members
but also guards and prisoners who are trying to straighten out
their lives, officials say. And taxpayers bear the cost of
increased security inside prisons. And one day, most convicts will
emerge from prison, back onto the streets, back into communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, a robber might have taken pride in never
using a gun. Now, they'll shoot someone first and then rob them,''
said Sam Buentello, the prison system's top gang expert.
</P>
<P>
   Hatred and bonding
</P>
<P>
   In the prison culture of barely suppressed anger, of predatory
behavior and rape, a place of enforced uniformity and harsh
routine, there is hate.
</P>
<P>
   And prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   In this place where 45 percent of convicts are black, 29 percent
are white and 26 percent are Hispanic, where 61 percent of the
employees are white, 23 percent are black and 15 percent are
Hispanic, race is a denominator for everyday life, especially in
the tougher maximum-security units.
</P>
<P>
   In this environment, the same white uniforms, the same buzz-cut
hair, guards barking orders and convicts answering with epithets,
strip searches every time they come and go between their cells and
work, convicts seize on race and ethnicity as a bond.
</P>
<P>
   Or a reason to hate.
</P>
<P>
   Such hatred can breed violence that is furious and unthinkable,
like the June attack in Jasper that made national headlines, when
three white ex-convicts chained a man behind a pickup truck and
dragged him to death, just because he was black.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Petrick, a convicted Houston robber, knows well that
mentality of hate. Until 1993, he was a general for the Aryan
Brotherhood of Texas prison gang, a top leader who helped draft the
gang's constitution, someone other members once feared.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has renounced his membership, after refusing an
order to kill someone, they want to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard it all. . . . I lived the rhetoric,'' he said from
behind the
</P>
<P>
   plastic window on an interview booth at the Goree Unit in
Huntsville, where he is in protective custody. ``But I didn't kill
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials say his path into the gang, and into the
mentality of hate, is typical.
</P>
<P>
   First arrested at age 13, a ``ball of hate looking for a place
to turn,'' Petrick said, he affiliated with the Aryan Brotherhood
in 1985, while he was in the Harris County Jail, and joined four
years later. Having done prison time previously in California and
Minnesota, with a reputation for winning jailhouse fights, Petrick
probably seemed the perfect recruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was extremely racist,'' he said, explaining that his views
grew from a troubled childhood in which ``I started hating and
focusing that hate. . . . I felt I had a good reason to hate
society.''
</P>
<P>
   In prison, he said, race became just another reason to hate.
</P>
<P>
   Race, Petrick said, is ``all you have left in here. We're
stripped down. The only identity we have in prison is our skin
color.''
</P>
<P>
   To combat the racial and ethnic tensions, to try to adjust
convicts' attitudes before the inmates leave prison, officials
offer several anger-management and diversity lessons in prison
classrooms. But they are available only at the lower-security
units, generally not those where gang members and the tougher
convicts are locked up, and officials privately concede that their
effectiveness is limited if convicts have no desire to stop hating.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone wants to hate, they will hate,'' prison director
Scott said, noting that racial tensions tend to drop as the
security level of the prison decreases. ``People don't come to
prison for being good citizens. They come for breaking society's
rules.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Royce West, D-Dallas, a former prosecutor who chairs
a legislative committee studying prison gangs, agrees. But, like
other lawmakers and criminal justice academics, he questions
``whether race is actually the problem or whether it is really
other issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We get this uncut, raw, X-rated view of racism in the prison
system,'' he said. ``But I think prison gangs are using racism as a
crutch to attract other individuals to join them, and we need to
address that.''
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, racism figured heavily in the formation of
prison gangs in Texas two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Until the late 1970s, Texas prisons were segregated by race and
run by convicts known as ``building tenders,'' trusted prisoners
whom guards allowed to supervise dorms and cellblocks.
</P>
<P>
   Then federal court orders desegregated prisons and outlawed the
</P>
<P>
   building tender system. Hispanics, whites and blacks were forced
to live with one another.
</P>
<P>
   Racial and ethnic tensions flared. And for protection against
assaults and thefts, convicts formed gangs, mostly along racial and
ethnic lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Syndicate, formed years earlier in California prisons
by
</P>
<P>
   Texans seeking to protect themselves, was first. Then came
groups with names such as Mexican Mafia, Texas Mafia, Mandingo
Warriors, Self Defense Family and the Aryan Brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
   By 1985, Texas' seven prison gangs were big trouble. Of the 52
convict slayings in 1984-85, 48 were gang-related, prison officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 1,500 assaults on staff in 1985,'' said Buentello.
``All hell had broken loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Zero tolerance
</P>
<P>
   To regain control, prison officials adopted a zero-tolerance
policy
</P>
<P>
   that remains in effect today. If you are confirmed as a gang
member, you serve your sentence on lockdown, alone in a solitary
cell, with only an hour outside each day for exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, by the early 1990s, gangs started to grow again,
fed by an influx of young criminals who had grown up in street
gangs. In just a few years, the number of confirmed gang members
inside Texas prisons jumped from 1,280 to more than 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Barrio Azteca, Raza Unida and Hermanos Pistoleros Latinos were
added to the gang list. But dozens more smaller groups of convicts,
less-organized but ganglike in mentality nonetheless, began to
spring up, sporting names like the Kingwood Chongos, Tango
Mexicales, Aggieland Crypt and Bud Club.
</P>
<P>
   In all, officials estimate that as many as 10,000 convicts may
be
</P>
<P>
   affiliated with some gang or group of some sort inside Texas
prisons. But in a prison system with only 8,200
solitary-confinement cells, of which gang members now occupy well
over half, there is simply no room to isolate them all.
</P>
<P>
   But that could soon change.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials have announced plans to build a new generation
of
</P>
<P>
   solitary-confinement units at a cost of more than $100 million
to hold the growing number of violent convicts and die-hard gang
members. With that will come another whopping price tag: $53 a day
to house a convict in the high-security unit compared with $38 a
day for a regular prison.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the first of those units, the Estelle High-Security
Unit
</P>
<P>
   outside Huntsville, was opened. At Super Max, as the unit is
known, the cells have no bars or windows to the outside, only a
steel door with two narrow windows and a slot to pass food trays
through. More than half of the 660 convicts in the Super Max unit
are gang members, people like Juan Garza, serving 20 years for auto
burglary in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Garza, 31, is among a growing chorus of people who complain that
Super Max is too much _ too much isolation, too few programs, too
punitive an environment where convicts may only grow meaner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitting in this cell 23 hours a day doesn't better anyone,''
said
</P>
<P>
   Garza, a ninth-grade dropout whom prison officials identify as a
member of the Mexican Mafia. ``People go crazy here. . . . There
are guys that actually sit in front of a mirror and carry on an
entire conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   To break the solitude, gang members communicate by ``the
phone,'' the air vents through which they can talk to each other.
Much to the chagrin of guards, they also have learned how to
``fish,'' pass written messages between cells with string passed
through a small crack beneath the steel cell doors.
</P>
<P>
   They play chess by making hand signs through the small plastic
window in their cell doors.
</P>
<P>
   And during their one hour of recreation a day, singly in small
</P>
<P>
   chain-link pens where guards are near with clipboards to record
any gang-related conversations, Garza said they can talk.
</P>
<P>
   But will such tough treatment force convicts to change for the
better?
</P>
<P>
   And will it stop or thwart gang activity?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, say prison officials, who insist that assaults and
misbehavior
</P>
<P>
   have dropped markedly at Super Max. Convicts disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like tying up a dog, chaining him up . . . and
expecting him to come back five years later, 10 years later when
you haven't fed him right, you've mistreated him, and you go and
let him loose,'' Garza said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is he going to do? Eventually, he's going to go and bite
</P>
<P>
   somebody. And then we end up chaining him right back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the complaints and the high cost, prison officials
insist the new isolation beds are humane, and needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those beds will be filled as soon as we can get them open,''
said Allan Polunsky, a San Antonio lawyer who heads the prison
system's governing board. ``And the sooner the better.''
</P>
<P>
   In youth prisons
</P>
<P>
   At the Texas Youth Commission, Executive Director Steve Robinson
estimates that gang activity has jumped by 25 percent in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, in the first such uprising, teen-age delinquents
rioted at the Evins Regional Juvenile Center in Edinburg and took
control of a dorm for several hours. After 25 youth commission
staff members and 16 sheriff's deputies regained control, they
found graffiti for a Hispanic street gang _ one affiliated with a
prison gang _ amid the debris.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, delinquents tried the same thing at another
state school. And in May, officials thwarted plans for a similar
riot at the Crockett State School in East Texas. Twelve gang
leaders were locked up in solitary cells, Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   For a corrections system where rehabilitation programs are the
</P>
<P>
   priority, not steel-and-concrete punishment, the trend is
ominous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a toxic mix,'' Robinson said, noting that 40 percent of
youth
</P>
<P>
   commission delinquents admit an affiliation with a street gang.
``Gangs threaten the whole of what we do, because gang influences
interfere with the programs that are a key to what we do. That's
where we start to lose ground in rehabilitation.''
</P>
<P>
   While Robinson said no youth commission delinquents have been
found to be members of prison gangs, officials in recent months
have intercepted letters from adult convicts recruiting teen-age
offenders to join white-supremacist prison gangs. As a result,
correspondence from convicts is now are prohibited at youth
commission lockups.
</P>
<P>
   And youth commission officials are making plans to build
hundreds of single-cell lockups rather than traditional dorm-style
housing, where gang activity can be hard to control. About 40
percent of the agency's 3,000 beds are single-bunk.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to ``make gang behavior a lot more costly,''
Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Inmate ingenuity
</P>
<P>
   In the adult prisons, such a policy has been longstanding. And
while prison officials say it has curbed most violence, and
probably thwarted gang recruitment efforts inside prison, the
gangs' illicit ingenuity continues.
</P>
<P>
   Though prison rules prohibit tattooing, convicts still practice
it,
</P>
<P>
   using electronic parts from a vending machine or a fan, a needle
or razor blade, and a dye made from burned soap or ink. Prison
officials say tattooing is less prevalent now than in the past, a
result of gang members seeking to avoid the punishment for
detection: solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
   At the Coffield Unit, guards recently discovered that a gang
member had used a smuggled hacksaw blade to cut the bottom track
off his cell door so he could slip out to attack a rival. At the
Estelle High-Security Unit, a gang member used scouring powder on a
shoelace to do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They spend all day, every day trying to come up with ways to
beat us,'' said Michael Upshaw, warden of the Coffield cellblocks
that house gang members. ``And we work just as hard to keep them
from doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the white-supremacist Texas Aryan Brotherhood
tried to turn itself into a religious group _ the Church of Aryan
Christian Heritage Inc. _ as a way to force prison officials to let
members meet and correspond unimpeded.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, the Fraternal Order of the Aryan
Brotherhood was incorporated to promote an Aryan, Christian
culture. Its corporate address: the Terrell prison unit near
Livingston, in East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Even in prison, the gangs maintain a hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Cantu, listed by prison officials as a general in the
Mexican
</P>
<P>
   Mafia, occupies a cell at the Coffield Unit. But rather than
talk with
</P>
<P>
   visitors, sometimes even guards, he speaks through a spokesman _
another convict on his cellblock.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the reality,'' he tells a reporter, rattling his cell
door.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is all I got to say.''
</P>
<P>
   He directs a reporter up one floor to another convict who, he
says in Spanish, is his ``official spokesman.'' That convict
declines to talk.
</P>
<P>
   The gangs have leaders who make major decisions for members at
one or several prisons. Some are called ``general,'' some
``president.'' In some gangs, such as the Barrio Azteca at
Coffield, rank can be denoted by the number of ``plumas,'' Spanish
for feathers.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Saldivar, a member of the Mexican Mafia incarcerated at the
Estelle High-Security Unit, explains the hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might put somebody on restriction where we won't let him go
out for rec. But we try to do it as democratically as we can. We
pass around an envelope with different opinions on it. Everybody
has a chance to speak their piece. . . . We try to do it like they
do it in a court of law.''
</P>
<P>
   While convicts deny it, prison officials say they also use the
</P>
<P>
   messaging system to order violent crimes outside prison,
including murder.
</P>
<P>
   A federal indictment unsealed July 20 in San Antonio alleges
that eight members of the Mexican Mafia carried out 14 murders in
Texas between 1994 and 1997, including one in a state prison in
Brazoria County, in a conspiracy hatched inside and outside of
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Such allegations can add to a gang's clout inside the violent
prison. ``The members of these gangs do what they are told to do,''
Warden Price says. ``If one of their leaders tells them to shut up,
they shut up, because if they don't, they know there's consequences
_ harsh consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, he says, explains why the Barrio Azteca cellblock in B
Wing ``is probably one of the cleanest . . . one of the quietest
cellblocks on the entire unit. It's all gangsters.''

THOUSANDS PAY LAST RESPECTS TO FORMER L.A. MAYOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE CONDON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- To Leana Babineaux, there was one big difference
in Los Angeles after Tom Bradley was elected in 1973 as the city's
first African-American mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of color were able to take part in what was going
on inside City Hall, instead of standing at the door looking
inside,'' said Babineaux, a 52-year-old resident of South Central.
``We were very happy when he became mayor. It was like we were
standing forward with our chest out.''
</P>
<P>
   Babineaux was one of thousands of Los Angeles residents who
filed past Bradley's body Sunday at a public viewing at the South
Hall of the Los Angeles Convention Center. Bradley, who retired in
1993, died after a heart attack Tuesday. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services will be held Monday for Bradley at 10 a.m. at
the First African Methodist Episcopalian Church at 2270 S. Harvard
Blvd. Vice President Al Gore, California Gov. Pete Wilson, Lt. Gov.
Gray Davis, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, Los Angeles County
Supervisor Chair Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, LAPD Chief Bernard C.
Parks and Los Angeles City Council President John Ferraro are
scheduled to speak.
</P>
<P>
   While Monday's service will mark the city's official farewell to
Bradley, people at the viewing Sunday said it gave them the chance
to reflect on how the mayor had touched their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``By showing up and saying goodbye to Tom, they are showing how
much he was loved by the people of Los Angeles,'' Riordan said
after he visited the Convention Center on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Jackson, 63, said she first met Bradley in the 1960s, when
he was a councilman and she asked him to come speak to a
Parent/Teachers Association meeting. Later she invited him to speak
at her church. Both times he accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was such a gracious man, you could approach him,'' Jackson
said, a retired teacher's assistant for Los Angeles city schools.
``He worked to open up City Hall not just for black people but for
all people.''
</P>
<P>
   Mischelle (cq) Baker said she knew Bradley because she is
related to one of his nieces. Still a teen-ager when Bradley was
making his rise politically in the 1960s, Baker said he was a role
model for her. His election as mayor in 1973 was a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It let me see I could reach a lot farther than a lot of people
in my family had,'' said Baker, now an industrial engineer at
Northrop-Grumman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was opening up all the doors so people like me and my son
could walk through them a little easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's family on Sunday issued a statement thanking the
hundreds of volunteers who have helped the family in the past few
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Words cannot really express our gratitude to the people who
have come by the house, sent notes and gifts, and offered to help
in any possible way. Today's public viewing at the Convention
Cemter and tomorrow's celebration of Tom Bradley's life would not
have been possible without our remarkable friends and many
volunteers. I know my father would be so thankful to everyone who
has helped in many ways,'' said Lorraine Bradley, the eldest
daughter of the five-term mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Rivera, a 40-year-old East Los Angeles homemaker, said she
decided to attend the viewing because Bradley always made sure to
be there for important events in her community when he was mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always involved with the community. He was at every
store opening, he was in every parade,'' Rivera said. ``He united
the races. We still need him to continue his work.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also an important role model for young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children looked up to him. If he could do it, if a
sharecropper's son could become mayor, they could do it too,''
Rivera said.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Watkins, a union representative for the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, flew in from
Washington, D.C., for the services. Watkins had been part of many
negotiations with Bradley over the years regarding employees
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understood the plight of the working man,'' said Watkins,
who campaigned for Bradley in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran on a slate of coalition politics. The idea was to
include everybody, and it worked,'' Watkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing at the downtown skyscrapers in the distance, Watkins
said Bradley was as responsible as anyone for the development of
the city's most important business center.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the skyline and think, It all happened on his
watch,'' Watkins said.

EDITORIAL: A CHANGED WORLD FOR THE IMF 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 5:
</P>
<P>
   The world has changed greatly in the past year, since the last
annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund. Then, although
policy makers were slow to realize it, the world was seeing the
first clear problems caused by excessive investments in emerging
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Now the investment world has turned on its head. Banks and
investors that once acted as if there were no risks see nothing but
risks. An international credit crunch is looming, in which many
will not be able to borrow.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is right to look for ways to deal
with that problem. Its idea of setting up an IMF procedure to
provide capital to countries threatened by rapid withdrawals of
funds deserves careful consideration, as does a Japanese initiative
to aid Asian countries, during the annual meetings of the IMF and
World Bank this week in Washington. The greatest risk is that major
countries will be unable to reach agreement on effective action.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings come with the IMF having been humbled over the past
year as its prescriptions for troubled Asian countries did not
produce the desired cures, and unwanted side effects forced it to
dilute the medication. When first Thailand and then South Korea and
Indonesia got into trouble in 1997, the IMF prescribed a blend of
fiscal and monetary belt-tightening that is best suited to
countries whose governments have been running big budget deficits.
But the problems in Asia were more in the private sector, stemming
in part from crony capitalism but largely from the willingness of
investors to shovel capital at banks and companies that were ill
equipped to use it wisely. Severe recessions have resulted, forcing
the IMF to be less stringent.
</P>
<P>
   With investors now excessively risk averse, and with many
companies and banks in emerging markets burdened with unpayable
debts, the biggest risk confronting the world is of deflation and
global recession. That means ways must be found to restructure
debts _ with penalties for those who lent money imprudently as well
as for those who borrowed the money. Economies must be kept
functioning while needed reforms are made.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF must play a role in that process, and in ways that make
it more likely its aid will benefit the people of the affected
countries _ rather than bail out investors, as has happened too
often in the past. The Clinton proposal would have the IMF lend
money to countries that have made reforms but still face capital
flight in the current risk-averse investing environment. In some
cases, those countries will probably have to move to floating
exchange rates, something the IMF has resisted in the past but will
sometimes need to encourage.
</P>
<P>
   The need for the IMF to adjust to changed conditions is clear.
But that should not obscure the fact that in a world with hesitant
investors, countries that deserve support may have to turn to the
IMF. Approving the $18 billion the administration is seeking will
probably be only the first step needed, but some members of the
House Republican leadership continue to balk with time running out
in the current session. They owe it to the world to approve the
money immediately.

 JOSEPH McCARTHY, 79, PILOT IN DAM-BUSTER RAID  
(lb) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was considered quite a show at the time: a brazen
British bombing raid in 1943 on a trio of strategic German dams
carried out with such high-spirited elan, employing such
delightfully preposterous techniques and producing such spectacular
success that it gave an immediate boost to battered British morale
in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   One of the last surviving pilots, Joseph C. McCarthy, an
American at the time of the raid, died of emphysema at his home in
Virginia Beach, Va., on Sept. 6 at age 79.
</P>
<P>
   The dam-busting raid of May 16 made instant heroes of the 11
pilots who survived the mission, which claimed eight of the raid's
19 Lancaster bombers and 53 of their 133 crewmen. Their remarkable
bouncing bombs wreaked watery havoc on the industrial Ruhr valley,
breaching two of the dams and sending almost half a billion tons of
water cascading down river channels in walls 50 feet high, smashing
bridges, factories and power plants for 100 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Some have argued that it was the turning point of the war, but
even if it was not, the raid is recalled so fondly even today that
it sends chills down British spines every time the 1955 film ``The
Dam Busters'' is shown on television.
</P>
<P>
   For all the British pride in their beloved dam busters, if it
can be said that the Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing
fields of Eton, it would not be much more of an exaggeration to
suggest that the attack on the Ruhr dams was wrought in part on the
flying fields of New York City, for that is where McCarthy learned
to fly.
</P>
<P>
   As the lone American in 617 Squadron, the secret and now storied
unit formed and trained expressly to carry out the low-flying raid,
McCarthy was the Bronx-bred man whom the British knew as Big Joe.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy was a native of St. James, Long Island, who grew up in
the Bronx, where a grandfather had been a deputy sheriff and his
father was a New York City fireman. He worked as a lifeguard at
Coney Island and learned to fly as a teen-ager. He got into the
fray because he had been so eager to see aerial action against the
Germans that he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force months before
the United States entered the war in December 1941.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the average life expectancy of a bomber pilot was
16 missions, McCarthy, like the other crack pilots recruited for
the Ruhr raid, had established his flying expertise by completing
30 bombing runs over Germany. After the raid he completed 40 more.
</P>
<P>
   He had also become a favorite of his fellow pilots. A
6-foot-3-inch, 225-pound man known as the big blond American,
McCarthy had a personality as outsized as his physique and an
outspoken penchant for unrestrained American profanity that trumped
the more timid oaths of his compatriots.
</P>
<P>
   In the end McCarthy lost the cultural clash. By the time the war
was over he had gone British, affecting a pipe, a walking stick and
a dog on a leash. ``If I'm going to be an officer and a
gentleman,'' he said, ``I'm going to have a crack at looking the
part.''
</P>
<P>
   The transformation was so complete that to remain in the RCAF he
became a Canadian citizen after the war, serving in a variety of
military posts. They included an international assignment in
Norfolk, Va., which led him to retire in 1969 to nearby Virginia
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Few people there knew that he had been personally congratulated
by King George VI and invested with the prestigious Distinguished
Service Order for his role in what the British still recall as one
of the most spectacular bombing raids in aviation history.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If it does not seem surprising that the same British military
establishment that invented snooker should embrace the outlandish
idea of skipping bombs across the water to destroy a dam, it was
not whimsy but military expedience that produced the audacious
scheme.
</P>
<P>
   The dams holding back three rivers _ the Eder, the Moehne and
the Sorpe _ emptying into the Ruhr, a Rhine tributary, were obvious
enough military targets, because destroying them could do serious
harm to the arms factories in Germany's industrial heartland.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was how to do it. At a time when bombs sometimes
missed their targets by as much as five miles, it was considered
futile to try to make a direct hit on top of a dam, especially with
a bomb big enough to cause a serious breach.
</P>
<P>
   Since a dam's most vulnerable spot was at its base, beneath the
waterline, torpedoes would have been an alternative, but the
landlocked lakes were inaccessible to submarines. Yet the Germans
had not taken the precaution of using a series of surface booms and
underwater nets to protect the dams against torpedoes dropped from
the air.
</P>
<P>
   British military planners had written off any notion of
attacking the dams until a brilliant, eccentric scientist named
Barnes Wallis came up with the idea of bouncing rapidly
backspinning cylinder bombs across the water until they hit the dam
and crawled down its concrete face, where a hydrostatic trigger
would set them off at the right depth.
</P>
<P>
   The idea eventually won the approval of the British high
command, who, after all, would not be the ones charged with flying
through a wall of flak to deliver 10,000-pound bombs at a precise
distance from a dam while flying at a precise, slow speed at an
altitude of exactly 60 feet.
</P>
<P>
   This was clearly a job for the colonials. Indeed, while the
dog-fighting Battle of Britain had attracted a corps of
swashbuckling British aristocrats, there were few among the British
bomber pilots. Their ranks were filled from the Commonwealth
countries of Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and especially
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of the actual mission, the 617 Squadron had already
laid the groundwork for the legend that would be reflected in the
1955 movie starring Michael Redgrave as Wallis and Richard Todd as
Wing Commander Guy Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 McCarthy, as one of the three surviving dam-busting
pilots, attended 50th-anniversary celebrations in England.
</P>
<P>
   With the passage of time what had once seemed a jolly good show
has lost some of its original luster, in part because the Germans
quickly repaired the extensive damage and in part because more
attention has been paid to the raid's human toll. More than 1,400
people drowned, among them some 750 slave laborers from half a
dozen countries, including a contingent of Ukrainian women trapped
in a padlocked compound.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy's bomb caused negligible damage, except to the dam.
Although he delivered his bomb perfectly and it detonated as
planned, his target was an earthen dam that absorbed much of its
impact.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy is survived by his wife, Alice; two children, Joseph B.
McCarthy and Karen Westergaard, both of Virginia Beach; a brother,
Frank, of Glendale, and five grandchildren.

RETURNING TO SIMPLE JOYS OF FISHING
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By PETE BODO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDES, N.Y. _ These days, walking any distance to go fishing is
like leaping to pluck a gleaming apple off a bough and eating it on
the spot. The scenario strikes a poignant, familiar chord in all of
us. But few people actually do it. We buy our apples at the
supermarket and when we get a chance to fish, we drive right up to
the roadside pullout beside the river and jump out, ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Richard Franklin and I decided that hiking in to fish for
brook trout in a remote pond near this upstate community in the
Catskills would be a novel way to end the trout season. Wild
brookies, woefully sensitive and unspeakably lovely creatures, have
gone the way of walking. These days, most flyfishers want to match
wits with tough, wily brown trout or zesty rainbows, neither of
which is native to Northeastern waters. Moreover, we can drive our
loaded sports utility vehicles within casting distance of them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the hapless native brookie is steadily pushed into
the ever-diminishing nook of cold, pure water by its more hardy and
flexible cousins, and by the degradation of the environment. We
sometimes forget that a creature need not be fierce to be
quintessentially wild.
</P>
<P>
   An hour into our hike, bearing unwieldy inflated float tubes on
our backs like gaudy blue-and-tan balloons, we were right back at
square one. We had taken three wrong trails, and broken a sweat in
doing so. We felt ashamed, with good reason. In his own way, each
of us was thinking, ``So it's come to this.'' But we started off
again, marching uphill, through stands of sturdy oak, cherry, beech
and ash trees. We hiked about two miles. Then, off in the distance
below us, I saw through the blazing fall foliage the dark glint of
water.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-pound porcupine, a creature with no reason to run even at
the worst of times, allowed us to approach within about 15 feet
before it flared its neck and rump to display its ivory quills. It
didn't even bother to turn head-on to confront us. The porcupine
stood sideways, regarded us and then waddled off along the
shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   Soon we had strapped on our flippers and plopped into the float
tubes. These rigs, ingenious variations on the inner tube, allow
anglers to maneuver and fish freely in still water of any depth.
The trade-off is that you look like a floating bathtub toy, and
feel as if you were nestled in a cushy Barcalounger. The only thing
missing is the remote.
</P>
<P>
   But the sensation is misleading, because these ``belly boats''
are quiet and unobtrusive, ideally suited for the low-impact
approach that befits fishing in remote, pristine waters.
</P>
<P>
   I called over to Richard. The ghastly echo of my voice startled
me. By virtue of its surroundings, this pond demanded absolute
silence. While neither of us had experienced that natural mandate
in a long time, we grew accustomed to it quickly. And under that
mantle of silence, wild brook trout tipped up their snouts and
gently sipped tiny yellow mayflies from the surface of the black
water.
</P>
<P>
   Brookies are neither discriminating feeders nor spectacular
fighters when stung by the hook. When it comes to that ``man vs.
fish'' thing, they just don't get it, not any more than the great
herds of bison understood the nature of the chase in the heyday of
the great buffalo hunt. They just stood there and fell when shot.
Likewise, brook trout will usually take any old fly, the gaudier
the better, if you throw it in front of them. But even that is
sometimes easier said than done.
</P>
<P>
   The brookies of the pond were elusive, rising sporadically. By
the time we cast to a rise, the fish were long gone. This was not
the game of skill that flyfishers crave to play with steadily
rising trout. It was much more natural than that. Dead trees stood
like giant bones at the marshy end of the pond, and behind them the
colored hardwoods and handsome dark pines shivered in the light
breeze and sparkled in the clear sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, we paddled over to some odd structures barely
visible on the far shore of the pond. It turned out that they were
part of a spillway, slab concrete and steel pipe, man-made. But in
the deep hole near the outflow we saw the fish _ half a dozen of 15
or 16 inches, with broad olive backs. The conspicuous ivory edging
on their fins identified them as brookies. The fish hung suspended
in the water like paintings on a wall. Occasionally, one would
leisurely swim a lap of the pool.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost spawning time, and the big brookies probably
gathered there because a hint of flow deceptively suggested the
existence of a tributary in which they could find ideal spawning
habitat. It didn't seem quite right to fish for them from atop a
culvert, but I did anyway. I didn't catch any. I guess at some
level all of us were fooled, but I'm proud to say that we didn't
get lost hiking back out to the car. &QL;

PHILIP GRUSHKIN, 77; DESIGNED FINE BOOKS FOR MORE THAN 5 DECADES
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By KATHRYN SHATTUCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Philip Grushkin, a book designer whose work made him the
standard-bearer throughout the publishing industry, died on Sept.
25 at Hackensack University Medical Center in Hackensack, N.J. He
was 77 and lived in Englewood, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, his daughter, Dena Florczyk, said.
</P>
<P>
   Over five decades, Grushkin designed hundreds of books for
publishers including Alfred A. Knopf, Random House, Abbeville and
Harry N. Abrams, where he worked as art director during the 1960s
when the company came to prominence as a leading art book
publisher. He then formed his own company, Philip Grushkin Inc.,
working in a third-floor studio and darkroom in his home,
surrounded by airbrush equipment, gadgets, pens, rules and
thousands of pieces of paper assembled in piles. His life was
literally books, said his son, Paul, noting that some 10,000
volumes lined the walls of the Grushkins' home.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he was an invisible presence, his work evident only to a
book's author, the publisher's editorial and design staff, the
printer and the bindery. Among the books considered exemplary
examples of his art are ``History of Art,'' by H.W. Janson; ``A
History of Far Eastern Art,'' by Sherman E. Lee, and ``Atlas of
Human Anatomy,'' by Frank H. Netter.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Brooklyn, Grushkin discovered art at an early age.
He studied at Cooper Union in Manhattan and then became the star
pupil of the master book designer George Salter. Like Salter,
Grushkin taught his art to others, first at Cooper Union, then at
New York University, the University of Virginia and Radcliffe
College. Hand-lettering was his mantra and muse. A computer, he
argued, obliterated all that felt alive.
</P>
<P>
   But in the mid-1990s, Grushkin discovered that no publisher
would accept a finished book design except on a computer disk. In
six months he taught himself how to design full books on a
computer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his daughter, Dena, of Teaneck, N.J., and his son
Paul of Pinole, Calif., he is survived by his wife, Jean; another
son, Jonas of Durango, Colo., two brothers, Stanley of Virginia
Beach, Va., and Daniel of Miami, and six grandchildren.

<P>
   &LR; The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 5:
</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The New York Yankees would no doubt prefer to have all eyes
trained on their quest for another World Series title. But their
inspiring on-field performance cannot shut out that other fall
classic _ &UR;  &LR; the struggle over the future of their storied stadium.
Recent developments fortify the case for keeping this ball club in
its historic home in the Bronx. Gov. George Pataki has affirmed his
support for this location. The possibilities for upgrading the
structure and enhancing the surrounding neighborhood were laid out
in a new $535 million renovation plan, drafted by a respected
architectural firm at the behest of Bronx Borough President
Fernando Ferrer. That plan and others like it should whet
everyone's appetite for a competition to design a stadium, a museum
and surrounding amenities worthy of baseball's premier franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Architectural drawings, of course, are more likely to fire the
public's imagination than the words uttered by a governor in
re-election mode. Nevertheless, Gov &UR; . &LR;  Pataki's pledge that the
Yankees ``belong in the Bronx, period'' is not some throwaway line
from a cheerleader in Albany. His words derive their power from his
control over the ball-park site he does not mention: the West Side
rail yards in Manhattan. They are owned by the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, whose board the governor controls.
</P>
<P>
   The West Side is the option that often elicits rhapsodic
comments from George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner,
and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. The governor, however, has a fiduciary
responsibility to safeguard this MTA endowment to help finance
future capital needs for buses, subways and commuter rail lines.
That responsibility makes the sale of this site problematic.
</P>
<P>
   The 26 acres and air rights, conservatively valued at a minimum
of $200 million, should only be sold when the authority can reap
the maximum value. That opportunity will not occur during the
current turbulence in financial markets. The authority may even
want to develop the site itself if that is the best way to generate
substantial revenues. Sale of this nest egg now, at a price
depressed either by market conditions or by a desire to placate the
Yankees, would be imprudent. The interests of millions of subway
riders, commuters and transit-dependent businesses would be
betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner has declined to show his hand on the stadium issue
until after the World Series and the gubernatorial election. Even
so, his distaste for remaining in the Bronx is well known.
Meanwhile, all appears quiet west of the Hudson, despite recent
sports coverage in The Star-Ledger of Newark promoting the idea of
developing a privately financed stadium in New Jersey. Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman's anti-poaching policy still seems to be in
force. Absent credible evidence that the Yankees are about to cross
the Hudson, the argument for the West Side option looks weak.
</P>
<P>
   There is no mystery about what would please most New York fans.
That would be having the Yankees dazzle us and future generations
in a renovated or new stadium in the Bronx.

   ATHENS, Ga. _ Are these Bulldogs for real?
</P>
<P>
   College football fans may get an answer to that question next
Saturday when Georgia meets Tennessee in a Southeastern Conference
showdown in Sanford Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Following Saturday night's stunning 28-27 upset at LSU, the
Bulldogs made the biggest leap in the latest college football
polls. Georgia jumped five spots to No. 7 in both Associated Press
and USA Today/ESPN coaches' polls, released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, which dropped a notch to No. 4 in the AP poll and
remained at No. 5 in the coaches' poll, has won seven straight
games against Georgia. The Volunteers, who have won the last five
contests by an average of 18 points, came away the 17-9 winner at
Auburn on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Not since legendary Bulldogs coach Vince Dooley stalked the
sidelines has Georgia been host to a game of this magnitude. The
contest has been sold out for months, and both teams enter this
week unbeaten at 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Athens hosted a game between a pair of top 10
teams was 1983, when No. 3 Auburn beat the No. 4 Bulldogs 13-7.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs have been riding the right arm of freshman
quarterback Quincy Carter of Southwest DeKalb High, who threw for
318 yards and two touchdowns on 27-of-34 passing against LSU.
Carter, who has played three seasons of minor league baseball in
the Chicago Cubs organization, has been one of the nation's best
players this season, leading the SEC and ranking third nationally
in passing efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he could accomplish much more during the first two
months of his collegiate career, Carter replied: ``Yeah, beat
Tennessee.

NEW POWER IN PIVOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One area that needs to be shored up for the Cal
State Northridge women's basketball team is defense, and the
coaching staff has taken a step toward doing exactly that. Myiesha
Jones, a 6-foot-5 center at Merritt College in Oakland, last week
made an oral commitment to attend CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like their staff,'' Jones said. ``They're friendly.
I'm used to a family atmosphere and that's what they have there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who will have two years of eligibility at CSUN if she
qualifies academically, isn't considered a big scorer _ she
averaged six points per game last year _ but she should bring
defense and rebounding to a Matadors squad that went 14-14 last
season. Jones averaged almost 10 rebounds and four blocked shots
per game last season at Merritt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the CSUN coaches) told me it was going to be a lot of
hard work,'' Jones said. ``I know I have to start weightlifting and
run and have physical workouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones played at Castlemont High before attending Merritt. She
was also recruited by Fresno State.
</P>
<P>
   It's against NCAA rules for coaches to comment about recruits
before a national letter of intent is signed. Jones can sign in
November.
</P>
<P>
   __ Not exactly Big Bear: Basketball practice begins in less than
two weeks and final arrangements are being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the CSUN men's staff will be taking a retreat to plan
for the upcoming season. They'll sequester themselves in a local
hotel room for three days this week to talk hoop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll spend three days talking about basketball and beating
each other up,'' coach Bobby Braswell said. ``We have two new guys
on the staff this year (Andre Chevalier and Eric Brown) so we have
to go through every play so they know how to teach it and how to
execute it.''
</P>
<P>
   Braswell, whose Matadors are expected to contend for the Big Sky
championship, said he won't settle on a starting lineup until the
first game nears.
</P>
<P>
   __ Visitation rights: One luxury afforded the men's basketball
coaching staff this season is a methodical approach to the
recruiting process.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors have just one scholarship to offer for next season,
though that could change if Rico Harris forgoes his senior year for
the NBA draft. Now that the summer evaluation period is over,
recruits will begin making official visits.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland High guard Kent Dennis is expected to visit CSUN Oct.
23-25. Dennis could well wind up at CSUN because of familiarity.
Chevalier was his former coach at Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN is also trying to schedule a visit for Long Beach Jordan
guard Craig Calloway.
</P>
<P>
   __ When to start?: Men's volleyball doesn't kick into gear until
after the new year, but the NCAA does allow teams to practice for a
specified duration in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still up in the air as to when we'll (begin), either
Oct. 19 or Oct. 26,'' coach Jeff Campbell said. ``You're only
allowed 22 weeks (during the year), so you have to pick and
choose.''

 &HT;    Putts mar Glasson's solid outing
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE MOUNTAIN, Ga. _ Bill Glasson's best finish of the year, a
tie for third in Sunday's conclusion of the Buick Challenge,
brought $102,000 to his 1998 earnings and an immeasurable amount of
personal satisfaction. The Evel Knievel of the PGA Tour, Glasson
has seen more recovery rooms than interview rooms and isn't fully
recovered from his third elbow operation. Were it not for a pair of
three-putts on the back nine, Glasson might have been slipping his
battered body behind the wheel of a new Buick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to win this one, but I didn't play well enough to
deserve to win,'' Glasson said after failing to birdie the 18th
hole for a shot in the playoff with Steve Elkington and Fred Funk.
``Today I just didn't hit the shots when I needed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Glasson birdied three of the first four holes to take the lead
from Funk, then stalled on the back nine, shooting even-par for a
69 and 72-hole score of 20-under 268. With a cold putter and a slow
pace of play, Glasson eventually lost his early momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mind started to wander,'' he said. ``I think the pace of
play really killed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Glasson moved to 82nd on the money list with $340,131 _ not bad
for only 10 events _ and will defend Oct. 15-18 at Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall's 63 low for day
</P>
<P>
   Skip Kendall pushed himself within possible reach of the Tour
Championship at Atlanta's East Lake Golf Club Oct. 29-Nov. 1 with a
9-under 63 Sunday for 5th place. He moved to 33rd on the money list
with the $60,000 check, just behind Smyrna's Stewart Cink.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot,'' Kendall said of a shot at East Lake. ``I
figure I have to make about $200,000 the next four weeks. That's my
goal, but I know I've got to play good.'' . . . Defending champion
Davis Love III ended the tournament with a 66 to tie for 14th at
13-under, but never contended. Departing quickly for the airport,
Love passed over the Mountain View course in his jet while the
leaders were finishing. . . . Atlanta's Billy Andrade, able to
generate nothing better than a 70 Sunday, also tied for 14th and
actually dropped a spot in the money list, to 42nd ($680,181), when
passed by winner Elkington. ``I just didn't get anything rolling,''
Andrade said, ``but I'm still pretty happy with my play.Change in
plans
</P>
<P>
   With his surprise win, Elkington moved to 40th on the money list
with a gain of $270,000 and is an outside shot for the Tour
Championship. ``This may change my schedule,'' he said. . . .
Columbus' Larry Mize tied for 14th after a 67-67 weekend. . . .
David Duval closed with a 69 and tied for sixth at 15-under-273.

 &HT;    Elkington prevails over Funk in playoff
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE MOUNTAIN, Ga. _ Considering the way things had been
progressing all week at the $1.5 million Buick Challenge, it seemed
only a matter of time before they cut the ribbon on Fred Funk
Boulevard, commemorating another win here by the former Maryland
golf coach, and proclaiming his as the Official Comfort Zone of
Callaway Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Funk, the new sign on the property is more
likely to designate Steve Elkington Way.
</P>
<P>
   After battling viral meningitis and recovering from another
sinus surgery this year, hey, how scary could a duel on the back
nine and a sudden-death playoff turn out to be? For Elkington, the
35-year-old Australian with the swing as sweet as a slab of
honey-bourbon ribs, it became just what his battery of doctors
ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Elkington's previous win at the Buick Challenge came four years
ago, when the tournament was still searching for credibility. This
one materialized with 19 of the top 30 money-winners on the
property as Elkington, after a final-round 65, made a par on the
first hole of a sudden-death playoff to defeat Funk for the
$270,000 first prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playoffs are a crapshoot,'' Elkington said after his ninth PGA
Tour win. ``That's why they call it sudden death.''
</P>
<P>
   Both players had finished regulation play at 21-under-par 267,
tying Davis Love III's 72-hole record from last year. But when Funk
(69), who could drive a ball down a bowling lane, put his tee shot
on the playoff hole (the 18th), into the fairway bunker and then
slapped into the lip coming out, Elkington smoothed an 8-iron
safely to the green and two-putted from 15 feet for the win.
</P>
<P>
   From Saturday's back nine through Sunday's, Elkington, starting
the final round four shots behind Funk and trailing Bill Glasson by
three, went 13-under par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that last 27 holes is about as good as I can play,''
Elkington said. ``I got a little better each day.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a coronation, Funk found consternation by bogeying
the 9th and 14th holes on errant drives into the Mountain View
Course's perilous rough and then repeating the oddity in the
playoff. His 7-iron from 184 yards caught the lip and squirted his
ball into the fairway. His third settled into deep rough right of
the green, basically ruling out a chip-in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disappointing to lose because I had the tournament
all week and my bread and butter is hitting fairways,'' Funk said.
``I just ran into a buzzsaw with Elkie making all the birdies. I
didn't do my end of the bargain to finish it off.''
</P>
<P>
   After the year's medical woes, maybe Callaway will again
springboard Elkington. He won the PGA the year following his
54-hole, rain-shortened decision here in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like a sickly person,'' said the Houston
resident, unfazed by Sunday's humidity. ``I hope it's all behind
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Glasson, who finished third at 20-under, missed a chance to join
the playoff by sliding a 15-footer by the hole at 18. Atlanta's
Billy Andrade (70) tied for 14th. Georgia Tech amateur Matt Kuchar
(71) tied for 58th.

STRAIGHTENING UP AN INTOLERABLE OFFICE MANAGER 
</HEADLINE>
   By ILANA DEBARE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 Q:  I'm a secretary at a real estate company with a horrid office
manager. She ridicules the people who work for her, spreads rumors
and berates her subordinates arbitrarily. The situation is so bad
that six secretaries left in the past year. When we try to complain
to the managing broker, who is the office manager's boss, he just
laughs it off. Is there anything we can do?
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; A:  &LR; You've got one of the worst possible workplace dilemmas
here _ a boss who's a bully and higher-ups who don't seem to care.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth making one more appeal to the managing broker, this
time focusing on the high staff turnover and how your boss'
behavior is hurting the firm's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Has the company spent thousands of extra dollars to hire temps
because of turnover? Have sales been hampered because the office
staff is too demoralized or distracted to get the work done?
</P>
<P>
   ``Be extremely clear about your motives _ that you're bringing
this forward because it affects people's work and productivity,''
said Daniel Oestreich, an organizational development consultant and
author of the new book ``Driving Fear Out of the Workplace.''
``Just telling him that `this doesn't feel good' will not be as
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Oestreich, who is based in Redmond, Wash., suggests offering
some solutions along with your complaints. You might ask the
managing broker to counsel your boss on certain behaviors _ for
instance, telling her not to spread rumors. Or you might ask him to
hire an outside team-building expert, who could assess your boss'
skills and coach her on how to be a better manager.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's a good chance the managing broker may still
turn a deaf ear. Then you have two options. One is getting together
with your co-workers and trying on your own to set some limits on
the boss' abusive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next time you see her belittling someone publicly, you
need to step in and say, `That's an unacceptable statement,' ''
said Ron Namie, a Benicia psychologist who counsels employees on
how to handle bad work situations and has a Web site called the
Work Doctor at www.workdoctor.com. ``Then the others need to step
in and back you up.''
</P>
<P>
   The other option is to do what those other six secretaries did _
quit and find a new job where you're treated with more respect.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; Q:  &LR; I was employed by a computer contracting firm that sent
me out on assignments to a number of different clients. After my
last assignment ended in mid-August, the firm didn't have any more
work lined up for me but kept me on the payroll anyway. I kept
getting paychecks through the end of August, but then the checks
stopped coming. Last week, I got a letter from the company dated
September 20 saying they had terminated me as of August 28. Can
they fire me retroactively like that?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; A:  &LR; Many high-tech contracting firms pay their contractors
only for those days that they're actually assigned to clients. Your
firm seems to handle things differently, keeping people on payroll
during gaps between assignments.
</P>
<P>
   But that distinction doesn't matter here. The point is that an
employer can't fire you retroactively _ from this or any other job.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take a more traditional job as an example. If you were
employed as a teapot-maker, and you showed up at the teapot factory
for eight hours every day, the company couldn't tell you on
September 20 that it wasn't going to pay you for all your work
since August 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't keep an employee around for three weeks and then
say, `Hey, we terminated you three weeks ago,' '' said Charles
Thompson, an employment lawyer with Hanson Bridgett Marcus Vlahos &AMP;
Rudy in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Your situation seems a little less clear cut because the company
didn't send you out on any assignments. ``The interesting thing is
that this person wasn't doing any work during those three weeks,''
Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   But you were still legally on the company's payroll all that
time. You presumably stayed by the phone, waited for assignments
and didn't look for other work. So the company should have paid you
for those three weeks, just as if you'd been busily making teapots.
</P>
<P>
   And your next step should be to file a claim for unpaid wages
with the California Labor Commissioner, at (415) 557-7878.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; Q:  &LR; I moved from Michigan to Colorado in March 1997 to take a
job with an electrical distributor. The salary was lower than I
wanted, but the owner made a verbal promise that after a year I'd
be eligible for an annual profit-sharing bonus of at least $14,000.
The year went by, but the owner then told me I would not be
eligible for profit-sharing until after my second year. This
created major financial problems for me, and I ended up resigning
from the firm because of this dispute. Can I sue the company for
breach of contract?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; A:  &LR; You need to check if the company's profit-sharing plan
is covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(commonly known as ERISA), the federal law that governs pensions
and health benefits, according to Robert Truhlar, an employment
lawyer in the Denver suburb of Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   Some small employers have informal profit-sharing plans that
aren't covered by ERISA. But larger employers often draw up a
formal plan and file it with the Internal Revenue Service as an
ERISA plan, which can get them some tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   If this company's plan is an ERISA plan, it would be governed by
federal pension law _ and you might not be able to file a breach of
contract suit. You'd have to take any complaints to the U.S.
Pension &AMP; Welfare Benefits Administration.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  But if it's not an ERISA plan, you could certainly sue for
breach of contract, according to Truhlar.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was a verbal promise, company officials would probably
claim they told you from the start that profit-sharing wouldn't
kick in until after two years. It would be their word against
yours. But you'd still have a strong case if you could produce
supporting evidence, such as notes you made after the hiring
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   One interesting point: You'd have an even stronger legal case if
this dispute occurred in California rather than Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Section 970 of the California Labor Code prohibits
``solicitation of employees by misrepresentation'' _ inducing a
worker to relocate for a job by misrepresenting the job. So in
California, you'd be able to sue not just for breach of contract
but also for violating the state labor code.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado has a similar law but, according to Truhlar, it's
rarely enforced in situations like yours.

QB'S LEAP KNOCKS HUSKIES FOR LOOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Nine yards to destiny. Nine yards to mount a rocket
booster on Arizona's football season, perhaps giving it life all
the way to Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   When University of Washington players saw on video Ortege
Jenkins' miraculous tote-and-tumble to the end zone Saturday night,
they had reason to be all the more chagrined. Jenkins, the Wildcat
quarterback, retreated all the way to the Husky 20 before making
his dash for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no doubt,'' Jenkins said in the euphoric Arizona locker
room. ``I don't know my vertical jump _ 37 (inches), 38, something
like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   With 12 seconds on the clock and Arizona owning no timeouts,
this is how the play unfolded:
</P>
<P>
   Arizona calls it ``A-2.'' Wildcat wide receiver Dennis Northcutt
and tight end Mike Lucky lined up left as Jenkins' two primary
targets. As the Huskies rushed four linemen, Jenkins backpedaled,
looked left and decided nothing was available.
</P>
<P>
   His right foot crossed the 20, and then he reversed himself,
sprinting up the middle. The Husky linemen were pushed to the
outside, so Jenkins was able to get his charge under way without
changing direction. By the 15, he was past the down linemen.
</P>
<P>
   He bolted straight ahead, and the Husky linebackers, who had
dropped into coverage, confronted him inside the 5, joined by free
safety Brendan Jones. Side by side, inside linebacker Marques
Hairston and Jones hunkered into squat positions at the 2, ready to
hammer Jenkins down. From Jenkins' right side, the other inside
linebacker, Lester Towns, moved in.
</P>
<P>
   Either Jenkins would score, or the game would end. Getting out
of bounds was not an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get squared up to hit him,'' Towns said, as he left
Hec Edmundson Pavilion at midnight. ``I don't know why everyone
went low. If they'd hit him high, he wouldn't have gone in.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins launched himself from the 4-yard line, seemingly into
the night sky. Hairston and Jones were foils, their minimal contact
only increased the arc of Jenkins' somersault.
</P>
<P>
   When he came down, he landed on his feet. Had he needed to, he
could have run to the University Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He jumped so high,'' marveled Jones. ``I give him all the
credit in the world. He did what he had to do to win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Incredible,'' said Jeff Woodruff, the Arizona running backs
coach who made his first return to Husky Stadium since his firing
by UW coach Jim Lambright after the 1993 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got hired (last winter), I looked at some of the
big plays of a year ago, and the thing I noticed, the guy made some
spectacular plays off-balance and out of position.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if he's going to play basketball for Lute Olson (Jenkins
has been a deep reserve), he's got to be a pretty good player. When
I talked to Miles Simon and Jason Terry and Mike Bibby, they said
practicing against him was tougher than a lot of guys they played
in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Tomey, the Arizona coach, said he had never seen a more
marvelous play in the crucible of a win-or-lose situation. Asked
what he thought when Jenkins rose at the 4, Tomey said, ``I just
know he's gonna go high.''
</P>
<P>
   Husky Stadium was almost empty when Jenkins, completing
interviews in the end zone, ran joyously up the tunnel. Scavanging
kids begged for his wristbands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't give you this one,'' Jenkins said. ``It's got the plays
on it.''
</P>
<P>
   With plays like his, who needs a script?

VACCO AND SPITZER TRADE SWIPES ON INTEGRITY AND COMPETENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ  
c. 1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dennis Vacco, New York's attorney general, did not
have a primary challenge to worry about this year. Neither has he
had to fret about money _ his campaign war chest is bulging. And he
has picked up good publicity lately on issues like cracking down on
unscrupulous health insurers and arresting child pornographers.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad position to be in during an election year.
</P>
<P>
   But now, not even three weeks into the general election
campaign, Vacco, the Republican incumbent, finds himself locked in
what most experts and recent polls indicate is shaping up as the
most competitive of the three major races for statewide offices
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic challenger, Eliot Spitzer, has mounted a broad
assault against Vacco _ on television and in speeches and fliers _
seeking to force him to defend his integrity and to answer charges
that he has turned the office into a patronage mill.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, a wealthy Manhattan lawyer, who is using his and his
family's money to finance his campaign, proved to be a formidable
candidate during a tough four-way primary race, and has been just
as aggressive since then.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco dismisses Spitzer's attacks as unfounded and points to a
record that includes fighting crime, protecting consumers and
cleaning up the environment. Vacco began the general election
campaign by calling on Spitzer to refrain from attacks, but then
started raising questions about the source of Spitzer's money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Eliot: Show me the money,'' blasted a headline from a
flier recently distributed by Vacco's campaign, adding in smaller
print: ``Vacco campaign calls for answers to questions about
Spitzer campaign cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer wasted little time in firing back. ``Hey, Dennis, stop
trying to turn away attention from your record of cronyism,'' said
a flier his campaign put out.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes in the race are high. The attorney general has a
staff of 450 lawyers who are responsible for defending the state
against hundreds of lawsuits each year, as well as enforcing its
environmental, consumer and other laws. And the attorney general,
along with the governor and the comptroller, are New York's three
major officeholders elected by a statewide vote.
</P>
<P>
   The major point of contention in the contest between Vacco and
Spitzer is who has the integrity and competence to be New York's
top law enforcement officer. Spitzer, a moderate, has emphasized
his experience as a prosecutor _ he was head of the Manhattan
District Attorney's labor racketeering unit _ and as a civic
advocate in making his case. He has also focused on popular issues,
from protecting customers from price gouging to forcing corporate
polluters to clean up the Hudson River and using product liability
laws to force gun manufacturers to install safety locks.
</P>
<P>
   More important, though, he has waged a vigorous campaign against
Vacco. He has argued that Vacco has neglected the duties of the
attorney general's office and in the process has compromised the
well-being of New Yorkers. He has attacked what he says is the
incumbent's reluctance to take on tobacco companies, corporate
polluters and other powerful interests because they are major
supporters of the state Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   But the thrust of his attacks has been on what he describes as
Vacco's politicization of the office. In speeches, fliers, letters
and a recent television advertisement, Spitzer contends that Vacco
has undermined the professionalism of the office by dismissing
dozens of experienced lawyers and replacing them with younger,
inexperienced lawyers with ties to the Republican and Conservative
Parties.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, a federal judge in Albany threw out a lawsuit filed
by two former assistant attorneys general who said that Vacco had
dismissed them because of their political affiliations. The judge,
Rosemary Pooler, said that even if those claims were correct, the
attorney general had the right to hire lawyers who shared his
political views.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco's campaign said that the ruling should put an end to the
issue, noting that Judge Pooler, as a Democrat, had sided with the
attorney general. ``Even respected Democrats recognize the
frivolity of these politically motivated lawsuits brought by
disgruntled former employees,'' said Matthew Behrmann, Vacco's
campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   While the court decision might have blunted some of the
sharpness of Spitzer's political jabs, it did nothing to deter him
from continuing to hammer away at the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is not whether it is legal to run a political
patronage mill out of the attorney general's office,'' Steven
Goldstein, the spokesman for the Spitzer campaign, said in
response. ``The question is whether it is unethical. As virtually
every major newspaper in this state has pointed out already, it is
certainly not ethical, and that is what the court of public opinion
will decide in November.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most recent public polls on the attorney general's
race showed Vacco and Spitzer in a statistical dead heat among all
registered voters. But the survey _ the Quinnipiac College Poll,
which was released on Sept. 27 _ showed Vacco with a slight lead
over Spitzer, 40 percent to 35 percent, among likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Spitzer's strategy from the start has been to try to
overcome whatever advantage Vacco has, including incumbency, by
turning to a deep campaign war chest. But even that has turned into
a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Vacco campaign notes that in a previous bid for the
Democratic nomination for attorney general in 1994, Spitzer lent
his campaign $4.3 million even though his tax returns showed that
he had a total income of only $559,000 for both 1993 and 1994.
Spitzer responded that the money he spent on the campaign came from
his savings, his income as a lawyer and his father, Bernard
Spitzer, a wealthy real estate developer.
</P>
<P>
   But Vacco is expected to mount a high-spending campaign of his
own. He has already raised more than $3.2 million and is widely
expected to receive more from the state Republican Party should he
run into trouble. Beyond that, he could benefit from the popularity
of the Republican governor, George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   A conservative who took office at a time of a national
Republican ascendancy, Vacco has done an effective job of expanding
his platform beyond the narrow law-and-order one he ran on in 1994.
He has embraced moderate issues as the electorate itself has become
more moderate in recent years. He has cast himself as a defender of
consumers, a protector of the environment and a champion of women's
issues.
</P>
<P>
   He has even become a convert on the contentious issue of
litigation against the tobacco industry. When he first took office,
he refused to join a nationwide lawsuit that sought to recoup from
tobacco makers the billions of dollars that states spent treating
tobacco-related illnesses. He said that would be akin to suing
dairy producers for cholesterol-related diseases caused by their
products.
</P>
<P>
   His position led critics to charge that he was being soft on
cigarette makers only because they were major contributors to the
state Republican Party. He eventually joined in the lawsuits
against the tobacco companies and is now an outspoken critic of the
industry, though opponents contend that his conversion was a
cynical political move.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco rose from political obscurity in 1994 when he became New
York's first Republican attorney general in nearly two decades. He
had been a career prosecutor who had never held elective office.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer is a political newcomer himself. He, too, is a career
lawyer who was a prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney's
office and is now a partner in a Manhattan law firm.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, however, the men share similar positions on some
major issues. Both are supporters of the death penalty. And they
emphasize their experience as prosecutors fighting crime, even
though combating street crime is largely handled by local district
attorneys, not the attorney general of the state.

HARU REISCHAUER, 83, A `BRIDGE' TO JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Haru Matsukata Reischauer, a journalist and author who was
influential in diplomatic affairs in the 1960s as the wife of the
U.S. ambassador to Japan, died on Sept. 23 in La Jolla, Calif. She
was 83.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was heart failure, a former colleague said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Reischauer's deep understanding of both Japanese and
American cultures and mores made her highly qualified to ease
tensions between the two countries in the early '60s. As the
embassy's first lady, she was crucial, her former colleagues said,
in bringing a psychological end to the postwar occupation of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   She grew up in Tokyo; her father was a prominent Japanese
statesman and her mother was an American of Japanese descent. As a
child, she had an American tutor, and she graduated from Principia
College in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Late in life, she traced the roots of her family's tradition of
statesmanship and their appreciation of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Samurai and Silk: A Japanese and American Heritage''
(Harvard University Press, 1986) she told the story of her two
grandfathers: One, born to a peasant family, became a wealthy silk
merchant in New York; the other, from a samurai family, rose to be
prime minister twice and was also a powerful finance minister
responsible for overhauling Japan's financial system in the 19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Not until the end of World War II _ which she spent in Japan,
feeling ``totally out of place,'' said a colleague from her embassy
days _ did her bicultural background become useful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, everything opened up,'' said George Packard, who is
now president of the U.S.-Japan Foundation in New York. During the
1950s, she wrote regularly about Japan for The Saturday Evening
Post and The Christian Science Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   But it was through her husband that she became an major
influence in establishing friendly relations between the United
States and Japan. James Michener introduced her to Edwin
Reischauer, a widower with three children and a Harvard professor
of Japanese studies. As teen-agers, it turned out, they had gone to
the same Tokyo high school, where she had had a secret crush on
him.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Immerman, a senior research associate at Columbia
University's East Asian Institute, who also worked at the U.S.
Embassy when she was there, said that before her marriage in 1956,
``she was never at home in either culture.'' Afterward, he said,
she moved easily in both. ``Somehow that relationship fulfilled
her.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, President John F. Kennedy appointed Edwin Reischauer
ambassador to Japan. ``Relations seemed to be coming apart,''
Packard said. The Japanese government was under pressure at the
time from groups on the left that wanted to end the security
arrangement with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In those tense times, Mrs. Reischauer could easily have found
herself distrusted by both the Americans and the Japanese. Instead,
said Packard _ who was then a special assistant to the ambassador _
she became widely respected.
</P>
<P>
   She came to be considered Japan's most popular woman, after the
empress. She went out of her way to be considerate with embassy
employees, said Immerman, a junior embassy officer at the time. For
instance, she opened the swimming pool, long reserved for the
ambassador's family, to everyone. She brought in influential
Japanese people ignored by earlier administrations _ intellectuals,
writers and leaders of citizens' groups.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband were a team. Before making decisions,
Reischauer would consult with his wife, Immerman recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a major role in helping him shape U.S. policy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, at the conclusion of his appointment, the Reischauers
returned to Cambridge, Mass., and to Harvard. Later, they moved to
California. Edwin Reischauer died in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   One stepson, Robert, of Bethesda, Md., following the family
tradition of public service, became director of the Congressional
Budget Office and is now a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution. Mrs. Reischauer is also survived by two stepdaughters,
Ann Heinemann of La Jolla and Joan Simon of Larchmont, N.Y.; two
sisters, Naka Rawthroen of Los Angeles and Mari Bruck of Studio
City, Calif.; nine grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Packard described her role in bringing together the United
States and Japan. ``She, herself, was a bridge,'' he said. ``She
represented an America that was friendly and respectful to Japan.''

$5.3 BILLION PROPOSED TO BUILD OR REPAIR SCHOOLS IN NEW JERSEY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what could result in the largest building program in New
Jersey's history, the Whitman administration is proposing to spend
$5.3 billion to build or repair hundreds of schools in New Jersey
over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes in response to a ruling in May by the New Jersey
Supreme Court that requires the administration to replace or
refurbish deteriorating buildings and classrooms in the 28 poorest
school districts in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, roughly $2.6 billion would be spent for
construction in those districts, which include large cities like
Newark and Trenton, as well as East Orange, Asbury Park, and other
smaller urban areas. An additional $2.7 billion would be reserved
for schools in more prosperous communities across the state.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is also proposing to centralize the financing
and management of school construction projects under a single state
agency to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Building Authority, which was created 17 years
ago to erect state buildings, would oversee the financing, design
and construction of new schools in the 28 poorest school districts,
all in urban areas, where the state is required to pay all costs,
and in suburban districts, which would have to pay for their own
projects but could save money by using the Building Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Pete McDonough, a spokesman for Gov. Christie Whitman, said
centralized financing and construction management could produce
savings of up to 25 percent through increased efficiency,
experience and greater buying power.
</P>
<P>
   For example, McDonough said, the Building Authority would
assemble prequalified lists of design and construction firms for
school projects. ``Because they would know that for the next X
number of years they'll be building a set number of buildings,
their price will come down tremendously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The centralized approach, which would have to be approved by the
Legislature, could also eliminate a healthy source of patronage.
Currently, local school officials are able to hand out contracts to
favored builders, architects, lawyers and underwriters.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear, however, whether the spending outlined in the
plan, first reported in The Sunday Star-Ledger of Newark, will be
enough to satisfy the Supreme Court. A report prepared for the
court in January recommended spending up to $2.8 billion to repair
or replace deteriorating buildings in schools in the poorer
districts, which educate 300,000 children, or about a fourth of the
students enrolled in New Jersey public schools.
</P>
<P>
   David Sciarra, executive director of the Education Law Center,
said that it was too early to put a price tag on the necessary
work. In January, he said, the urban school districts are to
complete court-ordered assessments of their existing buildings and
future needs. ``There's no way to know until then whether $2.6
billion, or $2.8 billion, or whatever amount will be sufficient to
meet the court's order,'' he said.

UW KICKING GAME CAN NO LONGER GO WITHOUT HELP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The caller to ESPN's national sports radio show early
Sunday morning was frantic.
</P>
<P>
   She was dialing ``Pigpen,'' the Las Vegas-based host, from
Seattle, demanding accountability for the source of her disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle, you're on. But no more whining about the Huskies,''
Pigpen sneered.
</P>
<P>
   The woman had been at Husky Stadium on Saturday night, bundled
up in Gore-Tex and purple pride as she watched a young, patchwork
Husky team attempt a resurrection of pride and momentum in a
football season trounced by the previous weekend's drubbing at
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of Saturday night's adventure in the rain?
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies should have, could have beaten Arizona, the woman
said.
</P>
<P>
   But any chance for resurrected pride and hope in 1998 was
crushed when Arizona quarterback Ortege Jenkins performed a Kerri
Strug gold medal somersault on the heads of the poor Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   After a stalwart attempt by the Husky defensive line to stop the
final Arizona drive, the cagey 'Cat QB vaulted himself into the
cool night air, then landed feet-first in the end zone to seal a
spectacular, come-from-behind Pac-10 win.
</P>
<P>
   But like most astute Husky fans, the caller understood the
Huskies' bitter 31-28 defeat was not decided by that amazing
80-yard scoring drive that all of Husky Nation will be forced to
relive as long as ``SportsCenter'' and other highlight shows replay
Jenkins' victorious work of acrobatics.
</P>
<P>
   The caller understood that the culprit in this unforgiving
defeat was the black hole known as the Husky kicking game. Her
outrage was warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an alumni, I want to know where my kicker is!'' the caller
said.
</P>
<P>
   And you know what? That sad, mad caller was speaking for all
Husky fans: Where have all the kickers gone?
</P>
<P>
   If UW coach Jim Lambright has an answer, it comes a week too
late (at least) to do his dispirited team or his peeved fan base
any shred of good.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, walk-on place-kicker Nick Lentz left the Washington
program. Lentz's disgruntled departure over the lack of a
scholarship put Lambright in the compromised position of sending
redshirt freshman Jim Skurski out on the field Saturday night to
perform one of the most important jobs in football.
</P>
<P>
   Skurski had connected on all of one field goal in his Washington
career.
</P>
<P>
   It should never have come down to this. The Washington kicking
game should not be relegated to holding your breath and praying
that field goals and extra points are not the difference between a
win and a bitter, unforgettable loss.
</P>
<P>
   It makes you wonder if Lambright ever took a look across the
lake last season to his old buddy, Dennis Erickson. Special-teams
debacles led to four losses for the Seahawks last season. Fixing
that broken part was priority No. 1, which explains why a new
punter and new special-teams coach, Pete Rodriguez, were brought
in.
</P>
<P>
   Glaring holes demand immediate attention, college or NFL.
</P>
<P>
   True, Lambright was willing to accept responsibility for this
botched game. His pain was evident in the post-game news
conference, when he was visibly shaken and driven to ``shield'' his
players from media questions.
</P>
<P>
   But the real way for Lambright to have avoided having to
announce ``I'll save my poor team for answering about this
disastrous loss'' was to have looked at the Husky record book. That
way, Lambright would see there is no way a shaky kicking game is
going to go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington tradition for place-kickers is rich. Chuck
Nelson's 1982 field-goal percentage (25 of 26 field goals made for
96.2 percent) is still an NCAA record.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Jaeger, who also went on to a stellar NFL career and is now
kicking for the Chicago Bears, set a record for 80 field goals
during his 1983-86 Husky career.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lansford went for two seasons when he did not miss an extra
point, booting 71 of 71 over 22 games in 1978 and '79.
</P>
<P>
   Before Lentz walked out last week, he already was in limbo. He
had claimed a quadriceps pull. He had been placed in equal standing
with Skurski, although all this turmoil seems easily traced to
Lentz's contention that he was told he would be rewarded with a
scholarship if he contributed to the team.
</P>
<P>
   With his 7-for-10 field-goal kicking in 1997, Lentz was the
second-leading scorer for the Huskies _ which only proves that
kickers, even the most average, can make the difference. And Lentz
was the first ray of hope that the Huskies' kicking game could at
least connect on 50 percent of its attempts.
</P>
<P>
   In a college football world of diminished scholarship
opportunities, the Huskies have had the added displeasure of the
lingering effects of their Pac-10 sanctions. If this has made the
Husky coaching staff blind to the dangers of praying a walk-on
kicker will be the answer, this last week should prove the ultimate
eye-opener.
</P>
<P>
   Lambright obviously feels bad for letting down the players who
did everything they could to beat Arizona. Freshman tailback Willie
Hurst and backup quarterback Marques Tuiasosopo were weapons enough
to get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   But as bad as Lambright feels, just think about poor Jim
Skurski, who missed two field goals and an extra point Saturday,
with two of those attempts blocked.
</P>
<P>
   If you are going to put a kicker on the field to ensure
important wins are signed, sealed and delivered, then it has to be
a kid good enough to earn a free ride. It's time for the Huskies to
sign, seal and deliver on this crucial part of the game.

DEFINITIONS OF `DISABILITY' CREATE LEGAL MAZE FOR DOCTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ILANA DEBARE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Doctors today have to be experts not just in setting broken bones
and diagnosing cancer, but also in the field of employment law.
<TEXT>
<P>
   San Francisco lawyer Marci Seville had a client with severe
hypertension whose doctor told her to take a 14-week leave from
work.
</P>
<P>
   But the doctor was unaware that the federal Family &AMP; Medical
Leave Act requires companies to hold workers' jobs open for just 12
weeks _ so Seville's client lost her job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had the physician known of the 12-week limit, he would have
returned the employee to work earlier with some minor work
restrictions,'' said Seville, who runs an employment law clinic at
Golden Gate University.
</P>
<P>
   It's understandable that doctors are having a hard time keeping
up with employment laws, which are changing almost as rapidly as
the frontiers of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In this decade, America added two major new laws aimed at
aiding sick or disabled workers _ the Americans with Disabilities
Act and the Family &AMP; Medical Leave Act.
</P>
<P>
   Each one requires doctors to issue reports that can play a key
role in determining whether employees get to keep their jobs. But
each has its own definition of illness or disability.
</P>
<P>
   And _ when taken together with other programs such as disability
insurance, workers' compensation and Social Security _ they create
a tangle of sometimes-conflicting definitions of ``disability''
that can be confounding to even the most well-trained doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The laws are so complicated that it's almost impossible for
the average physician, no matter how skilled, to keep up,'' said
Dr. Robert Goldberg, an occupational medicine specialist with the
U.S. Healthworks Medical Group in Sunnyvale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most doctors I've talked to are familiar with workers'
compensation, but very few know anything about the FMLA or the
ADA,'' said Vicki Laden, an attorney with Boxer &AMP; Gerson in Oakland
who frequently talks to medical groups about employment law. ``I've
had physicians call me and ask if I'd draft a medical note for them
because they don't know how to deal with (these laws).''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, most doctors dealt with just two main types of
paperwork related to their patients' jobs _ applications for
workers' compensation and for disability insurance.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1991, Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities
Act. And in 1993, it passed the Family &AMP; Medical Leave Act, which
requires employers to give 12 weeks of leave to eligible workers.
</P>
<P>
   To obtain an FMLA leave, workers must have their doctor certify
that they or a family member have a ``serious health condition.''
</P>
<P>
   But the federal government's definition of ``serious health
condition'' is not necessarily shared _ or even understood _ by
rank-and-file doctors.
</P>
<P>
   And there's no standard certification form for FMLA leave, so
doctors are faced with hundreds of different forms drawn up by
different employers.
</P>
<P>
   Gayle Goldblatt, employer liaison for Kaiser Permanente's
medical center in Oakland, often gets frantic calls from doctors
confused about how to handle FMLA certification requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, patients bring in three to six pages of documents
(from their employers) and ask them to be completed retroactively
for an absence that was only three days,'' Goldblatt said.
``Doctors are under phenomenal pressure from their patients to
declare things a `serious health condition.' They're often being
asked to make decisions that have more to do with personnel
policies than medical policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldblatt responded to Kaiser doctors' confusion by drawing up
an internal set of FMLA guidelines that she has embossed in plastic
and hands out to doctors in special training sessions on workplace
law.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, passage of the ADA created a different set of
challenges for doctors and their patients.
</P>
<P>
   Previous disability laws such as State Disability Insurance were
aimed primarily at providing income to workers who no longer could
hold down jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But the ADA took a dramatically different approach _ helping
disabled people remain in the workforce. It required employers to
provide ``reasonable accommodations,'' such as wheelchair ramps or
flexible schedules, that would allow people to keep working despite
injuries or illness.
</P>
<P>
   Employees seeking an ADA accommodation don't just need their
doctor to certify that they've got a disability: They need their
doctor to help flesh out the kinds of accommodations that would let
them keep working.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors _ used to disability insurance forms that simply ask
whether a patient can work or not _ sometimes don't understand what
the ADA requires.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, doctors' diagnoses for purposes of disability
insurance can be used to argue against the employee's request for
on-the-job accommodation.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Bell ended up in such a bind. When he was a bank examiner
for Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco, Bell's immune system started
to fail because of HIV. He worked out a deal with the bank where he
didn't have to do any out-of-town travel and could work from home
one day a week to decrease his stress.
</P>
<P>
   But after two years, the bank changed its policies. It no longer
guaranteed him one day of work at home each week and, according to
Bell, said he might have to do out-of-town travel.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's doctors told him that the travel and commute would damage
his fragile health, so he decided to stop work and file for
disability insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he sued the bank under the ADA _ saying it had refused to
continue his ``reasonable accommodation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wells Fargo challenged Bell's ADA lawsuit _ and used his
doctor's statements on the disability insurance application as one
of its arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The disability insurance applications didn't ask Bell or his
doctors if he could work with an accommodation: They simply asked
if he was too disabled to work. Bell's doctors said yes, he was too
disabled to work.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo's lawyers have argued that Bell couldn't have it
both ways _ saying on the insurance forms that he was too disabled
to work but then saying in his ADA lawsuit that he could work if
Wells made accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of Mr. Bell's doctors said he was totally disabled from
any occupation,'' said Angela Bradstreet, a lawyer representing
Wells Fargo. ``It's hard to reconcile that with someone who is
suing for (employment) discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell's case is scheduled for trial next spring in San Francisco
Superior Court. Meanwhile, courts across the country have issued
divergent opinions on whether employees can file for disability
insurance and, at the same time, pursue ADA claims.
</P>
<P>
   `We have two courts of appeal going one way on this and one
court going the other way,'' said Bradstreet, who works for Carroll
Burdick &AMP; McDonough and represents Wells Fargo. ``At some point,
the California Supreme Court is going to have to decide it. And
frankly, the U.S. Supreme Court will have to wrestle with it,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell's dispute is just one example of the legal minefield being
walked by doctors when they're asked to certify that employees are
``disabled'' or have ``serious health conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, some experts say, the best solution would be
for the federal government to reconcile the contradictory
definitions of what ``disability'' means in employment law.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not likely to happen soon. In the meantime, the
next-best solution may be to educate doctors in the details of the
ADA, FMLA and other workplace laws _ and what their diagnoses could
mean for their patients' careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really needs to be a great deal of training and
orientation with all these new definitions and new requirements,''
said Dr. Linda Hawes Clever, chair of the Department of
Occupational Health at California Pacific Medical Center in San
Francisco. ``But that's not the sort of course doctors are going to
leap to take nor is it the sort of course that anyone requires of
them.''

NCI DROPS COMPUTER NETWORKS TO FOCUS ON SOFTWARE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAN FOST  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Network Computer Inc. isn't making networked computers any more.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The onetime division of Oracle instead moves toward its new
corporate focus today, announcing a software product that it says
will help hook up a variety of consumer products to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike earlier NCI releases, which touted future products
without actually showing any concrete realities, the eNavigator not
only has a powerful ally in Alameda software firm Wind River
Systems, but it's already shipping in a consumer product in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past six to eight months, there's been nothing short of
a wave of consumer electronic devices that have gone digital before
our very eyes,'' said Dave Limp, vice president of marketing for
Foster City's NCI. ``They're just a small increment away from going
from being digital appliances to being information appliances. This
software will allow manufacturers to make that leap.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that, as microchips wind up in a range of machines _
from cars to refrigerators _ those chips will need software to run
them. While Wind River already makes software that controls things
like a car's anti-lock brakes, traffic lights, factory floors and
the Mars Pathfinder, it wants NCI's software to hook those devices
into the Internet and other computer networks, and to provide
graphics to make the devices easier to use.
</P>
<P>
   NCI's eNavigator is now just running in a $1,000 Fujitsu
InterTop, a handheld computer that is larger than a PalmPilot but
smaller than a laptop. The software allows InterTop to handle
e-mail and Web browsing.
</P>
<P>
   NCI is betting that people will want other digital devices _
whether a telephone or a gas pump or a Nintendo 64 video game
console _ to hook up to the Internet not for complete Web browsing,
but just to pull select pieces of information. For instance, a game
player could hook up with other gamers, or a gas pump could
download and display advertising, or a phone could check e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of thing is going to make the Internet pervasive in
people's lives in the next few years,'' Limp said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Curt Schacker, vice president of marketing for Wind River,
said the graphic interface also is important. The software could be
used, he said, to make a home-irrigation system easier to run, as
well as to hook it into a water utility's network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are marketing this technology to people building all sorts
of things,'' Schacker said.
</P>
<P>
   According to analyst David Card with Jupiter Communications in
New York, the software fits with NCI's emerging strategy to focus
on television. The company had its genesis in database software
giant Oracle's war on Microsoft, and Oracle chief executive Larry
Ellison's desire to supplant personal computers with low-cost
networked computers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Card said, NCI _ which remains primarily owned by Oracle,
with Netscape Communications Corp. also holding a big stake _
concedes that the PC is not going away any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, NCI is letting its technology partners figure out how
to use its software in corporate networks while it focuses its own
efforts on software for interactive television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jupiter is much more bullish on NCI's opportunities to take
the software into television sets than other devices,'' Card said.

   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ Although they may laugh along when
outsiders poke fun at their hometown, people here feel a deep
affection for this neighborly, unpretentious Hudson River city,
once home to companies as prosaically American as Smith Brothers
cough drops.
</P>
<P>
   That's why John Chickery, whose family has operated an office
furniture store on the city's ragtag Main Street for 22 years, was
annoyed on a trip last month to Las Vegas to hear a stranger say:
``You made the big time. You've got a mass murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   News had evidently traveled across the continent that eight
prostitutes who had vanished over the last two years were found
last month inside a ramshackle house less than two blocks from this
area's premier institution, Vassar College. And that discovery came
little more than a month after a verdict wrapped up another
national story that clouded Poughkeepsie's image: the racially
loaded defamation trial stemming from accusations in 1988 by a
black girl, Tawana Brawley, that she had been kidnapped and raped
by a gang of white men, charges that a grand jury had found to be
completely fictitious.
</P>
<P>
   ``First we're a racist town; now we're a town of mass murder,''
is the way Chickery's capsulized this city's frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Still, people here are sensitive to the fact that the
back-to-back episodes have exposed some of Poughkeepsie's less
flattering sides, the effects of the tailspin that Poughkeepsie has
been in since it began losing jobs and residents in the 1950s. This
once-storied place to raise a family _ New York City Schools
Chancellor Rudy Crew, the son of an IBM security guard, grew up
here _ has grown accustomed to violent crime, drugs, prostitution
and the kind of suspiciousness that sometimes manifests as racial
friction.
</P>
<P>
   Even the mayor of this city of 29,000, Colette Lafuente,
acknowledges that Poughkeepsie can be seen as a poster child for
all the government and commercial schemes of the 1960s and 1970s
that produced unintended and often damaging consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Travel through the city was made easier by the building of
crisscrossing highways, but the roads chopped the city into
quarters and wounded some vibrant neighborhoods. The highways also
made it easier for manufacturers to locate outside town, where land
was cheaper. And they made it possible to shop in massive malls
rising along Route 9, killing thriving downtown department and
apparel stores like Luckey Platt, Up to Date and M. Schwartz and
Co.
</P>
<P>
   With powerful patrons like Rep. Hamilton Fish Jr., the city
became one of the nation's largest per-capita recipients of federal
aid. But the aid was a mixed blessing. Swaths of charming 19th
century houses and commercial buildings were leveled by urban
renewal, replaced in some cases by ugly parking lots and bland
public housing, according to a study by Harvey Flad, a Vassar
professor of geography.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the state was releasing thousands of patients from
psychiatric hospitals, like the Hudson River Psychiatric Center
here. Scores wound up homeless in downtown, where they scared off
many remaining shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of this cascade of policy debacles, Poughkeepsie has
a threadbare statistical profile that is best crystallized by one
fact: This city midway between Manhattan and Albany does not have a
single supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   The population here has declined by almost a third from a 1950
high of 41,023. Of those remaining, three of every 10 never
graduated high school. The average family makes $34,706 a year and
in all Poughkeepsie, only 111 families earn more than $150,000
annually. Unemployment is about 6 percent in a city that once had
giant plants for printing, farm equipment and machine parts. Over
the years, the city's jobless rate has hovered close to twice that
of surrounding Dutchess County, said Dr. Ann Davis, an economics
professor at Poughkeepsie's Marist College.
</P>
<P>
   The final blow came in the early 1990s when IBM, which had
practically turned the Poughkeepsie area into a company town,
furloughed 7,700 workers in its three Hudson Valley plants, leaving
13,800 workers still employed. Now, the city's largest employer is
the Dutchess County government.
</P>
<P>
   Few people here blame Poughkeepsie for this year's unwelcome
events. When Tawana Brawley told her racially fraught story 10
years ago, she was living in Wappingers Falls, a village south of
Poughkeepsie. Yet Stephen Pagones, the former prosecutor who
accused Ms. Brawley and three of her advisers of defaming him,
brought his suit at the Dutchess County Courthouse in the city's
heart. And news conferences staged here by the Rev. Al Sharpton and
Miss Brawley's two other advisers who were defendants in the case
drew attention to regional race relations.
</P>
<P>
   The eight slain prostitutes were found in a house just across
the city border in a township that is also called Poughkeepsie.
Yet, because most of the prostitutes worked a seedy stretch of the
city's Main Street, the incident highlighted the city's attraction
for poor urban and rural women looking for fast money or drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But Patricia Barone, mother of Gina Barone, one of the victims,
does not blame the city's drug and prostitution problems for her
daughter's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that Kendall Francois had to pick
Poughkeepsie to live in,'' said Mrs. Barone, referring to the
linebacker-sized suspect in whose house the victims were found.
``Poughkeepsie is a lovely little city really trying to pull itself
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Poughkeepsie has never taken offense when outsiders ridiculed
its small-town, inelegant name. The city, whose name derives from a
Wappinger Indian mouthful that means ``reed-covered lodge by the
little water place,'' was settled in 1687 by two Dutchmen.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 19th century, Poughkeepsie, with new railroad
connections, was a bustling manufacturing city. Proud city fathers
like Matthew Vassar, who made his fortune as a brewer here,
enhanced the city with their generosity. Vassar founded a women's
college intended to rival Harvard in 1861.
</P>
<P>
   The prosperity lingered until mid-century, with employers like
the Smith Brothers' plant, Schatz Federal Bearings, which made the
ball bearings used in military gun turrets, and Western Printing
and Lithography, which printed Golden Books for children.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the decline of American manufacturing transformed
Poughkeepsie just as it transformed other river cities like Beacon,
Newburgh, and Kingston. Many white working-class people left the
city, said Norman Fainstein, Vassar's dean of faculty and an urban
sociologist. The long-rooted black community and the newer black
migrants from the South generally stayed put. Today almost a third
of the city's residents are black with a small but growing number
of Mexican immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Though some Poughkeepsians believe the small scale of the city
makes for cordial contacts across racial lines, Barbara Jeter
Jackson, one of two blacks on the eight-member legislative Common
Council, is disturbed that there are so few black workers on the
city's work force.
</P>
<P>
   Poughkeepsie's story today is practically a tale of three cities
_ a partly industrial south side, a still genteel north side and a
patchwork downtown that is graced with isolated jewels like the
Roosevelt-era post office and the Bardovan Theater.
</P>
<P>
   A visitor to a three-block pedestrian mall on Main Street can
find an anachronistic gem like Mary H. Abdoo's bridal shop, where
for 47 years customers from all over the Northeast have tried on
wedding dresses amid rose plush drapery and wrought-iron seats. But
the Main Street pedestrian mall, where traffic was blocked off on
the misguided notion that it would make shopping more convenient,
is now marked by empty storefronts.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Lafuente has made a revival of Poughkeepsie's largely
abandoned waterfront, with parks, shops and restaurants, the
centerpiece of her restoration plans. That will require a mix of
government and private funds. She also wants to reopen the Main
Street pedestrian mall to traffic. Giving a reporter a city tour,
she pointed out dozens of tumbledown buildings slated for
renovation, including a downtown row of 20 Queen Anne-style houses
and nearby storefronts that will be restored, with government
financing.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Poughkeepsians, Police Chief Ronald Knapp appears
defensive about the city's recent image problems. The discovery of
the slain prostitutes, he said, came after his department reduced
the number of murders from six in 1996 to one this year, with
officers beginning to focus on such matters as rowdy college
parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1996, people were screaming about homicides and
shootings,'' he said. ``Now they're screaming about parking
violations and college parties. Doesn't that say something?''

HOFFA HINTS AT BIG CHANGES FOR TEAMSTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ILANA DEBARE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
OAKLAND, Calif. -- James P. Hoffa waved a hand over his head like a
returning hero as he strode into the Oakland meeting hall of
Teamsters' Local 70. He posed for Instamatic snapshots with union
members. He signed photos of himself.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``This is my rank-and-file here,'' the son of the late Teamster
leader said confidently as he hand-shook his way through the
200-person crowd. ``Leedham (my opponent) couldn't get 14 people
together in a phone booth.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa sailed through the Bay Area yesterday in a visit that
seemed more like a post-victory lap around the field than a
final-stretch campaign sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa's opponents insist that their candidate, Tom Leedham, is
gaining ground on the well-known front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview with The Chronicle, Hoffa gave hints of some
of the big changes he would bring to the country's largest union _
such as a return to a more decentralized union and a tilt away from
the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see a union that is sensitive to working with local
unions rather than ordering them around,'' Hoffa said.
</P>
<P>
   The 55,000 Teamsters in the Bay Area will join millions of
others across the country next month in a re-run of the 1996 union
election that Hoffa narrowly lost to incumbent President Ron Carey.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes in the race go beyond the International Brotherhood
of Teamsters. As the largest single union in the country, the
Teamsters play a key role in determining the direction of the
AFL-CIO and setting a public image for organized labor generally.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1996 Teamster vote, a lot has changed: The election
was overturned because of campaign finance scandals by the Carey
camp. Carey himself was thrown out of the union. The reform banner
that he ran under is now being carried by Tom Leedham, a relatively
unknown Teamster from Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   And Hoffa and his supporters feel ready to claim the victory
they wanted two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can see the end in sight,'' said Chuck Mack, a strong Hoffa
supporter and head of Joint Council 7, which represents Bay Area
Teamsters. ``I have no doubt that by December, the membership will
have spoken very conclusively and Jim Hoffa and those on his slate
will have been elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa's speech to his supporters yesterday was vague on how
exactly he plans to reinvigorate the union. But in an interview
with The Chronicle, he gave some clues as to how he would change
the union's direction:
</P>
<P>
   _ Hoffa plans to reduce the role of the International and give
more autonomy to local and regional union bodies _ returning to the
decentralization that was a trademark of the Teamsters until the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The International built up a huge organizing department and
would send people in from the outside to organize something here in
Oakland,'' he said. `` I don't think that's the way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ As part of that organizational change, Hoffa promises to fire
much of the national organizing staff hired by Carey. ``The payroll
right now is loaded with Leedham (and Carey) cheerleaders _
operatives who perform no visible function and do not help the
membership,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hoffa will move the Teamsters away from the traditionally
union-friendly Democratic Party and toward a more bipartisan
political stance. ``We're not going to be blinded by party
labels,'' he said. ``We won't walk in lockstep for Democrats,
Republicans or anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   _ He will shift some resources from organizing new members into
providing service to existing members. ``The union has spent
enormous amounts of money on organizing, but no one knows what we
have to show for it,'' he said. ``We're still going to emphasize
organizing but in more traditional ways (than Carey).''
</P>
<P>
   _ Hoffa will take a more confrontational stance with other
AFL-CIO leaders on issues such as which unions have the right to
organize particular groups of workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are willing to come into the AFL as an active player,''
Hoffa said. ``But there has to be a major understanding that the
Teamsters will not be raided (by other unions seeking new members).
That's got to be the understanding, or something is going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the confident tone of yesterday's Oakland Hoffa rally,
the 57-year-old candidate continues to face sharp criticism from
opponents such as Teamsters for a Democratic Union, the
rank-and-file group that has long opposed union corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa's critics claim that he will reopen the Teamsters' doors
to corrupt ``old guard'' leaders who are more interested in drawing
six-figure union salaries than organizing workers. They criticize
his business relationship in the 1960s with organized crime figure
Allan Dorfman.
</P>
<P>
   ``His father was a great man, but this man ain't no `Hoffa
senior,' '' said Ken Mee, a Hoffa opponent from San Jose. ``If he
was named Smith or Jones, we would never have heard about him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hoffa deflects such criticisms by turning the corruption
issue around and pointing it at Carey camp members like Leedham.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just gone through the darkest six years in the union's
history,'' Hoffa said. ``The president (Carey) was kicked out of
the union for stealing $1 million; the union is now bankrupt; the
political action committee has been gutted. ... It's really kind of
pathetic to talk about things that happened 30 years ago (like
Hoffa's relations with Dorfman) when Ron Carey was kicked out just
six months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa is campaigning on a ``unity'' slate that includes some
Teamster officials who formerly supported Carey _ a pitch that
appeals to many rank-and-file members.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been too much fighting inside the union for too many
years, when we should all be working together for the best
contracts,'' said Paul Nolan, a Union City warehouseman attending
yesterday's event in a ``Hoffa Now'' hat that was autographed by
the candidate himself. ``Jimmy can unite all the Teamsters
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballots will be mailed out to Teamsters across the country on
November 2 and counted on December 3.

FIRST OF MANY CASTS IN MET'S TOSCA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The 13-year-old, sumptuously extravagant Franco
Zeffirelli production of Puccini's ``Tosca'' at the Metropolitan
Opera is hugely popular with audiences. So the company, naturally,
keeps bringing it back.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes the casting seems an afterthought, with singers
fitted into the schedule like interchangeable parts. Of course, a
major reason for the return of ``Tosca'' this season is Luciano
Pavarotti, who is to sing three performances as Mario in November
to observe his 30th anniversary with the company.
</P>
<P>
   But starting with the season's first ``Tosca,'' which came on
Friday night, there will be 14 performances, the last on March 25,
offering a total of three Marios, three Scarpias and five Toscas.
Forging some consistency of concept on the rotating roster of
singers will be the task of the veteran Italian maestro Nello
Santi, who is conducting all the performances.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Czech soprano Eva Urbanova appeared in place of
the originally announced Tosca, Daniela Dessi, who withdrew two
weeks ago because of an injury. Ms. Urbanova is a genuine artist
and an admirable singer. Her sizable voice throbs with rich
vibrato. Her tone is dusky and earthy, rather than conventionally
beautiful. However, on Friday her high notes were strained, a bit
raw and sharp in pitch. And there was more intensity and
expressivity in her singing than in her acting, which was seldom
compelling.
</P>
<P>
   The tenor Richard Leech made an energetic, athletic Mario,
easily able to bound up the stairs of the scaffolding to work on
his mural of Mary Magdalene in Act I, an aspect of the staging that
Pavarotti forgoes these days. Vocally, Leech started out shakily,
singing with dry tone and tremulous sound. But he warmed up and
summoned some ringing, house-filling top notes. However, he may be
paying a price for his increased emphasis on power: some of his
legato singing lacked elegance and pliancy.
</P>
<P>
   The French baritone Alain Fondary had a poor night as the
villainous police chief, Baron Scarpia. His singing was huffy and
short of breath, and he created little sense of malevolence. Santi,
who is steeped in the Italian tradition, had bold ideas about the
pacing and shape of this rhapsodic score. The orchestra was
essentially in sync with his conception, but the cast less so:
there were noticeable glitches in entrances and timing.
</P>
<P>
   One is tempted to predict that the ensemble problems will easily
be corrected in future performances. But the cast rotation begins
on Wednesday night, when the soprano Aprile Millo arrives to sing
the first of three scheduled performances as Tosca. &QL;

SCIENTIST SEES POWER DRAIN IN SWITCHED-OFF APPLIANCES  
 ARCHIVES WIN REPRIEVE IN STORING ELECTRONIC RECORDS  
 MEDITATION IN A WIRED WORLD

<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan Meier would like people to mean ``off'' when they say
``off.''
</P>
<P>
   Meier, a scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
in California, estimates that U.S. consumers spend $3.5 billion a
year powering electronic devices and household appliances that they
think are turned off, when actually those appliances are in a
suspended state called stand-by mode.
</P>
<P>
   TVs and VCRs are among the biggest culprits, as are high-end PCs
chock-full of power-sucking chips and gadgetry. While a TV, for
example, might use 50 watts of power when it is on, it may still
use as much as 10 watts when it is off. This stand-by feature makes
possible the much-revered remote control, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Battery chargers, like those used for cellular phones, continue
to use energy even when there is no phone plugged in. Even
microwaves consume energy when they are not in use, mostly to power
the electronic keypad. And Intel's Pentium chip, the brains inside
most PCs sold today, is a huge stand-by energy hog, Meier says.
</P>
<P>
   Though the wasted electricity amounts to only a few cents per
appliance, the total being wasted is enormous: equivalent to the
amount produced by eight power plants. That comes to about $50 a
household per year, Meier says.
</P>
<P>
   The solution? Meier says it is unreasonable to expect consumers
to unplug, particularly when they have come to appreciate the
conveniences made possible with stand-by mode, as in remote-control
garage-door openers.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the responsibility lies with manufacturers, who are
simply not paying much attention to energy use. Using an
energy-saving power supply adds nothing to the cost of producing a
device, according to the makers of energy-efficient power
technology, like Power Integrations of Sunnyvale, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Meier says he and his colleagues hope to avoid promoting
government regulation to deal with this problem, by getting
manufacturers to agree voluntarily to build products that use only
1 watt in stand-by mode.
</P>
<P>
   The other side of the problem, he says, comes from misuse of the
word ``off,'' which in electronics has come to mean neither off nor
on. Someday, if Meier's efforts pay off, the ``off'' button will,
once again, actually mean ``off.''

   Archives Win a Reprieve in Storing Electronic Records
</P>
<P>
   As technology marches forward, so do the paper handlers in the
United States' capital.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a U.S. District Court judge sided with the National
Archives and Records Administration in an 11th-hour plea for more
time _ more time, that is, to figure out how to deal with the
voluminous e-mail and other electronic records produced daily by
federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The government now has no system for storing electronic records
except to print them out and file them. In the process, a vast
majority simply get deleted.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two years ago, a group that included researchers,
librarians and Ralph Nader's group Public Citizen sued the
Archives, contending that allowing the deletion of electronic
records leads to the loss of valuable public information.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs contend that paper records are not as useful to
the public as electronic ones, which can be easily searched. (The
nation got its first taste of the increasing importance of
electronic records during the Iran-contra trials, when some of the
most important evidence against Oliver North came from e-mail
records.)
</P>
<P>
   Last year the judge agreed with the plaintiffs in the lawsuit
and ordered the National Archives to devise guidelines for the
storage of electronic records by Sept. 30, 1998. But when that
deadline passed, the Archives were given extra time to come up with
a master plan.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, it is business as usual in Washington, as
agencies continue to push the delete button.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated plaintiffs accused the Archives of stalling,
primarily to cover up the fact that they have not made any
progress. The archivist of the United States, John Carlin, says the
problem is simply too complex to rush a solution.
</P>
<P>
   But Eddie Becker, a Washington researcher who is a plaintiff in
the suit, said: ``They're more concerned with how to get rid of
stuff, not preserve it. They want to preserve only the material the
agencies want to keep.''

   Meditation in a Wired World: Stare at the Screen and Relax
</P>
<P>
   It is easy for Mark Abouzeid to preach inner harmony and balance
for today's highly stressed business people. He lives in a house in
Castelmuzio, Italy, population 250, where the view from his window
_ a hundred olive trees and the church featured in the movie ``The
English Patient'' _ is a picture of tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   But with the help of two high-speed phone lines and nine
employees scattered in Europe and the United States, Abouzeid, a
transplanted American, keeps in touch with angst, '90s style.
</P>
<P>
   His business, Voice of Wellness, creates sites on the World Wide
Web intended to help the average, non-Tuscan-dwelling individual
learn to stay centered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't make much sense sitting in an office, stressed out,
trying to convey those principles,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the summer, the site began offering a guided meditation
exercise, which was culled from a CD-ROM project that never quite
got off the ground. So far, 12,000 people have come to
Aboutliving.com to download the free audio, at least half of them
doing so from work, Abouzeid said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to give away the software and see if anyone would
use it,'' he said, explaining that meditation has a bad image and
therefore needs free promotion. ``People think they have to shave
their heads and become gurus just to take a few minutes to relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Chilling out, Web-style, involves staring at images on the
screen while a calming voice leads a user into meditation. ``The
primary focus is becoming aware of everything around you, more
mindful of how you act and react,'' said Abouzeid, who worked in
mergers and acquisitions as an investment banker in Asia in the
1980s. ``I've got a lot of karma to work off.''
</P>
<P>
   Abouzeid recognizes that he also has a lot of work to do. Making
a viable Web business with a wellness magazine that plans to
survive off advertising sales and electronic commerce is a
challenge to anyone's inner peace.

   BERLIN, Conn. _ In a tense ritual like that being played out
around the country, counselors and politicians in the New York City
suburbs scrambled Sunday to calm thousands of elderly people who
learned second-hand over the weekend that their health insurer
would drop them on Jan. 1.

   Oxford Health Plans said it would cancel the coverage of 26,600
of the people who had chosen to receive their Medicare benefits
through a health maintenance organization, Oxford Medicare
Advantage. The company said that costs and losses were forcing it
to cancel coverage in Westchester County and three other counties
in New York, nine counties in New Jersey and six of eight in
Connecticut, including Fairfield County. Oxford subscribers in
other areas, including New York City, will not be affected, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Oxford plans to begin mailing letters explaining the
change to all 156,000 of its Medicare members, but many learned
about the cutbacks from news reports after the company announced
its plans on Friday night. The result, advocates for the elderly
said, was confusion and some panic.
</P>
<P>
   People 65 and older have flocked to the Medicare HMOs, which in
many cases charge no premiums and have only small co-payments for
benefits that include preventive care and prescription drugs. The
alternative, a Medicare supplement, typically costs about $100 a
month, according to counselors for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs around the nation are finding that the plans are not
profitable, and are acting on a Nov. 2 deadline for notifying the
government that they plan to drop the coverage next year. More than
250,000 people are being dropped in more than a dozen states,
according to federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York region, Oxford is by far the largest of four
companies that have announced that they plan to drop a total of
35,000 members by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   In a flurry of activity this weekend, politicians organized
meetings and forums to look for solutions and allow subscribers to
vent their anger, while state and volunteer agencies prepared a
huge mailing to explain the options to Oxford subscribers, and
braced for a flood of phone calls on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a big company says they're pulling out, everyone in the
state thinks it means them,'' said Christine Lewis, the director
for elderly rights at the Connecticut Department of Social
Services. ``Folks are worried they're not going to have any
coverage at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers in the New York suburbs are likely to be able to
join another HMOs, although they may have to pay more for less
generous benefits and may have to change doctors, officials said.
``Now they have to worry about pre-existing conditions, waiting
periods and whether they're going to be able to afford medicine,''
said Gerd Weindling, the Connecticut president of the American
Association of Retired Persons.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said he thought it was
``crummy'' that he and his constituents learned about the change
from news reports instead of from the company, which is based in
Norwalk, Conn. Dodd said he planned to convene a meeting of state
and federal officials in Bridgeport on Monday afternoon to sort out
the decision's effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know these companies aren't in the Peace Corps,'' he said,
pausing as he campaigned Sunday at a fair in Berlin, 15 miles
southwest of Hartford. ``They have to make a profit. Certainly the
companies can act more responsibly. This wasn't a lottery, where
these companies ended up in these markets. They made financial
assessments and went out and recruited these people.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Oxford said the company had no choice about
how to announce the news, since it had to file its plan with the
federal government before it could notify subscribers. She said
Oxford unsuccessfully tried several ways to continue the service,
including sharing management costs with hospitals and medical
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford officials said the company was willing to discuss
continuing to provide service if the federal government would allow
Oxford to reduce benefits.

   The current confusion is a gift to the Democratic politicians
throughout the nation who have tried this fall to make an issue of
their plans for tighter regulation of HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, for instance, Rep. Barbara Kennelly, the
Democratic candidate for governor, has proposed a
patient-protection law that would impose new requirements on the
companies and give new power to patients.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning at fairs this weekend, the Democratic candidate for
lieutenant governor, Joseph Courtney, said the Oxford brouhaha
demonstrated the need for such a law. ``The system is just
collapsing for people,'' Courtney said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is especially contentious in Connecticut, where Gov.
John Rowland, a Republican, personally intervened last month to
prevent two insurers from dropping coverage in three rural counties
where elderly residents would be left with no HMO option.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend before the insurers agreed to the deal, a
72-year-old man had a heart attack and died at a Norwich forum that
was called to discuss the cancellations. He had berated the
insurers before his attack and, according to witnesses, his last
words included, ``Don't dump us.''
