<HEADLINE> Troop Rotation Underway for PLA Hong Kong Garrison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A fleet of six helicopters
landed at the Skek Kong Barracks here at 09:12 Wednesday morning,
raising the curtain of the first routine troop rotation for the
People's Liberation Army (PLA) Garrison in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Forty-eight minutes later, the six military helicopters that
had served in the Special Administrative Region (SAR) since July
1, 1997, took off and made a round trip of the mountain-embraced
barracks before heading northward to Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the PLA Hong Kong Garrison to make a
normal troop rotation since it assumed Hong Kong's defense
responsibility on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The rotation is carried out in accordance with the Garrison Law
of the HKSAR, which stipulates a personnel rotation system for the
Hong Kong Garrison.
</P>
<P>
"The action is taken at the order of the Central Military
Commission and in consideration of the defense responsibility of
the Hong Kong Garrison," said the garrison's Political Commissar
Xiong Ziren Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged officers and soldiers, whether in or out of Hong
Kong, to fulfill the defense responsibility for the HKSAR and make
contributions to Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
The rotation involves part of the ground, navy and air forces
of the garrison, but it does not affect the total number of troops
stationed in Hong Kong, according to military sources.
</P>
<P>
The rotation for the navy started with the arrival of vessels
at the Stonecutters Island Naval Base at 11:15, to take the
position of outgoing naval ships.
</P>
<P>
Standing on the deck of an outgoing vessel, 21-year-old sailor
Hu Shun said: "I'm proud of being among the first batch of the PLA
Hong Kong Garrison troops, and it is an unforgettable experience
in my life."
</P>
<P>
Wu Xinbei, a lieutenant on the same vessel, said: "Wherever we
are, in Hong Kong or outside, we will always do our best to
fulfill the defense responsibility for Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
A convoy of military vehicles rolled across the Lok Ma Chau
check point into Hong Kong at 21:06, marking the start of ground
troop rotation for the Hong Kong Garrison. Escorted by local
police on motorcycles, dozens of grass-green trucks, jeeps and
other military vehicles carried PLA officers and soldiers to
barracks.
</P>
<P>
Simple rotation ceremonies were held in barracks to welcome new
comers and bid farewell to those who would leave.
</P>
<P>
Around midnight, an outgoing battalion of the ground force
crossed the Lok Ma Chau checkpoint to Shenzhen.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
said here Wednesday that Russia needs emergency measures to fix
its economic problems.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Ministry of Emergency Situations, Primakov said,
however, the country was not in a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
He said all the economic problems could be solved with the help
from the state.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the prime minister said the state's regulation of the
economy should be consolidated, and "we cannot go on waiting for
the market environment to solve our problems", the Interfax news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the transition to the market economy should
proceed along a mechanism worked out in advance.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the 1999 budget, Primakov said the budget would be
extremely strained and would require emergency measures.
</P>
<P>
He was also quoted by the Itar-Tass as saying a new federal
rescue service should be set up in 2005 with a substantial
increase of funding from the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Primakov urged the Emergency Situations
Ministry to raise its civil defense readiness in line with the
potential for regional conflicts in the country.
</P>
<P>
Primakov expressed his dissatisfaction with professional
training of the leading staff of the country's civil defense.

BONN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- German companies have become more
pessimistic about their prospects in the coming six months
according to the latest business confidence survey of the
Ifo-Institut economic think tank.
</P>
<P>
Munich-based Ifo-Institut said Wednesday that above all western
German firms in October had turned more cool about their situation
than was the case during September.
</P>
<P>
In western Germany, the factors leading to a more sober
appraisal included declining production and orders, the survey
found, although the automotive and commercial vehicles sectors
were an exception.
</P>
<P>
In eastern Germany, the food and luxury goods sector had seen a
"landslide-type" drop in business confidence.
</P>
<P>
The construction sectors in both eastern and western Germany
were likewise both more pessimistic about their situation, even
though capacity utilization had increased, as had order book
volumes, the survey found.

<HEADLINE> OAU Calls for Improved African AIDS Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
African Unity (OAU) on Wednesday called on youths in Africa to
help change the picture of AIDS disease when the continent enters
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by OAU Assistant Secretary General Ahmed
haggag, on behalf of Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim, at the
1998 World AIDS Campaign held at Africa Hall here.
</P>
<P>
Haggag noted that this the campaign is very important to
Africa where HIV/AIDS pandemic is most prominent and is
increasing in most countries. "The pandemic is affecting the
youth in the prime of their lives," he added.
</P>
<P>
"In Africa, youths constitute over 50 percent of the
population and, therefore, if they seriously engage themselves in
the prevention and control activities, they will change the
picture of this disease as we enter the 21st century," Haggag
stressed.
</P>
<P>
In a statement at the gathering, K.Y. Amoako, Executive
Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa
(ECA), said AIDS has killed 12 million Africans and another 22
million are infected. "There are now an estimated 5,500 funerals
every day in Africa due to AIDS," he said.
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the effects of AIDS on Africa, Amoako called
on African young people to protect themselves, share information
about AIDS, and take an active part in trying to bring the issue
of AIDS to the government's attention.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics from the United Nations Program on
HIV- AIDS (UNAIDS), the number of AIDS cases is 30.6 million by
December, 1997. About 90 percent of the infected persons live in
developing countries. In 1997 only, 2.3 million persons, half of
whom women and 460,000 children, died of AIDS. The current global
infection rate is around 16,000 new infections a day.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNAIDS, the region worst affected by the
epidemic is Africa south of Sahara. In some countries of this
region, the average adult population rates may be as high as 7.5
percent. The prevalence of HIV infection has reached as high as
30 percent in certain cities in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
African leaders adopted "Declaration on the AIDS Epidemic in
Africa" at 28th OAU summit held in Dakar in July 1992, and the
African heads of state and government adopted a decision on
"establishment of an African fund for AIDS control" at 34th OAU
summit held in Ouagadougou in June 1998.

<HEADLINE> BT Takes 50 Percent Share in Excite UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- British Telecom (BT) has
dramatically entered the Internet content market with a 50 percent
investment in the UK subsidiary of American portal company Excite.
</P>
<P>
The 6-million-pound (10-million-U.S. dollar) deal, announced
Wednesday, brings BT into the realm of Internet content, competing
directly with the big names like Yahoo, Netscape, MSN and AOL.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time a major UK company has forged such a
close relationship with a U.S.-based Internet portal. According to
new figures from independent watchdog Media Matrix, Excite.com Web
portal is the sixth most popular Web site.
</P>
<P>
Portals provide services ranging from free e-mail to news,
online shopping and search engines, which are aimed at retaining
visitors to their Web sites and attracting advertising by acting
as one-stop shops.
</P>
<P>
BT sees the deal as developing its presence in Internet
advertising and as a major vehicle for pushing electronic commerce
and its involvement in transactions.
</P>
<P>
Excite will be able to take advantage of the better-known BT
brand in the UK, the influx of cash and the new customers BT will
drive to it as an Internet Service Provider (ISP).
</P>
<P>
Coming after Tuesday's news that American software and portal
company Netscape is to be bought by AOL, it is further evidence of
continuing convergence of services and utilities in the Internet
industry, analysts said.

after-tax income, was minus 0.2 percent in October. That followed
a rate of minus 0.1 percent in the previous month and was the
worst performance since 1959, when the government began tracking
the data on a monthly basis.
</P>
<P>
Analysts had feared the stock market slump from mid-July
through September would dampen consumer spending. But the Dow
Jones industrial average bounced back to set a new record Monday.
And surveys show consumer confidence rebounded this month after
four monthly declines, a promising sign for holiday sales.
</P>
<P>
Negative savings occurs when people finance spending by
borrowing, selling investments, withdrawing savings or cashing out
part of their home equity when they refinance a mortgage.
</P>
<P>
In October, spending grew at a moderately strong 0.5 percent
rate, after good gains of 0.7 percent in September and 0.4
percent in August. Spending in the latest month was fueled by a
2.2 percent jump in spending on big-ticket durable goods,
reflecting brisk auto sales.
</P>
<P>
Incomes rose 0.4 percent in October after an anemic 0.2 percent
increase in September. The most closely-watched component of
income, wages and salaries, rose 0.5 percent. Wages edged down 0.1
percent in manufacturing, which has been hurt by loss of export
sales to Asian and other countries with faltering economies. But
they rose 0.9 percent in services.
</P>
<P>
Farmers' and business owners' income also increased as did
interest and dividends, rental income and transfer payments such
as Social Security.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report Wednesday, the National Association of
Realtors said sales of existing homes in October increased 2.1
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.79 million.
Though short of the record 4.91 million rate in July, October is
still a strong month. As with personal spending, home purchases
are being supported by low interest rates.
</P>
<P>
In another separate report Wednesday, the Labor Department said
the number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment
benefits fell unexpectedly by 39,000 last week to a seasonally
adjusted 300,000, the lowest level in two months.

<P>
LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain's worsening trade
situation has been highlighted by official figures showing a
record 2.5 billion pound (40 billion U.S. dollar) deficit in
goods.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics said the results for
September represented the biggest monthly deficit on record.
</P>
<P>
The figures were much worse than City experts had predicted.
Trade with Asia has been particularly badly hit by the turmoil in
the world's financial markets.
</P>
<P>
It is commonly believed here that the main cause for the
deficit was the strong pound and a slowdown in the world's
economy.
</P>
<P>
The ONS warned that the situation was likely to worsen, with
exports continuing to fall while imports remained flat.

<HEADLINE> "Iron Lady" Says Pinochet Should Be Allowed to Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- British former Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher said Wednesday that former Chilean leader
Augusto Pinochet should be allowed to return home on compassionate
grounds.
</P>
<P>
Thatcher issued a statement immediately after the British House
of Lords, the Highest Court in the nation, ruled out that the
83-year-old Chilean general did not enjoy immunity from
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Thatcher, who was nicknamed "the Iron Lady" for her
stiffness, said Pinochet was "old, frail and sick and on
compassionate grounds alone should be allowed to return to Chile."
</P>
<P>
"I also remain convinced that the national interests of both
Chile and Britain would be best served by releasing him, which the
home secretary has it in his power to do," she added.
</P>
<P>
Thatcher was the most high profile supporter of Pinochet in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Last month, shortly before Pinochet was arrested, she
entertained the retired general and called him a friend of Britain
who had done much to save British lives.
</P>
<P>
During the 1982 Malvinas (Falklands) War, Pinochet was a strong
ally to Thatcher, then prime minister of the UK, and supported
Britain in its conflict with Argentina over the South Atlantic
islands.
</P>
<P>
Thatcher, who stepped down in 1990 after 11 years as premier,
had tea with Pinochet at her London home nine days before he was
house arrested.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was kept under police guard on October 16 while
recovering from a back surgery in a hospital in London. A Spanish
judge accused that he was responsible to the deathes and
disappearances of 3,000 people during his 17-year rule and
required his extradition to Spain to face court charges.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw, the interior minister of the UK, has
to decide whether to proceed with Spain's request to extradite the
retired general.
</P>
<P>
His decision would lead to a full hearing in the British courts
on the grounds for extradition.
</P>
<P>
The British High Court ruled out last week that the government
should decide until December 2 whether Pinochet should be
extradited to Spain.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Small Arms Creates Big Toll in Central Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Tuesday urged "all states to adopt legislation to enforce
and strengthen controls on the movement of illicit arms" into the
Great Lakes region in central Africa.
</P>
<P>
Peter Burleigh, president of the 15-member council for the
month of November, said in a statement that all countries needed
to show "the necessary political will" and follow council
resolutions on arms embargos.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1990s, the Great Lakes region of Africa has
experienced an increasing tide of militarization with a
corresponding decrease in human security.
</P>
<P>
As a result, central Africa has emerged as one of the most
volatile regions of the world with more than 1.5 million civilian
deaths and well over 5 million refugees and displaced persons.
</P>
<P>
Contributing to the horrible human tragedy has been a
relentless flow of weapons into the region, U.N. sources said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council reiterates its concern as expressed in
prior council resolutions and statements over the destabilizing
effects of illicit arms flows to and within the Great Lakes
region, and throughout Africa," said the council president.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has
prioritized the need to tackle illicit arms trafficking in his
recent report on conflicts in Africa, and a special U.N. panel on
small arms has issued recommendations which are now being
considered at the 53rd General Assembly session.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the 1990s, Burundi was described as "a society
without arms." In other words, no one had arms outside of the
military. However, one of the most dramatic changes, as reported
by the U.N. Secretary News, brings about the extensive presence of
weapons in the country.
</P>
<P>
The upsurge in intra-state and regional tensions in the 1990s
has led to a constant demand for arms and munitions. In this way,
small arms and light munitions have become the weapons of choice
for government troops, insurgent and civilian defense forces.
</P>
<P>
Such weapons are less expensive and easier to procure in this
profoundly poverty-stricken region.
</P>
<P>
The constant supply of these weapons intensifies and lengthens
the region's conflicts. Since light weapons are easier to handle
and require less training, they are more accessible to children
included in military or militia service.
</P>
<P>
Of particular concern is the emerging reliance on the private
arms networks, most of which are illegal, that operate with little
accountability and a high degree of secrecy, U.N. sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, it has often been difficult to obtain prosecutable
evidence due to false documentation, lack of paper trails and
mobility of arms traffickers.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Commission of Inquiry has just completed its six-month
investigation of arms trafficking into the Great Lakes region. In
his report, Mahmoud Kassem, chairman of the inquiry commission,
recommended moratoriums on imports and trade in weapons. It also
said the European Union should make the price of joining the EU a
commitment to monitor arms transfers to conflict zones.
</P>
<P>
But above all, the commission said a regional solution to stop
the various conflicts had to be found that included integrating
the rebels groups back into society.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, it said, "these arms, like the unemployed young men
who bear them, cross borders rapidly and without hindrance to
wreak havoc on the entire sub-region."

<HEADLINE> Khatami Underlines Role of Law in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami here on Wednesday emphasized again the significance of the
rule of law and freedom of thoughts in the country.
</P>
<P>
"All people, whether in favor of or against freedoms envisioned
in the constitution, must obey the laws of the land," Khatami
told a gathering of managing directors and editors-in-chief of
the country's press.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the country needs order and the constitution
serves as the basis of order in the country, saying "we must be
committed to order and have no choice but to stay within the
boundaries of the constitution."
</P>
<P>
Khatami made the remark after several representatives at the
gathering urged him to ensure freedom of speech which he promised
in the presidential election campaign last year.
</P>
<P>
Iranian political factions run into a hot debate on freedom of
the press after several dailies and weeklies were banned by the
conservative judiciary on the charge of threatening national
security.
</P>
<P>
The liberal president rejected the notion that diversity of
thoughts is a detriment to the country's security, adding what disrupts
security is limitation of freedoms.
</P>
<P>
He said that the society envisioned by the constitution is a
multi-voiced society, not a single-voiced one, within which there
is freedom of thought.
</P>
<P>
"Even those opposing the essence of freedom have the right to
speak out," he said, human beings are created different and
diversity can not be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Khatami warned that the suppressed thought will go underground
and will lead to a social explosion.
</P>
<P>
"If we allow different voices to be heard, underground
resistances will undoubtedly come to an end, or at least would
drop in intensity," he said.

<HEADLINE> Annan Hints Meeting With Libyans Over Lockerbie Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said Wednesday there is some possibility for him to
meet with Libyan officials in a bid to resolve the issue of
bringing to trial two Libyan suspects in the 1988 Lockerbie
airliner bombing.
</P>
<P>
Annan, due to visit North Africa next week, told reporters,
"The question has been raised if it will be helpful for me to go
down there (to Libya) and bring the issue finally to closure. I
have not made my mind up yet, but it is not excluded," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the center of the issue is the trial of two alleged Libyan
intelligence agents, Abdel Basset Ali Mohamed al-Megrahi and Lamen
Khalifa Fhimah, accused of planting a bomb aboard Pan Am Flight
103 which exploded over the Scottish village of Lockerbie on
December 21, 1988. All 259 people aboard the plane were killed as
were 11 on the ground.
</P>
<P>
In August, the United States and Britain, where the suspects
have been indicted, dropped their insistence on a trial in either
country and challenged Libya to make good on its repeated offer to
allow them to be tried before a Scottish court, under Scottish
law, in a third country.
</P>
<P>
Libya still raised a number of objections, including insistence
that if the men were convicted, they should not serve their
sentence in Scotland but in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Libyan lawyers have held lengthy discussions in recent months
with the U.N. legal counsel, Hans Corell, seeking clarification of
this and other issues.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the Security Council had given him specific tasks
"including working with the Libyans to ensure delivery of the two
to the Netherlands."
</P>
<P>
He said Corell had done a good job working with the Libyan
lawyers. "I think we have offered most of the clarifications and I
had hoped we would be able to bring the issue to closure by the
end of November. We are still pressing for that," he added.
</P>
<P>
At this point he raised the possibility of dealing with the
Lockerbie question during the resumed North Africa trip that he
interrupted earlier this month because of a crisis over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Annan did not say where he might meet with Libyan officials,
but reports reaching here said it could be on the Libyan-Tunisian
border.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief is due in Algeria on December 1-2 and in Tunisia
on December 3-4.

<HEADLINE> First Batch of Oil Equipment Arrive in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The first batch of spare
parts badly needed by Iraq's oil industry arrived in the country
Wednesday, said U.N. spokesman in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
George Somerwill, the United Nations spokesman, told reporters
that a ship carrying 2,520 tonnes of equipment and spare parts for
oil facilities had arrived in the southern Iraqi port city of Umm
Qasr.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on June 19 allowed Iraq to import 300
million U.S. dollars worth of spare parts for oil facilities to
increase its oil production and export.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused representatives of the United States and
British in the U.N. Sanctions Committee of blocking the approval
of some contracts it signed with foreign companies in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Under the current fourth phase of oil-for-food program, which
expires at midnight Wednesday, Iraq is allowed to export 5.2
billion dollars worth of oil to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the low prices in the world oil market and lack of
spare parts for its oil facilities, Iraq was only able to export
some 3 billion dollars worth of oil during the period.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council voted unanimously on Tuesday to renew the
humanitarian program in Iraq for another six months.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq only agreed to accept a three-month extension of the
fourth phase to give time for the implementation of the contracts
reached in previous phases.

ANKARA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz announced Wednesday night that he had submitted the letter
of his resignation to Turkish President Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz resigned as his minority government lost a vote of
confidence in parliament Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's government collapsed after losing a confidence vote in
parliament over a corruption scandal that tainted the prime
minister with allegations of ties with mafia.
</P>
<P>
The Coalition government led by Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz
lost the vote by 214 to 314 in the 550-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
Among the 528 deputies attending the session, 314 deputies,
most of whom are from the pro-Islamic Virtue Party (FP), the True
Path Party (DYP) and the Republican People's Party (CHP) voted for
the downfall of the government.
</P>
<P>
The Yilmaz government was formed in June 1997 after the then
prime minister Necmettin Erbakan resigned under the pressure from
the military.
</P>
<P>
Under the Turkish Constitution, the parliament will be given 45
days to form a new government. If it fails to do so, Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel, as head of state, will appoint a
care-taker cabinet which will operate until next April's general
election.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the ANAP and DYP, two center-right
parties, might reach a deal to form a new government with the
support from a small party.
</P>
<P>
The 17-month-old Yilmaz government has been accused by the
opposition parties of corruption and having relations with gangs
and mafia.
</P>
<P>
The crisis emerged after businessman Korkmaz Yigit claimed that
Yilmaz rigged the bidding process of the Turkish trade
bank.

<P>
BOU Governor Charles Kikonyogo stressed the need for this
sensitization at a one-day workshop here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor called for closer co-operation
between his bank and the media for the purpose of disseminating
accurate and reliable information about the bank's complex and
important roles of formulating and implementing monetary policy
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The BOU is carefully intervening in the foreign exchange
market to avoid depleting national reserves, Kikonyogo explained.
</P>
<P>
As to the supervision role of the central bank, the governor
said although his bank takes the blame for all eventualities, the
other stakeholders such as commercial banks, depositors and the
media also have a role to play in ensuring smooth operations of
the banking sector.
</P>

Sam Katwere, BOU's deputy director of public relations, said
the BOU will organize more media seminars to create public
awareness about the role and responsibilities of the central

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Leader Warns Africa of Dangers in Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian
Vice-President Omar Ali Juma on Wednesday warned African
countries not to rely on food imports to solve their hunger
problems.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the first African Congress on Food Security, Trade
and Sustainable Development (COASAD) in Dar es Salaam, Juma said
the open door policy of the present era give rise to problems
Africa has never faced in the past.
</P>
<P>
"Opening up our borders for food imports without regard for
domestic production could easily stifle incentives for domestic
production and jeopardize long-term food security objectives as
the country becomes import dependent," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Africa is increasingly being called upon to face
globalization and liberalized international trade, and the rules
of the World Trade Organization (WTO) requires it signatories in
Africa to lower trade barriers to food and other imports from
outside.
</P>
<P>
"To deal with this challenge we must decrease our dependency
on food imports and aid," the vice-president said to more than 40
participants from some 20 African countries, as well as France,
Belgium, the United States, among others.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, he said, Africa is still a net importer of even
the main food grains like maize and rice due to natural disasters
and wars.
</P>
<P>
African countries, he said, can reduce imports by sharing
research network and technical expertise and by trading more
among themselves.
</P>
<P>
"Africa must increase continental food security through
co-operation in food security programs such as the co-ordination
of nationally held strategic grain reserves," he said at the
pan-African assembly.
</P>
<P>
Juma also appealed to African countries to stop wars which
pose threats to food security and respect women's role in food
production.
</P>
<P>
The COASAD initiative was launched at the World Food Summit in
Rome in 1996, which calls for co-operation among African
countries in defeating famine.

<HEADLINE> aaa112532 Switzerland to Impose Sanctions on Angola's UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss Foreign Ministry
Wednesday announced that Switzerland will impose sanctions upon
the National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA),
effective from Thursday, the Angolan News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions include freezing the assets deposited by the
UNITA leaders and their relatives in Switzerland and banning any
military assistances and transportation services to the rebel
movement.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Bern, the Swiss Foreign Ministry also
noted that Switzerland will ban any import of diamonds without
the permission from the Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
The statement pointed out that Switzerland is "voluntarily"
implementing the United Nations resolution No. 1173 about
sanctions upon the UNITA. The resolution was aimed at cutting
off the economic resources and forcing the UNITA to follow the
1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the Swiss government decided to put limit to the
visa applications by UNITA President Jonas Savimbi and his
followers as well as their adult relatives and to forbid the
UNITA mission to operate in the European country.
</P>
<P>
Though not a U.N. member, Switzerland still joined the U.N.
Security Council in imposing sanctions upon the UNITA in 1993 and
1997 because these sanctions were in line with the Swiss laws.
</P>
<P>
Both the United Nations and the Angolan government have
accused Angola's rebel movement of violating the Lusaka peace
accord by refusing to demilitarize its troops and surrender the
areas under its control to the hands of the government.

<P>
Ebtekar, who is in charge of Iran's environmental protection,
came here to attend a two-day meeting of the Parties to the
Montreal Protocol on ozone layer protection, which closed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
She told a press conference that another key objective of her
visit here is to seek ways of strengthening ties with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The ties between the two countries were severed in 1979 after
Egypt signed the David Camp peace treaty with Israel. In recent
years, both sides have voiced readiness to improve their relations
and exchange visits of cultural and economic delegations.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Egypt have carried out cooperation in the fields of
economy and health, she said, hoping the same step be taken in
other areas to help promote sustainable development in both
countries.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the dispute over three Gulf islands between Iran
and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), she said the difference can be
settled through bilateral talks as the two countries enjoy good
relations.
</P>
<P>
Both Iran and the UAE claim sovereignty over Abu Musa, the
Greater and Lesser Tunb, three small islands at the mouth of the
strategic Hormuz Straits.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that the dispute should not lead to tensions in
the relations between Iran and the other Islamic countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran and UAE have expressed readiness to solve the issue
through peaceful means. But Iran maintains the dispute should be
resolved through bilateral talks while the UAE, supported by the
Arab world, insists on international arbitration.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council Wednesday decided to extend the mandate of the
U.N. Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) for a further period of
six months until May 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The 1,500-strong UNDOF has been deployed between Israeli and
Syrian forces in the Golan Heights since 1974.
</P>
<P>
Despite the generally quiet situation in the Israeli-Syrian
sector, the state of relations between several countries continued
to be potentially dangerous. The UNDOF supervises the cease-fire
and disengagement agreement reached more than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
In its resolution unanimously adopted, the Security Council
called on parties concerned to implement immediately its relevant
resolution.
</P>
<P>
The council requested the U.N. secretary-general to submit, at
the end of this period, a report on the development in the
situation.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland to Impose Sanctions on Angola's UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss Foreign Ministry
Wednesday announced that Switzerland will impose sanctions upon
the National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA),
effective from Thursday, the Angolan News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions include freezing the assets deposited by the
UNITA leaders and their relatives in Switzerland and banning any
military assistances and transportation services to the rebel
movement.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Bern, the Swiss Foreign Ministry also
noted that Switzerland will ban any import of diamonds without
the permission from the Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
The statement pointed out that Switzerland is "voluntarily"
implementing the United Nations resolution No. 1173 about
sanctions upon the UNITA. The resolution was aimed at cutting
off the economic resources and forcing the UNITA to follow the
1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the Swiss government decided to put limit to the
visa applications by UNITA President Jonas Savimbi and his
followers as well as their adult relatives and to forbid the
UNITA mission to operate in the European country.
</P>
<P>
Though not a U.N. member, Switzerland still joined the U.N.
Security Council in imposing sanctions upon the UNITA in 1993 and
1997 because these sanctions were in line with the Swiss laws.
</P>
<P>
Both the United Nations and the Angolan government have
accused Angola's rebel movement of violating the Lusaka peace
accord by refusing to demilitarize its troops and surrender the
areas under its control to the hands of the government.

NAIROBI, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from 22
National Olympic Committees in Africa gathered here Wednesday to
attend the continent's first regional seminar on sport and
environment.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar is focused on the impact of sporting
events on the environment, and the wider relationship between
environment, sport, culture and health on the continent.
</P>
<P>
It was sponsored by the International Olympic Committee (IOC),
the Nairobi-based U.N. Environment Program and the National

"No athlete can perform at his or her optimum level if the air
he breaths or the water she swims in is polluted," said UNEP
Executive Director Klaus Toepfer in a statement issued at the
opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"This seminar is one more step in a series of activities being
undertaken by UNEP and the IOC since we signed a cooperative
agreement in 1994, to sensitize those involved in organizing and
participating in sports events to the need to protect the
environment," said Toepfer.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian-Israeli Final Status Talks to Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 25 (Xinhua)-- A senior Palestinian official
announced Wednesday that the final status talks aimed at
achieving a permanent peace deal between the Palestinians and
Israel will be formally launched next month.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Shaath, minister of Planning and International
Cooperation of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), said the
talks will officially begin only after the Palestinian delegation
returns from a convention of donor countries to the PNA, the
Jerusalem Media and Communication Center said.
</P>
<P>
The convention is to be held in Washington at the end of this
month.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed to hold an "opening ceremony" this
week to set off the high risk talks, the East Jerusalem-based
Palestinian news service said.
</P>
<P>
The talks will try to resolve the thorniest issues between
the two hostile sides such as the final status of the Palestinian
areas in Gaza and the West Bank, the fate of Jerusalem, Jewish
settlements and Palestinian refugees before the five-year interim
period stipulated in the 1993 Oslo Accord expires in May next year.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians entered the final talks in May,
1996, in line with a timetable in the Oslo Accord. But soon after
a symbolic start, the talks were stillborn with the election of
hard-line Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Former Foreign Minister David Levy will return to the cabinet
and join incumbent Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon in heading the
Israeli side in the final talks.

<HEADLINE> Street Children Need to Be Educated: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- All the street children in
Uganda need to be educated and their problems deserve a
comprehensive study, a senior official said Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Francis Babu, state minister for education and sports, made
the call at a three-day regional workshop on child sponsorship at
Lweza Conference and Training Center near the capital city, Radio
Uganda reported Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The report said the official attributed the problems of street
children to Uganda's historical turmoil, spread of HIV/AIDS,
poverty and lack of love in some homes.
</P>
<P>
Though some proposals have been put forward, he lamented that
they are incomprehensive and do not adequately address the
problem in totality.
</P>
<P>
The minister criticized some proposals for being so inhuman as
to calling for their extermination or incarceration in prisons.
</P>
<P>
He advocated that educational centers be built to provide
training and normal education to all the street children.
</P>
<P>
Street children in Uganda are so many that they hit headlines
and pose a threat to social security. Some of them take to
begging while many others are addicted to drugs.
</P>
<P>
The regional workshop, organized by the Stomme Foundation of
Norway, has attracted 34 participants from local non-govenrmental
organizations from Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda which have
a working partnership with the foundation.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The 29th meeting of the Council
of the heads of government of the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS) was fruitful, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after the meeting, Primakov said
"the current crisis in Russia and other CIS states makes us
synchronize our plans more and more, and jointly look for the ways
out of this situation."
</P>
<P>
He said "there are many factors which push us towards closer
economic relations," and called for an "accelerated creation of a
free trade zone" in the CIS.
</P>
<P>
Primakov noted two key issues which were discussed at the
meeting: first, a number of proposals were made at the meeting
concerning a plan of action for the CIS states to overcome the
crisis; second, CIS Executive Secretary Boris Berezovsky presented
a report on CIS reform.
</P>
<P>
On the CIS reform, Primakov said that either a new executive
secretariat or an executive committee will be created to
"coordinate administrative work and work out the strategy and
tactic of CIS development."
</P>
<P>
Primakov emphasized that economic cooperation must become the
locomotive of integration. "A free trade area must be created."
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to reach a balance between the interests of all
countries of the CIS so that the renewed CIS can be really
effective, the Russian premier said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the Council of the heads of government of the
CIS opened at Moscow's President Hotel Wednesday afternoon.
Primakov chairs the present session since the prime minister of
Uzbekistan who is chairman of the Council is absent for health
reasons.
</P>
<P>
According to the Itar-Tass, after the CIS meeting Primakov
confirmed at the press conference that he will not run for
president in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Angry at Netanyahu's Cancellation of Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss federal council
(government) deplored Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
cancellation of his scheduled official working visit Wednesday to
Switzerland, said Vice Chancellor M. Casanova.
</P>
<P>
Casanova said that Netanyahu avoided using the opportunity to
appease Swiss people's irritation because he attended last week in
Jerusalem a ceremony rewarding A. D'Amato and three other
Americans.
</P>
<P>
Many Swiss consider the four as Swiss-bashers because they
helped force Swiss companies to compensate Jewish victims during
the holocaust.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Tel Aviv indicate that Netanyahu postponed his
visit because he and some of his cabinet members have not yet
agreed on a government reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
But Casanova believed that it was just an excuse because
Netanyahu went on with his Europe tour starting in London only
hours later. Switzerland was originally the first stop of
Netanyahu's tour in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli ambassador in Berne said he was informed of the
decision just before midnight. He will try to arrange a new date
for the "important visit."

GENEVA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The decision by Britain's House
of Lords on the Pinochet case will hearten human rights defenders
around the world, said High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary
Robinson in a statement issued here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"In overturning the ruling of the High Court that Pinochet
benefits from `sovereign immunity,' the Law Lords have raised the
hope that he will finally be brought to face allegations before a
court ad confirmed the emerging international consensus against
impunity," Ms Robinson said.
</P>

She said that the decision would have been unthinkable not so
long ago if there was not "a turn in the tide in international
law" as evidenced last summer in Rome with the adoption of the
Statute of the International Criminal Court.
</P>
<P>
"The outcome in the Pinochet case reinforces the need for
states to ratify the Statute of the International Criminal Court,"
she stressed.
</P>
<P>
"This court would pave the way towards consistent,
comprehensive and universal prosecution and punishment of
international crimes and help avoid embroiling governments and
domestic courts in difficult complications arising from diplomatic
relations," she said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Military Chiefs Do Not See SFOR Force Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The chiefs of staff from NATO
member states have agreed that they did not see the possibility
for substantial force reduction for the Stabilization Force (SFOR)
in Bosnia, a senior NATO official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
General Klaus Naumann, chairman of the NATO Military Committee,
told the press after a two-day NATO chiefs of staff meeting that
the military chiefs did their six-month review over the situation
in Bosnia and decided that the civil implementation of the Dayton
peace accord was slower than the political implementation.
</P>
<P>
The NATO-led multinational peacekeeping force in Bosnia will
remain at its current force level of 32,000 in the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
A United Nations special envoy to Bosnia demanded earlier this
month that the SFOR remain in Bosnia for some more years to come.
</P>
<P>
U.N. envoy Elisabeth Rehn made the request to the NATO
decision-making body -- the North Atlantic Council -- that the
SFOR presence is needed for still quite a while to secure the
safety of the 2,000-strong unarmed International Police Task Force
now working in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
She said that it would be difficult for the United Nations to
stay in Bosnia while others are leaving.
</P>
<P>
The SFOR is the continuation of the NATO-led peacekeeping force
of the Implementation Force (IFOR) that entered Bosnia after the
Dayton peace accord was signed in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
NATO has been considering reducing the SFOR force level or
replace it with a small-size deterrence force (DFOR) altogether.
</P>
<P>
The military committee chairman added that the NATO military
chiefs also discussed the concept that is to be incorporated into
the new strategic concept of the Western military alliance, that
is expected to be unveiled next April.
</P>
<P>
The opinion prevailed among the military chiefs, General
Naumann said, that nuclear strike should remain as "an assurance
to preserve peace and prevent crisis and conflict."
</P>
<P>
NATO would like to keep the element of uncertainty in the
calculation of potential opponents through nuclear deterrence for
the purpose of securing certainty, he said.
</P>
<P>
The military committee chief said that proliferation of mass
destruction weaponry is prospering and it is still unclear how
many potential nuclear states there are in the world during this
transitional period of time.
</P>
<P>
The new government of Germany wanted NATO to abandon its
rejection to no-first-use of nuclear weapons but the three nuclear
powers within NATO did not see the possibility to change the
nuclear doctrine of the alliance, according to the military
committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear issue is expected to be discussed at the year-end
council meetings of NATO foreign and defense ministers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Already 21 more cases of HIV
infection were reported in Belgium, the first increase in a year
since 1994, local television reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
RTL-TVI television quoted the Belgian Health Institute as
saying that total HIV infection has reached 210 cases even a month
before the end of year, or 21 more cases than last year.
</P>
<P>
The full-blown AIDS, however, has been on the decline since
1994, with 253 reported cases in 1994, 112 in 1997 and around 62
this year.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Marleen Dendas attributed the trend reverse to a slack
of public awareness-raising campaign since 1994 when HIV infection
peaked in this country.
</P>
<P>
"The epidemic is less dramatic and less visible now in this
country," said the doctor, "where there is no more large-scale
public information campaign as the ones before 1994."
</P>
<P>
The lack of public awareness-raising campaign may lead to more
infections of the sexually-transmitted disease in that people may
be discouraged to continue to practise safe sex, she added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Lebanese New President's Pledge Brings Hope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile
Lahoud's pledge to rule by law Tuesday brought hopes for the
country which is still reeling from the devastating 15-year-old
civil war.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old former army commander, who took over the rein
of state from 73-year-old Elias Hrawi, was sworn in Tuesday as the
country's 11th president since its independence 55 years ago from
France.
</P>
<P>
He vowed in his inaugural address at the parliament to restore
the rule of law in the country and launch a campaign against
corruption.
</P>
<P>
"As the head of state, I shall be under the law so no one else
can be above it," said Lahoud.
</P>
<P>
"There is no future for Lebanon and anyone in Lebanon without
the reemergence of the rule of law, " he asserted.
</P>
<P>
He promised to launch a campaign against rampant corruption
which has long been a social problem resented by people.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud also spelled out his economic policy to tackle the
deepening socio-economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The people has the right to ask about the type of economic and
financial policy that would be adopted, its burdens, its
cumulative effects and its targets," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president promised an equitable and fair taxation policy in
which "the poor will not be forced to shoulder the burdens of the
wealthy."
</P>
<P>
On regional affairs, he reiterated his country's commitment to
the special ties with Syria and slashed at the Israeli attempts to
split the Syrian and Lebanese tracks in the Middle East peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud, a close ally of Syria, was elected by parliament as
president on October 15 after getting the approval of Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad, whose country's 40,000 troops are
deployed in Lebanon as peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud's statement was welcomed by Lebanese officials.
</P>
<P>
Parliament Speaker Nabih Berry said the speech laid out
important positions, especially with regard to administrative
reform.
</P>
<P>
Former prime minister Rafik Hariri said the "realistic" speech
reflected the hope of Lebanese people to change the current
situation.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Investigates Alleged Persecution of Copts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Chief of Egypt's Higher State
Security Prosecution Hisham Badawi Wednesday listened to the
testimony of a newspaper editor about issues related to the
alleged persecution of Christian Copts by Egyptian police.
</P>
<P>
A report on Al Usbou newspaper written by one of its editors,
Moustafa Bakri, said the Egyptian Human Rights Organization
received 25,703 U.S. dollars from a foreign embassy in Cairo after
it released a report alleging that Copts in southern Egypt were
persecuted by the police, Egyptian Middle East News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, Bakri displayed a copy of the check showing
the sum of money and another copy of the organization's report on
the incident in Suhag Governorate's Kosheh village, where 70
percent of its 35,000 inhabitants are Christians.
</P>
<P>
The public prosecutor has ordered that the Bakri's report be
investigated, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette newspaper has reported that the Egyptian
Human Rights Organization issued a statement last month claiming
that more than 1,000 Copts were rounded up by the security force
who were investigating the killing of two Copts.
</P>
<P>
Based on the allegations, Britain's Sunday Telegraph newspaper
said that "Egyptian Christians have been subjected to horrific
crucification rituals, raped and tortured by the security forces
during a crackdown on the ancient Coptic community."
</P>
<P>
Egypt's parliament, social groups and celebrities have

<HEADLINE> U.S. Researchers Develop Termite Detection System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at the
Agricultural Center of Louisiana State University have developed
a new termite detection system.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the system has the potential to save
homeowners millions of U.S. Dollars a year by early detection of
the wood-eating pests.
</P>
<P>
The researchers recently discovered termites produce
naphthalene- a hydrocarbon they apparently use as a defense
against natural enemies such as ants. They developed a method of
using these unique gases to indicate the presence of termites.
</P>
<P>
The detection system samples the air in the walls of a
building and analyzes its composition. If the system identifies
the chemicals associated with termites, there's a strong
possibility the insects are there.
</P>
<P>
They say that the next step is full-scale testing the system.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Clerics Stage Rally against Ties with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Iranian clerics
on Wednesday staged a rally in the holy city of Qom, central
Iran, condemning establishment of any kinds of relations with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, some draped in shroud, were dragging the
flags of the U.S. on the ground, the Iranian official news
agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators marched through some streets and gathered
outside the holy shrine of Masoumeh, sister of the eighth Imam
of the Shiite Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration came after Iranian hardliners on Saturday
attacked a group of 13 foreign visitors, mostly Americans, and
forced them to leave Iran.
</P>
<P>
The attack was condemned by senior Iranian official,
including the minister of information, who pledged to punish
those responsible for the attack.
</P>
<P>
However, the protesters condemned the visit of American
visitors, who was accused by Iranian hardline newspapers of
being members of the Central Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
They burned several flags of the U.S. and chanted slogans
"Death to the U.S." and "Death to Hypocrites," IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
The rally issued a nine-point resolution, condemning the
visit of American visitors and terming it contrary to the
principles of dignity, wisdom and prudence.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls for Peace in Georgia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Wednesday issued a presidential statement, calling upon
warring parties in the former Soviet republic of Georgia to
"refrain from the use of force and to resolve disputed issues by
peaceful means only."
</P>
<P>
"The Council strongly urges the two sides to build on this
momentum to widen their commitment to the United Nations-led peace
process, to continue to intensify their discussion, in particular
within the Coordinating Council, and to expand their relations at
all levels, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also strongly encourages the parties to
work together in order to convene a meeting between Georgian
President Edward Shevardnadze and the leader of Abkhazia,
Ardzinba, for an agreement on the return of refugees and measures
for the economic rehabilitation of Abkhazia, Georgia, as a
concrete step towards easing tensions and leading to improvement
in the security environment, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The Council demands that both sides take determined and prompt
measures to put a stop to such acts, which subvert the peace
process, and to ensure that the security environment of all
international personnel improves significantly," it said.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Georgia returned to a relative peace after two years
of civil war, but the government has not wiped out all
destabilizing factors. In January 1995, the Georgian parties began
negotiations on the issue of Abkhazia.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique's Temane Gas Reserve Promising: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Atlantic Richfield
Corporation (ARCO) of the United States has said the exploration
and test drilling proved that the gas reserve in Mozambique's
Temane is promising, Mozambican News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Vice President of ARCO Mozambique Denny Tower told journalists
who visited the gas field Tuesday that "the consortium was happy
with the results so far obtained by the Temane gas prospection
program."
</P>
<P>
Five wells drilled in Temane in Mozambique's southern
Inhambane Province have proved that between 23 million and 50
million cubic meters of natural gas can be extracted from the
reserve per day for the next 50 years, the Mozambican News Agency
quoted Tower as saying.
</P>
<P>
"So far, we have invested about 30 million U.S. Dollars in our
prospecting activities and we expect this figure to reach 40
million by the end of the year," Tower said. "The total
investment may reach 60 million U.S. Dollars by mid-1999."
</P>
<P>
Temane 7, the last of the wells, was tested Tuesday, to
determine the quantity and quality of the gas in the deposit. The
test will be finished Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the arrangements to build a gas pipeline between
South Africa and Mozambique, Tower said that this is a matter
still under discussion between the consortium and the Mozambican
government.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the 960-km pipeline will be completed in one
year and the gas may not reach South Africa until the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
Tower disclosed that the gas sold to South Africa and Zimbabwe
as well as in Mozambique can earn some 200 million U.S. Dollars
annually.
</P>
<P>
The gas industry will also create more jobs for the
Mozambicans, he added.
</P>
<P>
Peter Thompson, head of the Mozambican branch of SASOL
Petroleum of South Africa, said that his company is willing to
buy gas from Mozambique because the gas can be used both as fuel
and as raw material for SASOL refineries.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Urges Syria to Release Jordanian Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Information Minister
Nasir Judeh here Wednesday urged Syria to release the Jordanians
jailed in Syrian prisons for political reasons.
</P>
<P>
Jordan welcomed the recent release of Musa Karasneh, a
Jordanian bank official who underwent five months imprisonment in
Syria, and hoped Syria to tackle the issue of other Jordanian
prisoners quickly, said Judeh at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Jordan stuck to a clear stand that any Jordanian who commits
crimes in another country should be subject to the laws of that
country while Jordan should be informed of the concerned details.
</P>
<P>
However, differences in political viewpoints should not affect
bilateral relations, especially those between brotherly countries,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Judeh criticized the Syrian authorities for denying earlier the
imprisonment of Karasneh, who was detained months ago when he
entered Syria on business trip.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government put the number of Jordanians jailed or
missing in Syria at over 700, while civilian groups put it at from
700 to 1,000.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has strained ties with Syria, who criticized the kingdom
for signing a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 and staying too
close to the Jewish state ever since.

AMMAN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Information Minister
Nasir Judeh said here Wednesday that Jordan will not be a base for
any Iraqi opposition force to stage activities aimed at toppling
Iraq's current government.
</P>
<P>
Such activities are forbidden in Jordan, whether they are
against Arab countries or non-Arab countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi opposition force is widely believed to have offices
in Amman, but it has never staged open activities against the
Iraqi authorities in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain earlier this month claimed that
they expected the Iraqi opposition force to replace the current
Iraqi authorities soon.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is Jordan's close neighbor. The only entrance and exit for
Iraq now under the Untied Nations sanctions is Jordan.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Organs Change View on Breast-feeding for HIV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said Wednesday
that they have changed their stance on breast-feeding because of
the deadly HIV virus.
</P>
<P>
Although they have been reluctant to support
non-breast-feeding for HIV-positive mothers in developing
countries, the U.N. agencies said in a statement released here
that they have changed their stance because of the escalating
levels of maternal HIV.
</P>
<P>
At the on-going four-day WHO workshop on the reduction of
mother to child transmission of HIV virus, the U.N. agencies said
that one consideration which led to the changing view was that in
most of southern Africa more than 20 percent of pregnant women
were HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
The agencies said two thirds of the babies born to
HIV-positive mothers were not infected.
</P>
<P>
Of the one-third infected, two-thirds were infected in the
womb and one-third through breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
The new policy guideline of the WHO, United Nations AIDS
Agency (UNAIDS) and UNICEF on breast-feeding was that all women
should be kept informed about the risks of HIV transmission
through breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
They said all women needed to have access to voluntary
counseling and testing to establish their HIV status and be
supported to undertake safely the option they chose, either to
breast-feed or use replacement feeding.
</P>
<P>
In line with the revised policy, the U.N. organizations
emphasized that breast milk and breast-feeding should remain the
desired option for HIV negative women and those who did not know
their status.
</P>
<P>
If HIV positive mothers had to breast-feed, the breast-feeding
duration should be reduced to between three and seven months as
risk of infection was higher if the process continued.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Find "Naked" Stars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Four young "naked" stars with
no surrounding dust and gas may give clue to how the Sun formed,
U.S. astronomers reported Wednesday in the scientific journal
Nature.
</P>
<P>
The formation of Sun-like stars is a gradual process during
which the young star accretes mass from the dense disk of dust and
gas that surrounds it, releasing jets of material along the polar
axes.
</P>
<P>
The four young stars observed by Reipurth and colleagues, of
the University of Colorado, Boulder, located in a star-forming
region between the massive, multiple star sigma Orionis and the
Horsehead Nebul, are unusual in that they are "naked" with much of
the expected envelopes of dust of gas missing.
</P>
<P>
It seems that ultraviolet radiation from massive stars in the
region has stripped the circumstellar envelopes from these young
stars, removing the reservoir of material from which the stars are
built up, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
Because the clouds are gone, those stars may give scientists an
unprecedented view of what goes into making a star like our Sun,
and how solar systems may evolve.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Resigns After Losing Confidence Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz resigned Wednesday evening after losing a confidence vote
in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the presidential palace, Yilmaz said,
"I submitted the letter of resignation to the president a while
ago."
</P>
<P>
The coalition government led by Yilmaz, chairman of the
pro-secular center-right Motherland Party (ANAP), collapsed when
314 deputies of the 550-seat parliament refused to cast a
confidence ballot for the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Most of the "no" votes came from the pro-Islamic Virtue Party
(FP) and True Path Party (DYP).
</P>
<P>
The FP and DYP, together with Republican People's Party (CHP),
have made three motions against Yilmaz, accusing him of interfering
in the privatization plan of a Turkish bank and having links with
gangs and mafia.
</P>
<P>
The Yilmaz administration came to power in June 1997 when the
then Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, who was known for his
pro-Islamic views, was forced to step down by the pro-secularist
military.
</P>
<P>
Under the Turkish Constitution, a new government should be
formed within 45 days. If the proposed government fails to win a
confidence vote in the parliament, Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel, as head of state, will appoint a caretaker cabinet which
will operate until next general election scheduled for April.
</P>
<P>
Demirel began trying to construct a new government and opened
talks with opposition party leaders hours after Yilmaz lost his
confidence vote.
</P>
<P>
But his meeting agenda clearly showed the potential
difficulties ahead as pro-Islamic forces press for power while
their military-backed rivals struggle to protect the secular
principles.
</P>
<P>
One of his first meetings was with the leader of the Virtue
Party, the largest party in the parliament, which seek to install
greater Muslim codes and values in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the head of parliament's largest party is
authorized to construct a new government.
</P>
<P>
But the military and secular political leaders have vowed to
repeat the so-called "soft coup", which toppled the Erbakan
government, if the FP is appointed to form a government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the secular-oriented parties, may seek to set aside
their feuds and unite to form a coalition until elections.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Yilmaz's ANAP and its longtime rival
the DYP led by Former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller will be most
likely to join hands to form a new government with the support of
a small party.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe launched the 1998-99
national anti-HIV/AIDS campaign to combat the spread of the
pandemic Wednesday in the capital of Harare.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is targeted at the young people who have
repeatedly been warned to desist from pre-marital sex as the
HIV/AIDS pandemic threatens to wipe out the most productive age
groups of people between the ages of 20 and 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Information, Posts and Telecommunications Chen
Chimutengwende said that the scourge affects young people in many
ways, so the campaign would focus on that group for HIV
prevention is a prerequisite for effectively dealing with the
AIDS problem.
</P>
<P>
Unless children got enough guidance from parents and the
society at large, the minister said, they could indulge in
behaviors which would put them at high risks of contracting the
lethal virus.
</P>
<P>
"AIDS robs young people of the opportunity to explore and
realize their full potential and inhibits their participation in
community and national development," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government has recognized the need for its leadership to
resolve the AIDS problem and proposed a coordination framework
aimed at placing AIDS high on the national agenda, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
The proposals have been submitted to the President's Office
for consideration, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is second to Botswana on the world list of countries
worst affected by AIDS. About 1.4 million adults, or 25.8
percent of sexually-active adults between 15 and 49 years, are
thought to be infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
More than 700 people reportedly die from HIV/AIDS-related
illnesses every week.

WASHINGTON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will provide Congress with his answers to 81 questions about
allegations stemming from the Monica Lewinsky matter on Friday,
the White House said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Amy Weiss said Clinton and his lawyers were still
working on responses to the questions, posed on November 5 by
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
"I was told by counsel's office that they're not finished yet,
but they will be finished and signed on Friday," she said.
</P>
<P>
The questions, based on Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's
referral on the Lewinsky matter to Congress, focus on the central
issue of the perjury, obstruction of justice and witness tampering
charges against Clinton being considered by the panel in its
impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
The Judiciary Committee said the questions were offered in
order to get Clinton to stipulate that certain facts about the
case were true and thus speed up the process.
</P>
<P>
They focus on conversations between Clinton and his aides, his
public and private statements about his affair with the former
White House intern, his efforts at aiding her job search and his
knowledge of her affidavit in the Paula Jones case.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 26 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela and Joseph Blatter, president of the Federation of
International Football Associations (FIFA), exchanged decorations
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was awarded with FIFA's highest honor, the FIFA Merit
of Order, for his efforts to reconcile South Africans, while
Blatter was decorated with South Africa's highest civil honor for
foreigners, the Order of Good Hope Class IV.
</P>
<P>
Blatter was recognized for his contribution to the promotion
of sport, specially football, in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Mr Blatter played a vital role in South Africa's re-admission
to world football. Through his intervention, FIFA deviated from
their constitutional requirements and provided South Africa with
immediate and unconstitutional full membership in 1992," Mandela
said.
</P>
<P>
Blatter reiterated his commitment to assisting South Africa in
its bid to host the 2006 World Cup tournament.
</P>
<P>
Blatter said earlier this year that it would be "logical" for
the tournament to be held in Africa, and that he was looking for
an African country to fulfill the criteria for staging the event.
</P>
<P>
Besides Germany and England, South Africa faces competition
from two other African countries -- Egypt and Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Quebec's PQ to Win Big in Monday's Election, Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A sweeping re-election of the
Parti Quebecois (PQ) seems assured in Monday's general election in
Canada's French-speaking province of Quebec, according to a poll
published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
If Quebec voters mark their ballots as they indicated in the
survey, the separatist PQ party will beat its major rival the Liberal
Party by a margin of 10 percentage points in the popular vote.
</P>
<P>
This would deliver the PQ a landslide in the seat count and put
it back in government with a bolstered majority, the Montreal-based
newspaper Gazette reported.
</P>
<P>
The poll found that the PQ had the backing of 43 percent of
decided voters, while the Liberals had the support of 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
When the undecided voters distributed by 3-2 ratio in favor of
the Liberals, the PQ held a 48 percent to 38 percent lead in this
final week of the 33-day campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Action Democratique party with 10 percent and the Equality
Party falling short of one percent, according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
The poll also found that majority of respondents (62.3 percent)
believe that a re-elected PQ government will hold another referendum
on Quebec's independence, while only 30.4 percent think otherwise.
</P>
<P>
By close to 60 percent of them indicated that they would have
voted No had a referendum been held this week.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted for The Gazette and Le Soleil by the SOM
polling firm, interviewed 1,031 Quebecers of voting age between
November 20 and 24. It has a margin of error of 3.8 percentage
points.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Railway Minister Nitish
Kumar has announced an extra compensation to the dead and injured
in one of the worst train tragedy, which occurred early Thursday
in north India.
</P>
<P>
Kumar, who inspected the accident site today, announced an
extra compensation of 25,000 rupees ( 595 U.S. dollars) to the
next of kin of each of the dead and 5,000 rupees (119 U.S.
dollars) each to the injured.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the injured could also get up to 400,000
rupees (9,500 U.S. dollars) each as insurance claim depending on
the nature of injury and disablement.
</P>
<P>
At least 108 people were killed and more than 250 others
injured in the train disasters as a south-bound express train
rammed into three derailed coaches near Khanna in Ludhiana
district of Punjab state.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported from the spot that
three bogies of the express train named Frontier Mail from Mumbai,
which had left Khanna at 3:10 am, derailed and fell on the down
track near a village called Kohri.
</P>
<P>
The 3152 express from Jammu rammed into the derailed bogies
with a result that the engine and seven bogies of the train
derailed and six more bogies of the Frontier Mail also went off
the rails, said railway officials in the area.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee sent a message to
the relatives of those killed, expressing his grief at the train
mishap and condolences to their kith and kin.
</P>
<P>
The death toll in the tragedy was likely to go up as a number
of bodies were feared trapped inside the 16 derailed coaches.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 16 bogies of the two trains, three of each train had
been severely damaged and gas cutters were called into service to
extricate the bodies from the badly mangled coaches.
</P>
<P>
Among those killed was the driver of the express from Jammu,
whose body has been extricated, railway officials said.
</P>
<P>
Identification of the bodies become difficult as they were
badly mutilated. The bodies extricated so far included that of 40
men, 20 women and two children, said PTI.
</P>
<P>
Local police said that 254 injured passengers have been
hospitalized in Khanna and nearby towns.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the accident was not immediately known and a
relief train has been rushed to the spot.
</P>
<P>
Railway Ministry has ordered an investigation by the
commissioner of Railway Safety into the cause of the accident.
</P>
<P>
Official sources here said that a total of 396 train accidents
have taken place from March 1997 till now, the reasons of which
were mainly on human failure, equipment failure, sabotage,
combination of factors and incidental causes.

GENEVA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Kuala Lumpur has

Games, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said in
Lausanne, Switzerland, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The IOC said in a statement that the Malaysian Minister of
Youth and Sports Tan Sri Muhyiddin Bin Mohd Yassin on Thursday
informed the IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch that the
Malaysian capital will bid to host the 2008 summer Olympic Games.

</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Mayor Jia Qinglin of the Chinese capital Beijing
submitted the city's application to Chinese Olympic Committee
(COC) President Wu Shaozu at a ceremony in Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Italy Not to Offer Political Asylum to Ocalan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rome, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Italy cannot offer political
asylum to Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan because of the
nature of the crimes he is accused of, Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini confirmed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera,
Dini said that under the Geneva Convention on Asylum, the crimes
Ocalan is accused of "don't fall into the category of persecution."
</P>
<P>
The act of granting Ocalan political refugee status would be a
"political act" by the Italian government, he added.
</P>
<P>
Dini's remarks followed yesterday's request by left-wing
government ally for offering political asylum to Ocalan, who was
detained in Rome on November 12 on the basis of a German arrest
warrant issued in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, leader of the Kurdish Worker's Party (PKK), was charged
of committing terrorist activities in Germany. But last Friday the
German government said it would not seek Ocalan's extradition from
Rome.
</P>
<P>
The detention of Ocalan triggered a row between Italy and
Turkey after Rome refused to extradite the rebel leader to Turkey,
where he is targeted as a "separatist terrorist" for leading the
Kurdish Worker's Party in its 14-year armed struggle for a Kurdish
homeland in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
However, Italy's constitution does not allow suspects to be
extradited to countries like Turkey where the death penalty is
still in force.
</P>
<P>
Dini stressed that where to try Ocalan deserves consideration,
indicating that the Kurd leader's expulsion from Italy could only
come after he had been tried.

<HEADLINE> Pak-Indian Technical Talks on Power Export Conclude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and India concluded
their two-day technical-level discussions on the issue of power
export to India here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the course of discussions, the Pakistani delegation
indicated availability of surplus power up to 2,000 megawatt which
could be exported to India at least till the year 2010 and
possibly even beyond, said a joint press statement issued at the
conclusion of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Since transfer of this power would require detailed system
studies and setting up of a large transmission network, it was
felt that initially study should be restricted to establish
interconnection facilities which can be executed in the short term
to transmit 400-500 megawatt power to India, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that it was assessed that the transmission
lines for the purpose on the Indian and Pakistani sides could be
constructed in about six months from the date of commercial
agreement between the governments of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was agreed that the next round of discussions
would be held in New Delhi on mutually convenient dates for
consideration of an in-principle agreement on the power export
possibility identified for the short term, and subject to
conclusion of such an agreement, commercial discussions could
follow, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Export of bulk power in the long term was also discussed and
the Indian delegation suggested possible points of interconnection
in northern and western regions of India.
</P>
<P>
It was decided that various technical aspects in this regard
would be examined, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani delegation was led by Joint Secretary of the
Water and Power Ministry Syed Ibrahim Shah while the Indian
delegation was headed by Special Secretary of Ministry of Power
Shri Pradip Baijal.

WUHAN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Construction of the
Changjiangbu-Jingmen Railway commenced today in central China's
Hubei Province, following a four-year feasibility study.
</P>
<P>
The 160-km railway will serve the ongoing construction of the
Three Gorges Dam Project, the world's largest water conservancy
and hydropower project. It will link the city of Yichang, the site
of the Three Gorges Dam, to Changjiangbu, a small station on the
Beijing-Guangzhou Railway.
</P>
<P>
The railway will cut the distance from Yichang to Wuhan,
capital of Hubei, by 240 km, and will substantially improve the
transportation of materials needed for the Three Gorges
Project. The line will have an annual transportation capacity of
over 20 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The line will be completed at an estimated cost of 1.85 billion
yuan (200 million US dollars), which will be provided by the

<HEADLINE> Most Russian Ballistic Missiles Outlive Service Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 26 (Xinhua) -- More than half of Russia's
intercontinental ballistic missiles on duty have outlived their
service life, a ranking military officer said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Anatoly Perminov, chief of the Russian Strategic Missile
Force's General Staff, told the Krasnaya Zvezda newspaper that 58
percent of the missiles have outlived their service life.
</P>
<P>
"The service life of almost 70 percent of space probes, 90
percent of ground services and one third of launch systems is also
over," Perminov said.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the problem, Perminov said, the Strategic Missile
Force is taking steps to extend the missiles' lifetime as "the
most rational option in the current economic situation."
</P>
<P>
The measures are expected to allow Russia to keep over 200
additional missiles and launching pads in the force until
2005-2007, Perminov said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the difficulties, Perminov stressed, new arms, such as
the Topol-M missile system, must be commissioned.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Perminov also called for a speedy ratification of
the START II treaty on reduction of strategic nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia would benefit from the treaty for two
reasons: the degree of nuclear confrontation will drop and
spending on the maintenance of nuclear arsenals will be cut by
almost 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that implementation of START II "will give
a certain advantage to the United States if the warheads of the
sides are counted," but such advantage could be removed in the
process of deeper cuts envisioned under START III.

opening day at the Perrier Hong Kong Open Gold Championship here
on Thursday, American John Daly reminded fans and critics alike
of the talent that earned him two major championships.
</P>
<P>
He was more than satisfied with his play in the first round as
he took the prestigious Hong Kong Golf Club by storm, carding a
66, while making his professional debut here.
</P>
<P>
"Everything is going right for me. It was one of those days
when you know that everything is going to fall in place," said
Daly, winner of the PGA Championship and British Open.
</P>
<P>
The American star was unexpectedly joined by local
professional Brad Schadewitz who finished with two birdies on the
last two holes. Chinese Taipei's Wang Ter-Chang, winner of the
1992 Philippines Open, also joined them at 66 after a string of
birdies on the back nine.
</P>
<P>
Playing through light showers, 36-year-old Taipei professional
Hsieh Chin-Sheng, winner of the 1988 Hong Kong Open, jumped into
the lead, however, after the first round play at the Hong Kong
championship.
</P>
<P>
Shooting a 7-under 64, Hsieh played a consistent round,
notching three birdies on the front nine and four more on the
back nine including three in a row on the final three holes.
Hsieh, whose previous best finish this year was fifth on the
Japan PGA Tour, was able to finish two shots clear of a tight
leader board.
</P>
<P>
"I am quite familiar with the course, having played here many
times -- I simply tried to use my past experience in Hong Kong to
my advantage -- as I did in 1988 when I took the title," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ecuadorian professional Rafael Ponce held sole possession of
the fifth place, three back of the leader, recording a 67. He was
 just ahead of a tied sixth place shared by 10 professionals,
including 1996 PGA Championship winner Mark Brooks and Hong Kong
local Derek Fund.
</P>
<P>
Former Hong Kong Open champion David Frost (1994), Rodrigo
Cuello (1996) and defending champion Frank Nobilo all stayed
within striking distance, with a 1-under-par 70, six strokes
behind Hsieh. 1994 Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal was even
for the day. Ryder Cup star Costantino Rocca and Ryder Cup
captain Bernard Gallacher were both one over.
</P>
<P>
The championship will last till Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Displaced Tigers Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-five Manchurian tigers
evacuated from their natural habitat due to devastating summer
flooding in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province returned home
today.
</P>
<P>
The trip from their temporary home to the Harbin Forest Garden,
a small nature reserve some 400 meters from the Songhua River,
took eight hours.
</P>
<P>
Heavy summer flooding threatened the reserve and the tigers
were relocated to a wild animal center some 200 km distant.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the tigers used to live in the wild and were
thus uncomfortable in their temporary caged environment,"
according to Director Liu Xinchen.
</P>
<P>
Workers drained water and reconstructed the garden once the
floods receded. "It was simply time to bring the big cats
back," said Liu, adding that "all personnel pledged to ensure the
safety of the tigers during the trip."
</P>
<P>
The initial task centered on moving nine cubs born at the
animal center from big to small travel cages and then to the
transport vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Cranes were used to load the 16 adult tigers aboard nine trucks.
</P>
<P>
The convoy moved slowly along slick ice-covered road at
temperatures of 20 degrees centigrade below zero, with the tigers
arriving home safely at 18:00 this evening.
</P>
<P>
"The tigers will be under observation for 20 days before the
garden is open to the public," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
He said the 20-odd tigers remaining at the center will return
home in the near future.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urges Coordination to HIV/AIDS Epidemic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- An effective response to
the HIV/AIDS epidemic requires multi-sectoral involvement and
participation, the United Nations Theme Group on HIV/AIDS in
Ethiopia (UNAIDS Ethiopia) stresses Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a newsletter issued here to mark 1998 World AIDS Campaign,
the UNAIDS Ethiopia estimates that by the end of the year 1997,
there were 2.5 million people living with HIV in Ethiopia, while
the overall adult prevalence of HIV was estimated at 7.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The UNAIDS Ethiopia, established in 1995, noted that the
HIV/AIDS epidemic has increasingly spread among Ethiopians with
time, saying that one percent of the population was HIV infected
in 1989, three percent in 1993 and five percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
It says that the cumulative number of AIDS cases was actually
350,000 by December 1997 and about 200,000 Ethiopians aged 15-49
years got infected with HIV in 1997 alone.
</P>
<P>
"AIDS will increase the mortality among
those aged 15-49 years by 57 percent by the year 2009," it says.
</P>
<P>
It says that the mounting of an effective response to the
HIV/AIDS epidemic in Ethiopia is an essential undertaking. It
calls for allocation of adequate financial resources, retaining
well trained and experienced personnel to plan, implement and
coordinate the response at national and regional levels.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Zimbabwean President Said to Be Hiding in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Convicted former
Zimbabwean president Canaan Banana is believed to be in hiding
in Botswana, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Banana was found guilty in absentia in Zimbabwe Thursday
morning on 11 counts of sodomy, attempted sodomy and indecent
assault. He faces about two years in jail and a fine.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean high court has issued a warrant for Banana's
arrest.
</P>
<P>
Botswanan President Festus Mogae's office and the Foreign
Ministry Thursday confirmed that Banana arrived in the country
Wednesday, said the SAPA report.
</P>
<P>
"He was here yesterday, but did not report to anyone," a
government spokesman said. But he said he did not know whether
Banana was still in the country.
</P>
<P>
Botswana's Deputy Police Commissioner Edwin Batshu said Banana
now faced extradition.
</P>
<P>
He said Banana could face charges of illegal entry. His
passport has been confiscated in Zimbabwe, yet he crossed the
border into Botswana Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported in Zimbabwe that Banana was being sheltered by
Botswana Anglican Archbishop Walter Makhulu, and planned to seek
asylum.
</P>
<P>
The charges against Banana centered around offenses committed
against members of his staff in the 1980s when he was president.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Chaebols' Slow Restructuring Arouses Great Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 26 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's family-owned
conglomerates, or chaebols, are under increased harsh criticisms
as they have been dragging their feet in restructuring their
business.
</P>
<P>
Increased criticisms came from the fact that the top five
largest chaebols --Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo, LG and SK -- have
shown little progress in implementing the government-initiated
"big deal" program, under which the chaebols should reach an
agreement to merge their overlapped or redundant businesses before
the November 30 deadline.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the five conglomerates announced their
respective restructuring plans, promising to attract foreign funds
at the expense of even their properties.
</P>
<P>
Under a five-point agreement reached between the government and
the chaebols, the chaebols promised reforms to promote managerial
transparency, ban inter-subsidiary debt payment guarantees,
reduce their debt to equity ratios below 200 percent, take legal
responsibility for bad management, and to trim unprofitable units.
</P>
<P>
However, to date, the top five chaebols' debts have shown
little indication of abating and their bloated operations have not
been sufficiently slimmed down.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they continue to expand by monopolizing available
bank credit, thus blocking the flow of capital to healthy
medium-sized and small companies in the country gripped by a
financial crisis caused by corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of
financial institutions late last year.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed with the International Monetary Fund
for a rescue loan of 58 billion U.S. dollars last December, South
Korea has to open its markets and restructure its economy.
</P>
<P>
According to government statistics, some 3.5 billion
U.S. dollars worth of foreign direct investment have gone to 37
projects by October this year, but only 577 million dollars went
to the top five business groups.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung pointed out that
South Korean economy would crumble if the five giants failed to
reform themselves.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with 133 bankers and financiers, Kim said banks
must sign agreements with the chaebols to improve their balance
sheets through closure of their unprofitable subsidiary companies.
</P>
<P>
If the chaebols' reform is completed by the end of this year,
the South Korean economy will begin recovery next year, Kim
predicted.
</P>
<P>
There are also criticisms from abroad. U.S. President Bill
Clinton made comments critical of the chaebols' slower reform at a
press conference last Saturday when he was visiting Seoul.
</P>
<P>
In the past months, newspaper editorials have urged the top
chaebols to quicken their reform as public discontent with the
chaebols' reform is escalating.
</P>
<P>
"The primary blame for the chaebols' slow reform should be
placed on the chaebols themselves. Despite much talks, there have
hardly been any improvement in their outdated fleet-style
management scheme and corporate governance. What has been achieved
thus far was merely the liquidation of small and little-known
subsidiaries," an editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Some critics alleged that debts by the top five may emerge as a
stumbling block to the country's early economic recovery while
some financial analysts warned that the five conglomerates are
already ailing from cash-flow problems.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, President Kim re-appealed to the chaebols to abide by
the five-point agreement signed with his government.
</P>
<P>
"As long as I am in power, I will never slow the pace of the
ongoing reform program or give special exemptions to any chaebol,"
said the president.

<HEADLINE> Rising to Power from Scratch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's outgoing second
prime minister Hun Sen was named Wednesday night by King Norodom
Sihanouk new sole prime minister of next government after his
Cambodian People's Party (CPP) has won the multi-party election on
July 26.
</P>
<P>
The King also appointed him to form a new cabinet in alliance
with FUNCINPEC party, the second largest party led by Prince
Ranariddh who was newly elected president of the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
A son of a peasant family, Hun Sen rose to the premiership
since 1985 for nearly 13 years through a combination of his
enriched political experience, chance and strategy.
</P>
<P>
Born of a poor peasant family on April 4, 1951 in the eastern
province of Kompong Cham, Hun Sen spent his childhood in difficult
conditions, with little schooling. However, he tried to receive
education in Phnom Penh while residing in a pagoda.
</P>
<P>
He joined forces led by the Khmer Rouge during their 1970-75
guerrilla war against the US-backed Lon Nol government. Beginning
from the lowest rank, he gradually rose to commandership of a
squad, a platoon and a brigade by his own effort.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, who lost an eye in the last days of the war, split
from the Khmer Rouge and fled to Vietnam, fearing the purges in
which hundreds of cadres had already been executed.
</P>
<P>
After Vietnamese forces rolled into Phnom Penh in late 1978 and
overthrew Pol Put and his team, Hun Sen was appointed Minister of
Foreign Affairs of the new People's Republic of Kampuchea in 1979,
at that time he was only 28-year-old.
</P>
<P>
He was elected as president of the Minister Council (prime
minister) in January 1985 when he was 34 years old while retaining
his post as foreign minister, making him the youngest premier in
the world.
</P>
<P>
From 1985 until 1993, Hun Sen's acknowledged major achievements
included the prevention of the return of genocide, the political
and economic reforms, and the national reconciliation. He also
helped architect the Paris Peace Agreement on Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Following the 1993 UN-organized election, Hun Sen worked as
co-premier in a coalition government led by first-premier Prince
Norodom Ranariddh whom he ousted in July last year.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen has proven his incomparable commitment in the
reconstructing of rural roads, schools, hospitals, water wells and
ponds.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen has received many diplomas, some of which are tokens of
his studies and some are of his working experience. They are the
Master of Arts in Politics from Cambodia's Tertiary Education,
Ph.D of Philosophy from the Institute of Political Sciences in
Hanoi, and Ph.D of Law from USA and Honorary Doctorate from
Wesleyan College, the USA.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen has three sons and three daughters (one of them
adopted). Two of the sons are in the Military Academy (one in West
Point, USA, and another in Saint Cyr, France).
</P>
<P>
Although Hun Sen promised in his political platform to recover
the international credibility of his country and vowed to improve
the economy and the living standards of the people within his
five-term, he surely would face various unexpected challenges.

ISLAMABAD, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will export 3
million tons of rice in the current fiscal year starting July 1,
1998, Minister for Food and Agriculture Abdul Sattar Lalika said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press of Pakistan quoted him as saying that the
country is likely to reap more than 5 million tons of rice this

tons.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Pakistan is expected to earn around 800
million U.S. dollars from rice export this year, an increase of 45
percent over that of last year.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan also had a bumper crop of wheat this year and
at present about 2.2 million tons of wheat is available to meet
the domestic requirement.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, it is the first time in the history
of Pakistan that a sufficient stock of wheat is available and
there is absolutely no question of any shortage.

<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- China has taken important
steps to reform the existing disaster relief system by assigning
the China Disaster Relief Association (CDRA) responsibility for
handling various disaster and poverty relief donations in place of
the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The CDRA, a social organization, will act under the guidance
and supervision of the ministry and assume full responsibility for
accepting, managing and allocating funds and materials donated for
disaster or poverty relief, according to Li Bengong, director of
the ministry's Disaster Relief Department
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark today at a ceremony marking the founding of
the CDRA.
</P>
<P>
"The founding of the CDRA will add impetus to China's efforts
to adopt common international disaster relief practices," said
Civil Affairs Minister Doje Cering.
</P>
<P>
The 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
(CPC), convened in September 1997, called for a new round of
government streamlining and urged the governments at all levels to
transfer redundant functions to social organizations.
</P>
<P>
"Transferring the administration of donations to the CDRA will
enable civil affairs departments to concentrate on work related to
macro-controls and policy research," according to a senior
ministry official.

The latest statistics from the Civil Affairs Ministry show that
devastating summer flooding, the worst in decades, killed 3,656
people, destroyed over 7.3 million structures and caused direct
economic losses of some 264.2 billion yuan (30 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
China has suffered from frequent natural disasters since the
ancient times, with disasters during modern times causing average
annual losses of 50 billion yuan and adversely affecting the lives
of as many as 200 million people, according to a ministry official.
</P>
<P>
Natural disasters since the founding of New China in 1949 have
cost the Chinese government over 30 billion yuan and large amounts
of materials, including 300 billion kg of grain for disaster
relief. In addition, the government has allocated over two billion
yuan annually for various relief efforts over the past several
years.
</P>
<P>
The government has thus paid increasing attention to raising
disaster relief donations and has repeatedly called on the
country's 1.2 billion people to exhibit compassion and a spirit of
mutual assistance.
</P>
<P>
People across the nation have donated some 100 million pieces
of clothing and quilts since early August this year, in addition
to five billion yuan in funds and relief materials to
flood-devastated areas, according to the ministry.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Nations Offer More Products for Preferential Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The seven member countries
of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)
have agreed to offer another 3,500 items of products for
preferential entry among themselves with tariff concessions
ranging from 5 to 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
They reached the agreement at the third meeting of the
Inter-Governmental Group on Trade Liberalization held on November
21-23 at the Kathmandu-based SAARC Secretariat, the secretariat
said in a press release Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting concluded the third round of trade negotiations
under the SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA).
</P>
<P>
The first two rounds under the SAPTA have put 2,228 items of
products on the Consolidated National Schedules of Concessions
with tariff cuts ranging from 7.5 percent to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
The press release said that the results of the third round of
talks would take effect from the date of issuing customs
notifications by the respective SAARC member countries --
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
In another favorable development, the third meeting of the
SAPTA Committee of Participants held on November 23-24 at the
SAARC Secretariat agreed to a downward revision of the present
ratio of origin requirement for export products, the press release
said.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of products which are not wholly produced or obtained
in the territory of the exporting SAARC country but with inputs
coming from outside the SAARC region, which now stands at 50
percent, has been revised not to exceed 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The level of domestic value addition would now stand at 40
percent to qualify any product under SAPTA," the press release
said.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the rule dealing with Cumulative Rules of Origin
under the SAPTA has been revised downward from its present 60
percent to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
It said that the reports of the third meeting of the SAPTA
Committee of Participants and the third meeting of the
Inter-Governmental Group on Trade Liberalization will be
considered by the 10th meeting of the Committee on Economic
Cooperation and the 21st session of the SAARC Council of
Ministers, both scheduled to be held in Colombo, Sri Lanka in
February 1999.
</P>
<P>
The level of intra-SAARC trade flows is expected to increase
substantially with the addition of products and deepening of
tariff concessions on some products covered in the three rounds of
trade talks as well as with the relaxation in the SAPTA Rules of
Origin, the press release observed.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the intra-SAARC trade volume accounts for some 3
percent of the region's total foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC was formed in December 1985 to promote economic and
social development in the region.
</P>
<P>
It aims to establish a South Asian Free Trade Area by the year
2001, but the SAARC leaders deferred the deadline indefinitely at
their 10th summit in July.

objection to the revision before the deadline on November 17.
</P>
<P>
Under the revised convention, a new intergovernmental structure
named the TIR Executive Board will be established to monitor the
customs' administrative practices of the member states more
closely.
</P>
<P>
The original convention allowed unhindered goods transportation
around the world under customs seals. However, in recent years,
customs seals and stamps have been falsified by international
crime groups for the use of smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The newly established body will closely monitor national
administrative practices within the TIR system.
</P>
<P>
More strict criteria are to be implemented on appraising the
reliability of national associations that are authorized to issue
the TIR Carnet.
</P>
<P>
The revised convention only allows transport operators approved
not only by their national transport associations, but also by the
respective national customs authorities, to gain benefit from the
new TIR system.
</P>
<P>
The executive board will also build a new mechanism to increase
cooperation among customs authorities, the transport businesses
and the insurance groups that provide backup to the TIR.

COLOMBO, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Tamil rebels chased two of

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's Vice-Mayor Jiang
Yiren said today that Shanghai approved 18,586 overseas-funded
projects by the end of September this year, with total contractual
overseas funds of 34.19 billion U.S. dollars and 23.9 billion
dollars of them have actually been used.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held today in Beijing, Jiang
said that Shanghai is home to some 200 of the world's top 500
multinational corporations, including Volkswagen, Bell and
Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
The output value for overseas-funded businesses accounted for
37.5 percent of the city's total industrial output value for 1997,
with their export volume accounting for 42 percent of the city's
annual total, according to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He said that overseas investments have introduced advanced
technology and management expertise, and have gradually helped the
city form three high-tech industries, namely, the information
processing, bioengineering and pharmaceutical, and new materials
industries.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that tomorrow's Beijing exhibition of
achievements in use of overseas funds will be a golden opportunity
for Shanghai to exchange experience with other provinces and
cities. He added that the city's Pudong New Area will be a focus
of the Shanghai exhibit.
</P>
<P>
The Pudong New Area, designated in April 1990, has been a
pioneer in promoting the city's economy, with overseas-funded
enterprises accounting for 33.7 percent of Pudong's total in 1997
in terms of output value.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, stressed
today that establishing a comprehensive legal system is not only a
requirement for the development of a socialist market economy, but
also a prerequisite for building a socialist country ruled by
law.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a legal lecture sponsored by the Ninth NPC Standing
Committee, Li said that establishing and improving the legal
system in line with the socialist market economy must proceed in
accordance with the fact that China is still in the primary stage
of socialism.
</P>
<P>
China must learn from the positive achievements of the
international community and introduce new laws in line with
generally accepted conventions when drafting laws for the
socialist market economy. New laws must also fully consider
the practical economic and social situation in China, said Li.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China's reform and opening must progress
gradually, and laws must meet the demands of different periods of
the time.
</P>
<P>
Laws must be drafted from a farsighted point of view and
must be feasible and easily implementable in order to meet the
needs of reform, opening and development of the socialist market
economy.
</P>
<P>
Li also instructed the NPC and its Standing Committee to work
diligently to adopt and implement economic laws, and enhance the
legal awareness of the general public.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The four-day fighting between
Philippine government troops and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) in Maguindanao, Mindanao, ended Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Joselin B. Nazareno, armed forces chief of staff, told
reporters here that as of 12:00 (04:00 GMT) Thursday, fighting in
Kabingi, Datu Piang, Maguindanao, has stopped, except for sporadic
fire from a group of MILF rebels who may not have heard the call
from both sides to cease firing.
</P>
<P>
Nazareno denied earlier news reports that 15 government
soldiers were killed in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Nazareno said that it is easy to find out the number of
fatalities the military has suffered "because we bring them to the
funeral parlor."
</P>
<P>
A government army spokesman said that 23 government soldiers
were wounded and at least three MILF members were killed.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Star newspaper reported Thursday that 29 people
were killed in the fighting, including 10 civilians, and scores of
others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
The fighting erupted in the village of Kabingi after the MILF
tried to expand their controlled territory despite an existing
ceasefire agreement, Nazareno said.
</P>
<P>
But the MILF dismissed the accusation and accused the
government army of starting the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The four days of fighting have also forced 400 families to flee
from their homes to avoid being caught in the cross fire.

<HEADLINE> Health Most Important Social Issue in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Health has taken over from
crime as the most important social issue seen to be facing
Australia, figures from a survey by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics (ABS) show.
</P>
<P>
The survey of people's views on environmental issues found that
the environment rated fifth in importance - even though three in
four Australians had at least one environmental concern.
</P>
<P>
The ABS figures show 29 percent of the respondents believe
health is the most important social issue.
</P>
<P>
This was followed by crime (24 percent), education and
unemployment (both 16 percent), and environmental problems (16
percent).
</P>
<P>
In 1996, crime was seen as the most important social issue,
followed by health, education, unemployment, and then the
environment.
</P>
<P>
In the latest survey, dated March 1998, health was the most
important issue to older people but least important to people aged
35-44.
</P>
<P>
In general, younger people were more concerned about long-term
environmental problems although 18-24 year olds, as well as 45-54
year olds, were most concerned about unemployment.
</P>
<P>
But the survey said 71 percent of Australians were concerned
with at least one specific environmental problem.
</P>
<P>
The figure was up from 68 percent in 1996 but down from 75
percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Air pollution continued to be the environmental problem of
greatest worry for Australians, with 32 percent reporting it as
their major concern.
</P>
<P>
This compared wircent in 1996, 34 percent in 1994 and
40 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The next most important concern was water and ocean pollution
followed by the destruction of trees, garbage and rubbish disposal
and the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
Then came toxic chemicals and hazardous waste, the greenhouse
effect, soil erosion and salin destruction of animals and
wildlife, conservation of resources, nuclear testing, pesticides
and uranium mining.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of those surveyed believe the quality of the
environment had declined in the last decade.

<HEADLINE> Antarctic Ozone Hole Expected to Break Up: NZ Scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The ozone hole over the
Antarctic, which this year reached a record size, is expected to
break up during the next few weeks, the New Zealand Press
Association (NZPA) Thursday quoted a New Zealand scientist as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Steve Wood said satellite data showed the hole covered 27
million square kilometers at its peak last month. This was a 5
percent increase over the previous record set in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Ozone reached a near record low of 90 dobson units over the
Antarctic at the end of September, but is now back to 160. This is
still lower than the global average of 300 to 350 dobson units,
according to Wood.
</P>
<P>
The thickness of the ozone layer, which protects the earth from
 ultraviolet solar radiation, is measured in dobson units.
</P>
<P>
Wood said scientists are not overly concerned about the
increased size of the hole this year, as an unusually strong polar
vortex is responsible for the severe depletion.
</P>
<P>
The vortex is still present, but is likely to break down during
the next few weeks. The ozone-depleted air will spread over the
southern hemisphere, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lowered ozone levels mean people should take care to avoid
prolonged exposure to the sun, Wood said.

<HEADLINE> South China's Guangxi Makes Economic Strides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region in south China has seen fast expansion of its foreign trade
and economic cooperation since the country introduced the reform
and opening-up policy in 1978.
</P>
<P>
In the past two decades, the region's total imports and exports
have hit 26.3 billion U.S. dollars, with an average annual growth
rate of 13.67 percent.
</P>
<P>
The region's foreign trade volume in 1997, for instance, was
3.068 billion U.S. dollars, 11.41 times the 1978 figure, said
local sources.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi, which borders Vietnam and has a coastline of 1,595
kilometers, exports 3,000 kinds of commodities to 120 countries
and regions, including the United States, Japan, the Netherlands,
Germany, Australia and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The region's export commodity structure, which used to be
mainly primary products such as farm and sideline produce and
minerals, has been improved to include manufactured goods. In
1997, exports of industrial goods made up 81.4 percent of the
region's total as against 24.4 percent in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi, a southwest China gateway to the outside world with an
increasingly improved infrastructure, is a popular investment site
favored by domestic and overseas investors alike.
</P>
<P>
From 1985 to 1997, domestic investors pumped in 15.32 billion
yuan and financed 22,700 projects in this southern Chinese
autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-backed businesses here have been rising year after
year. By late June, the region had approved 6,738 overseas-funded
projects, with a combined contractual investment volume of 10.58
billion U.S. dollars, with the actually arrived volume of 4.7
billion dollars. The investors are from 48 countries and regions,
</P>
<P>
Guangxi's border trade reached 3.1 billion yuan in 1997 as
against 450 million yuan in 1989, up 6.87 times since 1989 when
China fully resumed border trade with Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Senior PLA Officer Stresses Army Loyalty to Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior People's Liberation
Army (PLA) officer said today that the army must maintain a high
degree of unity with the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) and the Central Military Commission (CMC) with
Jiang Zemin at the core.
</P>
<P>
"We must unswervingly hold high the banner of Deng Xiaoping
Theory and adhere to the absolute leadership of the Party over the
army," according to General Cao Gangchuan, director of the PLA
General Armament Department.
</P>
<P>
Cao made the remarks at a forum marking the 20th anniversary of
the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee which initiated
China's reform and opening drive.
</P>
<P>
China has scored great achievements in national defence
modernization and the development of military hardware under the
correct guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory and the Party's basic
line for the primary stage of socialism, said Cao, also a member
of the CMC.
</P>
<P>
Cao pointed to the necessity for PLA armaments departments to
extend greater efforts to develop new military equipment, while at
the same time improving the management of existing weapons and
armaments.
</P>
<P>
"We must strictly follow the CMC's military strategies for the
new period and extend every effort to improve our combat
capability under the conditions of modern technological warfare,
especially under conditions involving high technology," said Cao.

<HEADLINE> France Backs Establishment of Palestinian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- France has fully expressed its
support to the establishment of a Palestinian state when the interim
autonomous period of the Palestinian territories expires on May 4,
1999.
</P>
<P>
French National Assembly speaker Laurent Fabius said on Thursday
that the Palestinians should move toward the creation of an
independent state while respecting the agreements signed with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
``What should be absolutely respected are the Oslo agreements,
and the objective of the creation of a Palestinian state is fixed in
a very clean way,'' said Fabius after a meeting with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat in the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that peace is the number one objective of this
process, which should be implemented within ``the framework of
peace.''
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac said on Thursday that France and
the European Union would provide a support ``as generous as
possible'' to finance the development of a future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that only a Palestinian state can guarantee the
Palestinian engagement for the security of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived here on Thursday for a two-day visit,
Thursday declared his firm intention to establish a Palestinian
state on May 4, 1999.

<HEADLINE> South Africa to Import $50bn of Arms by 2015 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Delivery of the 29.7
billion Rand (50 billion U.S. Dollars) in arms equipment agreed
to by the South African government last week should be complete
by 2015, Deputy Defense Minister Ronnie Kasrils said in Cape Town
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A further round of negotiations was now being entered into
with the preferred suppliers from Germany, Britain, Italy and
Sweden to reach an affordable final financial package, Kasrils
told reporters at parliament.
</P>
<P>
If these negotiations were not concluded satisfactorily, the
South African government could reconsider suppliers, he said.
</P>
<P>
The South African cabinet announced last week that it was
scheduled to import four corvettes and three submarines from
Germany, four maritime helicopters and 24 trainer aircraft from
Britain, 40 light utility helicopters from Italy, and 28 fighter
aircraft from Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Kasrils reiterated that an essential element of the package
was counter-trade, involving industrial development benefits to
the South African economy and the creation of 65,000 new jobs,
and that it should also be borne in mind that existing jobs would
be retained.
</P>
<P>
He said the weapons purchases, which followed exhaustive
consultation inside and outside parliament, were meant to prevent
the defense force from virtually collapsing because of the
obsolescence of its equipment.
</P>
<P>
It was also aimed at exploiting South Africa's "unique
position internationally in the post-apartheid era," Kasrils
said.

PARIS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- President Laurent-Desire Kabila
of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRCongo) said on Thursday
that he will be in Paris to seek understanding and support from
both the host and the international community.
</P>
<P>
Kabila will attend the 20th Franco-African summit on Friday and
meet President Jacques Chirac on Saturday. This will be his first
trip to Europe since his coming to power in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
"We are here to make ourselves understood and to seek from the
international community, which is so indifferent to the aggression
Congo is suffering from, an end to this torpor," he said in an
interview with Radio France Internationale.
</P>
<P>
"We are here to say that the international frontiers of Congo
should be respected," he added.
</P>
<P>
The DRCongo has accused Rwanda and Uganda of aggression by
backing the Tutsi-led armed rebellion which broke out in June in
the eastern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out the possibility of meeting with the presidents of
Rwanda and Uganda, who will also attend the summit in Paris.
</P>
<P>
"The aggressors should quit our territory first, then we can
negotiate," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that if the international community helps DRCongo
by pressuring Rwanda and Uganda to withdraw from the country, his
country will hold general elections in April or May next year.

BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A forum was held today in the
Great Hall of the People in the center of Beijing to mark the 45th
anniversary of the founding anniversary of the All-China
Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC), the nation's largest
non-governmental business association.
</P>
<P>
Most of the organization's 1.3 million members are business
people from the non-public sector. The ACFIC now has established
branches in over 90 percent of the nation's administrative regions
above the county level.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and
also head of the United Front Work Department of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, extended congratulations
to the ACFIC at the forum.
</P>
<P>
"The ACFIC has followed a glorious road over the past 45
years," said Wang. "Our nation has reached a critical moment for
reform and development and the ACFIC should carry forward its fine
tradition and promote the healthy development of the non-public
sector."
</P>
<P>
Enterprises involving various kinds of private ownership have
emerged as a major reemployment channel for the layoffs.
</P>
<P>
Private business people used the ACFIC as a conduit to donate
over 850 million yuan (over 100 million U.S. dollars) to victims of
this year's devastating summer flooding which hit many parts of
China.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Siwei, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress
Standing Committee, and chairman of the Central Committee of the

<HEADLINE> Cypriot, Greek Leaders to Discuss Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot and Greek leaders
will meet in Athens Friday to discuss the latest developments of
the Cyprus problem including the missile issue, Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before his departure for Athens to attend the
meeting, Kasoulides said Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides will
discuss all the parameters of the Cyprus problem with Greek
leaders and if the missile issue is part of these parameters, he
will touch upon that as well.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed a deal with Russia in January 1997 to buy
anti-aircraft S-300 missiles in a bid to boost its defense
capability.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and other western countries have criticized Cyprus
for signing the deal, and Turkey has threatened to launch
pro-emptive military strikes if the missiles are deployed on the
island.
</P>
<P>
Press reports here said that the leaders of the two countries
are expected to discuss a number of solutions to the missile
issue.
</P>
<P>
"This is a regular, routine meeting to exchange views and
assessments about all the parameters of the Cyprus problem,"
Kasoulides said, adding that his personal assessment is that one
should not expect to see "either black or white smoke" at the end
of the meeting about any of the aspects of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides, who was in London for a conference on
Cyprus, flied to Athens Wednesday night for his meeting with
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis.
</P>
<P>
The foreign and defense ministers of the two countries, as
well as other officials dealing with the Cyprus problem, are
expected to be present at the Athens meeting.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation formula, but the
Turkish Cypriots opted out of the peace negotiations last year to
protest against a decision made by the European Union to begin
accession talks with Cyprus while scraping Turkey off its
immediate membership candidates list.

TIANJIN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- State Councillor Wu Yi today
urged companies throughout the nation to increase exports.
</P>
<P>
"The seriousness of the Asian financial crisis has increased
during the year and created unprecedented difficulties for China's
foreign trade activities," Wu said during an inspection tour of
this largest port city in north China.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that maintaining comparatively low export
growth over the first ten months was far from an easy task, and
called on officials and managers to work even harder through the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign trade sector will face an even more severe
situation next year because of the devaluation of currencies in
some countries affected by the crisis and various other factors,
according to Wu.
</P>
<P>
She said the government will introduce various measures to
increase exports, including encouraging private companies to
compete on the global market and helping more companies break into
the international market.
</P>
<P>
In addition, large overseas trade companies handling imports
and exports will be encouraged to establish joint ventures in
China. Wu also called for increased exports of machinery and
electronics products.

<HEADLINE> China's Auto Production Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- China had an increase in the
number of automobiles produced in October for the second
consecutive monthly rise, after a downturn from May to August.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Administration of Machinery Industry's
Automobile Industry Development Institute, China built more
than 155,000 automotives in October, an increase of 14.6 percent
over September. Sales exceeded 140,000 for the month, an increase
of 5 percent over the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The rebound meant that automobile output and sales for the past
ten months were slightly greater than for the same period of last
year. From January to October, China produced 1,330,100
automobiles, 1.24 percent more than for the same period of last
year. Sales totaled 1,287,324, an increase of 0.69 percent.
</P>
<P>
A State Administration of Machinery Industry official says that
increased investment in fixed assets over the past six months has
begun to show effects in the automobile industry.
</P>
<P>
An Automobile Industry Development Institute analyst says that
China's automobile market has fluctuated for the past several
months, with double-digit growth for the first three months of the
year, followed by a continued downward slide from April. But,
after bottoming out in July, the market improved steadily.
</P>
<P>
He said he expects demand to pick up at the end of the year and
predicts that output and sales will peak in the fourth quarter,
which will show the industry's fastest growth for the year.
</P>
<P>
Automobile production is expected to reach 437,000 in the
fourth quarter. In October, supply and demand remained basically
balanced, with an inventory of 173,000 automobiles by the end of
the month.

<HEADLINE> Lens to Appeal Vairelles' Booking with UEFA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- French club Lens said on
Thursday that they would appeal to the European soccer's
governing body UEFA on the booking of striker Tony Vairelles in a
Champions' League match.
</P>
<P>
The club planned to send video tapes of their 1-0 win over
Arsenal to UEFA in order to prove that Vairelles should not have
been sent off in the last minute.
</P>
<P>
Vairelles was shown a red card for apparently elbowing
defender Lee Dixon seconds after Arsenal's midfielder Ray Parlour
was sent off.
</P>
<P>
Lens officials said the tapes showed Dixon had faked injury.
</P>
<P>
If their appeal went unsuccessful, Vairelles would not play in
the group E decider against Dynamo Kiev next month in Lens, along
with midfielder Cyril Rool and defender Eric Sikora.

<HEADLINE> Success In China's Major Afforestation Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- An afforestation program in
northern, northwestern, and northeastern parts of China has had
some good results on more than 20 million hectares of land,
according to Wang Zhibao, director of the State Forestry Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The program, which is widely known as the Three Norths
Afforestation Project, started in 1978 and is scheduled to be
completed by 2002, with 35.33 million hectares of trees planted.
</P>
<P>
Over 500 counties in 13 provinces and ethnic minority
autonomous regions are involved. The project is expected to double
the forest coverage in these areas, which have many areas
threatened by sand and about a third of the country's eroded areas.
</P>
<P>
The project is meant to improve the environment and help local
economic development, he says, but adds that problems like
uncontrolled cultivation, illegal mining, excessive grazing, and
wasting of water still exit, and he warns that the amount of
desertified land is expanding at more than 1,700 square kilometers
a year.
</P>
<P>
There needs to be a greater effort to stop this desertification
and soil-erosion, he said, and the Three Norths Project should be
legalized.

HANOI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam expects to export one
million tons of rice in the first quarter of 1999 and 3.8-4
million tons in the whole of 1999, the Saigon Times daily reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the daily, over 500,000 tons of rice are now

A senior official said the government will allocate more of
this year's quotas to rice exporters if they receive more orders
at higher prices.
</P>
<P>
At present, the price of exported rice with 25 percent and 5

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Encourages IT Industry to Help Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian International
Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz said Thursday the
government wants the information technology (IT) industry to
develop into an export sector both in hardware and software
manufacturing to help speed up economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
"Information technology could assist to speed up economic
recovery by contributing towards higher economic growth via
enhanced productivity and efficiency," she said at the opening of
the Asian-Oceanian Computing Industry Organization (ASOCIO)
General Assembly and Symposium 1998 held in Petaling Jaya near
here.
</P>
<P>
The information technology industry must assume the catalytic
role in driving forward the growth and development processes,
Rafidah said, adding this could be achieved by strategizing for a
wider and more intensified outreach of information technology
utilization and appreciation amongst the business community and in
particular, the people at large.
</P>
<P>
The development of information technology itself as a new
growth sector will contribute significantly to the enhancement of
industrial production and workforce skills, she said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia exported IT products worth 86.37 billion ringgit
(about 22.728 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997, and between January
to September this year, exports of such products from Malaysia
reached 83.2 billion ringgit (about 21.894 billion dollars),
according to Rafidah.
</P>
<P>
The World Trade Organization (WTO) 1995 Report listed Malaysia
as the fifth largest trader in information technology products in
the world, she said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's total expenditure on information technology was
estimated at about 5.38 billion ringgit (about 1.415 billion
dollars) in 1997, compared with 4.94 billion ringgit (about 1.3
billion dollars) reported in 1996 and 3.8 billion ringgit (about 1
billion dollars) in 1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
backpedaled Thursday to close weaker, dragged lower by a softer
Japanese yen and a continuing bleak outlook for commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
The local currency traded within a tight range as world markets
slowed in anticipation of Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday in the
U.S., BNP senior strategist Clifford Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
The local unit closed at 63.78 U.S. cents from 64.25 Wednesday,
after trading between 63.70 and 64.02 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The yen's dip against the U.S. dollar had contributed to the
domestic weakening, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Also, commodities are remaining very weak and not far above
historic lows," Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
On the cross rates, the Australian dollar was buying 77.51
Japanese yen from 77.53 Wednesday and 1.0866 German marks from
1.0939.

<HEADLINE> National Agriculture Record At China's Hinton Farm  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A farm named after an American
agronomist in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province has set a
number of national agriculture records in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The 1,533-ha "William Hinton Farm" in Youyi County, 100 km from
the city of Jiamusi, has only 20 employees, but thanks to
mechanization, each of them produces at least 245,000 kg of grain a
year, and the highest is 331,000 kg. On average, each of them
feeds 800 people consuming 400 kg of grain each annually.
</P>
<P>
The farm is a model because it has sold 93 percent of its
surplus grain to the state for the last couple of years, the head
of the farm, Zhang Runliang, says.
</P>
<P>
The farm's first 62 farm machines were imported from the United
States in 1978. They were expected to last an average of eight
years, but the people at Hinton Farm have extended their use to 20
years and some are still in use.
</P>
<P>
Yang Guangduo, one of the employees, says that he finishes his
harvesting, threshing, and pulverizing of stalks with a harvester
that was imported 21 years ago.

<P>
By prolonging the service life of the farm machines, they have
saved several million yuan, Zhang says, and have also introduced
modern techniques like chemical weeding, spray irrigation, close
planting and composts in the fields.
</P>
<P>
To preserve the organic matter in the soil, they pulverize the
stalks and plow them into the soil during spring ploughing,
enriching the soil and increasing average output of grain and
beans from 168 kg to 268 kg.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the farm started issuing shares, increasing the
employees' initiative and awareness of competition. Agricultural
productivity per worker has averaged 270,000 kg over the past four
years, 12.5 percent higher than the figure 17 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Hinton Farm's experience spread to the Heilongjiang Reclamation
Area, which has 103 farms on 2 million ha of land on the Sanjiang
Plain.
</P>
<P>
Hongge Farm, China's first modernized farm, was built in 1980
with 13.5 million U.S. dollars worth of funds from Japan. Two
similar farms were built later with World Bank loans.
</P>
<P>
Now, when the Heilongjiang Reclamation Area has 100,000 kg of
grain and soy beans annually per worker, it is nothing new, thanks
to improved farm machinery.

<HEADLINE> China's Use of Overseas Investment Beneficial to Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- When the first
overseas-invested company was established in Beijing in 1980, most
Chinese had never heard the words "overseas-funded businesses."
Today, it's one of the most frequently used phrases in China.
</P>
<P>
Most of them could never have imagined what it would be like
today, that over 16,000 overseas-funded businesses are set-up each
year, and more than 28 billion U.S. dollars in overseas capitals
is used by China. Overseas-funded businesses are now everywhere,
and play an ever more important role in the development of China's
economy.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC)
says that China has approved 321,034 overseas-funded businesses
from 1979 to the end of October this year, involving contractual
560.575 billion U.S. dollars, 257.778 billion dollars of which is
actually being used. China was the world's second largest country
in direct use of overseas capitals following the United States
over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The past 20 years have seen overseas funds penetrating into
nearly every corner of the Chinese economy, first going to the
processing industry in the early 1980's, and now coming into basic
industry, infrastructure, hi-tech areas, finance, insurance,
retail and foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, these investments are adding money to
China's economic growth and increasing tax revenue and foreign
exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
1997 statistics show that overseas businesses actually
put 45.2 billion U.S. dollars into China, accounting for 14.79
percent of the nation's gross investment in fixed assests.
</P>
<P>
And overseas-funded businesses produced 18.57 percent of
China's gross value of industrial output.
</P>
<P>
Tax from overseas-funded enterprises was 99.3 billion dollars,
making up 13.16 percent of the country's total industrial and
commercial tax income, and constituting the fastest-growing tax
source every year since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Total import and export volume of overseas-funded enterprises
was 152.62 billion U.S. dollars last year, accounting for 47.3
percent of China's total import and export earnings.
</P>
<P>
Experts here point out that China's large scale use of overseas
investment has advanced the circulation and utilization of
international capital, especially idle capital from Western
countries. It also promotes the China economy deeper into the
global market, and benefits economic globalization, they said.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC Minister Shi Guangsheng said in May this year that the
active, rational and effective use of overseas capital is
long-term guideline China must follow.
</P>
<P>
China's use of overseas capital appeared to be falling a bit
this year due to the Asian financial crisis. However, as an
official from MOFTEC pointed out recently, China's growing
economy, undevaluated yuan and stable society will continue to be
essential factors attracting overseas investment. The Chinese
government is taking necessary initiatives to keep China's use of
overseas capital at a comparatively high level.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economists Pin Hopes On Mid-Term Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Economists are pinning their
hopes on a three-year mid-term restructuring of the economy and
say that if it succeeds, the country can expect to maintain its
high growth rate for another 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The Macro-Economic Research Institute of the State Development
Planning Commission recently released a report that says the
mid-term restructuring is needed because the country faces a
number of problems, including an incomplete macro-economic system,
side effects from the high growth of the past 20 years, decreasing
competitiveness of local export products, and bad bank loans and
debts, and that this is the only way out.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring goes along with reforms, and may be costly
and even slow growth, but it is needed as a long-term driving
force and for sustained growth, the Institute's report says. It
predicts that growth can be held at 7 to 8 percent during the
three-year restructuring period and after that, will remain at 8
to 9 percent for another decade or even longer.
</P>
<P>
The huge potential growth in consumer demand is one thing
making high growth possible.

BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The water table in many areas
around Beijing that has fallen is on the rebound this year,
according to the Beijing Geological Engineering Institute.
</P>
<P>
Water table levels in the plains around Beijing had risen by as
much as a meter by September, from the same time last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that increased amounts of precipitation this year
improved subterranean water supplies.

According to the Beijing Meteorology Bureau, average rainfall
in Beijing was about 528 mm from June to September of this year,
up 217 mm from the same period of last year.
</P>

However, it will still be very difficult to reverse the
downward trend in the water table in recent years, because of

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- China has further increased
the reliability of its 100-megawatt-plus generators since 1993,
according to a senior China State Power Corporation official.
</P>
<P>
The country's total installed generating capacity is now
300,000 megawatts, almost 58.7 percent of which comes from large
generators of 100 megawatts or more.
</P>
<P>
This reflects rapid growth in China's power sector, he says,
explaining that the country has introduced a more reliable
administration system to solve problems of quality.
</P>
<P>
With this system, construction units and equipment
manufacturers work together on installation and trial operations
of large-size generating units, and pool their skills to try to
pinpoint any defects that might lead to accidents.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Hit 12-Year Lows on U.S. Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Oil prices Wednesday
plunged to new 12-year lows on the New York Mercantile Exchange
(NYMEX) as investors awaited announcement from the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Prices for West Texas Intermediate crude oil at NYMEX for
January delivery closed 26 cents lower at 11.86 U.S. dollars a
barrel, but prices earlier in the session fell as low as 11.63
dollars a barrel, just below the 12-year low of 11.65 dollars a
barrel seen in June.
</P>
<P>
December heating oil fell 0.9 cent to 33.10 cents a gallon;
December unleaded gasoline fell 0.31 cent to 34.98 cents a gallon;
December natural gas fell 5.9 cents to 2.09 dollars for each 1,000
cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
OPEC, facing declining prices amid a global economic crisis
that reduced demand, adjourned Wednesday without an announcement,
thus sending crude oil prices down to new 12-year lows in the
earlier session.
</P>
<P>
Futures prices later climbed on NYMEX amid a report that OPEC
had agreed to extend the current cuts of production into 1999,
with another meeting planned for March to reassess the situation.
</P>
<P>
Even if OPEC were to agree to keep output at current levels,
analysts say there is still too much oil being pumped to cause
prices to rise appreciably.
</P>
<P>
Market participants say OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, the world's
largest oil producer, must make even deeper production cuts to
tighten supply, since demand is unlikely to rise sharply in the
coming months.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The second regional branch
of the central bank, the People's Bank of China Guangzhou Branch,
opened in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong Province, today.
</P>
<P>
The first regional branch of the central bank was opened in
Shanghai, China's largest trade and financial city, several days ago.
</P>
<P>
The PBOC Guangzhou Branch will replace the former offices of the
central bank in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and Guangdong
and Hainan provinces, which will continue their duty until the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
From the beginning of next year, the Guangzhou Branch will
start exercising the functions of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony today, Dai Xianglong, governor

<HEADLINE> 2 Israeli Soldiers Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers were
killed Wednesday night in a roadside bombing in south Lebanon,
bringing to 20 the number of Israeli soldiers killed there since
the beginning of the year, the Israeli army announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The bomb exploded when the soldiers were on a night
patrol several hundred meters away from their outpost, Israeli
radio reports said.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or the Party of God, has claimed responsibility for
the attack.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time in less than two weeks that Israeli
soldiers were killed by roadside bombs planted by the Hezbollah
guerrillas, who were fighting to oust Israeli troops out of
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Three soldiers were killed and four others injured early last
week in a bombardment just 30 meters from their outpost.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been mounting in the Israel's self-declared
security zone in south Lebanon over the last few weeks. Israeli
military helicopters have repeatedly struck at Hezbollah bases and
Hezbollah guerrillas fired mortars or missiles at Israeli outposts
in return.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli soldiers remain in hospital in serious conditions
after they were wounded in a heavy exchange of fire with
Hezbollah guerrillas Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the recent heavy casualties would heat up
again a public debate over whether Israeli troops should continue
to stay in the security zone.
</P>
<P>
The 15-kilometer-deep border buffer was set up by Israel in
1985 with the aim of protecting northern Israel from cross-border
guerrilla attacks, but the area itself has become a site of
frequent roadside bombs, rocket attacks and fierce ground clashes.
</P>
<P>
In April, Israeli inner Cabinet adopted the U.N. Resolution
425, passed in March 1978 by U.N. Security Council, which calls for
Israeli unilateral withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, Lebanon and its main ally Syria have rejected Israel's
call for taking security control over south Lebanon and assuming
responsibility for the safety of Israel's northern border.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The prospects of Cambodia
being accepted into ASEAN have been brightened by the decision of
the two main factions of Cambodia to form a coalition government,
Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah expressed support for any move towards ending the
political crisis in Cambodia and said the situation there now was
"getting better."

</P>
<P>
The Malaysian foreign minister said he would await steps taken
by Singapore Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar as chairman of the

Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said at the APEC leaders meeting here last week, ASEAN
leaders in the Asia-Pacific grouping discussed the possibility of

Once the ministers completed their evaluation and confirmed the
formation of the government in accordance with Cambodia's
constitution, its admission could be considered at next month's
summit, Abdullah added.

<HEADLINE> Improving Research Environment For Young Chinese Scientists (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS) will start a series of reforms in a bid to provide
a better research environment for young scientists.
</P>
<P>
The Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, which has been called
a "hotbed in east Asia" by the U.S.'s "Science" Magazine, has been
designated as a pilot institute for the reforms.
</P>
<P>
The plan is to invite more young scientists from China and
overseas to improve its basic scientific studies and ability to
develop advanced technology, according to Deng Maicun, the
institute's director.
</P>
<P>
Deng and his colleagues are changing management methods of
research projects, employees, and distribution of bonuses.
</P>
<P>
The reforms may even help them produce a Nobel Price winner,
CAS's vice-president Yan Yixun says.
</P>
<P>
Xie Jinchun, 35, is one of ten-some young scientists who have
returned to China to work at the institute. He graduated from
Stanford University with a Ph.D. and returned in 1995 in response
to a special program for young scientists, and took the place of a
senior academic and became deputy-director of a major state lab.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the central government's policies, Xie has made more
than 3.4 million yuan (410,000 U.S. dollars) for his projects in
basic and applied sciences.
</P>
<P>
"Working for my own country fills me with a sense of belonging
and a vision of the future," Xie says, and he hopes that the bonus
system can help scientists get more material rewards for their
work and can keep his staff delighted.

</P>
<P>
She said in Parliament that for a start, the project would
focus on hospitals in the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) which is
designed specially for hi-tech development and services.
</P>
<P>
She said telemedicine would be expanded to cover hospitals in
rural areas as well but this would depend on the allocation

According to Deng Maichun, director of the Dalian Institute of
Chemical Physics, the reforms are expected to raise annual
salaries of major research fellows to well above 40,000 yuan
(4,830 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The CAS has allocated 75 million yuan (9.06 million US dollars)
for the Dalian reform project, Deng says, and 1999 will be a
crucial year for it. It will be backed by a board of directors,
specialist committee, and new logistics system.
</P>
<P>
Most of the reform measures were worked out by learning from
experience and practice in Western countries which will definitely
benefit young scientists, the returned scientists in particular,
said Yan Yixun.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Xie will compete with a dozen scientists with similar
backgrounds for the position of director of the research section
of the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics. But he is confident
about getting the position and says he plans to use five to ten
years to improve his team's research capacity up to the advanced
world level.
</P>
<P>
"It is far from enough to create an environment that could
possibly produce a Nobel Winner by adjusting the internal
mechanism in an institute," said Xie. "And it requires both the
effort and support of the whole country."

<HEADLINE> Visiting Chinese President Meets Old Japanese Friends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 26 (Xinhua)-- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin met here Thursday morning old Japanese friends who made
contributions to the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations and
the signing of the China-Japan Peace and Friendship Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Jiang quoted former Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai as saying that
people should not forget the well digger while they drink water
from it. "That's why I have this meeting with you," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"You are all the witness of history. Today's friendship between
China and Japan is hard won. It is the fruit of the arduous and
positive efforts of you and your predecessors," said Jiang, adding
that both Chinese and Japanese people will not forget about it.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he is especially happy to see the offsprings of some
of the old friends. "From you, we can see that we have also got
offsprings to promote the bilateral friendship," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the Sino-Japanese friendship will be passed
on from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the Japanese friends present at the
meeting, former Chief Cabinet Secretary Susumu Nikaido said it is
very important for Japan to review its history when walking toward
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Nikaido, who visited China dozens of times, said that Japan and
China should strengthen contacts at all levels, to deepen
understanding of each other and to develop a full relationship in
all fields.
</P>
<P>
Former Foreign Minister Zentaro Kosaka said that the friendship
between Japan and China should keep flowing as the Yellow
River. He promised that he will continue his efforts to promote it.
</P>
<P>
Son of former Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe said that his
fatherly generation has made contributions to the bilateral
relationship, which should be held on today. And the younger
generation, he said, should look to the future on the basis of
recognizing the history with a correct attitude.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the younger generation of the two countries
should make joint efforts to boost the peace and development of
Asia and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
Tenkoko Sonoda, widow of former Foreign Minister Nao Sonoda,
said that to bring up a generation for promoting the bilateral
friendship, Japan should teach them with a correct view on
history, so that they could have a proper perceptive of the period
of the unfortunate history in the bilateral relationship.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who agreed with what they said, said that only through a
correct recognition of history can people look into the future.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the meeting were Yasuo Fukuda, son of former
Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda, and Hiroyuki Sonoda, son of Nao
Sonoda.

BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Garbage is also taking on a
modern form in Guangzhou, capital of South China's Guangdong
Province, along with the city's accelerated economic development,
reported the China Information News recently.
</P>
<P>
This booming city's garbage has become filled with plastic
bags, boxes and other products in the past ten years, displacing
the ashes and dust that were generated in years past, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
Ashes and dust were reduced to 146 tons a day last year from
1,556 tons a day in 1987, while plastic garbage, 70 percent of
which is in the form of bags and food boxes, rose from 11 tons
a day to 755 tons a day last year.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper praised the decrease of ashes and dust as social
progress, but blamed the plastic garbage as a source of public

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Limits Foreign Borrowing to 3.5 Pc of GDP Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's National Assembly has
approved severe cuts in the government's administrative budget and
limited foreign borrowing to 3.5 percent of GDP next year, the
Vietnam News reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The assembly also asked organizations receiving budgetary
allocations to save as much as ten percent of them to mitigate the
severe impacts caused by the current regional crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a significant socio-economic move, the assembly approved
higher investment next year for agriculture and rural development,
hunger eradication and poverty alleviation, education, public
health care and scientific research development.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Nguyen Sinh Hung told the National Assembly
Wednesday that administrative costs would be cut to 90 percent of
what had been spent this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the most severe cut, between 30 percent and 70 percent,
would be made in the purchase of office equipment and the
spending on seminars and conferences.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister said that budgetary collection next year
was expected to increase by 2.2 percent over this year, but tax
collection would drop by 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hung explained the fall in tax collection by saying that the
government wanted to allow domestic businesses to retain up to 2
trillion VN Dong (about 142 million U.S. dollars) of their tax
dues to re-invest in their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
The government would raise up to 13 trillion VN Dong (about 10
billion dollars) from foreign sources and the sale of treasury
bonds limiting total foreign borrowings to 3.5 percent of GDP
next year, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He identified official development assistance (ODA) as one of
the main sources of foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
Hung said this level of borrowing was much lower than the five
percent limit that marks a country's finances as being sound.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's government was planning more incentives to encourage
people to buy treasury bonds, the minister said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is importing at least
64 tanks through the Tanzanian port of Dar-es-Salaam to reinforce
its military capacity, New Vision daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, Ugandan State Minister of Defense Steven Kavuma told
Xinhua in a telephone interview that he could not make comments
on the issue and would like to talk about it later on.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted one port official as saying Wednesday that a
total of 90 tanks bound for Uganda had been unloaded.
</P>
<P>
According to a copy of the ship's manifest, the tanks are
ordered by Uganda's Ministry of Defense, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Another report said the allied forces in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) had downed a rebel plane, thus starting
their long-awaited offensive against the rebels in eastern DRC.
</P>
<P>
Kavuma said this week that Ugandan forces deployed in eastern
DRC are to guard the security of their borders there and that
they would surely fight back if attacked from any side.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has been accused of backing the rebels there and of

<HEADLINE> Negative Growth Estimated for Zambia's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's real economic growth
in 1998 is estimated to be at least minus two percent from last
year's 3.5 percent, reducing the per capita income by some five
percent.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Finance Minister Godfrey Simasiku said here Tuesday
night that the country's envisaged four percent gross domestic
product (GDP) was impossible as various negative factors had led
to a failure to achieve macro-economic targets set at the
beginning of the year, Zambia Daily Mail reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Many of the problems that emerged in the course of the year
have not been eased or resolved. As a result, the achievement of
even the revised macro-economic objectives for this year is not
possible," said Simasiku.
</P>
<P>
The growth target in the national budget was 5.5 percent and
was revised to four percent at mid-year. Inflation which now
stands around 27 percent was expected to be brought down to nine
percent, then revised to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Simasiku reiterated that this had been triggered by the
failure to privatize major assets of Zambia Consolidated Copper
Mines (ZCCM), low copper production and prices as well as donor
postponement of balance of payment.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that the country's economy would be adversely
affected by the El Nino atmospheric conditions and the continuing
financial crisis in the Far East and former Soviet block
countries which depressed the prices of Zambia's metal products
and non-traditional exports.
</P>
<P>
Nontheless, the deputy minister hoped the adverse course of
macro-economic indicators could be turned around after the sale
of ZCCM's major assets, leading to a positive GDP, reduced
inflation, increased external reserves and exports, and reduced
poverty.
</P>
<P>
But earlier in the week, Finance Minister Edith Nawakwi said
she did not envisage any growth in 1999 as there would be no
difference from the 1998 economic stumbling blocks.

<HEADLINE> Visiting Chinese President Meets Former Japanese PMs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 26 (Xinhua)-- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here Thursday that China and Japan should make joint
efforts to bring a healthy, stable and constantly developing
bilateral relationship into the next century.
</P>
<P>
At a breakfast meeting with six former Japanese prime
ministers, Jiang said that the two countries should enhance
bilateral ties on the basis of adhering to the principles of the
Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and the China-Japan Peace and
Friendship Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Former Japanese Prime Ministers Yasuhiro Nakasone, Noboru
Takeshita, Toshiki Kaifu, Tsutomu Hata, Tomiichi Murayama and
Ryutaro Hashimoto were present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Lessons learned from the past can guide one in the future,
Jiang said, adding that past experiences of the two countries
proved that recognizing history with a correct attitude is the
most important step for the realization of Sino-Japanese
friendship from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
The former Japanese leaders agreed with Jiang's opinion.
</P>
<P>
Noting that he agrees with an old Chinese saying that past
experiences should be remembered and serve as a guide for the
future, Murayama said correctly recognizing history serves as a
basis for the two countries to establish mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
Nakasone said that on behalf of the Japanese government,
Murayama expressed remorse and apology in 1995 for Japan's past
war against China. "His remarks represent our common idea," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Nakasone voiced the hope that the peaceful and cooperative
bilateral ties oriented toward the 21st century could be
established on the basis of this common understanding.
</P>
<P>
Jiang praised and thanked the six former prime ministers for
making great contributions to the development of Sino-Japanese
relations when they were in and out of office.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that it is necessary to nurture more successors to
the older generation that has been committed to promoting
Sino-Japanese friendship.
</P>
<P>
To achieve a long-term Sino-Japanese friendship, the two
countries should boost exchanges between young people, Jiang
said. He hoped that the former Japanese prime ministers could
play a more active role in promoting such exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived here on Wednesday for a six-day state visit to
Japan.

LOS ANGELES, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Five workers were killed
and one missing when an explosion tore through an oil refinery in
U.S. west coast on Wednesday, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred at about 1:30 p.m. local time in the

and the cause was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
Steve Valandra, a spokesman for the state Department of Labor

<P>
Witnesses said a fireball from the explosion was visible from
several miles away and a sound was heard like sonic boom.

ANKARA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sabah (Morning)
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said Wednesday evening
that he would hold talks with leaders of the parliamentary parties
to form a new government as the Mesut Yilmaz government failed to
survive a confidence vote.
</P>
<P>
Under the Turkish Constitution, the president will have to
appoint a care-taker government if the new government can not be
formed within 45 days.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom)
</P>
<P>
-- After the collapse of the Yilmaz government in a confidence
vote Wednesday, True Path Party (DYP) Chairwoman Tansu Ciller made
a phone call to Recai Kutan, leader of the Virtue Party (FP),
saying that their two parties should form a new government.
</P>
<P>
The DYP, the third largest party in the parliament, was a
junior partner of then coalition government headed by former
Welfare Party, a predecessor of the FP.
</P>
<P>
Radikal (Radical)
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan said
Wednesday that the Turco-Italian ties would be greatly undermined
if the Italian government gives political asylum to Abdullah
Ocalan, leader of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Italy refused to extradite Ocalan to Ankara because its
constitution bars the handing over of suspects to countries which
have the death penalty. Capital punishment is legal in Turkey but
has not been carried out since 1984.

<HEADLINE> Deng Theory Popular Among College Students in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Colleges students in China
are learning in high spirits Deng Xiaoping Theory through practice.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100,000 colleges students from 49 colleges and
universities in Guangdong, a pioneer province of reform, have taken
part in various social events this year.
</P>
<P>
About one-third of all students on these campuses became
voluntary members of societies or groups studying Deng Theory.
</P>
<P>
Selections From Deng Xiaoping (Volume III) and Deng Xiaoping
Theory became the first choices among teachers and students in
Guangdong who attended a reading contest for colleges across the
province.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong, one of the most economically vitalized areas in
China, was the pilot province for China's reform and opening up
drive two decades ago. Late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, known as
the architect of China's reform, began his architecture in this
southern province by setting up four special economic zones there.
</P>
<P>
Students from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and
Macao, and foreign students in Guangdong are also interested in
learning Deng Theory, and many of them take part in research
groups organized by departments and universities.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Shanghai say that more than 22,000 students from
31 colleges and universities in the municipality are members of
Deng Theory societies.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Seafood Breeders Raising More Balloonfish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Breeding balloonfish, an
edible variety but known for the lethal poison in its internal
organs, has become a favorite among seafood cultivators in coastal
Chinese provinces.
</P>
<P>
In Hebei, Shandong, Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, many local
breeders have abandoned the cultivation of prawns and exchanged
their prawn farms for balloonfish ponds in the hope of making more
money.
</P>
<P>
Balloonfish, with spindle-shaped bodies, have lethal poison in
their liver, brain, ovary and skin. However, their meat is quite a
tasty food to most Asian people.
</P>
<P>
But marine and aquatic products experts in the port city of
Qinhuangdao in Hebei Province caution that people not eat
balloonfish unless they are cooked by specially trained chefs.
</P>
<P>
At present, most balloonfish bred in China are exported to
Japan and South Korea.

</P>
<P>
Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) will reduce its base rate from
25.5 percent to 23 percent with effect from December 1, 1998, the
East African Standard newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
CFC Bank's lending rate is down to 21.5 percent while Stanbic

<HEADLINE> Australia Launches Greenhouse Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Households will be taught to
identify and reduce greenhouse gas emissions as part of the
national greenhouse strategy released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The strategy follows last year's Kyoto Conference which set
international targets for emissions reductions and review of the
1992 National Greenhouse Response Strategy.
</P>
<P>
Much of the strategy is based on initiatives already planned or
being undertaken by the government.
</P>
<P>
Its goals include limiting net greenhouse emissions to meet
international commitments, fostering understanding of greenhouse
issues and laying the foundation for climate change.
</P>
<P>
The strategy was jointly released by Environment Minister
Robert Hill and Industry Minister Nick Minchin.
</P>
<P>
Key measures include further research on the carbon storage
capacity of vegetation and strategies to help governments and
households identify and reduce greenhouse emission activities.
</P>
<P>
The strategy will also target energy suppliers, with standards
for power generation aimed to improve efficiency in the use of
fossil fuels.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government also wants to see the
proportion of energy from renewable resources increased.
</P>
<P>
Energy efficiency standards for houses will be strengthened and
the strategy also seeks to encourage more plantations to absorb
carbon emissions.
</P>
<P>
Work will also be undertaken to reduce waste at landfills and
manage synthetic gases.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Set up Gemstone Auction Floor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will set up a gemstone
auction floor later this year in Kitwe in the north of the
country to promote the sale of gemstones from small scale miners,
according to the latest Zambia Investor.
</P>
<P>
The magazine published by Zambia Investment Center quoted
George Shawa, general secretary of Emerald and Semi-Precious
Miners Association of Zambia, as saying that total cost for the
floor, the first of its kind in the country, is estimated to be
25 million Kwacha (about 20,000 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Both local and foreign investors are expected to have their
stones graded by experts to be based on the center, he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently the stones being mined in Zambia are not graded for
quality and being sold on the basis of seller-buyer agreements.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of the auction floor will enable Zambia to
export quality stones and equally earn accordingly from them," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The center will accommodate a data bank which will provide the
Zambian gemstone dealers with information on the changing trends
in the industry.
</P>
<P>
He said the lack of equipment for deep mining and lapidaries
to cut and polish the stones are some of the biggest handicaps.
</P>
<P>
"The gemstone industry has great potential to grow into a
major contributor to Zambia's economy but for lack of resources
by most operators," Shawa said.

BEIRUT, November 26 (Xinhua) -- One Israeli army officer
was killed and another soldier wounded Wednesday night in south
Lebanon in a roadside bombing, reported the Orient radio Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted security sources as saying that the incident
occurred when an Israeli armored patrol passed by near Markab
village inside the Israeli security zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, later claimed
responsibility for the attack, saying that its operation killed
or wounded all Israeli soldiers it targeted.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli reinforcements and ambulance cars arrived at the
site and rushed the wounded to hospital in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli artillery troops retaliated the attack by blasting
large areas inside and outside the security zone, while its
warplanes flew low over Lebanon's southern town of Nabatieh, just
north of the zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out the self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its northern
towns and villages from cross-border attacks by Lebanese
guerqBJ y gu
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been continuing in the south.

year, representing nearly 75 percent of the total 40.2 billion
dollars in premiums sold through bank channels this year.
</P>
<P>
This year's volume is the continued dominance of insurance
products that are complementary to banks' core businesses in
retirement and asset management, Datamonitor said.
</P>
<P>
Banks have broken into the insurance market in the United
States, a competitive arena, by selling products that are simple
enough to be sold by existing teams of customer
representatives. When the insurance products are more complicated
and demand more expertise from sales representatives, banks have
often resorted to the services of third party marketers.
</P>
<P>
Datamonitor's study predicts a marked increase in banks'
involvement in new insurance areas that offer appealing synergies,
such as personal property and casualty. This may ultimately rival
and even surpass mainstay bank insurance products such as credit
life.
</P>
<P>
Datamonitor research indicates that the top 50 banks in the
United States, led by BankAmerica, Chase, Citibank, First Union
and Norwest, took in 2.4 billion dollars in revenue from insurance
activities, or roughly 70 percent of the 3.3 billion dollars in
total bank insurance revenues in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Seek Balanced Trade with S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Trade Minister Joseph
Kamotho is pondering higher tariffs and import quotas to help
redress a run-away trade imbalance with South Africa, a national
newspaper resported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Kenya annually imports goods worth 20 billion Shillings (some
340 million U.S Dollars) from S. Africa, which buys goods worth
one billion Shillings (17 million Dollars) from us. The gap is so
large that it is raising concern here," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We are an open market and goods enter Kenya without any
restrictions. South Africa is a closed market and is yet to be
fully liberalized. They are still applying all kinds of
restrictions on imports," Kamotho said, adding it is not fair.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan and South African officials were working on a bilateral
trade protocol to enhance fair trade, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Citing two cases which have irritated Kenyans, the minister
said, South Africa levied a 10 percent special tax on soda ash
from Kenya, making it more expensive than soda ash from Botswana.
</P>
<P>
Another dispute was that South Africa had sought to bar Kenya
Breweries from launching its Tusker brands into the South African
market when South African Breweries operated a brewery for its
Castle brands in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The dispute is pending before South African courts.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are also restrictions on Kenyan wine,
according to the minister.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Records Annual Surplus in Current Account </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Government
recorded a 2,658 million NZ dollar (1,435 million U.S. dollar)
surplus
(referred to as savings) in the current account in the year to
June 1998,
according to figures released Thursday by Statistics New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
This was its fifth consecutive annual surplus and was 131
million NZ
dollars (70.5 million U.S. dollars) higher than for the previous
year,
when a surplus of 2,527 million NZ dollars (1,364.5 million U.S.
dollars)
was registered. But the figure was 1,741 million NZ dollars (940
million
U.S. dollars) lower than that recorded in the year to June 1996.
</P>
<P>
Total current income for the year to June 1998 was 33,866
million NZ
dollars (1,828.7 million U.S. dollars), an increase of 451 million
 NZ
dollars (243.5 million U.S. dollars) or 1.3 percent over the
previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Taxation revenue made the most significant contribution to the

increase, up 977 million NZ dollars (527.6 million U.S. dollars).
This
was partly offset by a decrease in dividends and profits received,
down
532 million NZ dollars (287.3 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Direct taxation revenue grew by 770 million NZ dollars (415.8
million
U.S. dollars) from 20,151 million NZ dollars (10,881.5 million
U.S.
dollars) in the year to June 1997 to 20,921 million NZ dollars
(11,297.3
million U.S. dollars) in the year to June 1998. The rise in
company
taxes and taxes on individuals was offset by a 60 million NZ
dollar
(32.4 million U.S. dollar) decrease in withholding taxes.
</P>
<P>
Current expenditure increased by one percent or 320 million NZ
dollars
(172.8 million U.S. dollars) from 30,888 million NZ dollars
(16,679.5
million U.S. dollars) in the year to June 1997 to 31,208 million
NZ
dollars (16,852.3 million U.S. dollars) in the year to June 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the year to June 1998 debt servicing or interest paid
decreased 419
million NZ dollars (226.3 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Wellingtonians Among the World's Honest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Wellington people are among
the
most honest in the world, The Dominion reported Thursday while
quoting
Reader's Digest magazine.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based daily said that Ms Eleni Yiasoumi helped
prove
it when she returned a "lost" wallet.
</P>
<P>
Ms Yiasoumi had come into the downtown to pay some outstanding
bills
when she found the wallet, with 50 New Zealand dollars inside.
</P>
<P>
She said she was "absolutely broke" but was not tempted to keep
the
wallet. She handed the wallet and contents to police and spent
several
hours trying to contact the owner.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever owns the wallet has a right to get it back," she said.
</P>
<P>
But the wallet had not been lost by an absent-minded local: it
had
been strategically dropped by pollsters commissioned by Reader's
Digest
magazine.
</P>
<P>
In a real-life test of integrity, pollsters dropped cash-filled

wallets in cities all around the world. Of the 10 wallets dropped
in
Wellington, only one was not returned.
</P>
<P>
The test showed Wellingtonians to be more honest than the
citizens of
Auckland, the largest city in New Zealand, and or Christchurch,
the
biggest city in New Zealand's South Island, which both scored
eight out
of 10, and well ahead of Sydney which scored four.
</P>
<P>
Only Norwegian capital Oslo and Denmark's Odense bettered
Wellington,
each achieving a 100 percent return rate.
</P>
<P>
Other results from the survey showed that women were more
honest than
men, and young people more honest than their elders.
</P>
<P>
But that failed to help much in answering the single remaining
question: who was the one Wellingtonian who held on to a wallet
and
spoiled a 100 percent record? the newspaper asked.

<HEADLINE> Arson Suspect Identified in Wellington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A man has been named in
court as a suspect in a six-week spate of Wellington fires, the
Evening Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old man, Jason Malcolm Myhill, has pleaded guilty
to wilfully setting fire to a farm shed in Upper Hutt, a district
under Wellington administration, the Wellington-based newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
Myhill, unemployed, appeared in the Upper Hull District Court
Thursday and is remanded in custody.
</P>
<P>
Prosecuting sergeant Roger Wasson was quoted as saying Myhill
is considered a suspect for a spate of suspicious fires in
Wellington.
</P>
<P>
Detectives have spoken to Myhill about the Wellington fires,
but no charges have been laid, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
On November 7 Myhill became frustrated when friends he went to
visit in Upper Hutt were not home. To vent his frustration he set
fire to an old farm house. He ripped up paper and set it alight.
He then waited to see the fire take hold and left. He went to
visit another friend who was not home, heard the fire engine
sirens and returned to the scene of the fire to watch
firefighters.
</P>
<P>
Police became suspicious and he was taken to the Upper Hutt
police station for questioning. He initially denied being involved
but later admitted it.
</P>
<P>
The Evening Post quoted Myhill's lawyer Phyllis Strachan as
saying that a psychiatric report has revealed Myhill has low
intelligence and is not easily able to understand matters,
although he is seen to be fit to plead.

<HEADLINE> Building Boost in New Zealand Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Falling interest rates in
New
Zealand are expected to give a much needed boost to the
residential
building market next year, according to an ABN AMRO Housing Market

Outlook issued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Market Outlook said house sales has started to recover on
the
back of lower interest rates, and an increase in residential
building
consents is likely to follow in another four to five months.
</P>
<P>
The number of residential building consents issued by local
bodies in
New Zealand has been dropping since October last year, reflecting
a lack
of confidence in the future. The latest figures from September
showed
consents had increased marginally, but were still about a third
below
last year's levels, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The fall in interest rates should produce up to a 20 percent
increase in the number of residential building consents by mid
next
year," it said.
</P>
<P>
House sales recorded by the New Zealand Real Estate Institute
increased by 38 percent from June to October, it added.
</P>
<P>
The increase in house sales occurred despite a weak labor
market and
a falling migration, it said, adding an expected economic recovery
would
further boost the housing market late next year.

WASHINGTON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A cocktail waitress who
had sued NBA star Dennis Rodman a civil lawsuit early this month
filed a criminal complaint against him.
</P>
<P>
Susan Patterson filed the complaint at the Los Angeles County
Sheriff Department's West Hollywood station Tuesday, according to
Patterson's lawyer today.
</P>
<P>
Patterson claimed Rodman jammed a 100 dollars bill down her
blouse and grabbed her breast on October 3 while she was working
at the Fenix in the Argyle Hotel in West Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
But Rodman's lawyer Richard Howell said: "We view this as
being a tactical effort on Ms. Patterson's part to recover money
in the already pending frivolous civil lawsuit. We have every
confidence these allegations will be investigated and immediately
dismissed."
</P>
<P>
The suit sought general, punitive and exemplary damages to be
determined at trial. It said Rodman has committed several similar
assaults in Nevada and Utah.

NEW DELHI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- At least 108 people were
killed and more than 250 others injured early Thursday morning in
one of the worst train disasters as a south-bound express train
rammed into three derailed coaches near Khanna in Ludhiana
district of Punjab state.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported from the spot that
three bogies of the a express train named Frontier Mail from

with a result that the engine and seven bogies of the train
derailed and six more bogies of the Frontier Mail also went off
the rails, said railway officials in the area.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nepal, Bhutan to Resume Ministerial Talks on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Nepal and Bhutan have agreed
to hold a new round of ministerial talks on the refugee issue in
Kathmandu in January 1999, Nepali Home Minister Govind Raj Joshi
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The talks will concentrate on repatriation of the Bhutanese
refugees, we hope to reach concrete solutions after the Kathmandu
talks," the minister told the press at the airport upon arrival
from a three-day visit to Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
He said that Bhutanese King Jigme Singye Wangchuck, Chairman of
the Council of Ministers Jigme Y. Thinley and other senior
government officials met with the six-member Nepalese delegation.
</P>
<P>
"The visit has been able to clear the misunderstanding so far
existing between us," he said. "We have found some changing
attitude on the Bhutanese side."
</P>
<P>
The seventh round of ministerial talks between the two
Himalayan kingdoms broke down in Kathmandu in April 1996 when the
two sides disagreed on the verification of the refugee categories.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Bhutanese refugees are staying in eight U.N.-run
camps in eastern Nepal after being forced to flee Bhutan in 1989
and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Bhutan said that it would take back only those of genuine
Bhutanese origin while Nepal had declared them as stateless
people.
</P>
<P>
Minister Joshi said that his country will not seek the
involvement of India in the issue since it is purely a bilateral
issue.
</P>
<P>
"It's bilateral issue between two small neighbors. We want to
demonstrate to other countries that we're capable of solving the
problem by ourselves," he added.
</P>
<P>
Nepal had sought India's help in resolving the long-standing
Bhutanese refugee issue. But India, which handles Bhutan's defense
and foreign affairs, refused.

HARBIN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Divers can now easily cut steel
cable 300 meters under water with the help of a newly developed
underwater system.
</P>
<P>
The system, first of the kind in China, enables divers to cut
metal or dismantle drilling equipment in deep water without
carrying along tools such as iron pincers, planks and drilling
machines as they have had to do in the past.
</P>
<P>
This new system, developed by the Marine Intelligence Machinery
Research Center attached to Harbin Engineering University,
includes a hydraulic power and control system, cable winches and
all necessary tools.
</P>
<P>
Meng Qingxin, head of the research center, said the system can
also cut off power automatically in less than a second in cases of
electrical emergencies.
</P>
<P>
The professor also said his center is able to develop a robot for
underwater operations of this kind if necessary.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China Invests Heavily in Water Control Projects (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Governments at all levels in
China have raised billions of yuan for the construction of many
key water control projects since this summer's devastating floods.
</P>
<P>
"Making sure that China can successfully fend off natural
disasters and reap a bumper harvest next year is crucial to the
country's reform, development and stability." Vice-Premier Wen
Jiabao said recently.
</P>
<P>
Water conservation experts consider this "a natural outcome"
after the worst flooding in decades, which claimed 3,004 lives and
caused total losses of some 200 billion yuan (24.1 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The damage sent a warning to provinces unaffected by the floods
as well as flood-ravaged areas. Provinces potentially threatened
by other natural hazards are also taking measures to reduce their
consequences.
</P>
<P>
Restoring flood-damaged facilities is high on the agenda of all
localities concerned, while the central government has instituted
a complete plan for the current winter water control efforts.
</P>
<P>
In Paizhouwan, a small town in central China's Hubei Province
along the Yangtze River and the focus of nationwide attention
during a disastrous breach of its dike, two large projects are now
underway to fill the 148,800-square-meter flood-washed cavity and
rebuild the breached dike that made 57,000 locals homeless.
</P>
<P>
Technicians in charge of the projects said the 30-meter-deep
puddle needs 800,000 cubic meters of sand and stone to fill
it. These 44-million-yuan restoration projects are expected to be
completed by next April, before the new flood season begins.
</P>
<P>
In fact, all the provinces along the Yangtze have begun to
increase their efforts in this regard.
</P>
<P>
In Anhui Province, bordering Hubei, local authorities launched
a water control campaign in August costing 2.5 billion yuan, or
five to six times the amount usually invested in such projects.
Large numbers of laborers have been mobilized to work on 47,000
projects, including 6,300 flood-damaged facilities.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China Invests Heavily in Water Control Projects (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The summer flooding made the governments and people aware that
the construction of water control facilities is not just
"government-sponsored projects," but "everyone's responsibility"
as well.
</P>
<P>
Individual investors in east China's Zhejiang Province played
their part in raising funds to improve water conservation
facilities for their "own welfare."
</P>
<P>
Aware of the government's capital shortage, this economically
developed province has raised 1.1 billion yuan for this purpose so
far this year, a net increase of 212 million yuan over last year,
of which 40 percent came from private investors instead of
governments.
</P>
<P>
Huang Yongbin, a local farmer in the city of Leqing, invested
more than three million yuan to help build a 100-kilometer
anti-wave wall along the shores. The coastal province also
suffered from Typhoon Winnie last summer.
</P>
<P>
According to provincial government sources, total investment in
building water control facilities this winter would amount to 2.8
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Water conservation projects are not only for combating floods,
they are also for water storage in some regions, as China has
already been labeled as a country badly short of water resources.
</P>
<P>
Droughts and floods alternatively affect Shandong Province,
also in east China. According to Song Fatang, deputy governor of
the province, the water shortage has hindered sustained economic
growth, with the per-capita water supply less than one-sixth of
China's average.
</P>
<P>
The province has a 629-kilometer-long bank along the Yellow River,
China's second longest known for severe flooding in flood season
and dry spells at its lower reaches at other times of the year.
</P>
<P>
Shandong at the lower reaches of the river will spend 15
billion yuan in the next three years to build water conservation
facilities that can both ease water shortages and combat flooding,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, according to Liao Yiwei, a provincial
official in charge of a dike reinforcement program, 70 percent of
the 61 planned projects are expected to be completed, while the
rest will be finished before next flood season.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi Now a Leading Meat Supplier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, south China, has ended its reliance on meat supplied by
other provinces after vigorous efforts to develop its own animal
husbandry.
</P>
<P>
The per-capita meat output of Guangxi has now reached 56.37
kilograms a year, ranking the second in the country.
</P>
<P>
Increased production of the animal husbandry sector for the
past 19 consecutive years has also enabled the region to place
ninth in total meat output.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the region's animal husbandry output value made up
32.85 percent of its total agricultural output value, making it
one of the top ten animal husbandry centers in the country.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, local governments in Guangxi
autonomous region have allocated vast special funds to utilize
plentiful local grassy mountain slopes for raising sheep, cows,
geese and other plant-eating animals.
</P>
<P>
The region is also encouraging pen-raising and the use of corn
stalks, straw and sugarcane for feed, and ten demonstration
counties have been established for the spread of these methods.

<P>
NEW DELHI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- At least 73 people were
killed and more than 200 others injured early Thursday morning
when a south-bound express train rammed into three derailed
coaches near Khanna in Ludhiana district of Punjab state.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported from the scene that the
death toll was expected to go up as a number of bodies were feared
trapped inside the 16 derailed coaches.
</P>
<P>
A railway gateman in the area reported derailment of three
bogies of the Amritsar bound 2903 frontier Golden Temple Mail from
Mumbai near a village called Kohri.
</P>
<P>
A railway spokesman said that the three derailed bogies of the
superfast train, which left Khanna station at 3.10 a.m. local
time, fell on the down track.
</P>
<P>
The 3152 express from Jammu rammed into the three derailed
bogies with the result that the engine and seven bogies of the
train derailed, and six more bogies of the frontier mail also went
off the rails.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 16 bogies of the two trains, three of each train had
been severely damaged, PTI said, adding that cutters had been
pressed into service to extricate the bodies and take out of the

<HEADLINE> China Makes Major Progress in Regional Climate Prediction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This achievement has been highly rated by several international
meteorological organizations. Roland Fuchs, director of Global
Change System for Analysis, Research and Training (START) and
president of International Geography Union, said the RCM developed
by China is the first outstanding regional climate model in the
world, and can be applied not only in China but throughout Asia,
adding that it will be significant to research and prediction of
global climate changes.
</P>
<P>
Fu Congbin, professor and director of the Temperate East Asia
Regional Center, said that the influence of humans over climate is
much larger in Asia than in other parts of the world, as this
region is more populated and enjoys faster economic
development. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a model in
line with the region's special conditions.
</P>
<P>
Fu said people have been talking about global warming for the
past ten years, but now they are more concerned with what
influences regional climate changes will have on their lives.
</P>
<P>
Regional climate modeling may simulate future climate changes
in a certain region and prediction results may serve as an
important scientific basis for decision-making by government
departments.
</P>
<P>
Departments of agriculture and water resources, for example,
can judge how future climate changes will affect agricultural
production and water resources based on such prediction, and then
plan effective development strategies.
</P>
<P>
To enable developing countries in Asia to master and use the
modeling, the CAS is hosting an international training course on
the application of RCM for Asia from November 23 to December 2 in
Beijing. More than 30 young scientists from 14 countries and
regions in Asia, Africa and the Pacific are attending the course.
</P>
<P>
The course is co-sponsored by START and APN (Asia-Pacific
Network for Global Change Research). Fuchs said this course is the
most important and highest-ranking project among START's worldwide
programs, and he pledged that START will continue to support
China's research on regional climate changes.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Urges to Further Cooperation Within Visegrad Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The member countries of
Visegrad Group should expand their cooperation on European
integration, Hungarian Premier Orban Viktor told a meeting of
central and east European ambassadors on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that Budapest was working to enhance cooperation among
the member countries of the new Visegrad Group in a bid to
accelerate the integration process.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Nemet Zsolt, state secretary of Hungary's
Foreign Ministry, said that at next summit of the Visegrad Group
in Slovakia, scheduled for the end of April next year, the host
country would become the group's fourth member, following Hungary,
Poland and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Hungary gave diplomatic priority to cooperation in central
Europe and was working towards breaking down social and economic
borders within the group.
</P>
<P>
The three states issued a joint statement on October 21 on the
resumption of cooperation within the group, which was founded in
the town of Visegrad, north of Budapest, on February 15, 1991 and
ceased to exist except in name in December 1992 when these
countries and Slovakia established the Central Europe Free Trade
Zone.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Hungary's Magyar Nemzet newspaper on
November 9, Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan expressed his
nation's wish to join the group.

<HEADLINE> IAEA Says Iraq Unable to Make Nuclear Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A report by the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it found no evidence that Iraq is
able to make nuclear weapons, IAEA spokesman Hans Friedrich Meyer
told the press here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the press on the report prepared by IAEA Director
General Mohamed El-Baradei on Iraq's nuclear capability, Meyer
said the IAEA check showed that Iraq had no facilities essential
in manufacturing materials to build nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The result "means there is no sign at present that Iraq has the
capability of making nuclear weapons," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman meanwhile pointed out that due to limitations of
its working conditions, the IAEA could not be certain that Baghdad
had ultimately abandoned all programs related to nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
"We do not know if any secret data involving nuclear weapons
programs is still hidden in some computers, but drawing up a new
nuclear arms program could cost billions of U.S. dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meyer said since the latest resumption of the United Nations
weapon inspection in Baghdad, the IAEA has sent 10 inspectors to
Iraq for two daily checks of relevant institutions.
</P>
<P>
The report by the Vienna-based IAEA criticized Iraq for not
handing over documents so far that could prove definitely it has
stopped its nuclear weapons program.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Japanese investors
Thursday renewed their commitment to Malaysia and pledged that
their investment in the country will stay.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Japan Federation of Economic Organization
(Keidanren) which consists of giant Japanese companies voiced
their commitment during a meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad here Thursday, Malaysian Foreign Affairs
Undersecretary for East and South Asia Syed Norulzaman Syed
Kamarulzaman told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Syed Norulzaman said the organization also showed their
commitment to ensuring continued employment among locals in
Japanese companies in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the meeting, the Japanese businessmen
wanted to know more about the economic measures taken by Malaysia,
particularly the currency controls and the pegging of the local
currency to the U.S. dollar at 3.8 ringgit.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir assured them that the pegging of the ringgit to the
dollar was not something the Malaysian government was going to
change overnight as it would disrupt business and will stay for
the time being, Syed Norulzaman said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the mission also supported Japan's yen loan of 1.8
billion U.S. dollars to Malaysia to help ease the country's burden
during the current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The 24-member Keidanren mission is currently touring the region
and it is the first time since 1995, that a Keindanren delegation
is consisting of top notch Japanese businessmen. The mission will
visit Singapore next after its two-day visit here.

<HEADLINE> Onset of Parkinson's Disease Occurring at Earlier Age </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Parkinson's disease has
often been labeled as "a disease of the elderly," but statistics no
longer support this.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released Wednesday by the U.S. National
Parkinson Foundation (NPF), the average age of the onset of the
disease is currently estimated to be about 55, with 15 percent of
patients diagnosed below the age of 50. NPF medical experts have
confirmed the diagnoses of two individuals under the age of 13.
</P>
<P>
Parkinson's disease is a slowly progressive neurological
disorder named after Dr. James Parkinson, a London physician who
was the first to describe the syndrome in 1817. The disease has
debilitating effects on a patient's ability to control voluntary
movements.
</P>
<P>
Currently, over one million people in the United States alone
suffer from this disease, and each year nearly 60,000 new cases
are diagnosed, said NPF.
</P>
<P>
Parkinson's often goes unrecognized in the young for several
years after symptoms first appear because doctors don't expect to
find the disease in people who are in their 30s or 40s.
</P>
<P>
Thus, NPF said, it is important that any individuals displaying
the symptoms of Parkinson's disease be seen by a neurologist
specializing in movement disorders for further diagnosis and
treatment.
</P>
<P>
NPF said that young people displaying onset symptoms of
Parkinson's disease have special needs, because they often have
children to raise, jobs to keep and other issues to address that
are different than those patients in retirement years. So they
must implement a comprehensive disease management program
including physical, occupational and speech therapies in addition
to traditional medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
There is no cure for the disease now. But NPF said that there
have been many new advances in the treatment in the last decade
and several new drugs were approved this year alone. Researchers
are hopeful of finding a cure within the next decade, NPF said.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria, Most Serious Candidate for NATO Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria is among the most
serious candidates for membership into NATO, said Foreign
Ministry Spokesman Radko Vlaikov here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement after British Secretary of State for
Defense George Robertson said earlier in the day there would be no
second wave regarding the enlargement of NATO.
</P>
<P>
Vlaikov said Bulgaria's candidacy is much more of a serious
concern than countries that have already been mentioned as
possible participants in NATO's second wave of enlargement.
</P>
<P>
The time and direction of the next NATO enlargement plan should
be decided during serious and comprehensive discussions in the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the foreign ministry spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
A number of factors should be taken into consideration,
including geostrategic importance, and the interests of member
states, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
It is important for Bulgaria that NATO's enlargement continues
to be an open-door process, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria has been working continuously to prepare itself for
NATO accession. It has completed the reforms in the army so that
it will be able to meet all the membership criteria.

ROME, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The number of countries suffering
a serious lack of food rose to 36 by June this year, up from 29 in
1997, according to a report by the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) released here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The FAO attributed the worsening food supply in part to bad
weather and the world economic turbulence, which significantly cut
grain outputs in many countries.
</P>
<P>
The report also noted that more than 828 million people around
the world suffered malnutrition from 1994 to 1996, up by over six
million from the level of 1990 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
The regions most seriously affected by malnutrition were in
Central Asia, Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The FAO said much work was needed to reduce the world's

<HEADLINE> U.S. Existing Home Sales Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Sales of existing
single-family U.S. homes rose sharply in October, compared with
the same period of last year, the National Association of Realtors
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted annual rate of existing-home sales rose
9.4 percent in October to 4.79 million units from 4.38 million
units recorded in October 1997, the association said.
</P>
<P>
The annual rate for a particular month represents what the
total number of actual sales for a year would be if the relative
pace for that month were maintained for 12 months. Seasonably
adjusted annual rates are used in reporting monthly data to factor
out seasonal variations in resale activity.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the association is projecting 4.75 million existing
home sales for 1998, which would be a 12.6 percent increase over
the record of 4.22 million sales posted last year.
</P>
<P>
The national median existing-home price was 130,900
U.S. dollars in October, up 5.2 percent from October 1997, when
the median price was 124,400 dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, the housing market is on a stable, straight track
toward record levels again this year. The market we are looking
at right now is probably going to remain the same through at least
the early part of 1999," said Sharon Millett, president of the
association.
</P>
<P>
Sales have been supported by plentiful jobs, large accumulated
stock market gains and low mortgage rates. Fixed-rate, 30-year
lows have averaged below 7 percent since mid-June this year.
</P>
<P>
The biggest rise in October home sales came in the U.S. South,
with a gain of 6.9 percent. Home resales rose 0.8 percent in the
Midwest but were off 2.8 percent in the West and 1.5 percent in
the Northeast, according to the association.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Realtors is the nation's largest
professional organization which represents nearly 720,000 members
involved in all aspects of the real estate industry.

<HEADLINE> Re-Employment Services Covering Nearly All Lay-Offs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The coverage of re-employment
centers has been extended rapidly this year to cope with the
increasing numbers of workers laid off as a result of the reform
of the State-owned enterprises, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The enterprise-based re-employment centers, which now look
after almost all laid-off workers, are scheduled to disappear by
the end of the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
The re-employment services have expanded rapidly this year,
extending to almost all laid-off workers at state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China had 7.9 million laid-off
workers by the end of July. They have been released by State-owned
enterprises streamlining their structures.
</P>
<P>
Laid-off workers looked after by re-employment centers are not
counted as jobless in China.
</P>
<P>
The enterprise-based re-employment centers set up in recent
years have so far covered 99 percent coverage of the country's
lay-offs.
</P>
<P>
The center scheme was piloted by Shanghai, the country's
leading industrial city, in 1996, and spread throughout the
country the following year.
</P>
<P>
The centers pay into workers' personal pension, health care and
unemployment insurance accounts, organize free training and
provide job information. They also pay laid-off workers a wage of
140-380 yuan per month.
</P>
<P>
However, some lay-offs hesitate or even refuse to join the
centers, since this means leaving the State-owned enterprises that
used to bear all social welfare responsibilities, including
housing, health care and pensions.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Ministerial Meeting Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A ministerial meeting of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) due to begin
here late Wednesday has been postponed until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the meeting, OPEC ministers were
close to an agreement on ways to boost sagging oil prices during
their informal sessions.
</P>
<P>
OPEC countries, which account for some 37 percent of world oil
production, were meeting as oil prices sank to a record low in
London, with Brent crude for January delivery ending the day at
11.16 U.S. dollars a barrel, after closing Tuesday at 11.19.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC ministers are expected to reiterate their commitment
to output cuts of 2.6 million barrels a day agreed earlier this
year, and perhaps extend this figure to the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
World oil demand has been slowing this year due to the global
financial turmoil, so that the output cuts have not been enough to
stop prices falling.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC members are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait,
Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.

CHENGDU, November 26 (Xinhua) -- China's Sichuan Province is
intensifying efforts to adopt save-water irrigation method to beat
droughts that have been plaguing the province in the past.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan built 22,000 km of canals that do not leak, reducing
water losses by over 60 percent from the old clay canals. It has
used the technique on 12,000 hectares of land.

Specialists say that if all rice paddies in the province use
water-saving techniques, seven billion cubic meters of water can
be saved annually.

<P>
In addition to the water saving technique, Sichuan is planting
more trees and grass to keep soil from eroding and developing

<HEADLINE> Sweden Supports Britain's Ruling Over Pinochet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Sweden is supporting a
British legal ruling on Wednesday denying former Chilean leader
Augusto Pinochet immunity from prosecution, Swedish Foreign
Minister Anna Lindh said.
</P>
<P>
Hailing it as a success of international law, justice and human
values, she said the ruling was a major step towards bringing
Pinochet to justice and making up for the abuses under his 17-year
rule.
</P>
<P>
Lindh noted that thousands of Chilean exiles who had suffered
under Pinochet's administration were living in Sweden and that her
government would consider approving legal proceedings against the
former Chilean leader if the Swedish judiciary could find
sufficient evidence.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Law Lords, sitting as the highest court in the
country, ruled that Pinochet, now in London after back surgery,
did not enjoy immunity, paving the way to extradite him to Spain
on charges of genocide, torture and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon accused Pinochet of being
responsible for more than 3,000 deaths and disappearances,
including those of Spanish citizens, at the hands of secret police
in Chile between 1973 and 1990.

BELGRADE, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from a
Serbian government delegation and nine parties and organizations
from the province of Kosovo signed a declaration of support in
Pristina Wednesday for the Serb proposal granting self-rule to
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The declaration stressed that the implementation of the
proposal will help achieve peace, stability and development of the
province and equality among different ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, reached earlier between the representatives,
limits the political scope for self-rule.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the majority ethnic Albanians, led by Ibrahim
Rugova, dismissed the Serb plan and refused to meet face-to-face
with Serb officials without foreign mediation.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav president's envoy Vladan Kutlesic, Serbian deputy
Premier Cratko Markovic and representatives from nine parties and
organizations signed the declaration.
</P>
<P>
Serbian President Milan Milutinovic presided over the meeting.
</P>

Serbian authorities, in defiance of a U.S. proposal which may
cause them to loosen their grip on the province, said anything

SHENYANG, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese police arrested a
murder suspect three days after seeing his computer-generated
image in the city of Zhaodong in northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province.
</P>
<P>
The front and side view colored images, quite different from
the routine hand--drawn ones, were obtained by employing a newly
developed software system based on descriptions given by eye
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
The Jingxing CCK-2 image combination system, which passed
expert appraisal at the Ministry of Public Security and Qinghua
University on Wednesday, is China's first image software system
for identifying criminals in major cases.
</P>
<P>
The system creates images by selecting one of a number of
possible pictures of ears, eyes, lips, noses and so forth from a
special computer data bank. The process allows each part of these
images to be enlarged or reduced, and they are then combined to
form a complete portrait before being printed.
</P>
<P>
The system was developed by the Chinese Criminal Police
Institute for training criminal police and detectives, and the
N.E.U.-Alpine Corporation, China's first listed software company.
</P>
<P>
Criminologists say this system is suited for producing
portraits with Chinese facial characteristics, and is more
effective than those drawn by hand.

PRAGUE, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Chamber of Deputies
approved the government's 1999 budget Wednesday by a vote of 113
to 82.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time the Chamber of Deputies reviewed the
budget in 40 days.
</P>
<P>
On October 14, the chamber rejected a previous budget plan and
asked the government to amend it.
</P>
<P>
Under the approved budget, budget revenues next year will be
574 billion korunas (about 19.1 billion U.S. dollars), budget
expenditures will be 605 billion korunas (20.1 billion dollars),
and the budget deficit will be 31 billion korunas (about one
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Economists here believe the budget deficit in 1999 will be the
worst since the republic's independence in 1993, indicating that
the country's financial condition has deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
For years the republic's economy has been slowing down due in
part to a very weak domestic demand. In 1997, the Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) increased only one percent.
</P>
<P>
For the first half of this year, the GDP fell by 1.7 percent
compared to the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector Employs More Laid-Off In Shandong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 75,000 laid-off
workers in east China's Shandong Province have become
self-employed or employed by private businesses in the first half
of this year, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 250,000 laid-offs have found new jobs since 1991,
the paper quoted an official of the marketing department of the
Shandong Administration of Industry and Commerce, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Benefits for many laid-off workers who are trying their luck as
street vendors or who run small stores are now provided by
reemployment centers based at their former employers, where their
three major social insurances are continued. These transitional
centers are expected to disappear in two years.
</P>
<P>
Procedures for obtaining a business licence have been
simplified for laid-off workers from state-owned enterprises which
are operating in the red.
</P>
<P>
For laid-off workers in financial straits, industrial and
commercial administrative fees are exempted for the first year,
said Hu Hongtao, an official with the administration, which is
sponsoring training programs teaching business techniques.
</P>
<P>
Most of the laid-off workers have spent years laboring on
production lines. They lost their posts when State-owned
enterprises used massive cuts in labor to raise efficiency.
</P>
<P>
But private enterprises are recruiting actively for their
expansion and creating new opportunities. By the end of August,
6.9 million people were involved in the private sector, accounting
for 13.6 percent of total workers.
</P>
<P>
Local government welcomes the move because re-employment of
laid-offs helps ease the worry of social unrest.
</P>
<P>
There were 7.9 million laid-offs in China by the end of
July. They have been encouraged to create job opportunities for
themselves instead of queuing up for posts with state-owned
enterprises.

<HEADLINE> PM Says Spain Respects British Ruling on Pinochet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Prime Minister Jose
Maria Aznar said on Wednesday that his government would respect
the British court's ruling denying former Chilean leader Augusto
Pinochet immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that relations between Spain and Chile
would not be affected by the Pinochet affair because it was a
judicial matter.
</P>
<P>
"We are awaiting a decision from the British judiciary," said
the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Spanish government forwarded to Britain
a Spanish judge's request to extradite Pinochet, in London for a
back surgery, on charges of genocide, torture and terrorism during
his 17-year rule of Chile.
</P>
<P>
Judge Baltasar Garzon accused Pinochet of responsibility for
more than 3,000 deaths and disappearances, including Spanish
citizens, at the hands of secret police in Chile between 1973 and
1990.
</P>
<P>
Madrid's decision to abide by the judiciary proceedings had
angered the Chilean government which recalled its ambassador for
consultations.

<HEADLINE> South China Tigers Dying Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Wang Menghu, deputy
secretary-general of the China Zoo Protection Association, has
warned that South China tigers could die out within 20 to 30 years
if certain measures are not taken.
</P>
<P>
According to him, there are only 53 South China tigers still in
existence, all of them in 21 Chinese zoos and most are sick,
handicapped or aged.
</P>
<P>
Tigers in the wild may have become completely extinct in China,
he said. They have been listed among the 10 species extremely in
danger of extinction by international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The South China tiger is rarer than the Giant Panda, of which
there are more than 1,000 in the wild.
</P>
<P>
The South China tiger lives in Hunan, Jiangxi, Jiangsu and
Fujian provinces. In the 1950s, China had more than 4,000 of them,
and 675 were killed by illegal hunters from 1952 to 1964.
</P>
<P>
The last South China tiger in Hunan was shot in 1994, and
nobody has said to have seen the tigers in the other three
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that at least 100 tigers are needed to maintain the
species, and that the 53 tigers can only survive 20 t0 30 more
years.

<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- After enduring the pains
caused by a plastic tube left in her abdomen for 18 years, Cao
Jingyu finally got compensation of 80,000 yuan(9,639 U.S. dollars)
from the No.3 Hospital affiliated with Beijing Medical University.
</P>
<P>
The 66-year-old Cao, a retired Chinese teacher with the Middle
School affiliated with Beijing University, originally asked for
139,850 yuan(16,850 U.S. dollars) but recently settled out of
court with the hospital at the No.1 Intermediate People's Court.
</P>
<P>
The compensation covers lost work-time, mental distress and
medical expenses incurred over the past 18 years.
</P>
<P>
The plastic tube measuring about 16.5 centimeters long and 2
millimeters in diameter, was implanted for radiation and
chemotherapy following a tumor operation in January 1978, which
caused recurring stomach-aches, insomnia and nausea until January
1997, when doctors and Haidian District Hospital detected the tube
during another operation.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Earnings From Tourism Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Foreign exchange earnings
generated by Indonesia's tourism industry during the first
semester of this year have dropped by 23.68 percent, Antara News
Agency Thursday quoted a senior tourism official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Up till 1997, Indonesia always enjoyed a significant increase
of over 10 percent in its foreign exchange earnings from tourism,
but since the rampant forest and bush fires in the same year the
figure began to decline.
</P>
<P>
The foreign and bush fires raging in several parts of this
archipelagic country caused plane crashes and sea mishaps due to
bad visibility, said Djodi Soesilo, director of the tourism
marketing development.
</P>
<P>
The number of foreign tourists visiting the country in the
first semester of 1998 dropped drastically to 1,885,882, or
experienced a decline of 22.83 percent from the figure attained in
the corresponding period last hear.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of dengue fever has also added to the fears of
foreign tourists to visit Indonesia, Soesilo said.
</P>
<P>
The May riots rocking Jakarta and other Indonesian big cities
following the fatal shootings of six Trisakti University students
were the main reasons for the decline with the United States,
Japan and some European countries issuing travel advisories
calling on their citizens not to visit Indonesia for security
reasons.
</P>
<P>
The travel advisories have been lifted in line with an
improvement of security condition, but the Black Friday bloody
incident on November 13 again caused foreign tourists to hesitate
to visit Indonesia. In the incident, Indonesian students and
unruly mobs fought street battles against security officers,
claiming 15 lives.
</P>
<P>
Countries like Japan, the United States and Belgium had even
reissued the above-mentioned travel advisories.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Complete Top-Notch Cultural Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- China's capital city of
Beijing will see the completion of six projects of world-class
cultural facilities this year or early next, Today's China Daily
quoted a city official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The six projects are the Beijing Municipal Concert Hall, the
Beijing Drama School, the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe's Circus
School, the new Capital Library, and office buildings, living
quarters, and rehearsal and performing halls for the Beijing
Children's Art Troupe and Chinese Pingju Troupe, said Zhao
Dongming, executive deputy-director of the Beijing Cultural
Bureau(BCB). Five of them will be completed this year with the new
Capital Library to be finished early next year.
</P>
<P>
The facilities, when completed, will give Beijingers a modern
library, the country's best concert hall and a living and working
environment more conducive to artistic creation, and the
Children's Art Troupe will finally have a home, an office building
and rehearsal and performing halls of their own.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that the Beijing Municipal People's Political
Consultative Conference, which initiated the six construction
projects last year, could not fully realize all its ambitions in
designing and equipping the new cultural centers, due to a building
budget that provided just 2,000 yuan (241 U.S. dollars) per square
meter for some of the facilities.
</P>
<P>
"We had to make the best use of our limited municipal
governmental financial allocation,"said Zhao.
</P>
<P>
The tearing-down of many old theaters like Xidan, Jixiang,
Tianqiao, and Chang'an caused many complaints from Beijingers,
noted Zhou Shuzeng, former BCB director.
</P>
<P>
"Now I'm really pleased to see our actions did initiate great
improvements here," said Zhou.

<P>
GUIYANG, November 26 (Xinhua) -- China has made great progress
in using artificial propagation to prevent the extinction of South
China tigers, with 11 tiger cubs born over the past four years

</P>
<P>
Wang Menghu, deputy secretary-general of China Association of

<HEADLINE> China's Crackdown on Smuggling Benefits Home Producers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- China's nationwide
anti-smuggling campaign has made the price of many domestic
products higher, taking many Chinese companies out of the red.
</P>
<P>
The Wanhua Synthetic Leather Company in Shandong Province is
one of the companies that benefited from the campaign. As China's
sole producer of cyanic acid grease, a key material for
polyurethane, the company used to make a good profit.
</P>
<P>
But, since the second half of 1996, large amounts of smuggled
goods hit the company hard and by this July its inventory grew to
5,000 tons and its price had fallen to below production costs.
</P>
<P>
The anti-smuggling campaign, however, which began in July,
brought the company's monthly sales back up to 2,000 tons from
some 500 tons, the company's president Hao Wenguang says.
</P>
<P>
Textiles and chemicals, this province's two pillar industries,
were seriously affected by smuggling. But from August, the
situation began to change for the better. The price of polythene
and polyester fiber are now up 1,400 yuan and 3,000 yuan a ton,
respectively and the price of computers, vegetable oils,
petrochemical products, and chemical fertilizers have also risen
considerably.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Shucun, an official who is in charge of the
anti-smuggling drive, says that the campaign has brought new
business opportunities for local industries and many enterprises
have had an increase in sales, revenues, and profits in September
compared with the previous eight months.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The head of the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) Carol Bellamy said continuing poverty in
Latin America is due to the "shameful decline" in aid funds for
women and children.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out on Wednesday that over 500,000 children under
five die every year in the region due to illnesses which otherwise
could be prevented at a low cost, while two thirds of all children
drop out of school due to extreme poverty.
</P>
<P>
During her opening address to the fourth American ministerial
meeting on children and social policies, Bellamy said that 22,000
Latin American and Caribbean women also die every year during
labor and that 65 percent of remote villages have no potable water.
</P>
<P>
However, she admitted that health care for poor children had
improved in the past 30 years, adding that death rates linked to
chicken pox had slumped 95 percent due to vaccination programs and
other efforts.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy also mentioned "significant advances" in the fight to
reduce the infant mortality rate due to diarrhea, adding that less
babies are being born underweight and more children are attending
school.
</P>
<P>
She awarded a United Nations medal to Peruvian President
Alberto Fujimori for helping to reduce illnesses incurred as
result of a lack of iodine in people's diet.

dollars in the previous week, the Jakarta Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The drop was mainly due to repayments of the government's
overseas debt, Bank Indonesia said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The amount is well above the adjusted target for net foreign
exchange reserves set by the International Monetary Fund of 11.26
billion dollars, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia said that gross foreign exchange reserves
dropped by 10.4 million to 22.75 billion dollars in the same week.

<HEADLINE> Couch Wins First Women's Bout in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Jane Couch won the first
professional women's boximg match in Britain on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old Briton exploited her home soil to land a
stunning righthander on her 18-year-old German opponent Simona
Lukic in the second round before the referee stepped in to stop
the fight.
</P>
<P>
"She walked into my right hand. She was a strong girl," Couch
said, "I hope I will be an inspiration to women. There weren't
just people here to watch a freak show. Women have been boxing
since Roman times."
</P>
<P>
Couch entered the ring to pumping music and was aggressive
from the start. She went onto the attack from the beginning,
aiming a fast jab that the willowy Lukic did well to avoid.
</P>
<P>
The German teenager from Frankfurt seem more like a catwalk
model than a boxer. It was her father who encouraged her to take
up boxing.
</P>
<P>
The historic fight was staged in Caesar's nightclub with the
boxing ring set up on the dance floor under disco lights.
</P>
<P>
Fight promoter Roy Cameron dismissed critics who said women
should only be in a boxing ring if they paraded around in short
skirts and stilettos.
</P>
<P>
"This fight is history," he boasted before the contest which
ended after just 184 seconds.

<HEADLINE> Chilean President Condemns Court Decision Against Pinochet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Chilean President Eduardo
Frei on Wednesday condemned a British legal ruling which denied
former dictator General Augusto Pinochet diplomatic immunity and
renewed calls for his release.
</P>
<P>
The ruling "affects the principle of immunity defended by
Chile", Frei said in a brief nationwide address.
</P>
<P>
The ruling against Pinochet, 83, was greeted with anger by his
supporters, especially in the military.
</P>
<P>
The decision was "openly unjust and vexatious against a former
president, commander-in-chief of the army and lifelong senator"
and "very seriously offends our country's sovereignty and
dignity", army spokesman Colonel Alfredo Ewing said.
</P>
<P>
The air force and navy also expressed their outrage over the
ruling, while the British House of Lords' decision that Pinochet
was not immune from prosecution for genocide and torture was met
with relief and applause among his opponents here.
</P>
<P>
Leftists said the decision showed that justice was still
pending concerning human rights abuses under Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Most of the abuses have remained unpunished under an amnesty
law, in the face of the army's still considerable power.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet seized power in 1973 in a violent coup allegedly
supported by the Central Intelligence Agency against
democratically-elected president Salvador Allende.
</P>
<P>
During his 17-year rule, over 2,000 people were killed for
political reasons and over 1,000 more disappeared after their
arrests.

<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in China's Zhejiang
Province are coming to local agricultural enterprise associations
to sign contracts for their products in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
Helping farmers adapt to changing markets has long been a
problem for agricultural industrialization and timely supplies,
and farmers were less than enthusiastic because of these
difficulties. So, the city of Ningbo decided to focus on
integrating production and marketing.
</P>
<P>
In Shengshan County near Ningbo, more than 100 farmers with
large tracts of land are growing Japanese beans, new cabbage
varieties on contract with Agricultural Products Purchasing and
Marketing Co.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hua Defang earned more than 45,000 yuan (5,620
U.S. dollars) for one hectare of vegetables on average and this
year he rushed for another contract with the association for his
1.3-ha of land.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 10,000 farmers who have signed such
contracts in Ningbo. Their earnings are over 37,500 yuan for one
hectare on average, 35 percent higher than those who do not have a
contract.

<HEADLINE> New Farming Method For Reducing Soil Erosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Xueliang, a Chinese
water conservation specialist, has proposed a new money-saving
farming method that can stop soil erosion by as much as 60 percent
on sloping fields along the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The new method could help cut soil erosion by 30-odd tons per
hectare in areas along the upper reaches of the Yangtze each year,
or 120 million tons in total.
</P>
<P>
Farmers plough fields on slopes in a direction parallel to the
ground, in contrast to the old way of ploughing along the slopes,
Zhang explains, so that the ridges prevent soil from being washed
away.
</P>
<P>
The old method was popular but made it easy for rainwater to
carry the soil along furrows down to the river. This soil amounted
to 200 million tons each year.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts have blamed this summer's catastrophic flooding
along the Yangtze River on serious soil erosion and a deteriorating
environment.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is now terracing these sloping fields at
a cost of more than 30,000 yuan (3,600 U.S. dollars) per
hectare. But, only 300 yuan is needed with the new method,
according to Zhang, who says that that production can also be
enhanced by 10 percent and that farmers can improve their fields
simply by changing the direction of ploughing.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Luxemburgo Suspended for Two Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's national
coach Wanderley Luxemburgo was handed a 60-day club suspension by
the Brazilian Disciplinary Tribunal of Sport (TJD) on Tuesday for
abusing a referee in the changing room.
</P>
<P>
The TJD said Luxemburgo's behaviour was not considered worthy
of the manager of the national side. Thus, Luxemburgo, also
coach of Corinthians, will be banned from club matches but not
duties with the Brazilian team.
</P>
<P>
Luxemburgo, who replaced Mario Zagallo after the World Cup
finals in July, charged referee Claudio Cerdeira to overrule his
earlier decision of cancelling a Corinthians goal on October 31
against Vitoria in the league.
</P>
<P>
Luxemburgo has a history of heated exchanges both with his
players and footballing authorities. He charged on to the pitch
during a league match last November and accused Cerdeira of being
prejudiced against Santos and wanting them to lose -- they won
the match 4-0.
</P>
<P>
Cerdeira is suing Luxemburgo, who was subsequently suspended
for 40 days by the Brazilian Football Federation, for 55,000
dollars for "damaging his morale" following remarks he made on
television.
</P>
<P>
Luxemburgo claimed on national television that the referee was
nothing but a "thief and a swine".
</P>
<P>
Their feud started back in 1994 when Luxemburgo, then coaching
Palmeiras, threatened the official at half-time.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, as coach of Flamengo, Luxemburgo said Cerdeira was
"mentally retarded" and in 1996, back for another spell at
Palmeiras, he accused the referee of favouring the opposing
team.

LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Football Association of
England has vowed to step up efforts to stamp racism out of the
football after losing an appeal against a 28,000 pounds fine
imposed following England's game in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The fine was imposed by European football's governing body,
UEFA, after a section of England supporters were accused of
racially abusing striker Henrik Larsson during the Euro 2000
qualifying match in Stockholm two months ago.
</P>
<P>
FA lawyers disputed that there had been any racist chanting,
but UEFA's appeals body rejected an appeal against the fine
following a hearing in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
A UEFA statement read: "The appeal was rejected following
evidence presented by the referee, Pierluigi Collina, and the
UEFA delegate at the match, Mattieu Sprengers, stressing that on
at least eight occasions during the game English fans had
directed racist chants at the Swedish player, Henrik Larsson."

<HEADLINE> Players, Owners Cancel Bargaining Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The NBA announced today
that there will be no bargaining session with the players on
Saturday and none are scheduled for the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
Less than a week after the sides seemed to be heading in the
right direction towards ending the nearly five-month long
lockout, animosity arose today after the Players Association
claimed that the league attempted to place pre-conditions on
meeting again.
</P>
<P>
"It was agreed that we would meet this current Saturday and if
necessary hold the players over for negotiations on Sunday and
Monday," said NBA executive director Billy Hunter. "All the
players were flying into town with the expectations of
negotiating.
</P>
<P>
"Last night around 6 p.m. I received a fax signed by NBA
deputy commissioner Russ Granik insisting that he presented us
with an ultimatum including three issues for preconditions to
meet. In response I was instructed to reply by 2 p.m. today. I
informed him that we would not meet the conditions but that all
negotiable items were up for negotiation.
</P>
<P>
"Russ then informed me that there was no need for a meeting.
He said it would not be worth the effort. He said he would get
back to me when they would be inclined to meet."
</P>
<P>
Just 24 hours ago, Hunter was looking forward to Saturday's
session. But today he closed his office for the holiday. He said
he found it "incredible" that the league would send such a letter
at the 12th hour.
</P>
<P>
"Our players are ready to meet and negotiate but it is quite
apparent that we cannot negotiate against ourselves. All of the
concessions that we have made, it would seem we could get a deal
done but I don't know.
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I can assess is that they are trying to play
mind games. They attempt to get the player's hopes up then pull
the rug out from under them," added Hunter.
</P>
<P>
This latest delay further jeopardizes the entire season and
comes one day after the league announced that a televised
doubleheader scheduled for Christmas Day has been scratched.
</P>
<P>
Once an agreement is in place, teams would need about a month
to sign players and hold training camps. However, the Christmas
cacellations leave just six days of games until January 1 when it
is believed the season would have to start in order play a
scheule of 55-60 games over four months and complete the playoffs
by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
Hunter added that the escrow proposal remains viable despite
the misunderstanding. The escrow found would set aside a
percentage of players' salaries that would go to owners if the
amount of basketball-related income earmarked for salaries
climbed above a certain percentage.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Political Parties Total 106 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- After years of a repressive
political system that recognized only three parties, there are now
106 political parties vying to compete in Indonesia's general
election next year, the Indonesian Observer reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of political parties began forming after former
president Soeharto stepped down on May 21 this year amid rising
protests against his iron-handed rule and massive riots.
</P>
<P>
The latest party to emerge is the United Indonesian Party, to
be launched here on November 29.
</P>
<P>
Although 106 parties have been founded, Home Affairs Minister
Syarwan Hamid estimates less than 10 parties will fulfill
requirements (currently being formulated in the election law) to
take part in the June 7 general election.
</P>
<P>
Parties likely to dominate the upcoming election are the
National Mandate Party chaired by Amien Rais, the Indonesian
Democratic Party chaired by Megawati Soekarnoputri, the National
Awakening Party chaired by Matori Abdul Djalil, the ruling Golkar
party chaired by Akbar Tandjung, the United Development Party
chaired by Ismail Hasan Metareum and the Crescent Moon Party
chaired by Yusril Ihza Mahendra.
</P>
<P>
An election bill, together with two political bills, is now
being deliberated by the government and the House of
Representatives. The bills are expected to be passed into law in
January, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted analysts as saying that most of the smaller
parties will have to merge if they are to have any chance of
meeting the criteria to be set for the next general election.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- WBC welterweight champion
Oscar De La Hoya of the United States is accused by a girl of
rape in Mexico in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit said De La Hoya raped teh 15-year-old girl in a
hotel room in Cabo San Lucas in June 1996. The lawsuit was filed
in San Bernardino County Superior Court Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The complaint charged assault, battery, false imprisonment and
intentional infliction of emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
"My client has suffered severe psychological injury since this
incident, which has affected her greatly both emotionally and
physically," Lisa L. Maki, attorney for the plaintiffi, said.
</P>
<P>
But De La Hoya's promoter Bob Arum said today he was outraged.
"This is a total and complete crock. Two and a half years after
the alleged event, this complaint is filed. There never, ever,
ever was a complaint made to the authorities in Cabo or to the
hotel where the incident allegedly took place."
</P>
<P>
"It's an attempt to extort money and to use the legal system
to extort money, and it's an absolute outrage because nothing
ever happended. Nothing, nothing. He wouldn't know this girl if
she walked into the same room with him."
</P>
<P>
Maki explained the plaintiff, who is now 18, waited more than
two years to sue the boxer because "she was terrified, and due to
her psychological injury we decided to wait to file the case when
she turned 18."
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old De La Hoya is scheduled to defend the title in
Las Vegas on February 13.

of the Zhuang lived in the Daoxian area from the Stone Age to the
early Warring States Period (475-221 B.C.) and that the rice
remains in Hunan were left by the ancestors of the Zhuang.
</P>
<P>
The Zhuang are the largest ethnic minority group in China, with
17 million people living mainly in today's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region.
</P>

Southern China and Southeast Asia are commonly regarded as the

<HEADLINE> AIDS Virus Spreads in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The deadly AIDS virus is
spreading faster in Jakarta than any other province in Indonesia,
according to new data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Dr. Samsuridjal Djauzi, an expert
on internal diseases, at a seminar on HIV/AIDS prevention in South
Jakarta on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, 141 people in Jakarta are
carrying the HIV virus, while 91 have AIDS. Next on the list is
Irian Jaya province, where 122 have HIV and 78 have AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Official figures indicate that AIDS has killed 111 Indonesians,
while another 221 people in the country have been infected with
the disease.
</P>
<P>
Djauzi said people may think the numbers are very small and no
cause for alarm. But he warned that the real number of AIDS cases
in Indonesia is much higher because most carriers don't realize
they have the disease.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he said, many AIDS-related deaths are never
documented by the health authorities.
</P>
<P>
Doctors from the United Nations estimate that at least 500,000
people in Indonesia have been contaminated with HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
What's more worrying, he said, is that around 58 percent of
HIV/AIDS carriers in Indonesia are between the ages of 15 and 25.
</P>
<P>
Djauzi said the community should protect youths by combating
rape, forced prostitution and other forms of exploitation.

MEXICO CITY, November 25 (Xinhua) -- For the third straight
day, a volcano 80 kilometers from Mexico City caused the earth to
shake and belched ash and steam four kilometers into the air on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said there was no imminent danger. Residents,

<HEADLINE> Chinese Locomotives Replacing Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- China will not need to import
any electric locomotives by the year 2000 because of the
development of its own high-speed locomotives in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Plant, one of the country's
major manufacturers, has so far produced more than 100 high-speed
engines and they are now running on railway networks nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The plant started manufacturing locomotives in 1958, and made
the first locomotive with a maximum speed of 100 km per hour,
according to Zhao Xiaoguang, general manager of the plant.
</P>
<P>
He said that technological breakthroughs have improved the
power and speed of its locomotives in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In June, 1998, the new Shaoshan 8 locomotive developed by the
plant had a maximum speed record of 240 km per hour on the
Beijing-Kowloon Railway in trial runs.

<HEADLINE> Ferguson Completes Newcastle Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Duncan Ferguson predicted
great things ahead from his new partnership with England captain
Alan Shearer after completing his move from Everton to Newcastle
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Scot will cost Newcastle an initial outlay of seven
million pounds, with Everton set to collect another one million
pounds when he has played 30 games.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knows that Alan Shearer is one of the best players
in Europe and I'm looking forward to teaming up with him. I think
it will be a good partnership," said Ferguson, who has agreed a
five and a half year contract.
</P>
<P>
"I know there's a big history about this club. It's the same
as my last club, the supporters are very fanatical and I'm
looking forward to getting out there on Saturday and doing my
best for them," he added.
</P>
<P>
Newspaper reports claim Shearer is in favor of the signing,
but speculation continues about his own future at St James' Park.
</P>
<P>
Club chairman Freddy Shepherd refused to allow questions about
Shearer during a news conference to confirm Ferguson's arrival.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson said he was surprised Everton were willing to sell
him, a decision taken behind the back of manager Walter Smith,
who came close to resignation over the issue.
</P>
<P>
He will wear the number 20 shirt and will make his debut in
the home game against Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
Coach Ruud Gullit revealed he had been interested in signing
Ferguson during his time in charge at Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
"In my previous job, I was sniffing to get him there. He's a
very good player, not only because of his height but because of
his football skills. He's a class player and he will give the
team an extra boost.
</P>
<P>
"I think he will do also for the fans. I'm sure that the fans
will love him," said Gullit.
</P>
<P>
He claimed earlier this week that the club only had seven
million available for transfers, but Shepherd said they would
continue to try and provide funds for further signings.
</P>
<P>
"If we can, of course we will help. We will help him as much
as we can. We never discuss how much we have or how much we h
aven't got," the chairman added.

<HEADLINE> Police Investigate Match Fixing Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Scotland Yard revealed
Wednesday it has investigated a match-fixing allegation involving
an English Premiership match.
</P>
<P>
An anonymous tip-off included allegations about an
Arsenal-Southampton match which ended in a 1-1 draw last month.
</P>
<P>
But a police spokeswoman said that no evidence had been found
so far to substantiate the claim.
</P>
<P>
"An anonymous allegation concerning a Premier League football
match was received by the Metropolitan Police," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Preliminary inquiries were conducted but it has not been
established if there is any basis for a formal investigation.
</P>
<P>
"This matter remains under consideration, but it is thought no
further inquiries will be made in the absence of any further
information."
</P>
<P>
Allegations of match-fixing and other corrupt financial
practices have dented football's reputation in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Last year players Hans Segers, John Fashanu and Bruce
Grobbelaar were cleared of criminal charges of match fixing.
</P>
<P>
The Football Association later gave Segers and Grobbelaar
suspended bans for breaking its rules banning players from
gambling on match results.

<HEADLINE> Champions' League Produce Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The penultimate round of the
European Champions' League produced all its expected drama on
Wednesday, but no team secured a place in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Ajax Amsterdam were stunned 1-0 at home by Croatia Zagreb to
hand the group A initiative to Olympiakos Piraeus, 2-1 victors
over Porto.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona are out of contention after a classic 3-3 home draw
with unbeaten Manchester United, leaving Bayern Munich needing a
draw at Old Trafford in their final game after they beat Brondby
2-0.
</P>
<P>
Unbeaten United, who have scored 19 goals in their five games,
twice led in the Nou Camp, but now need victory against Bayern to
make sure of their place in the last eight.
</P>
<P>
Defending champions Real Madrid are also up against it after l
osing 3-1 at Inter Milan as Roberto Baggio scored twice in the
last five minutes for the Italians.
</P>
<P>
Inter now need only beat Sturm Graz in their last game while
Real will hope victory over Spartak Moscow, which would take them
to 12 points, will be enough to clinch one of the two
quarter-final places available for the best runners-up.
</P>
<P>
Kaiserslautern's serene passage towards the last eight was
rudely interrupted by Benfica, who beat the Germans 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Kaiserslautern should still progress but might yet need to
take a point from HJK Helsinki to be certain.
</P>
<P>
Group E remains tight with only Arsenal out of contention
following their 1-0 home defeat by RC Lens.
</P>
<P>
The French club are locked together on eight points with
Dynamo Kiev -- who needed some luck to edge Panathinaikos 2-1
-with the two meeting in France in the final game.
</P>
<P>
With Juventus's game against Galatasaray postponed for a week,
perennial party-poopers Rosenborg Trondheim took the chance to
got to the top in group B, thanks to a 2-1 home victory over
Athletic Bilbao.

NANJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Jiangsu Province in east China

mines that are being closed have caused serious pollution, even
though they promote economic development locally.

sectors.

<HEADLINE> Most Canadians Oppose Bank Mergers, Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A large majority of Canadians
don't want the proposed mergers of the country's four major banks
to be allowed, according to a poll released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The poll found that 60 percent of the respondents oppose the
mergers, 31 percent support the proposal while nine percent didn't
express an opinion.
</P>
<P>
The proposed mergers would have the Royal Bank join up with the
Bank of Montreal, while the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
would get together with the Toronto-Dominion Bank.
</P>
<P>
The mergers, which was put forward last spring, are still
waiting the approval of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by the Environics Research Group for the
Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB), involved the
surveying of 1,202 Canadians between October 29 and November 10,
and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.0 percentage points,
19 times out of 20.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the poll results in Toronto, CFIB president
Catherine Swift said that Canadians "simply don't want these
mergers."
</P>
<P>
"They know that the concentration of economic power mergers
would bring would have negative impacts on their communities,"
Swift said.
</P>
<P>
The four banks have been saying that they need to merge to be
able to better compete both at home and abroad.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 26 (Xinhua) - Former Chilean leader Augusto
Pinochet, who was ruled out by Britain's highest court on
Wednesday of immune from prosecution, vowed on Thursday to fight
on against extradition.
</P>
<P>
"He will keep fighting for what he thinks is right," Chilean
parliamentarian Hernan Larrain, who consoled Pinochet on his 83rd
birthday after the narrow 3-2 decision by Law Lords, said.
</P>
<P>
"He was composed, ready to go on. He said it is not easy to
beat him," Larrain told reporters after Wednesday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, who is still under police guard at a north London
hospital where he has been recovering from back surgery, is
clearly determined to fight attempts to extradite him to Spain
from Britain.
</P>
<P>
Chile's President Eduardo Frei has also vowed to contest the
ruling and stressed that Pinochet, who was a permanent senator at
home, should enjoy diplomatic immunity.
</P>
<P>
President Frei is scheduled to send his foreign minister to
London to settle this problem.

<HEADLINE> Using Air-Raid Shelters In Southwestern China To Help Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Old air-raid shelters have
been used in the Chinese city of Chongqing over the past decade or
so to bring in 3.1 billion yuan in output and about 700 million
yuan in pre-tax profits.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing sits on the juncture of the Yangtze River and the
Jialing River and is built on hills. It was a target of Japanese
air raids in the 1930s and 1940s. From January 1938 to August
1943, there were 203 air raids, which killed more than 14,000
people and destroyed 37,000 houses. To avoid the random bomb
attacks, the people of Chongqing built more than 80,000 m. of
shelters.
</P>
<P>
This was later expanded to over one million sq.m. when the New
China was founded on October 1, 1949.
</P>
<P>
Only 350,000 sq.m. of the air-raid shelters have been used, but
an output value of 700 million yuan and 50 million yuan in pre-tax
profits and charges for using the shelters are generated
annually. More than 10,000 people have found jobs in the air-raid
shelters.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Wins again, Agassi Retires in ATP World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras beat Carlos Moya of
Spain 6-3, 6-3 while his fellow American Andre Agassi retired
in his opening match against Alex Corretja because of a back
injury in the ATP World Championship in Hanover, Germany, on Wed
nesday.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, seeking to become the first man to finish as world
number one for the sixth consecutive year, had clinched a place
in the semifinals of the season-ending tournament.
</P>
<P>
Marcelo Rios, the only player who can threaten Sampras, trails
by 33 points in the computer rankings and has to do better than
Sampras in the elite meet that brings together the top eight
players of the year.
</P>
<P>
But Rios, who was not scheduled to play Wednesday, lost his
first match to Tim Henman and is battling a back injury. He now
has to win his next two round-robin matches to reach the
semifinals and stay in the chase.
</P>
<P>
Sampras was certainly good enough to beat Moya in only 62
minutes. Moya, the French Open champion who is now 1-1, had
beaten Sampras in a group match last year but Sampras went on to
win the 3.5 million U.S. dollars event for the fourth time.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, who won the event in 1990, quit the match when he
trailed Spaniard Corretja 7-5, 3-6, 1-2. He said he would wait
until Thursday before deciding whether to continue the tournament.
</P>
<P>
If Agassi pulls out, he will be replaced by Greg Rusedski of
Britain, who would play Rios on Thursday. Corretja plays Henman
and Sampras meets Karol Kucera of Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov beat Kucera 6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 6-2 in the last match
Wednesday and improved to 1-1. Kucera dropped to 0-2.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Plunge to New Low as OPEC Offers No Hope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- World oil prices sank to new
12-year lows on Wednesday as the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) was unable to trim the record oil glut
and Iraqi oil sales looked set to continue.
</P>
<P>
World benchmark Brent crude oil futures tumbled sharply on
Wednesday. The contract closed at $10.90 a barrel, having earlier
in the day dipped to $10.65, the lowest level for Brent crude
since 1986.
</P>
<P>
This happened when Opec Ministers meeting in Vienna were
believed to extend existing output curbs by another six months
rather than cutting deeper into supply.
</P>
<P>
A draft OPEC communique being prepared on Wednesday referred to
the possibility of extra cuts but only after ministers review
output in March, Reuters quoted a delegate as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iraq said it accepted the fifth round of an
"oil-for-food" deal with the United Nations, thus making an
extended gap in oil exports from Baghdad this Winter unlikely.
</P>
<P>
Oil traders said the OPEC deal, which extends existing
production cuts by six months, won't do enough to rescue the oil
market next year from burgeoning supply, brimming oil storage
tanks and sluggish demand.
</P>
<P>
"The current cuts are just not taking enough oil off the
market. They are going to have to deal with the same problem next
year," Glenn Murray of oil brokers Azur SA in France was quoted by
Reuters as saying.
</P>
<P>
A cold Winter in the Western consuming nations might help boost
demand and bite into stocks in the short-term but any deal will
"certainly not solve the stock problem," said Nigel Saperia of
Bankers Trust in London.
</P>
<P>
OPEC agreed earlier this year to cut 2.6 million barrels per
day (bpd) or some 10 percent of its total production until the
middle of next year. The new agreement looks set to extend those
cuts until the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
OPEC, once a mighty oil producers' cartel, has been stunned by
the huge drop in oil prices that has driven Brent to an average of
$13.66 so far this year, the lowest average since 1976.

<HEADLINE> German Worries About Kurdish Violence over Ocalan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 25 (Xinhua)--Germany fears that its security
would be jeopardized if Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan were
to be extradited to Germany, Deutsche Presse-Agentur (dpa)
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was detained in Rome on November 12 on the basis of an
international arrest warrant issued by Germany where he is wanted
on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
The detention triggered a row between Italy and Turkey after
Rome refused to extradite Ocalan to Ankara.
</P>
<P>
German government announced last Friday it would not seek
Ocalan's extradition from Rome, leaving Italy to find an answer to
the conundrum.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the European Union and the U.S. have criticized the
unexplained German stance.
</P>
<P>
Sources who declined to be named told dpa that the main reason
was fear that Turks and Kurds would start fighting one another on
German soil if Ocalan was on trial in the country.
</P>
<P>
But Party spokesmen on Police and legal affairs denied to dpa
that the government was worried Ocalan might be acquitted by a
German court.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot conceive of that happening,"said one who asked to
remain anonymous, "That's way off."
</P>
<P>
At the federal Justice Ministry, a spokesman also agreed there
was a solid case against Ocalan of ordering murders and arsons. It
would merely be up to a judge to link the chain of command back to
Ocalan, the head of the Kurdish Workers Party(PKK),which was
banned in Germany in 1993.
</P>
<P>
It said around 50,000 Kurds residing in Germany are ready to
obey orders from Ocalan who holds his supporters in an "iron grip"
and could spark widespread violence.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, tens of thousands of Kurds pushed for
self-determination by blocking German highways, hitting police
with burning sticks,threatening German politicians with murder but
then condemning the use of Violence.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Train Colombian Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen is to visit Colombia and pledge to help train the
Colombian military in human rights and judicial reform, said a
Pentagon official Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, made the
statement at a background briefing in laying out Cohen's trip to
the region next week.
</P>
<P>
The United States now prohibits U.S. military support and
anti-drug financial aid for Colombian army units accused of
abuses.
</P>
<P>
Since Colombia's new president, Andres Pastrana, took power in
August, the Clinton administration has been boosting efforts to
help weed out corruption in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government supports the peace process and the efforts
that President Pastrana is making to draw to a close a civil
conflict which has lasted over 30 years down there," said the
official.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton pledged to offer the support when
Pastrana visited the United States this fall.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Cohen will travel to Cartagena, Colombia, to meet
with Pastrana and Defense Minister Rodrigo Lloreda and to
participate in a conference of defense officials from 33 nations
in the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also will hold bilateral talks with defense ministers
from Argentina, Chile and Brazil during three days of meetings,
Monday through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Pastrana and Cohen are expected to discuss the peace
process and anti-drug cooperation, including the possibly of the
U.S. military working directly with a Colombian military unit to
battle narcotics, the senior defense official said.
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, in a meeting with U.S. defense officials, the
Colombian defense minister agreed to move forward on a program to
"support human rights training and judicial reform within the
Colombian military," according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military spends 30 million U.S. dollars to 40 million
U.S. dollars a year on anti-drug efforts in Colombia and one
million to two million U.S. dollars on training its military, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Congress has approved 600 million U.S. dollars for more
anti-drug efforts around the world so spending in Colombia and the
Americas will likely increase this year, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The military has cleared two of eight Colombian Army brigades
to receive U.S. funds, but two have been placed out of bounds
because of abuses, the official said.
</P>
<P>
At this year's conference, Cohen is expected to seek
suggestions about where to locate a new, U.S.-operated
anti-narcotics center.
</P>
<P>
Panama has rejected keeping the center past the end of the
century when the U.S. military will withdraw.

Suriname and the largest loan ever for the country.
</P>
<P>
The resources will be used to support a reform program that

</P>
<P>
The major objective of the program is to promote sustainable
economic development and market-driven resource allocation by
improving the country's economic policy and institutional
framework.
</P>
<P>
The program will eliminate unnecessary and nontransparent
administrative controls in external trade and in the rice
subsector, as well as in the environmental area. It will also
support improved food safety, management of toxic agrochemicals
and sustainable forestry management.

WASHINGTON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
mourned the murder of liberal Russian lawmaker Galina Starovoitova
and warned against the rise of anti-Semitism and extremism in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement released Wednesday, Clinton saluted
Starovoitova, a leader of the Russia's reformist Democratic Choice
party who was gunned down last week, as an early advocate for
democratic change during Soviet rule.
</P>
<P>
Her assassination was "an assault on the Russian people's
aspirations to build a society that is peaceful, tolerant and
governed by the rule of law," said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"It is a terrible loss for friends of democracy around the
world," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The president added that he was "troubled by recent expressions
of anti-Semitism and extremism in Russia."
</P>
<P>
The United States would "continue to stand with those who, like
Ms. Starovoytova, have been leading Russia toward a more
pluralistic, more tolerant future," he said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton's top national security officials discussed the situation
in Iraq for 90 minutes on Wednesday without making any major
decisions, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger met Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, Defense Secretary William Cohen, Director
George Tenet of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and others,
said National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley.
</P>
<P>
The officials met for 90 minutes as part of an effort to
"continue following developments in Iraq," but made no decisions.
</P>
<P>
U.N. weapons inspectors returned to Baghdad last week after
Iraq, under threat of U.S.-British air strikes, rescinded its
decision to prohibit inspections.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government refused to turn over the documents
requested by U.N. inspectors last week, saying that such documents
do not exist.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have said a strike against Iraq
could be activated at any time without permission from the U.N.
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
However, the two countries have made clear that denial of
weapons documents alone would not be enough for bombing raids and
routine and intrusive ground inspections would have to be
conducted first.

<HEADLINE> Alcohol Consumption Related to Substance in Brain: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Alcohol consumption, and
resistance to its effects, are related to concentrations of a
substance called neuropeptide Y (NPY), at least in rats and mice,
scientists said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
NPY, a naturally occurring substance in the brain that acts to
modulate the activities of neurons, can promote feeding, reduces
anxiety-associated behaviour and helps in learning and memory.
</P>
<P>
Mice unable to make their own NPY drink more alcohol than
normal and are less sensitive to its effects, Todd Thiele of the
University of Washington, the United States, and colleagues, have
found.
</P>
<P>
Their study, published in the scientific journal Nature, also
showed that genetically engineered mice that produce more NPY than
normal prefer not to drink alcohol, and are more prone to succumb
to its effects when they do.
</P>
<P>
"These data are direct evidence that alcohol consumption and
resistance are inversely proportional to concentrations of NPY in
the brain." the researchers concluded.
</P>
<P>
Although the research was restricted to rats and mice,
scientists believe it may shed some light on why some people are
more prone to alcoholism and alcohol abuse than others.

PARIS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
said here on Wednesday that he is determined to establish an
independent Palestinian state on May 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
He made the declaration after meeting French President Jacques
Chirac and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who is here to attend

<P>
"I should say clearly the importance that we attach to the
establishment of our Palestinian state at the end of the interim

</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo agreements, signed by Israel and
Palestinians in 1993, the occupied territories should have a
definite status after an interim period ends on May 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Israel is opposed to the idea of an independent Palestinian
state, while Palestinians prefer an independent state.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that France supports Palestinians to exercise their
right of self-determination by establishing an independent state.

LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Steady progress was being made
in the Northern Ireland peace process despite fears of an impasse,
a British government spokesman said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He admitted the talks were "at a difficult juncture" but said
some forward movement had been made towards setting up the
North-South cross border bodies, an integral part of the Good
Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair met all the main parties in Belfast,
capital of Northern Ireland, during his lengthy talks to try to
narrow the gap between nationalists and unionists over the shape
of the new shadow executive for the Northern Ireland Assembly and
cross-border bodies.
</P>
<P>
Blair said earlier: "I believe we can make progress, I believe
that the parties to the agreement want to make the agreement
work."
</P>
<P>
He added: "I'm going to do everything I can to push it on and
to keep the momentum going."
</P>
<P>
But Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams added his voice to the growing
concern around the peace process earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Emerging for a meeting with Blair, he said: "No-one likes the
word crisis, but this is a serious situation."
</P>
<P>
"Clearly the creditability of the agreement comes more and more
into question as the drift continues.
</P>
<P>
"People are concerned that the promise of the Good Friday
Agreement has been stymied by unreconstructed unionists," he said.

BONN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana met German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer in Bonn
Wednesday evening for talks on Kosovo and NATO alliance policies,

The meeting came two days after Fischer proposed that the North

tactical option of first use of nuclear weapons against an enemy.

Solana was expected to discuss measures to provide protection
for the some 2,000 civilian observers of the Organization for

Kosovo to monitor withdrawal of Yugoslav forces and the return of
refugees.

Solana is due Thursday in Macedonia where the protection force
