<HEADLINE> Six Die in German Train Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- An overnight express train derailed early Sunday
near Cologne, killing at least six people aboard and injuring dozens,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   The train was on its way from Amsterdam, the Netherlands, to Basel,
Switzerland, when the engine and several cars went off the tracks shortly after
midnight near the town of Bruehl. One of the cars flipped onto its side, German
railways spokesman Manfred Ziegerath said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said six people were killed and 48 injured, including 18 seriously.
However, Ziegerath said earlier that more than 100 people were injured, about 20
of them seriously.
</P>
<P>
	   About 250 to 300 other people were unhurt on the nine-car train, which
derailed on a stretch where it had to cross a series of switches because of
track work, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cologne police spokesman Peter Massen said 30 rescue vehicles were on the
scene of the crash, which occurred at 12:13 a.m. local time south of Cologne.
Four helicopters were also dispatched to the scene to transport the injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Railway authorities and prosecutors were investigating the cause of the
crash, Ziegerath said.

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves 105, Nuggets 97, OT  </HEADLINE>

<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- Kevin Garnett scored six of his 30 points in overtime, and
the Minnesota Timberwolves rallied from a 13-point deficit with three minutes
left in regulation to beat the Denver Nuggets 105-97 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Garnett's 12-foot jumper with 1.1 seconds left in the fourth quarter forced
the extra session.
</P>
<P>
	   Two free throws by George McCloud gave Denver an 84-71 lead with 3:06
remaining in regulation. Minnesota scored the next 11 points in a 17-4 run that
produced an 88-88 tie.
</P>
<P>
	   Garnett's three-point play on a jumper in the lane made it 86-all. After two
free throws by Cory Alexander, Garnett tied it.
</P>
<P>
	   Garnett had six straight points for Minnesota in overtime, including an
18-foot jumper that made it 97-92 with 1:31 to go. Anthony Peeler hit 4-of-4
free throws in the final 17 seconds to ice it.
</P>
<P>
	   Garnett also had 14 rebounds. Bobby Jackson had 20 points and Peeler 17.
</P>
<P>
	   Denver rookie James Posey scored a career-high 23 points. Antonio McDyess
and Raef LaFrentz had 20 points and 13 points, respectively, before both fouled
out late in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Both teams were without their starting point guards. Denver's Nick Van Exel
missed the game after aggravating a groin injury in Friday night's loss to
Golden State. Minnesota's Terrell Brandon missed his fourth straight game with a
sprained left ankle.
</P>
<P>
	   Each team missed its first six shots and shot 33 percent in the first
quarter that ended with Denver leading 26-23. After the early drought, the
Nuggets mounted a 14-2 run, highlighted by two 3-pointers from Posey, to take a
16-8 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Denver started the second quarter 0-for-7 and Minnesota 0-for-6 before
Jackson's three-point play with 8:43 left. Jackson's subsequent free throw gave
the Timberwolves a 27-26 lead, but Denver outscored the cold-shooting Wolves
20-6 the remainder of the period for a 46-33 lead at halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Minnesota shot just 17 percent (4-for-23) in the period.
</P>
<P>
	   Denver expanded its lead to 18 in the third quarter on Posey's fastbreak
slam, making it 57-39 midway through the period. Posey's steal and layup at the
end of the period gave Denver a 70-53 margin.
</P>
<P>
	   Peeler's 3-point basket and his layup after Jackson's steal got Minnesota
started on its fourth-quarter rally.

<HEADLINE> Prada Reaches America's Cup Finals  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- When the boats set sail for the America's Cup
later this month, America won't be there.
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in the Cup's 150-year history, no U.S. boat will compete in
the finals.
</P>
<P>
	Prada skipper Francesco de Angelis made sure of that Sunday, sailing
brilliantly and beating AmericaOne by 49 seconds to give the Italians a 5-4
triumph in the best-of-9 challenger finals.
</P>
<P>
	Prada capped its comeback from a 4-3 deficit and advanced to face defending
champion New Zealand in the best-of-9 Cup finals starting Feb. 19 for the shiny
silver pitcher that is sailing's top prize.
</P>
<P>
	De Angelis wrapped his hands around a huge bottle of champagne after putting an
Italian boat in position to win the America's Cup for the first time.
</P>
<P>
	AmericaOne skipper Paul Cayard, his mood as gray as the clouds over the Hauraki
Gulf, headed for port with no races left to sail.
</P>
<P>
	One race lasting barely two hours and covering just 18 1/2 miles had reversed
150 years of America's Cup history.
</P>
<P>
	``Italy put up $100 million in 2 1/2 years to beat us in one race,'' said
Cayard, loser in all three of his Cup campaigns as a skipper.
</P>
<P>
	His campaign lasted half as long and cost less than half the money but he
nearly reached the final round as he won three straight races. But de Angelis
forced a deciding ninth race with Saturday's 37-second victory.
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, de Angelis led at every mark on the six-leg, up-and-back course with
three legs into the wind and three with the breeze blowing from behind. He was
in front by 1:06 with just one 3 1/4-mile downwind leg remaining.
</P>
<P>
	Cayard had a chance to catch him. A very slim one. He needed a catastrophe to
befall Prada's equipment.
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Italians had a celebration.
</P>
<P>
	As de Angelis cruised across the finish line, his crew members shook hands and
embraced. A passenger on Prada's tender waved an Italian flag as the boat, which
carries non-sailing team members, pulled alongside.
</P>
<P>
	One Prada sailor popped the cork on a champagne bottle and soaked his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
	Patrizio Bertelli, the primary backer of the campaign, wore a red vest and a
wide smile as he boarded the yacht and shook hands vigorously with de Angelis.
</P>
<P>
	Then the winning skipper lifted the bottle of champagne and took a long drink.
</P>
<P>
	As hard as he tried, Cayard, sailing for the St. Francis Yacht Club in San
Francisco, could do nothing about it. He admitted that being chief executive
officer and primary fund-raiser of an America's Cup campaign for the first time
may have been too much.
</P>
<P>
	``I had a little too much on my plate also this time and probably wasn't as
good a sailor this time around as I was in '95 and '92,'' he said, ``but I like
the (America's Cup) game. I like the organization. I am very proud of what
AmericaOne did.''
</P>
<P>
	He didn't rule out another Cup campaign, in Auckland or the Mediterranean if
Prada beats New Zealand, but said the Americans would have a better chance if
they had fewer syndicates. There were five American campaigns among the original
11 challenger syndicates representing seven countries.
</P>
<P>
	In Cayard's two previous campaigns as helmsman, he lost in the challenger
finals in 1992 and the Cup finals in 1995. But he's also a six-time world
champion in other boats and won the grueling Whitbread Round the World Race in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	Prada won the start by a second Sunday, a meaningless edge. But the stronger
wind on Prada's side of the course pushed it to a 34-second lead after the first
leg, into the wind.
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted the right (side) real hard and we got the right,'' Cayard said.
``It didn't work out for us on the first'' leg.
</P>
<P>
	The early lead allowed de Angelis to dictate tactics and he stretched the
advantage to 39 seconds after the second leg and 47 midway through the race.
</P>
<P>
	He kept pushing and flew to the horizon with leads of 52 seconds after the
fourth leg and 1:06 after the fifth.
</P>
<P>
	Prada had taken a 3-1 lead in the series, but two of those wins resulted from
equipment damage and a penalty on AmericaOne. Then AmericaOne won the next three
races, reinforcing Cayard's reputation as a skipper who can't be rattled.
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, he was at the helm of an Italian boat, Il Moro di Venezia, that
trailed the challenger finals 3-1. But he won the next four races and went on to
the Cup finals, where he lost 4-1 to Bill Koch's Stars &AMP; Stripes.
</P>
<P>
	He couldn't repeat that comeback this time.
</P>
<P>
	The race began 50 minutes late as officials waited for the fluky winds to pick
up. They finally did, blowing from the southwest at 10-14 knots at the start.
</P>
<P>
	About 30 seconds before the start, a Prada crewman warned de Angelis that he
might reach the starting line too early. ``Be careful,'' the sailor said.
</P>
<P>
	De Angelis was.
</P>
<P>
	The United States won the first 25 competitions, starting in 1851 when the
schooner America, representing the New York Yacht Club, beat 14 other boats in
one race around the Isle of Wight in England.
</P>
<P>
	At the time, the trophy presented to the winner was called the 100 Guineas Cup,
the amount it cost. It later was renamed for the first winner.
</P>
<P>
	The first defense came in 1870, a 35-mile race off New York City with 14 NYYC
boats going against England's Cambria, which finished 10th. Magic was the
winner.
</P>
<P>
	There were 11 more successful defenses in New York before the scene shifted to
Newport, R.I., in 1920. American boats won 13 consecutive defenses there. But
the nation's streak of 25 Cup triumphs ended in 1983 in Newport when John
Bertrand's Australia II beat Dennis Conner's Liberty.
</P>
<P>
	Conner regained the Cup in Fremantle, Australia, in 1987 and Americans retained
it in 1988 and 1992 before New Zealand swept Young America, skippered by Cayard,
5-0 in San Diego in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	If Cayard wants to keep trying, he'll have to sail in hostile waters again.

<HEADLINE> Singh Takes Lead at Pebble Beach  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG FERGUSON AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Oblivious to Tiger Woods' streak and fickle
weather that either blew rain in his face or cast long shadows in the afternoon,
Vijay Singh went about his business Saturday and wound up leading the Pebble
Beach National Pro-Am.
</P>
<P>
	   Singh saved several good pars in a bogey-free round of 5-under 67 at Pebble
Beach, giving him 133 over two rounds and a one-stroke lead over Notah Begay.
</P>
<P>
	   Begay also played Pebble and had a 68, although his round of eight birdies
and four bogeys was far from the consistency Singh displayed on a day that
featured everything the Monterey Peninsula has to offer -- clouds, wind, rain,
sunshine.
</P>
<P>
	   Adding to a difficult second round was the pace of play -- close to six
hours for most foursomes.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was tough to concentrate, and I did it well today," said Begay, who has
a one-week jail sentence awaiting him for drunken driving at the end of the West
Coast swing.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of rain and high wind earlier in the week, the third round will be
played Sunday and the final round -- weather permitting -- on Monday. A year
ago, the final round was washed out and Payne Stewart was a 54-hole champion.
</P>
<P>
	   If that holds true again -- Pebble has had only one 72-hole tournament the
past four years -- then Woods has his work cut out if he wants to match Ben
Hogan's six-tournament winning streak in 1948.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods had a new driver in his bag Saturday after the head snapped off his
regular one the day before. What hurt him more was the putter, several birdie
chances escaping him at Spyglass Hill. Woods was even-par for his round -- seven
strokes behind -- with two holes left.
</P>
<P>
	   It could have been worse. David Duval also played Spyglass and tumbled out
of contention. He made his first bogey of the week on his opening hole -- with a
wedge in his hand -- and was 4-over going into the 18th.
</P>
<P>
	   Matt Gogel, a Nike Tour grad who played in the final group in the Bob Hope
Classic two weeks ago, had a 68 at Poppy Hills and was at 137.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods' PGA Tour winning streak dates to the NEC Invitational in August.
Begay says there's no bounty for the player who can stop it, but he did offer
some perspective from when they were teammates at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you can beat Tiger, usually you're going to bear the lead," Begay said.
"That's how it was in school. If I can just beat him, I know I'm either going to
win the tournament or I'm going to be right there."
</P>
<P>
	   That's not Singh's approach.
</P>
<P>
	   The former PGA champion couldn't care less about Woods' streak, or the
weather, or if he got a break by not having to play Pebble in even stronger wind
that knocked out so many other players on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not really worried about his streak," Singh said. "I'm just going to go
out there and try to win the golf tournament. Sooner or later, somebody is going
to break that."
</P>
<P>
	   Singh was at peace with himself throughout the round, especially with his
putter. He is one of the best when he gets it going with the flat stick, and his
assessment over two rounds should make him a good candidate to win this week.
</P>
<P>
	   "I haven't putted this consistently for two days for a while," he said. "I'm
not fighting anything. I pick a line and hit it, instead of worrying about how
much it's going to break."
</P>
<P>
	   Tied with Begay and Duval to start the second round, he got off to a quick
start with short birdie putts on Nos. 2 and 4, a 12-foot bunker shot he holed on
the par-3 fifth, and a 7-iron from 102 yards to 15 feet on the par-3 seventh.
</P>
<P>
	   Begay might be leading if not for the par-3s. He bogeyed three of them,
including No. 17, when he tried to finesse a 4-iron into the wind that came up
some 30 yards short.
</P>
<P>
	   "Embarrassing," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   All was not lost. He did manage eight birdies on a tough day at Pebble, and
has a chance to win for the third time in his last 12 PGA Tour events.
</P>
<P>
	   For all that he's been through over the past couple of weeks, Begay would
like to be noticed for his golf instead of his problems off the course.
</P>
<P>
	   He pleaded guilty to aggravated drunken driving in New Mexico, although he
has earned high praise for the way he has owned to his mistake. He'll spend a
week in jail right after the Match Play Championship.
</P>
<P>
	   "I realize I'm really lucky to be out here, and I appreciate the opportunity
to just compete," he said. "With the court's decision behind me, maybe I just
need to win this so I can give someone else something to write about."
</P>
<P>
	   DIVOTS: The tournament is sponsored by AT&AMP;T. ... Ken Griffey Jr. hit a
wedge to about 40 feet on the 121-yard 15th hole at Spyglass Hill. Then he put
another ball just inside that -- by throwing it from the tee. ... Lift, clean
and place has been in effect since the start of the tournament. The last time
the ball was played down at Pebble was in 1992. ... Gary Nicklaus was at 4-under
until making two double bogeys on the back nine at Poppy Hills. He finished at
1-over 145. ... The last player to go wire to wire at Pebble -- at least a share
of the lead after every round -- was Tom Shaw in 1971.

<HEADLINE> 19-year-old Columbia sophomore found dead in dorm, boyfriend kills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Columbia University sophomore lacrosse player from
Long Island was found dead in her dorm room on Saturday, and her boyfriend, a
suspect in her death, died hours later after throwing himself in front of a
subway train, police said.
<P>
	   The body of Kathleen Roskot, 19, of Bayshore, was found by a resident
assistant and campus security in Roskot's dormitory, Ruggles Hall, on West 114th
Street, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Roskot was found naked on the floor of her bedroom. She had been stabbed
once in the neck, and authorities said a kitchen knife believed to be the weapon
was found in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas Nelford, 23, believed to be Roskot's boyfriend, died after jumping in
front of a No. 1 train around 3:30 p.m. at the station at 181st street, said New
York Police Assistant Chief William Taylor.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor said Nelford, who was from Oxnard, Calif., had attended Columbia
until 1998 and had been known to stay in Roskot's suite from time to time. The
suites have rooms for four to seven students who share a common living room.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the couple had come home around 12:30 a.m. Saturday, and that
some kind of disturbance had been heard around an hour later. When the man's
body was found, he was carrying Roskot's wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor was unsure when the boyfriend left.
</P>
<P>
	   "The room was a mess," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lashauna Cutts, a Bronx sophomore who shared the suite, said she had heard
something around 1:30 a.m. from her bedroom, but didn't think anything of it
because the suite was often used for parties.
</P>
<P>
	   She didn't know anything was going on until someone told her of the problem
in the afternoon and she saw blood in the hallway.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it must have been something personal," she said, wiping away tears.
</P>
<P>
	   A friend of Rosket's boyfriend, who wouldn't give his name, said he and his
housemates had kicked him out of their home where he had been living about a
year ago because he was unstable and "strung out on drugs."
</P>
<P>
	   The resident assistant in the woman's dormitory called security when she was
notified that Roskot had failed to show up for lacrosse practice Saturday
morning, said Suzanne Trimel, a Columbia spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
	   The assistant and security guards found Roskot's body and called police just
after 2 p.m., according to Trimel. She was declared dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
	   The death occurred a block from the apartment where a 26-year-old Columbia
Law School student, Lynda Hong, was killed in 1998. Police charged an
ex-boyfriend with slashing her throat, but he pleaded innocent and blamed
another of his girlfriends.

night.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the Clippers' first game since Chris Ford was fired as head coach and
replaced on an interim basis by assistant Jim Todd. It also marked the debut of
former defensive specialist Dennis Johnson, an owner of three NBA championship
rings, as Clippers assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Finley had 19 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists as the Dallas won
for the sixth time in seven games. With their 19th victory, the Mavericks
matched their win total from last season, which was shortened to 50 games by a
lockout.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas made 10 3-pointers in beating the Clippers for the fifth straight
time.
</P>
<P>
	   Maurice Taylor scored 17 points for the Clippers, who lost for the 17th time
in 19 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas never trailed, shooting 55 percent in the first half en route to a
67-51 lead. Cedric Ceballos paced the Mavericks in the half with 15 points,
Nowitzki contributed 13, and Strickland hit a 3-pointer with less than a second
on the clock.
</P>
<P>
	   Derek Anderson, who scored a career-high 35 points in a losing cause against
the Mavericks on Jan. 27 at Reunion Arena, missed nine of his first 10 shots --
including a slam-dunk attempt with 5:56 to play -- and finished with seven
points.

<P>
    LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Kaspars Kambala had 20 points and 11 rebounds as UNLV beat
a ranked team for the first time this season, downing No. 19 Utah 72-66 Saturday
night
</P>
<P>
	   The Rebels had lost to Top 25 opponents North Carolina, Oklahoma State, and
Cincinnati before defeating the Utes.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Dickel scored 18 points for the Rebels (14-5, 5-2 Mountain West).
Freshman Dalron Johnson had 17 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Alex Jensen led Utah (17-4, 6-1) with 19 points and 11 rebounds. Hanno
Mottola added 16 points and Tony Harvey scored 12.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah, which is 0-4 on the road, trailed most of the game, but tied it at 61
with 5:57 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rebels didn't get a basket the rest of the game, and made only 11-of-20
free throws in that span. Still, it was enough as the Utes could only muster
Jensen's 3-pointer and a late field goal from Jeff Johnsen.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah turned the ball over three times and missed four shots in the final
five minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   "The effort was there, the focus was there," UNLV head coach Bill Bayno
said. "Together as a team it was the best it's ever been."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rebels led 39-31 at halftime. Johnson had 13 points, including nine in a
13-point run midway through the first half.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Set To Defend Cup  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Team New Zealand tinkered with its equipment,
sailed its boats and had plenty of time to wonder just how good it would be in
its first America's Cup defense.
</P>
<P>
	It's about to find out.
</P>
<P>
	Sunday marked the end of the intense, best-of-9 challenger finals in which
Prada of Italy beat AmericaOne by 49 seconds for a 5-4 win. That signaled the
start of the next phase of the Kiwis' campaign, the best-of-9 series for
sailing's top prize -- an ornate silver pitcher with no bottom.
</P>
<P>
	``We are ready to go racing,'' New Zealand skipper Russell Coutts said before
Sunday's race.
</P>
<P>
	The challenger trials began on Oct. 18 with 11 boats from seven countries. Team
New Zealand chose not to have a defender series so it missed the competitive
racing that would sharpen its sailing.
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it took its own two boats out on the Hauraki Gulf, and did what it
could to improve in preparation for the finals starting Feb. 19 on that same
body of water.
</P>
<P>
	``In match racing, you can't practice all the moves. There are a lot of moves
that are unexpected. There are a lot of moves that you're reacting to the other
boat,'' Coutts said in a local television interview. ``We would have liked to
have had an outside competition but didn't this time and I think it is an
advantage for the challengers.''
</P>
<P>
	But with a small nation of about 4 million people, New Zealand syndicate head
Sir Peter Blake didn't think there would be enough financial support for two
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	When Blake won the Cup in San Diego in 1995, with Coutts at the helm, they had
plenty of practice since they were challenging and participated in the trials.
</P>
<P>
	New Zealand's boat that year, Black Magic, was the fastest by far. It swept the
finals 5-0 over Young America, skippered by Paul Cayard, who was driving
AmericaOne this time. The victory margins were huge -- 2 minutes, 45 seconds,
4:14, 1:51, 3:37 and 1:50.
</P>
<P>
	The differences probably won't be that great again, but the Kiwis will have to
wait until the first race of the Cup finals to see how they match up.
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say I'm really worried about any aspect,'' Coutts said. ``Across the
board, we're well prepared. I guess it's the unknown that you always worry about
and being surprised and we've done our best to not be surprised.''
</P>
<P>
	There is some suspicion that New Zealand might be weaker in light air than
strong wind, but all Coutts would say was, ``we're working on all aspects of our
program.''
</P>
<P>
	Starting with a race in 1851 around the Isle of Wight in England that the
schooner America won, U.S. boats won all 25 competitions until Australia won in
1983 in Newport, R.I., the 13th consecutive time the Cup was contested there.
</P>
<P>
	New Zealand's first participation was in 1987 off Fremantle, Australia, where
it lost the challenger finals to Dennis Conner's Stars &AMP; Stripes. It lost the
next year in San Diego to Conner's catamaran. In 1992, the Kiwis' boat -- the
Red Sled -- lost the challenger finals to Il Moro di Venezia, skippered by
Cayard.
</P>
<P>
	Now, they are the defenders.
</P>
<P>
	The Auckland waterfront was transformed into a bustling mix of chic sidewalk
cafes with street entertainers, a maritime museum and retail shops. Modern
facilities were built for all the syndicates, side by side.
</P>
<P>
	Coutts would like to use them again to defend the Cup.
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to keep it for a long time,'' he said. ``It's difficult but it's
definitely doable, and we would like to eventually have a similar situation to
what Newport, R.I. had.''

Alaska Jet Lands After Problem
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   RENO, Nev. (AP) -- An Alaska Airlines MD-80 jet returned to Reno's airport
shortly after takeoff on Saturday night after its pilot reported problems
similar to those under investigation in Monday's crash off the California coast,
officials said. The Seattle-bound flight left Reno/Tahoe International Airport
at about 7 p.m. and returned after about eight minutes later after the pilot
reported motors controlling the plane's horizontal stabilizer were operating
improperly, said Jack Evans, an Alaska Airlines spokesman. Investigators are
looking into possible problems with the stabilizer on Alaska Flight 261, an
MD-83 which crashed on Monday in the Pacific Ocean north of Los Angeles, killing
88 people.

Crash Victim's Ring Given to Family

	   POULSBO, Wash. (AP) -- A California fisherman who recovered a Masonic ring
belonging to a victim of last week's Alaska Airlines crash presented it to the
man's children Saturday. The ring's owner, Bob Williams, and his wife, Patty,
died along with 86 others aboard Flight 261 from Puerto Vallarta when the plane
went down Monday off the coast of southern California. The ring has become a
meaningful symbol for the remaining family members, said Williams' daughter,
Tracy Knizek.

Seven Die in German Train Crash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   BRUEHL, Germany (AP) -- An overnight express train derailed early Sunday
near Cologne, killing at least seven passengers and injuring more than 100,
authorities said. The sleeper train, headed from Amsterdam, the Netherlands, to
Basel, Switzerland with about 300 passengers, went off the tracks shortly after
midnight at a switch in the small town of Bruehl, south of Cologne, German
railways spokesman Manfred Ziegerath said. The engine tumbled down an embankment
and crashed through the garage of a house, but the people inside were unscathed,
police said. Most of those killed had been either in a car that fell down the
embankment or another that hit a steel post, officials said.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A university student was found dead in her dorm room on
Saturday, and her boyfriend, considered a suspect in her death, died hours later
after throwing himself in front of a subway train, police said. Kathleen Roskot,
19, a Columbia University student from Long Island, was found dead in her
bedroom with a stab wound to the neck, police said. She was discovered by a
resident assistant after she failed to show up for lacrosse practice, Columbia
spokeswoman Suzanne Trimel said. Authorities said a kitchen knife believed to be
the weapon had been left in a bathroom.

IRA's Disarmament in Doubt
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Irish Republican Army commanders said
Saturday that British and Protestant demands will not influence whether or not
they disarm, leaving the centerpiece of Northern Ireland's peace accord, the
Protestant-Catholic government, in continued peril. The British government says
it intends to strip the 9-week-old coalition Cabinet of its powers on Friday if
the IRA doesn't promise to disarm. The province's Cabinet was formed two months
ago following a Sinn Fein-Ulster Unionist deal brokered by American mediator
George Mitchell.

Poll: McCain Catches Bush in S.C.

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Time/CNN poll released Saturday says John McCain has
rallied from a 20-percent point deficit against George W. Bush in South Carolina
and is now in a statistical draw. The latest poll found McCain the choice of 44
percent of likely Republican voters in the Feb. 19 primary, compared with Bush's
40 percent. Nationally, a Newsweek poll showed a major surge by McCain after a
resounding victory in New Hampshire, but found he still was far behind the Texas
governor.

Magic Defeat the Pacers 107-102
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Reserve Chucky Atkins scored 15 of his 17 points in
the fourth quarter as the Orlando Magic snapped Indiana's four-game winning
streak with a 107-102 victory Saturday night. John Amaechi had 19 points and Pat
Garrity added 18 for the Magic, but it was Atkins who came through down the
stretch. The backup point guard scored seven of Orlando's last nine points,
including a driving one-hand runner that put his team up 103-97 with 49 seconds
to go. Jalen Rose led Indiana with 25 points, however the Pacers only got 13
from Reggie Miller on 3-for-8 shooting to lose for the fifth straight time on
the road.

	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Prada skipper Francesco de Angelis sailed
brilliantly Sunday, beating AmericaOne by 49 seconds in the deciding race of the
America's Cup challenger finals. So for the first time in the Cup's 150-year
history, no U.S. boat will compete in the finals. Prada capped its comeback from
a 4-3 deficit and advanced to face defending champion New Zealand in the
best-of-9 Cup finals starting Feb. 19 for the shiny silver pitcher that is
sailing's top prize.

<HEADLINE> Seven Die in German Train Crash  </HEADLINE>
   By JOACHIM SONDERMANN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRUEHL, Germany (AP) -- A European night train hurtled off the tracks early
Sunday in a southern suburb of Cologne, killing at least seven passengers and
injuring more than 100, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   One car toppled down an embankment and another was crushed against a steel
post when the sleeper train derailed shortly after midnight at a switch in the
small town of Bruehl, German railways spokesman Manfred Ziegerath said.
</P>
<P>
	   The train was heading from Amsterdam, the Netherlands, to Basel, Switzerland
with about 300 passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   Scores of rescue workers using heavy equipment and dogs broke open the
mangled blue coaches and combed the debris throughout the night. As day broke
over the floodlit scene, rescue crews prepared to lift wrecked coaches, under
which police said more dead might be found.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the train's engine had fallen down the embankment, smashed
through the garage of a house but stopped just before the house wall. The people
inside were unscathed.
</P>
<P>
	   Damage was the worst in the second coach, which was pulled with the engine
over the embankment, and in another car that had slammed into a support pole
under the Bruehl station roof.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was already sleeping, and then a big crash woke me up,'' said a woman
living about 300 feet from the crash site who declined to give her name. ``I've
never heard so many sirens.''
</P>
<P>
	   Seven people were killed and 105 were taken to hospitals, including about 20
with serious injuries, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said many young people had been on the train. The train driver was
not injured, but was in shock, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   The nine-car train had just left Cologne main station on one of Germany's
main international routes when it derailed at 12:13 a.m. after crossing a series
of switches to avoid track work, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ziegerath said the train left the tracks at a switch when it returned to the
main line.
</P>
<P>
	   Railway authorities and prosecutors were investigating the cause of the
accident, Germany's deadliest since the June 1998 crash of a high-speed
IntercityExpress that killed 101 people at Eschede. The cause of that crash was
found to be a broken wheel.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday's crash seemed certain to revive questions about German rail safety
lingering since the Eschede disaster. The railways set up a telephone hotline.

<HEADLINE> Syndrome X Solution: Exercise, Diet  </HEADLINE>
    By IRA DREYFUSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Here's another way in which exercise may help a person
avoid an early death -- it fights insulin resistance syndrome, which may affect
millions of American.
</P>
<P>
	   "My guess is 10 percent to 25 percent of the population is
insulin-resistant," said Dr. Robert Sherwin, a professor at Yale School of
Medicine and president-elect of the American Diabetes Association. There are no
statistics on exactly how many people have the condition, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   People with insulin resistance syndrome have double or triple the risk of
heart disease, said Dr. Barbara V. Howard, president of MedStar Research
Institute, a part of the Washington Hospital Center. And virtually everyone who
developed adult-onset diabetes started with insulin resistance, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Insulin resistance syndrome, also known as syndrome X, is a combination of
conditions, some of which can be seen and some of which only show up in medical
tests.
</P>
<P>
	   One which can be seen is overweight -- especially weight over the belt, such
as a pot belly, as opposed to weight around the hips. "It is almost always
associated with the central obesity body pattern," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
	   The other indications show up on blood tests. These include above-normal
cholesterol levels, and higher readings on glucose tests commonly used to check
for diabetes. People with insulin resistance syndrome also may have elevated
blood pressure, Howard said.
</P>
<P>
	   The locus of all these signs and symptoms is a growing inability to use
insulin. Muscle cells become less able to let the hormone guide nutrients
through the cell membrane and into the cells.
</P>
<P>
	   The pancreas tries to overcome the resistance by pumping out more insulin.
</P>
<P>
	   But if the resistance grows, diabetes can result. And cholesterol changes
linked to insulin resistance also can lead to clogged arteries and heart
disease, Sherwin said.
</P>
<P>
	   However, regular, calorie-burning aerobic exercise improves the factors that
insulin resistance syndrome worsens. The cells get better in their ability to
take up insulin. Cholesterol levels and blood pressure retreats. Even the pot
belly shrinks.
</P>
<P>
	   Exercise combined with diet forms one of the best ways to beat insulin
resistance, Sherwin and Howard said. They also conceded it's easier to prescribe
diet and exercise than to see their patients follow the regimen.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you can get a lot of weight loss, you can get them to almost normal
insulin resistance, and the same with very heavy exercise," Howard said. "We
know it's very hard for people to lose weight and keep it off, or do really
vigorous exercise programs."
</P>
<P>
	   Differing approaches to treating syndrome X don't make things easier.
Sherwin stands by vigorous aerobic exercise, at least every other day, at
sweat-producing levels found in an aerobic studio or a treadmill run. Anything
less hasn't been proved to work, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Howard, on the other hand, believes that even brisk walking can accomplish
some good. "We have reasonably good epidemiological data that people who just do
walking have lower rates of diabetes and heart disease," she said. From that,
she inferred that they would have lower risk of insulin resistance syndrome.
</P>
<P>
	   Howard noted that syndrome X has found its way into several new books. One,
by Dr. Burton Berkson of Las Cruces, N.M., is titled "Syndrome X." Berkson
estimated that 65 percent of Americans have some symptom of syndrome X, but he
said this was an indirect calculation based on diseases associated with syndrome
X.
</P>
<P>
	   Berkson calls for fewer refined carbohydrates, such as sugary pastries, and
more nonstarchy vegetables.
</P>
<P>
	   Sherwin and Howard both back eating fewer calories but don't think much of
diets that recommend certain types of foods, such as more protein and less
carbohydrate, or more carbohydrate and less protein. "Varying the distribution
of calories has absolutely no effect at all," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
	   Berkson also disagrees with Sherwin and Howard in recommending more
antioxidants, especially alpha lipoic acid.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent lab studies of rat tissue, mostly in Europe but some in the United
States, have turned up indications that alpha lipoic acid may fight development
of diabetes and heart disease. But Sherwin and Howard see nothing to establish
that it can fight insulin resistance syndrome in people.
</P>
<P>
	   Berkson recommends exercise, but he has some disagreements even with the
coauthors of his book, a nutrition writer and a nutrition counselor. They accept
the idea that moderate exercise can help, but he believes exercise should be
vigorous.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am on a regular exercise program at least three days a week," said
Berkson, who is 60. "I run a mile or two, do curls, do presses, situps and
rowing exercises, and also punch the bag."

<HEADLINE> Cities Press for Precise Census  </HEADLINE>
   By GENARO C. ARMAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mayors smarting from what they contend was a census
undercount in 1990 that cost cities at least $500 million over the past decade
are determined to ensure a more accurate tally this year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This census is very important to us. Obviously, there's a lot at stake,''
said H. Brent Coles, mayor of Boise, Idaho, and vice president of the U.S.
Conference of Mayors.
</P>
<P>
	   A city's share of state and federal dollars for schools, roads, police and
other essential municipal functions depends on its population; more residents,
more money.
</P>
<P>
	   The Census Bureau estimates it undercounted 1.4 percent of the population in
1990, but does not adjust the actual 1990 figures to account for the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayors' group surveyed 34 cities of varying sizes from Los Angeles, with
a population of about 3.6 million, to Lafayette, Ind, a city of about 40,000.
The cities translated the census undercount into lost dollars and estimated a
total loss of $536 million in federal and state funds during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   It generally is agreed it is almost impossible to count every person in the
country. Under dispute is how to account for the ``missing'' people.
</P>
<P>
	   That has led to a battle between Democrats and Republicans over the use of
statistical methods known as sampling to estimate the final count.
</P>
<P>
	   Because many undercounted individuals are presumed to be minorities and
inner-city residents who vote Democratic, the GOP fears sample-adjusted numbers
could be juggled to threaten Republican legislative seats.
</P>
<P>
	   In the cities, the undercounted include the homeless, families living in
crowded apartments and illegal immigrants afraid of turning over information to
the government. Cities also tend to have a higher concentration of renters, who
are more mobile than homeowners.
</P>
<P>
	   Detroit is making perhaps the greatest push for an exact count. Mayor Dennis
Archer has made it a mission to keep his city's population over 1 million. The
latest census estimates have Detroit's population at 970,000, down from 1.03
million in 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan law says Detroit would lose the ability to enforce certain city
taxes if its population drops below a million. The mayors' survey estimated that
would mean an annual loss of more than $176 million.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you look at the estimates, you tend to perceive only the change, and
that's just 4 percent,'' said Patricia Becker, who is in charge of verifying
addresses for the Census Bureau in Detroit. ``But the psychological impression
of a number is much greater than the message it's carrying.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Census Bureau is in the midst of a $167 million advertising campaign to
promote people to mail back their census forms. But the Census Bureau director,
Kenneth Prewitt, says generating interest through local leaders is the key.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Fundamentally, that is a message being carried about by people in the
community who work with alien and immigrant groups. They are the ones who have
to carry the message that this data is confidential,'' Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
	   With the census officially set to kick off April 1, federal and city
officials are racing to ensure they get as accurate a count as possible.
</P>
<P>
	   The job entails everything from going block-by-block to verify addresses to
holding rallies and promotional events so inform residents about the count.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our message really rides on that, because a lot of the federal dollars
that we get really get returned to programming for communities of color and
low-income folks,'' said Mayor Susan Bauman of Madison, Wis.
</P>
<P>
	   But not everyone is convinced the Census Bureau's message will work.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I go back to Tucson, I'm going to find out how are they really going
to do that?'' Robert Walkup, the mayor of the Arizona city, said after attending
a presentation by Prewitt in Washington. ``How do they really know all the
places where people live?
</P>
<P>
	   ``They said that parts of the population's minority groups are suspicious of
filling out forms of any kind and they said, 'We'll just have a program
convincing them that's OK,''' Walkup said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Well, I'm telling you that I know enough about our population, and they'll
need more than just telling them, 'Trust me, it's OK.'''

<HEADLINE> Sinking demonstrates how immersion suits save lives  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   PORTLAND, Maine (AP) - As his trawler filled with seawater and heaved
back and forth in vicious waves, Shawn Rich scrambled to climb into his
immersion suit.
<P>
	   The bulky suit proved to be a lifesaver, keeping the fisherman from freezing
to death as he was tossed about on the rough seas for three hours, awaiting
rescue.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coast Guard credits immersion suits as one of the key factors behind a
dramatic drop in deaths in the fishing fleet.
</P>
<P>
	   The suits are critically important when vessels go down swiftly. Rich
testified last week at a formal inquiry into the sinking of his trawler, Two
Friends, that he didn't even have time to get the life raft into the water
before his 63-foot vessel flooded and capsized.
</P>
<P>
	   "People think a boat sinking takes a lot of time but it doesn't. It can
happen in less than a minute," said Leni Gronros, president of Rockland Boat,
the only place in Maine licensed to repair immersion suits.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coast Guard has required vessels in cold waters to be equipped with
immersion suits since the early 1990s, the same time requirements for emergency
locator devices and life rafts went into effect.
</P>
<P>
	   Together, those three safety items are credited with saving more than 200
lives since 1993 from Maine to northern New Jersey, said Bob Higgins, a Coast
Guard regional fishing vessel safety coordinator in Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of deaths in the fishing industry in the region was cut in half
in the same period, Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Alaskan commercial fishery also has seen a big drop in the number of
deaths because of the safety measures.
</P>
<P>
	   The death rate associated with vessel losses in Alaska dropped from 27
percent to 7 percent between 1991 and 1998 even though the number of sinkings
remained about the same, said Jennifer Lincoln of the National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health.
</P>
<P>
	   The bulky suits, which sell for $250 to $350, are made for a fishermen to
step into while wearing boots and clothes.
</P>
<P>
	   The fisherman gets into the one-size-fits-all suit like overalls, puts his
arms through the sleeves, pulls up the entry zipper, and then positions a hood
and mittens. Air bladders make the suits buoyant, and fishermen are advised to
simply float on their backs until help arrives.
</P>
<P>
	   Unfortunately, many fishermen have complied with the Coast Guard requirement
by tossing the suits aboard a vessel and never thinking about them again,
Gronros said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's viewed as a nuisance to a lot of people and that's too bad," Gronros
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Getting into an immersion suit requires practice and suits that are not
maintained may suffer from dry rot, leaky seams and zippers that do not work,
officials say.
</P>
<P>
	   Rich, the only survivor of the three-member crew, testified at the inquiry
that the Two Friends began taking on water off Cape Neddick on Jan. 25 and
shifted suddenly. Within minutes, it capsized.
</P>
<P>
	   Rich managed to climb into his suit but did not get his head covered because
his sweatshirt interfered.
</P>
<P>
	   The skipper, who died as Rich tried to keep his head afloat, was not able to
get one of his arms into his suit. When the body was recovered, one of his arms
was in a position as if he had been tugging at the zipper, according to a
statement by a Coast Guard swimmer.
</P>
<P>
	   The other victim, Rich's father, got into the suit but was caught under the
vessel when it capsized, Rich testified.
</P>
<P>
	   Stewart Tweed, who works for Rutgers Cooperative Extension, which promotes a
safety program in New Jersey, said it's important for fishermen to conduct
monthly safety drills.
</P>
<P>
	   The two-day course sponsored by Rutgers required fishermen to practice
putting on their immersion suits and to get into a pool wearing the cumbersome
suits, Tweed said.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can have all of the gear in the world, but if you don't know how to use
it, it's not useful," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coast Guard said the inquiry into the Two Friends highlighted some
potential problems with immersion suits and there may be lessons to be learned
in preparedness, said James Shelton, a Coast Guard spokesman who attended an
official inquiry into the sinking.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's one of the things that may come out of this, a stepped-up approach
in terms of training," he said.

<HEADLINE> It's pork to McCain but gold to others in Congress  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - The John McCain road show stops briefly in New Jersey
this week, energized by a huge primary victory in New Hampshire built upon the
candidate's "straight talk" criticism of money in politics and pork-barrel
government spending.
<P>
	   "My gosh, after Tuesday's results (in New Hampshire) that thing is going
bananas," said state Sen. William Schluter, a McCain supporter, describing
ticket sales for this Friday's $500-a-person fundraiser at Fiddler's Elbow
Country Club in Somerset County.
</P>
<P>
	   If the Republican senator from Arizona delivers his standard stump speech,
his New Jersey supporters will hear this from McCain:
</P>
<P>
	   "I will refuse to sign any pork barrel bill that crosses my desk. And if
Congress tries to make me waste your money, I will make sure you know who they
are - every single one of them."
</P>
<P>
	   One lawmaker's pork is another's gold, however.
</P>
<P>
	   The pork that McCain rails against includes funding for some activities
cherished by New Jersey and zealously guarded by its lawmakers in both parties:
cancer research in Toms River, beach replenishment up and down the coast,
military construction projects at Fort Dix and Naval Weapons Station Earle.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's commitment to pork-busting is evident on his official Senate site
on the World Wide Web. A pig rolls a barrel of dollars across the site to
illustrate the senator's devotion to cutting pork-barrel spending.
</P>
<P>
	   Click on the pig and you find long lists of pork projects that McCain railed
against last year. Taken from appropriations bills approved by Congress, the
lists include dozens of earmarked funds for the Garden State.
</P>
<P>
	   They include $500,000 to the State Police for a truck safety initiative,
$400,000 to Monmouth University for a teacher skill project and $2.5 million for
a computer network at Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, $1.5 million to research cancer cases in Toms River and $500,000 for
downtown revitalization in Gloucester County.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, $1.25 million for security improvements at Naval Weapons Station
Earle, $1.16 million for an instrument landing system at Newark International
Airport and more than $17 million to rebuild New Jersey beaches.
</P>
<P>
	   The list goes on. These are the projects that New Jersey lawmakers -
Republicans and Democrats alike - boast about when discussing what they have
done for their districts.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain defines pork as "low-priority, unnecessary, or wasteful spending" on
projects that have not be reviewed in a competitive process. His web site
includes the caveat that McCain's criticism is "not intended to reflect a
judgment on the merits of an item."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked last week about McCain's ideas on pork, two of his leading New Jersey
supporters offered different assessments.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think he's wrong in what he considers pork," said lobbyist Hazel Gluck.
"And when he gets to be president of the United States I think that will
change."
</P>
<P>
	   She continued: "Pork to me is giving money for some project that doesn't
mean anything to anybody. I don't consider replenishing the beaches as pork. I
personally think we look better if we look at the defense department spending
100 bucks for a toilet seat."
</P>
<P>
	   Schluter, R-Mercer, thinks of himself as a McCain-like maverick in the New
Jersey Legislature. He said he agrees with McCain - in theory.
</P>
<P>
	   But in practice, he said, even pork opponents have to grab their share until
the entire system changes.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you don't play by the rules of the system you can get left in the dust,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain may feel the same. Last month, an anti-pork coalition in Washington
gave him only average grades in steering clear of wasteful spending projects
that come before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   "McCain talks the talk, but when it comes time for leadership, he walks,"
said Courtney Cuff of Friends of the Earth, one of the organizations in the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain spokeswoman Nancy Ives replied that for 17 years McCain has "fought
against pork-barrel spending items in every appropriations bill."

<HEADLINE> World Trade Meeting Seeks Healing  </HEADLINE>
    By PATRICK McDOWELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- The breakdown of last year's world trade talks in
Seattle into street violence and bitter disagreement may be partly healed by an
upcoming gathering in Bangkok, a U.N. trade leader said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. Conference on Trade and Development will gather representatives of
some 180 countries in a meeting to try to bridge gaps between poor and rich
nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Those gaps led to the World Trade Organization's failure in November to
launch a new round of trade negotiations. The Seattle talks ended up foundering
amid chaotic street violence and demonstrations against the theme of
globalization that President Clinton and some other leaders were encouraging.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubens Ricupero, the Brazilian secretary-general of the U.N. conference,
called UNCTAD, told a news conference he has detected a fresh spirit of
compromise since then that might help push the world trade agenda forward.
</P>
<P>
	   UNCTAD holds its conference every four years. This year's meeting, in the
Thai capital from Feb. 12-19, will be preceded by a forum for activist groups
starting Monday. That gathering will try to keep disagreements in the debating

<P>
	   "We are confident that in our conference, there will be what we could call a
healing process after Seattle," Ricupero said. "We are beginning to see some
signs in the world after Seattle that people are willing to make some
compromises."
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike the WTO, which hammers out international trade treaties and has the
power to enforce them, UNCTAD is largely a discussion group concerned with how
trade can advance development in poor countries. But given that both
Geneva-based organizations deal with many of the same issues and people, hopes
are high that new stances may be found on disputes that helped sink the Seattle
meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the thorniest are agricultural export subsidies and the high tariff
barriers that rich nations employ to offset developing countries' price
advantages in exporting food and clothing. Those policies are a "major
distortion" of free trade, Ricupero said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricupero said Asia's rebound from financial crisis would be a prime topic at
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   The crisis ended more quickly than anyone expected, thanks to the strengths
that led to the continent's extraordinary growth in the first place, he said. He
cited World Bank predictions that Asian economies will average 4 percent growth
this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Given that UNCTAD deals mainly with developing countries' concerns, the U.S.
and many wealthier nations are sending development and trade officials, not
high-profile leaders. The only leader of one of the world's seven most
industrialized countries to attend will be Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, security at the conference will be tight. Shaken by a pair of
recent hostage seizures by radical Myanmar student dissidents, Thailand is
deploying more than 6,000 police officers backed up by helicopters, a bomb
squad, police dogs and firefighters.
</P>
<P>
	   Only a symbolic few protesters will be allowed near the Queen Sirikit
Conference Center. Other demonstrations will be confined to a park in central
Bangkok more than a mile away.

<HEADLINE> Trade Meeting May Bridge Gaps  </HEADLINE>
    By PATRICK McDOWELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- The breakdown of last year's world trade talks in
Seattle into street violence and bitter disagreement may be partly healed by an
upcoming gathering in Bangkok, a U.N. trade leader said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. Conference on Trade and Development will gather representatives of
some 180 countries in a meeting to try to bridge gaps between poor and rich
nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Those gaps led to the World Trade Organization's failure in November to
launch a new round of trade negotiations. The Seattle talks ended up foundering
amid chaotic street violence and demonstrations against the theme of
globalization that President Clinton and some other leaders were encouraging.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubens Ricupero, the Brazilian secretary-general of the U.N. conference,
called UNCTAD, told a news conference he has detected a fresh spirit of
compromise since then that might help push the world trade agenda forward.
</P>
<P>
	   UNCTAD holds its conference every four years. This year's meeting, in the
Thai capital from Feb. 12-19, will be preceded by a forum for activist groups
starting Monday. That gathering will try to keep disagreements in the debating
halls and off the streets.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are confident that in our conference, there will be what we could call a
healing process after Seattle," Ricupero said. "We are beginning to see some
signs in the world after Seattle that people are willing to make some
compromises."
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike the WTO, which hammers out international trade treaties and has the

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Steps Out on Her Own  </HEADLINE>
   By BETH J. HARPAZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The bright colors, fussy gowns and ever-changing coiffures
are gone. Nowadays her hair is cut in a short and simple helmet, and she sticks
to an all-black jacket and trousers -- the ensemble of choice for New York power
women.
</P>
<P>
	   Hillary Rodham Clinton has traded in the first-lady look for what have
become her combat fatigues in her battle to convince New Yorkers that she is one
of them.
</P>
<P>
	   The battle begins in earnest on Sunday, not far from the house she recently
bought in the New York City suburb of Chappaqua, when she officially launches
her candidacy for the U.S. Senate. From a hall at a state university campus,
with husband Bill, daughter Chelsea and her mother Dorothy by her side, she will
formally step out of the shadow life of politician's spouse from Arkansas and
into a political spotlight of her own.
</P>
<P>
	   The transition has changed more than her appearance. Hillary Clinton has
become the epitome of an eager office-seeker, shaking every outstretched hand,
traveling the length and breadth of New York to get in touch with a population
more than seven times bigger than that of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
	   She has already hit some potholes. She took heat for: sitting silently while
Yassir Arafat's wife accused the Israelis of poisoning Palestinians; failing to
voice an opinion on the fate of 6-year-old Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez; promising
to march in a St. Patrick's Day parade, apparently unaware that most Democratic
officials shun the event because it excludes homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
	   One of her toughest challenges has been the accusation that she's a
``carpetbagger'' who moved to New York only because it has a vacancy for a
Democratic Party candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Her probable Republican opponent, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
hasn't declared his candidacy -- there's no deadline for entering New York's
Nov. 7 election -- but his term expires in two years, and he cannot run again.
</P>
<P>
	   Brooklyn-born Giuliani has won high marks from New Yorkers for cleaning up
the city and bringing down crime rates. He can seem heavy-handed and vindictive,
whether sending out cops to round up the homeless or cutting off funds to a
museum because he considers the art offensive. But his bluntness and fierce
temper can seem refreshing compared to the first lady's measured style.
</P>
<P>
	   As is often the case in politics, Clinton was much more popular with voters
as long as she wasn't revealing her ambitions.
</P>
<P>
	   When she visited New York during that fall of 1998, to help fellow Democrat
Chuck Schumer in his run for U.S. Senate, audiences couldn't get enough of her.
The crowd in one packed union hall went wild when she showed up; it felt more
like a rock concert than a political rally. As the betrayed wife in the Monica
Lewinsky scandal, she clearly had New Yorkers' -- and the nation's -- sympathy,
and when rumors of a Senate run surfaced and pollsters started to get
interested, some soundings put her 10 points ahead of Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   But she lost ground as the wounded-wife image faded and the Senate candidate
emerged. Polls now have her almost neck-and-neck with Giuliani, and he has
stronger support among white women -- women who, in the old days, would greet
Clinton with chants of ``Run, Hillary, run.''
</P>
<P>
	   So despite having already spent a year on the campaign trail, she still has
work to do before Nov. 7 to explain to New Yorkers why she should represent them
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a question that haunts many people,'' acknowledges her campaign
adviser, Harold Ickes. ``Why is she doing this? And who is she?''
</P>
<P>
	   The clues to who she is lie deeply rooted in her childhood.
</P>
<P>
	   Born in 1947, the eldest of three, she was raised in the Chicago suburb of
Park Ridge and has likened her family to that of the 1950s television sitcom
``Father Knows Best.'' Her mother was there every day when she came home for
lunch; her father, who owned a drapery business, would kneel by his bed each
night in prayer.
</P>
<P>
	   Her mother instilled in her the steely poise Americans so admired during the
impeachment struggle. If young Bill Clinton's defining moment was standing up to
his violent stepfather, little Hillary's was running home in tears to escape a
neighborhood bully. Her mother sent her back out the door, saying: ``There's no
room for cowards in this house.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later, a Methodist church youth group introduced her ``to the world beyond
our all-white middle-class suburb.'' A teen-age Hillary baby-sat for migrant
farm workers' families and even shook hands with Martin Luther King Jr. -- not
long after her future husband's fabled meeting, as a young man, with President
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
	   This early faith-based activism had a lifelong impact. ``Be ye doers and not
just hearers of the word,'' she intoned at several recent appearances, prompting
one of her hosts to respond: ``Thank you, Rev. Clinton!''
</P>
<P>
	   At Wellesley College, she was a campus leader who made front-page news in
the Boston Globe with her commencement speech -- a strident rebuttal to another
speaker who derided '60s activism. At Yale Law School, she added a year to her
studies to learn about child development, then worked as a staff attorney for
the Children's Defense Fund. Children's issues, education and health remain her
priorities and are themes of her Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   She spent 1974 working for the House Judiciary Committee researching the
constitutional grounds for impeaching President Nixon. She then rejected a
promising legal career in the Capitol and moved to Arkansas to marry Bill
Clinton, whom she had met at Yale. She worked for a prominent Little Rock law
firm, and kept her maiden name after he was elected governor.
</P>
<P>
	   But when he lost his first re-election bid, her career-woman image was
deemed part of the problem. From then on, she used her married name.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet she remained committed to her own career. She kept her job at a law firm
while serving as Arkansas' first lady, and took just four months off from work
when Chelsea, now 19, was born.
</P>
<P>
	   Her biggest achievement in Arkansas public life was reforming the state's
schools, including raising salaries and per-pupil spending, and instituting
competency tests for teachers and students. As chairwoman of the Arkansas
Education Standards Committee, she went to each of the state's 75 counties, held
hearings, shepherded debates, and came away with new standards that, accompanied
by a tax hike, led to the changes.
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast, her effort in Washington to overhaul the country's health care
-- a job entrusted to her by her husband -- was a dismal failure. ``I come from
the school of smaller steps now,'' she said humbly at a New York event last
fall.
</P>
<P>
	   There were other humiliations in Washington too. After records from the
Whitewater scandal mysteriously appeared in the White House, Hillary Clinton
became the first president's wife to testify before a grand jury. But her
popularity soared during the impeachment drama, with two-thirds of Americans
saying they approved of her brave smile and the way she soldiered on.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, as she reinvents herself for the next phase in her political life --
declaring herself a Yankees fan, strolling the beach on Long Island, quoting the
Bible in a Harlem church and chatting about dairy farms and droughts upstate --
she is discovering the huge difference between life inside the Beltway and the
rambunctious world of New York politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Already, the Republican knives are out for this ``ultra-liberal,
carpet-bagging opportunist,'' as one conservative mailing puts it, and the
question of the first lady's Noo Yawk credentials is bound to resurface
throughout the campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   But there are compensations, as the writer Nora Ephron noted at a Manhattan
luncheon honoring ``Today'' host Katie Couric.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can run,'' Ephron told the first lady. ``You can live here. And you
will never have to wear a turquoise jacket again.''

<HEADLINE> Sheen May Replace Fox on TV Show  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The hit television sitcom "Spin City" may survive the
departure of its star, Michael J. Fox.
</P>
<P>
	   When Fox, who plays a hard-charging deputy mayor of New York, leaves the
show at the end of the spring season, he may be replaced by Charlie Sheen, Time
reports in the issue that will hit newsstands Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC and the show's production company, DreamWorks, are talking to Sheen
about joining the cast, which includes Barry Bostwick and Heather Locklear.
</P>
<P>
	   One catch: The show is currently filmed in New York, where Fox lives, and
would have to move to Los Angeles to accommodate Sheen.

   ALBION, Mich. (AP) -- Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter said that daring to dream
was what kept him going while he was imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The dream was the only thing that kept me alive,'' the one-time boxing
great told an audience at Albion College on Friday . ``Dare to dream.''

	   Carter talked about his boxing triumphs, imprisonment for a triple homicide
in 1966, his release in 1988, and his fame today.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter's professional boxing career began in 1961. But five years later,

He maintained his innocence but was sentenced to three life terms, narrowly
escaping the electric chair.

<HEADLINE> Author Says Average Folks Hit it Big  </HEADLINE>
   By CHAD ROEDEMEIER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Who gets to be a millionaire?
</P>
<P>
	   Conventional wisdom says it's the students who get straight A's, blow the
roof off the SAT and go to Ivy League colleges. Or maybe it's the children born
into wealthy families with brilliant connections.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither is typical, says Thomas J. Stanley, who surveyed 1,300 millionaires
for his new book, ``The Millionaire Mind,'' due out Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The average millionaire made B's and C's in college, Stanley says. Their
average SAT score was 1190 -- not good enough to get into many top-notch
schools. In fact, most millionaires were told they were not intellectually
gifted, not smart enough to succeed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I find no correlation between SAT scores, grade point averages and
economic achievement. None,'' said Stanley. ``Admittedly, there are some very
bright people in the data, but not many.''
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of relying on natural genius, millionaires choose careers that match
their abilities, Stanley said. They may not have great analytic intelligence,
but they are creative and practical. They focus on a goal, take calculated risks
and then work harder than most people.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a lesson Stanley has taken to heart. The author, who lives in Atlanta,
has gotten rich himself by writing about the rich.
</P>
<P>
	   For years he was a marketing professor at Georgia State University. He wrote
three textbooks about marketing to wealthy people and gave seminars around the
country. But he felt like he was on a treadmill going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
	   So he took time off to write what he calls ``the home-run book.'' ``The
Millionaire Next Door,'' written with researcher William D. Danko of Albany,
N.Y., and published in 1996. It has been on The New York Times Best Sellers list
for more than 150 weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   In ``The Millionaire Mind,'' Stanley studied even richer millionaires -- the
top 1 percent of households. These people had an average net worth of $9.2
million and earned $749,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
	   The average multimillionaire in Stanley's study is a 54-year-old man,
married to the same woman for 28 years, with three children. Nearly half are
business owners or senior corporate executives.
</P>
<P>
	   And almost none of them credit their success to being smart. They say the
keys to success are being honest and disciplined, getting along with people,
having a supportive spouse and working hard.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Somehow they figured out what they were good at,'' Stanley said. ``They
all said, 'I'll be the best at this. This is what I really, really love to
do.'''
</P>
<P>
	   One of his case studies is Donald Sonner, the 64-year-old head of Southern
Bloomer Manufacturing Co. in Bristol, Tenn. Sonner's only education was a single
year of high school, but he was a millionaire by the time he was 24.
</P>
<P>
	   How? His company takes scrap cloth and makes underwear for prisons and
gun-cleaning patches. He got rich by working hard and capitalizing on an idea no
one else had, Stanley said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Working on Two Democratic Items  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under election-year pressure, majority Republicans in
Congress are working quickly on a minimum wage increase and a patients' rights
bill, two key items on the Democratic agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Congress is better off if it is dealt with sooner rather than later,''
Sen. Larry Craig of Idaho said last week, shortly after the Senate passed a
minimum wage increase coupled with tax breaks designed as sweeteners for
business.
</P>
<P>
	   Craig, the third-ranking Republican in the Senate, added that the closer the
election, the more Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and others ``would like to
make an issue'' of the wage bill.
</P>
<P>
	   The minimum wage aside, Republicans are preparing to open formal
House-Senate compromise talks this week on a contested measure to expand the
rights of patients dealing with the HMOs. The original House bill, passed last
year with the support of Democrats, provides the right to sue HMOs for denial of
care. The GOP-crafted Senate plan does not.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think everything's on the table,'' Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., told
reporters late last week, after key GOP lawmakers reviewed the issue at a
closed-door meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   House Republicans say the health bill, in particular, has political
importance. Several GOP sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Speaker Dennis Hastert's top aide had told the senior GOP staff over the winter
break that the House would be lost to the Democrats this fall if a patients'
rights bill did not make it to President Clinton's desk.
</P>
<P>
	   Faced with a relatively short session, Republicans also are at work on their
own agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   A House vote is expected this week, for example, on a tax cut to ease the
marriage penalty -- now about 25 million couples, most of them with dual
incomes, pay more income taxes than they would if single.
</P>
<P>
	   A vote on legislation to ban certain late-term abortions is expected by
spring.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the politial landscape bears similarities to 1996, when Republicans
found it prudent to forge compromises with the Democrats and the White House on
bills to raise the minimum wage, expand health care opportunities and enact a
stand-alone welfare bill.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate-passed minimum wage bill calls for a $1 per hour increase in the
current wage floor of $5.l5 per hour, to be phased in through March 2002. Tax
breaks total $18 billion over five year, and include provisions to offset the
cost of health insurance for the self-employed as well as employees whose jobs
offer no insurance coverage. The plan won preliminary approval late last year
and was designed by Republicans to head off a more generous Democratic proposal
to raise the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
	   It was passed last week as part of a bill overhauling bankruptcy laws. The
House leadership is expected to have its own minimum wage bill in the next few
weeks, despite long-standing opposition by conservatives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hate it,'' House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, of the minimum wage
increase. He added, ``Obviously, we don't have the votes to stop minimum wage,
so we ought to do something that lessens the burden on people that pay the
wages.''
</P>
<P>
	   The leadership's efforts to expedite the legislation last year were thwarted
by a coalition of renegade Republicans and House Democrats who banded together
behind an increase that phased in more quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   House GOP aides said last week the leadership has not settled on a strategy.
The leadership may try to find a way to allow Democrats and moderate Republicans
to approve their preferred wage proposal, while at the same time Republicans get
their way on a larger series of tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
	   On health care, there are numerous differences between bills passed a year
ago by the House and Senate, but two key areas of contention.
</P>
<P>
	   The House bill would apply to all 161 million Americans with health
insurance, compared with 48 million for the Senate measure. But the right-to-sue
controversy issue is expected to be one of the last issues resolved.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said in an appearance before the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce recently the compromise legislation probably would
include some provision for lawsuits. But, he added, ``what we don't want to make
it is just a lawyer's bill of rights.''
</P>
<P>
	   There were additional signs of flexibility from Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., a
leading architect of the Senate-passed bill and an opponent of the right to sue.
</P>
<P>
	   Nickles has not gone as far as Lott in his public comments. But according to
House aides who spoke on condition of anonymity, he told lawmakers in a closed
door meeting that he, too, is committed to finding a compromise on the issue
that can reach the president's desk.

<HEADLINE> Police commanders feel pressure to keep crime numbers low  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Crime is down in cities nationwide and the unwritten
mantra of the police brass is: It better stay that way. But some criminologists
feel that motto can lead to trouble.
<P>
	   Police commanders are under pressure from their superiors' expectations, and
some have doctored statistics to show the number of offenses still going down.
Other commanders allege they were transferred when their precincts showed an
increase in crime.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, two New York captains were transferred, and the captains' union
says the moves were prompted by a jump in the number of crimes. In 1998, the
head of the police transportation bureau was forced to resign after he was
accused of underreporting subway offenses.
</P>
<P>
	   Such problems are not unique to New York City. The Philadelphia police
department has come under fire for allegedly reporting major crimes as minor
ones. Police in Boca Raton, Fla., and Atlanta also have been accused of
doctoring statistics.
</P>
<P>
	   Commanders have always been held accountable for what goes on in their
precincts, but in the 1990s a program known in some departments as COMPSTAT -
which uses computerized statistics to more accurately outline crime patterns -
began to put commanders on the hot seat.
</P>
<P>
	   Criminologists say, however, that COMPSTAT is not to blame. They maintain
the problem arises because police brass put too much weight on the statistics,
without looking at the broader picture.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've often used the term criminal justice limbo stick - how low can you
go?" said James Alan Fox, a criminal justice professor at Northeastern
University.
</P>
<P>
	   "Can we hold someone accountable because you can't go lower, and the only
way left to go is up?," Fox added. "Holding a commander accountable purely
because the crime number increased, especially after falling for many years in a
row is shortsighted and unfair."
</P>
<P>
	   Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University, agrees.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can't fire everybody," he said. "You have to understand what some of
the external factors are - which are under the control of the precinct commander
and ... which are not."
</P>
<P>
	   Former New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton, who introduced
COMPSTAT in the city, said if commanders were being transferred solely on the
basis of an increase in crime statistics, that was wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   "Despite our best efforts and best people, sometimes crime is going to go
up," said Bratton, commissioner from 1994 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   New York City police Capt. John F. Driscoll, who heads the Captains
Endowment Association - the union for police captains - said a person cannot
judge the effectiveness of a commanding officer by crime statistics alone.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have to take into account a commander's supervisory skills,
administrative skills, relationships with his cops and command, and more
importantly, his relationship with the community," Driscoll said.
</P>
<P>
	   Driscoll has criticized what he claims is the New York police practice of
transferring commanders when crime rises in their precincts. In the past few
weeks, Capt. James Guida of the 88th Precinct in Brooklyn and Capt. Joseph W.
Byrne of the 104th Precinct in Queens were transferred after statistics showed
an increase in crimes in their commands.
</P>
<P>
	   Police Commission Howard Safir denies Driscoll's allegations. "When I look
at whether or not to transfer a precinct commander, I look at the totality of
his performance," Safir said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Crime reduction is, of course, a very important factor, but community
relations is a very important factor, civilian complaints are a very important
factor. Precinct morale is a factor. Nobody gets transferred based strictly on
one thing."
</P>
<P>
	   Guida replaced Capt. Charles F. Dowd when auditors found in 1988 that Dowd
had underreported crimes by classifying felonies as misdemeanors. Dowd was
transferred instead of being fired because officials said he had not willfully
deceived the department.
</P>
<P>
	   Also in 1998, the head of the Police Transportation Bureau, Chief Kenneth
Donohue, resigned after he was accused of underreporting subway crime. Earlier
that year, Safir said subway crime had been underreported for decades by as much
as 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Many crimes committed on trains or in stations were recorded as having
occurred above ground, he said, adding that the error was discovered during an
audit.
</P>
<P>
	   Other departments have seen similar problems. In 1998, the Philadelphia
police department came under fire when it was revealed that reports were being
rewritten to exclude key facts and that major offenses were being recast as
minor ones. The allegations prompted an inquiry by the FBI, and the city had to
withdraw its crime figures from the FBI for 1996, 1997 and part of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, Atlanta Deputy Police Chief Louis Arcangeli alleged that the
department's 1996 crime statistics were softened by writing off some unsolved
crimes and misclassifying some violent crimes as non-violent.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard claimed a state audit
exonerated his department of any wrongdoing, but the audit included an FBI
finding a significant number of robberies, rapes and car thefts were incorrectly
listed as unfounded.
</P>
<P>
	   Arcangeli has since been demoted to captain, but Harvard denied this was
because of his allegations. Arcangeli continues to work for the department and
said in a recent telephone interview that police commanders are now vigilant
about reporting crimes because the state is monitoring the department.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, Attorney General Janet Reno ordered an informal inquiry into the
Boca Raton, Fla., police department to see if officers downgraded hundreds of
crimes to enhance the city's image as a safe place to live. The scandal cost
Police Chief Peter Petracco and the department's No. 3 ranking officer their
jobs. The department allegedly downgraded burglaries and petty thefts to the
point where they did not need to be included in the city's annual report to the
state and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
	   Mary Victoria Pyne, unit chief with the Uniformed Crime Reporting Program
managed by the FBI, said the federal government scrutinizes crime data from
17,000 law enforcement agencies, making it hard for police officers doctoring
statistics to get away with it.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are not seeing a lot of inaccurate statistics," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bratton also said that COMPSTAT makes it nearly impossible to fudge
statistics without it eventually being uncovered.
</P>
<P>
	   "COMPSTAT is about transparency. You have to come out and show your peers
what you've done," he said. "If crime is way down in your precinct, your
colleagues will ask you how you did that, and you'll have to answer. There's
nowhere to hide."

<HEADLINE> Simon Estes carves niche as one of world's finest performers of  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Simon Estes was flying around the world, singing to
rousing ovations. But back in his hotel room at night, he was "crying like a
baby," says the towering 61-year-old baritone.
<P>
	   "And I had lumps in my throat bigger than grapefruits - before, during and
after the singing," Estes says of the personal struggle after his recent
divorce. "But I thought, well, I have to take this incredible pain and make
myself stronger, and go on."
</P>
<P>
	   With his patrician presence and rich voice, Estes has carved a niche for
himself as one of the world's finest performers of Verdi and Wagner, singing
alongside stars like Placido Domingo and Leontyne Price. And his new
autobiography is filled with photos of Estes in the company of world leaders -
Nelson Mandela, Pope John Paul II, former President Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   But the glossy tome begins with a simple boy growing up in Iowa amid fierce
segregation.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I was a kid, we couldn't go into the swimming pool with white people,"
Estes remembers. "They'd disinfect the pool, and then they'd let the white kids
come in. You know, those 'black' germs were in the water."
</P>
<P>
	   This kid had a splendid voice. He ended up at New York's Juilliard School
and soon became the only black male opera singer of great celebrity.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, he says, "the world did not let me forget that I have a darker skin
color than you."
</P>
<P>
	   For his 1965 debut at the Deutsche Oper in Berlin, he was subjected to
makeup that made him look "white as a ghost," he says.
</P>
<P>
	   And in the 1970s, "I remember singing in one of those Southern cities, and
the director of the opera house came up to me and said, 'Simon, I want to work
with you, but I can't because some of the people who are giving us money said if
I engaged you, they're going to take away the funds. And we need the money."'
</P>
<P>
	   Things have changed. In his hometown of Centerville, Iowa, the local high
school auditorium was named after him several years ago. "That was a way of
saying, 'Simon, we're sorry."'
</P>
<P>
	   He has given concerts around Iowa, and the state has given him the Iowan
Award, it's highest honor. This was the first time it went to a black person.
</P>
<P>
	   But his racially charged journey has left its mark.
</P>
<P>
	   When he teaches classes at Iowa State University, he speaks not only about
music, but about human values, telling students: "Don't ever compromise your
principles to try to get a job, or a position or relationship, or whatever."
</P>
<P>
	   And despite his success, he's still waging an age-old battle to bring more
talented black male singers into classical music. There are plenty of black
female stars, he says, but only a handful of men.
</P>
<P>
	   "Find me a group of people where one gender can sing, and the other gender
cannot sing!" he says. "It's one of the last big hurdles that we still have to
overcome."
</P>
<P>
	   Estes tempers such frustrations by thinking of Nelson Mandela, for whom he
has sung.
</P>
<P>
	   "Here was a man who was unjustly incarcerated for 27 years. He came out and
not one time did he speak of revenge or hatred or bitterness," Estes says. "In
order not to have hatred when you have been so unjustly treated requires an
inner strength that I personally think has to come from a higher source."
</P>
<P>
	   Before each performance, he prays. "I pray that the gift God has given me
touches somebody's heart out there," says Estes, his face illuminated by a
winter sun as he sits on the glassed-in porch of his New Jersey home.
</P>
<P>
	   He glances at his watch to make sure it's not too late to call Switzerland,
where his three daughters live with their mother.
</P>
<P>
	   He has just finished vacuuming the white carpet; again he's a bachelor who
does his own cooking, laundry and ironing. He doesn't need to do housework,
given his six-figure income from work at the Met, the Vienna State Opera and the
Washington Opera.
</P>
<P>
	   But this man has a different definition of success.
</P>
<P>
	   "The more I sing, the more, in quotes, 'success' I have - whatever that may
be - the more humble and grateful I'd like to become, instead of feeling that
everybody has to cater to me and I have to have the presidential suite and a
limousine that's 40 feet long," Estes said.
</P>
<P>
	   To him, success means "being at peace with yourself."
</P>
<P>
	   There's at least one sore spot: The divorce he granted his wife more than a
year ago. Leaving her and their three daughters, ages 12, 14 and 16, "was the
most difficult thing in my life."
</P>
<P>
	   And it made performing tough, especially the lead role in Wagner's "Flying
Dutchman" for which Estes is famed. He pointed out that his character says at
one point, "Oh, I'm without a wife and I'm without a child," and said that's
when the lump arose in his throat.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've always been a very strong person in my life. But this broke me, it
really broke me," he says. "I flew around the world, and I was in hotel rooms
crying like a baby."
</P>
<P>
	   He survived through friends and prayer, and the shows went on. And now, his
piano accompanist tells him, he's singing at his best again.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm almost cured," Estes says. "And I think about trying to improve my
life, to be a better person."
</P>
<P>
	   He sponsors an educational foundation that gives scholarships to talented
students. Two years ago, he founded the Simon Estes High School near Cape Town,
South Africa, with almost 200 students who are focused on music. Last year, 40
of them attended school in Iowa for the academic year.
</P>
<P>
	   The baritone has perhaps another dozen years of performing ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
	   In March, he'll appear at Carnegie Hall in Ponchielli's "La Gioconda,"
followed by Verdi's "Aida" in Los Angeles with Domingo, appearances in Tokyo and
opera dates all over Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   And he says he'll stop performing "while I can still sing. ... I want to try
to be like Michael Jordan."
</P>
<P>
	   His final, dream concert in Washington is already planned, except for the
exact date. The program will include "Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen," as
well as a rendition of the 27th Psalm, "The Lord is my light."
</P>
<P>
	   And Estes will offer a beloved song by Gustav Mahler, "Ich bin der Welt
Abhanden Gekommen," meaning "I am lost to the world."
</P>
<P>
	   It ends with the words: "I live alone in my heaven, in my love and in my
song...."

<HEADLINE> Latest poll says candidates remain neck and neck  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A new poll released Sunday on the U.S. Senate race finds
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in a statistical dead heat,
but with a majority expecting Giuliani to eventually win.
<P>
	   The survey by the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute shows Giuliani with a
45 to 42 percent lead over Clinton, but the difference disappears once the
3-point margin of error is figured in.
</P>
<P>
	   Ten percent of those surveyed were undecided.
</P>
<P>
	   But fully half of those polled - including some Clinton supporters - expect
the mayor to win. Only 31 percent expect Clinton to win.
</P>
<P>
	   Female voters of all races were about equally split between the two groups,
but white women prefer the mayor, 52 to 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey also found that Giuliani is regarded as more knowledgeable about
state issues, while Clinton is regarded as having a more suitable personality
for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Seventy-three percent of those surveyed said the mayor understands the
issues and problems facing New York State, but only 42 percent say the same of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   And while 70 percent think Clinton has the personality to be an effective
U.S. Senator, only 58 percent believe Giuliani does.
</P>
<P>
	   More than seven in 10 voters rated both of them high on leadership and
intelligence, although people gave Giuliani slightly higher marks for leadership
and her slightly higher marks for brains.
</P>
<P>
	   And a month after Clinton moved into her new Westchester home in Chappaqua,
46 percent still say that it bothers them that she's not from New York, compared
to 54 percent who say that it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
	   A Quinnipiac survey taken a year ago showed Clinton leading Giuliani 54-36,
with 57 percent saying they expected the mayor would ultimately win.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Clinton and Giuliani were given favorable ratings by a little more than
a third of those polled. That's a few points lower for Giuliani since January,
but Clinton's best favorability rating since June.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was to formally announce her candidacy Sunday while Giuliani got his
share of the media's attention with appearances on five TV talk shows.
</P>
<P>
	   "Today's big show by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton may cause a thaw, but
so far the Senate race seems frozen, with Mayor Giuliani holding on the high
side of a squeaker," Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac College Polling
Institute, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll surveyed 1,072 registered voters by phone from Feb. 2 to 5.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton announces Senate candidacy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) - With the president taking a step back from the
spotlight, Hillary Rodham Clinton, her family at her side, planned to go before
2,000 people Sunday to announce her Senate candidacy from a state she has called
home for only a month.
<P>
	   The race for the seat being vacated by fellow Democrat Daniel Patrick
Moynihan is expected to pit Clinton against Rudolph Giuliani, the Republican
mayor of New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   No other first lady has ever run for public office and in doing so, Clinton
steps out of the long and scandal-scarred shadow of her husband. Bill Clinton is
said to be one of her major advisers as she resumes the career she put aside to
help him capture the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton, daughter Chelsea and mother Dorothy Rodham assembled in
this New York City suburb to be with the first lady for her formal campaign
kickoff.
</P>
<P>
	   There is little real doubt that Clinton will face Giuliani in the polls, but
the mayor has not held his own formal campaign announcement. About the closest
he's come was on ABC's "This Week," one of five TV talk shows he appeared on
Sunday. When asked if he planned to run, he said, "Looks that way."
</P>
<P>
	   Recent polls have shown Giuliani with a slight lead over Clinton and running
even with her among women voters. That's a far cry from a year ago when talk was
fresh about a possible Clinton campaign that many doubted would ever come to
pass. Sympathy was strong from the Monica Lewinsky scandal and polls showed her
well ahead of the mayor if she did run.
</P>
<P>
	   Five months later, she formed a Senate committee and began raising money for
the race. At Moynihan's sprawling farm on a bright July day she kicked off a
summer-long "listening tour" of the state that bled over into the fall and took
her from Broadway to Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now I suppose the questions on everyone's mind is why the Senate and why
New York and why me?" she said at the farm. "All I can say is that I care deeply
about the issues that are important in this state that I have already been
learning about and hearing about."
</P>
<P>
	   By December, she was assuring supporters she intended to run. In early
January, she moved into a $1.7 million house in suburban Westchester County just
north of New York City to establish residency in the state she had decided to
adopt. President Clinton said he would move there when he left the White House
at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
	   For her formal announcement, Clinton chose a gymnasium at the State
University of New York at Purchase not far from her new home, a gym that serves
as the practice court for the New York Knicks basketball team.
</P>
<P>
	   Other than a closeness to home, political experts said there was good reason
for Clinton to stage her announcement in Westchester.
</P>
<P>
	   "When duck hunting, one goes where the ducks are," Republican consultant Jay
Severin explained. "The independent suburban ducks are the ducks in this
campaign that are yet to be bagged."
</P>
<P>
	   In statewide races, suburban voters from Westchester County and Long Island
are considered a key to success and a Marist College poll released Friday showed
Giuliani leading in the suburbs, 56 percent to 34 percent, his strongest showing
in any region of the state.
</P>
<P>
	   While Giuliani dismissed the Clinton announcement as "a Hollywood type of
thing," a top Democratic strategist not connected to the Clinton campaign said
it served a real purpose, especially for a famous out-of-towner still viewed
skeptically by many New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It makes people understand this is for real and not a joke. It's not a game
anymore," Hank Sheinkopf said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton campaign arranged for about 500 house parties to be held
simultaneously around the state for more than 20,000 supporters who would watch
the announcement on television and then listen in on a conference telephone call
from the candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Clinton was to fly to Buffalo to begin a tour across the state
that would take her to Rochester on Tuesday, Syracuse on Wednesday and Albany on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   As of the end of the year, she had raised $8 million and Giuliani, who
started fund raising three months earlier, had raised almost $12 million. It is
expected to be the most expensive Senate race in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
	   In seeking to replace Moynihan in the Senate, Clinton hopes to make another
kind of history. No woman has ever been independently elected to statewide
office in New York. Former vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro
unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Senate nomination in 1992 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's terrific," Ferraro said. "I think it's taking the role of the
first lady and putting it in the perspective of the 21st century ... We now know
that there is an afterlife for these women as well as being an assistant or
whatever in the White House."

<HEADLINE> Bradley Hopes To Claw His Way To Win  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bruised by losses in Iowa and New Hampshire, Bill Bradley's
presidential campaign is fighting back against the aggressive campaign being
waged by rival Al Gore. Though the strategy is not entirely risk-free, aides
have concluded that Gore's tactics have left Bradley with little choice but to
respond.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Part of our strategy will be drawing a contrast with the vice president,
which we will do increasingly,'' said Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, Bradley wasted little time Sunday resuming his criticisms of Gore,
which he had stepped up in the closing days of the contest in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' the former New Jersey senator renewed
his attack on Gore's fund-raising practices in the last campaign, criticizing
the vice president's 1996 appearance at a Buddhist temple near Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think he has to explain more thoroughly what was happening at the
Buddhist temple, said Bradley. ``If he didn't know it was a fund-raiser then he
was spectacularly naive.''
</P>
<P>
	   He again warned that Republicans will hammer Gore with the issue in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no doubt in my mind that is going to happen,'' Bradley said.
``This is a real risk in the fall. The Democratic Party is taking a risk.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley also has challenged Gore on health care and his record on abortion
and says voters want a ``fresh start,'' a thinly veiled reference to President
Clinton's troubles.
</P>
<P>
	   ``America is about competition, political campaigns are about competition,''
said Bradley, defending his assault. ``If your positions are misrepresented, you
can only take it so long. That's the way I'll continue for the next four or five
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
	   By then, the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination could well be
decided, with a high-stakes showdown in California, New York and other states on
March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   ``California is the neutral ground,'' said Gore campaign spokesman Chris
Lehane.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have to take off on March 7,'' acknowledged Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   One place to begin is within his own party. Much of the Democratic
establishment is behind Gore and one of Bradley's most urgent tasks is winning
back key constituencies like blacks and women who surveys show overwhelmingly
support the vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think I have to communicate better with the Democratic base,'' said
Bradley, who was visiting a predominantly black church Sunday to campaign with
activist Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
	   Both rivals took a breather over the weekend before launching an intense
burst of campaigning leading up to the big round of March 7 primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley opened his week in New York and was heading to Florida. Gore, too,
was beginning in New York, and both were setting aside ample time for
California.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have to win California,'' Bradley said. ``I know I have some ground to
make up.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore also has focused heavily on California, and has the backing of key
state leaders like Gov. Gray Davis and organized labor. Polls give Gore the edge
there -- a Field poll in mid-January had him ahead 44 percent to 17 percent --
but they can be unreliable as voters begin to tune in to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Countering Bradley, Gore's aides said they will continue the kind of
grassroots, retail campaign that led to success in the opening contests in Iowa
and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Al Gore is a national candidate,'' said Lehane, Gore's spokesman. ``We'll
be campaigning in virtually every state where they have a primary. There's only
one candidate in this race who is undefeated and that's Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
	   For Bradley, the debate has been one of tactics. A core campaign theme has
been his argument that he's a nontraditional candidate who operates above the
charges and countercharges that have become staples of political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   But in the face of early setbacks, Bradley's approach has shifted. Backers
like Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska have urged Bradley -- who picks up Secret
Service protection Monday -- to be more aggressive and respond to Gore -- and
that's becoming apparent.

<HEADLINE> The 'other' Carnegie Hall brings music, art to West Virginia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LEWISBURG, W.Va. (AP) - The name "Carnegie Hall" conjures up
superlatives, a place where only the best perform.
<P>
	   It also conjures up New York.
</P>
<P>
	   But there are two other Carnegie Halls, also built with money from steel
baron Andrew Carnegie and used to present quality arts to their communities.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides New York and Carnegie's hometown of Dunfermline, Scotland, there is
Lewisburg, where this four-story Georgian Revival Carnegie Hall sits just a bit
off the beaten path.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're the humble stepsister," says Vivian Conly, executive director in
Lewisburg.

	   Once the richest man in the world, Carnegie gave away millions of his vast
fortune to fund libraries. And while many of those have music halls, including
the one in Pittsburgh, Carnegie seldom donated money to fund places solely
devoted to music and the performing arts.
</P>
<P>
	   The spacious New York hall can seat thousands; Lewisburg, which cost $33,000
in 1902, can hold only 400. And where gracefully curved tiered seating and plush
carpet add to the New York hall's luxury, dark red plaster walls and teal
leather seats help hide imperfections in Lewisburg.
</P>
<P>
	   Because it was built for the Lewisburg Female Institute, which later became
the Greenbrier College for Women, "it's institutional rather than elegant and
grand," Conly says.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, patrons and performers seem to enjoy the intimate setting, where
paintings by local artists grace the lobby and a hand-carved staircase leads to
the balcony above.
</P>
<P>
	   The red brick building also houses art and dance studios, a small museum and
meeting rooms. A kitchen is used for culinary classes, while several other rooms
are used for weaving, pottery, basket-making and glass art. Skills learned in
class are seen in a vibrant mosaic that covers a once drab wall.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Carnegie built his fortune as a steel tycoon in neighboring
Pennsylvania, he had no connection to West Virginia. He was persuaded by James
Lang, chairman of the Board of Trustees of the women's college, to donate money
to replace a structure destroyed by fire.
</P>
<P>
	   The men shared the same Scottish roots.
</P>
<P>
	   That simple connection produced a place that brings the arts to southern
West Virginia, with live performances by artists from around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., who with his own wealthy family has been a
staunch supporter of the arts, called the Lewisburg hall a "wonderful asset."
</P>
<P>
	   "It may not have the same stature as its New York cousin, but as far as I'm
concerned, it's the jewel of the Carnegie Hall family," Rockefeller says.
</P>
<P>
	   Carnegie Hall lay dormant for years after the women's college closed in
1972. For several years it was used as a mental hospital. But when the once
stately building was about to be condemned in 1983, local residents formed a
nonprofit group to save it.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1995, in the midst of a nearly $3 million renovation project, the
National Endowment for the Arts recognized the Lewisburg hall as a model for
rural arts agency management and arts education.
</P>
<P>
	   And two years later, it was chosen for inclusion in The John F. Kennedy
Performing Arts Center and Schools' Partners in Education program.
</P>
<P>
	   "Carnegie Hall," Conly says, "is one of West Virginia's greatest treasures."
</P>
<P>
	   Celebrated violinist Isaac Stern, the namesake of Carnegie Hall's main
auditorium in New York, played the West Virginia hall in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, country and bluegrass star Ricky Skaggs and
blues artist Taj Mahal are among the many performers to take the stage here,
along with the Vienna Boys' Choir, the National Theater of the Deaf and the
Mystical Arts of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
	   The monks, who have shared stages with Phillip Glass, Paul Simon, Patti
Smith, Natalie Merchant and the Beastie Boys, spent a week in Lewisburg last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   This season, the Millennium Performance Series includes artists Angela Au,
who, at age 11, played piano for Queen Elizabeth II; Celtic Rhythm, a group of
Irish step dancers and musicians; and The Dillards, who appeared as the Darling
family on the "Andy Griffith Show" in the 1960s.

<HEADLINE> For Hillary Clinton the battle begins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) - For Hillary Rodham Clinton, Sunday's formal entry
into the New York Senate campaign is the first step down a very bumpy road that
can lead to her becoming a political force in her own right or a footnote in
history.
<P>
	   With most polls showing her likely Republican rival, New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, slightly ahead, "it is she who must change the fundamental
dynamics. She's got to shake things up," Republican consultant Jay Severin said.
</P>
<P>
	   "She needs to, as the political consultants say, get on message and generate
a little more enthusiasm from her base supporters," pollster Lee Miringoff, head
of Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion, said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by an almost 5-3 margin,
Clinton not only finds herself trailing Giuliani overall, but with no advantage
among women voters.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, a Marist poll out Friday showed Giuliani leading Clinton among
white women, 52 percent to 34 percent. The poll also showed him taking 23
percent of Democratic voters while she landed just 12 percent of Republicans.
Among independent voters, Giuliani led Clinton, 57 percent to 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Not to worry, says former vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro, the
former congresswoman from Queens who twice unsuccessfully sought the Democratic
Senate nomination in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "Once people hear where he stands on issues that are important to us on a
federal level, it's a different ball game," Ferraro predicted. "Then, you will
see the Democratic voters running straight home to Hillary and you will see
women moving in great numbers into her column."
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, Clinton's campaign strategy has been clear for months. At every
opportunity, she stresses the need for better schools, more affordable quality
health care, lower transportation costs and more job-creating programs. And, she
questions whether the often blunt Giuliani has the proper temperament to get
along and get things done in the collegial Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   "The mayor always gets angry about things," she said late last year during a
stop in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
	   "She's got to engage the mayor on issues that play for her," veteran
Republican operative Nelson Warfield said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anything that lets her get in the game and actually start trading blows
with this guy has got to be good for her," Warfield added.
</P>
<P>
	   But the GOP consultant, who is not involved in the Senate race, cautioned
that Clinton's task isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every other contender who has ever gone up against Rudy Giuliani has tried
to bait him into making some sort of mistake," Warfield said. "But he's an
incredibly disciplined hothead, so he has largely avoided that fate. But she
will eventually attempt to pull it off."
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, Democratic consultant Hank Sheinkopf, who is also not
involved in the campaign, said Clinton's surrounding herself with family,
including President Clinton, at her campaign announcement Sunday was a smart
move.
</P>
<P>
	   "It shows she is a family person in spite of all the troubles they have
experienced," he said. "It makes her more human. It removes the sharp edges."
</P>
<P>
	   Sheinkopf said having President Clinton along could also be a big help for
her in heavily Democratic New York City where he remains highly popular and even
in the crucial suburbs of Long Island.
</P>
<P>
	   "He won Nassau County in '92 and '96," Sheinkopf recalled.
</P>
<P>
	   One issue still haunting Clinton is the carpetbagger charge. Until she moved
into a $1.7 million house in suburban Westchester County on Jan. 6 she had never
lived or worked in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   But the latest Marist poll found that for the first time since February of
last year, fewer than half the voters surveyed expressed concern that Clinton
lacked New York roots.
</P>
<P>
	   Forty-seven percent of voters said they were at least somewhat concerned
about Clinton not being from New York while 41 percent said they were not
concerned at all about that. In the Marist poll, the carpetbagger concern peaked
in December when 57 percent of voters said they were at least somewhat
concerned.
</P>
<P>
	   Miringoff said the bottom line in the Senate race is that while "Giuliani is
ahead, Clinton is within striking distance."
</P>
<P>
	   "She has to shore up her Democratic base and if she does that, she's fine,"
Ferraro said.

<HEADLINE> Did Felicity's Haircut Doom the WB?  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- A haircut, a missing creator and the switch of a
single station. Sometimes the little things mean the difference between a hot
network and a struggling one.
</P>
<P>
	   The WB was everyone's darling last season. Ratings were up, and it became a
particularly popular destination for tastemaking teen-age girls with smart
dramas like "Dawson's Creek," "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Felicity."
</P>
<P>
	   This year, though, its audience has dropped by more than 15 percent. Its
total prime-time viewership has even slipped behind the resurgent UPN, the
mini-network rival that many believed the WB had left behind for good.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps the first hint of trouble arrived in a card sent to "Felicity"
creator J.J. Abrams last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   It was from a vacationing Keri Russell, the series star. As a joke, Russell
sent a picture of herself in a wig, covering up her flowing, brown curls with a
short hairdo.
</P>
<P>
	   That got Abrams to thinking. Since the series planned to have Felicity break
up with her boyfriend, Ben, early this season, why not have Russell cut off her
hair? That's something a college sophomore might do to put a failed romance
behind her.
</P>
<P>
	   Bad idea. The show has been flooded with angry e-mails. Superficial as it
may seem, WB executives think the haircut may be one of the reasons the
"Felicity" ratings are off.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was distinctive," said Jamie Kellner, the WB's chief executive, "and we
cut off our distinctiveness."
</P>
<P>
	   Now there's a new rule on WB shows: no dramatic haircuts without permission.
</P>
<P>
	   Early this season, "Felicity" also effectively isolated Russell's character
from her friends, a no-no when you're trying to create an ensemble that appears
to care for each other like family, said Susanne Daniels, the WB's entertainment
president. A brief romance with a brooding professor's son didn't help, either.
</P>
<P>
	   Daniels believes "Felicity" is on the road back, starting with a critically
well-received special episode that was a "Twilight Zone" homage. She also hopes
a behind-the-scenes personnel change will right another listing ship, "Dawson's
Creek."
</P>
<P>
	   For much of this season, the show's special chemistry was buried beneath bad
soap opera plots. The introduction of Eve, a manipulative vixen, is seen in
retrospect as a telling mistake.
</P>
<P>
	   "It sort of took the show to a darker, harder, edgier place," Daniels said,
"and a lot of what works about the show is the hopefulness and the emotional
bonding of the characters."
</P>
<P>
	   The absence of Kevin Williamson, the series' creator, from any involvement
in the show is obvious; he often said the characters were based on different
aspects of his personality. Williamson went off to try other projects, so far
without much success.
</P>
<P>
	   Daniels has put one of the show's original writers in charge of the series
now. Its ultimate health may depend on whether Williamson can be coaxed back.
</P>
<P>
	   Kellner concedes that the WB's schedule is too heavy on dramas. As a result,
the network is concentrating most of its development efforts on establishing new
comedies.
</P>
<P>
	   A more subtle problem is the WB's effort to build a schedule with shows a
little too much like what they already have on the air. The idea is to promote a
natural audience flow from one to another so no one clicks the remote.
</P>
<P>
	   Unfortunately for the WB, competitors noticed that young dramas were working
and tried to imitate. The market quickly flooded, and a backlash may have set
in.
</P>
<P>
	   The WB has also suffered this year from the loss of a key affiliate, WGN in
Chicago. WGN is a superstation available on many cable systems, and it found it
was duplicating many local stations that also carried WB programming.
</P>
<P>
	   It was one more thing cutting in to the WB's viewership.
</P>
<P>
	   "We knew it would be a bump in the road," Kellner said, "but we were so
positive about our schedule we thought we would drive right over it. But we
haven't."
</P>
<P>
	   He looked uncomfortable talking about it. Kellner, who worked at Fox before
the WB, is used to growing networks, not stagnating ones.
</P>
<P>
	   But he insists there's no panic.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not changing our plan," he said. "We're not changing our people. We
are just going to be more aggressive."

<HEADLINE> GM's New CEO Must Seek Young Buyers  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- When G. Richard Wagoner Jr. assumes the job of CEO of
General Motors Corp. on June 1, he will be the youngest chief executive ever at
GM, running the world's largest automaker at age 47.
</P>
<P>
	   But whether he can keep the company in good health will depend in part on
improving GM's standing among consumers half his age. With rivals hustling
harder for younger buyers, Wagoner will have to show that GM can compete
profitably for those consumers and keep bringing them back as they grow older.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's critical that we engage that group," Wagoner said Friday.
"History has shown that when you get a buyer into your family and treat them
well, it's easier to keep them than to attract someone new.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've got to focus on products that meet their needs. The challenge has
been getting something that's eye catching ... at a price point that they want
to pay."
</P>
<P>
	   The average American car buyer is in their early 50s, the time of life when
many Americans are able to afford new vehicles more often. While GM remains
strong with older buyers, research from The Polk Co. shows that the vehicle
lines with the most pull with buyers under the age of 35 are imports -- namely
makes such as Isuzu, Honda and Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
	   While Chevrolet, Pontiac and Saturn sell about one-fifth of their vehicles
to customers under 35, the number drops precipitously for other GM vehicle
lines, Polk found. Karen Piurkowski, director of loyalty with Polk, said buyers
in the age range from 23 to 35, commonly labeled Generation X, tend to consider
foreign manufacturers more than their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
	   "GM has a big challenge ahead of them as people move up through these
population segments," she said. "It's not as natural for (Generation X members)
to be as loyal to a domestic manufacturer, whereas the baby boomers were always
a Ford family or a GM family."
</P>
<P>
	   Younger buyers have not always been a major concern of automakers, since
they tend to choose cheaper, smaller vehicles that carry slim profits.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, GM has shifted its attention from small cars to trucks and
sport utility vehicles. The company has said it loses money on every Chevrolet
Cavalier and Pontiac Sunfire it builds; those models will be 10 years old by the
time GM brings out their replacements in 2004.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our research on younger buyers says they aren't necessarily interested in
small cars," Wagoner said. "I don't necessarily believe that traditional small
cars with more progressive styling are what young buyers are after."
</P>
<P>
	   Other automakers have gone after younger buyers with more force. Among the
new vehicles targeted at the market are Chrysler's Neon and upcoming PT Cruiser,
the Toyota Echo and Ford's Focus -- all well-equipped models that carry far more
options than cars of that size and price had before.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford said Friday that one fourth of all Focus buyers so far were under 25
years old -- a higher share of younger buyers than any other vehicle sold in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
	   To compete with those models, Wagoner said GM would use more expressive
vehicles that are a step above the bottom of the market.
</P>
<P>
	   He points to the Pontiac Aztek, a new SUV coming out this year and the
Pontiac Piranha, a concept car that will be shown for the first time at this
week's Chicago Auto Show, as the types of vehicles that eventually will bring
younger buyers back into the GM fold.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our view is that we're increasingly focused on the kind of things that will
attract youthful (buyers) into the family," Wagoner said. "That's why we're
putting so much more emphasis on the Internet, because more people are using it
and because of the kind of people that are using it as well."
</P>
<P>
	   Analyst Jim Hall with AutoPacific said the Aztek and an upcoming Saturn SUV
had the potential to make GM a contender for those consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   "The fact that they're developing vehicles like that at all is amazing,"
Hall said. "Their attitude for a long time was that they were going to be a fast
second to market with a new product. The irony is that being second to market is
a losing proposition."

<HEADLINE> Candidates on the Issues: HMOs  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Three days a week, The Associated Press picks an issue and asks the
presidential candidates a question about it. Today's question and the responses:
</P>
<P>
	   Health Maintenance Organizations
</P>
<P>
	   Should federal law be changed to give patients new rights to sue their HMOs,
and, if so, should that right to sue be limited or unfettered?
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats:
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Bradley: ``Health care decisions should be made by doctors and their
patients, not an insurance company bureaucracy. A patient who feels that an HMO
has denied needed care should have the right to an independent appeals process
and should have the right to sue if harmed by an HMO decision. I support the
Patients' Bill of Rights and I would also push for a Consumers' Right to Know,
which would ensure that HMOs reveal important details of a plan that affects the
care you receive.''
</P>
<P>
	   Al Gore: ``I believe that we must pass a strong, enforceable Patients' Bill
of Rights to ensure that people insured by HMOs get the health care they need,
when they need it. For many people, the decisions HMOs make can be the
difference between life and death, and no one should have to worry about an HMO
at a time when they are worried about their immediate survival. That is why I am
calling for improved patient care by granting patients the right to an
independent appeal when they are denied treatment, access to specialists,
guaranteed coverage of emergency room treatment, and the right to hold health
maintenance organizations accountable for their actions that can allow
individuals to seek redress for decisions made by these organizations.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reform:
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Buchanan: ``Yes. If an HMO denies care to some individual and the
individual dies as a consequence, should his wife or survivor have a right to
sue? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans:
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush: ``I believe patients need access to a speedy and impartial
forum to resolve disputes over health care coverage. Texas has a law that gives
patients the right to seek legal action if they have been harmed. I allowed it
to become law because we have a strong, independent review process and other
protections designed to encourage quick, out of court resolutions instead of
costly litigation. The process is working in Texas. I would support similar
protections at the federal level provided they do not supersede the patient
protection laws Texas and many other states already have on the books.''
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes: ``Americans want the right to sue their HMOs because they feel
they don't have any control over their own health care. My 'Health Care
Declaration of Independence' would dramatically reform the system so all
Americans have the freedom to choose doctors they trust, specialists they need
and second opinions they want. A lawsuit should certainly be an option, but also
the last resort. Why can't people sue now? Because most people don't own their
health insurance policies and therefore have little recourse in either the
marketplace or in the courts. Most Americans with private insurance get their
health insurance through their jobs, but the policy is owned, not by them, but
by their employer. Under the Forbes plan, we would move to a system in which
people can own their own health insurance policies. They would have the option
to select from a variety of plans that could be arranged through their trade or
professional associations, their churches, or other trusted groups, including
their employers. Then, if they are denied care, they could take their health
plans to court for breach of contract, just as they would under any other
contract.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes: ``We have to take an approach that empowers those who are out
there looking for health care services, to be the ones who can make the choices
and make the decisions that will enforce, within that system, a relationship
between the money you pay, and the quality you get.''
</P>
<P>
	   John McCain: ``Yes. Once a patient has exhausted all options to obtain
appropriate medical care that has been denied by an HMO, including going through
a free and fair internal and external appeals process, that patient should have
the right to seek redress in the courts. The right to sue should be limited to
actual economic damages and capped non-economic damages under terms that do not
foster frivolous lawsuits or unduly add costs to the health care system.''

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton To Announce Candidacy  </HEADLINE>
   By MARC HUMBERT AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) -- With the president taking a step back from the
spotlight, Hillary Rodham Clinton planned to go before 2,000 people Sunday to
announce her Senate candidacy from a state she has called home for only a month.
</P>
<P>
	   The race for the seat being vacated by fellow Democrat Daniel Patrick
Moynihan is likely to pit Clinton against Rudolph Giuliani, the Republican mayor
of New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   No other first lady has ever run for public office and in doing so, Clinton
steps out of the long and scandal-scarred shadow of her husband.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton, daughter Chelsea and mother Dorothy Rodham assembled in
this New York City suburb to be with the first lady for her formal campaign
kickoff.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent polls have shown Giuliani with a slight lead over Clinton and running
even with her among women voters. That's a far cry from a year ago when sympathy
was strong from the Monica Lewinsky scandal and polls showed her well ahead of
the mayor.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday morning talk shows, Giuliani reminded viewers of Clinton's late
arrival to New York politics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My record of success comes out of my knowledge, experience, background and
life experience as a lifetime resident of the state,'' he said on CBS' ``Face
the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``How is it that the Democratic Party can't come up with a candidate for the
Senate from the state of New York? What does that say about the Democratic
Party?''
</P>
<P>
	   Last July at Moynihan's sprawling farm, Clinton kicked off a summer-long
``listening tour'' of the state that extended into the fall and took her from
Broadway to Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
	   By December, she was assuring supporters she intended to run. And in early
January, she moved into a $1.7 million house in suburban Westchester County just
north of New York City to establish residency.
</P>
<P>
	   For her formal announcement, Clinton chose the State University of New York
at Purchase not far from her new home. Political experts said there was good
reason to stage her announcement in Westchester.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When duck hunting, one goes where the ducks are,'' Republican consultant
Jay Severin said. ``The independent suburban ducks are the ducks in this
campaign that are yet to be bagged.''
</P>
<P>
	   In statewide races, suburban voters from Westchester County and Long Island
are considered a key to success. A Marist College poll released Friday showed
Giuliani leading in the suburbs, 56 percent to 34 percent, his strongest showing
in any region of the state.
</P>
<P>
	   While Giuliani dismissed the Clinton announcement as ``a Hollywood type of
thing,'' a top Democratic strategist not connected to the Clinton campaign said
it served a real purpose, especially for a famous out-of-towner still viewed
skeptically by many New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It makes people understand this is for real and not a joke. It's not a
game anymore,'' Hank Sheinkopf said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton campaign arranged for about 500 house parties to be held
simultaneously around the state so more than 20,000 supporters could watch the
announcement on television and then listen in on a conference telephone call
from the candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   As of the end of the year, Clinton had raised $8 million and Giuliani, who
started fund raising three months earlier, had raised almost $12 million. It is
expected to be the most expensive Senate race in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
	   In seeking to replace Moynihan in the Senate, Clinton hopes to make another
kind of history. No woman has ever been independently elected to statewide
office in New York. Former vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro
unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Senate nomination in 1992 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's terrific,'' Ferraro said. ``I think it's taking the role of
the first lady and putting it in the perspective of the 21st century.''

<HEADLINE> Police commanders feel pressure to keep crime numbers low  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Crime is down in cities nationwide and the unwritten
mantra of the police brass is: It better stay that way. But some criminologists
feel that motto can lead to trouble.
<P>
	   Police commanders are under pressure from their superiors' expectations, and
some have doctored statistics to show the number of offenses still going down.
Other commanders allege they were transferred when their precincts showed an
increase in crime.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, two New York captains were transferred, and the captains' union
says the moves were prompted by a jump in the number of crimes. In 1998, the
head of the police transportation bureau was forced to resign after he was
accused of underreporting subway offenses.
</P>
<P>
	   Such problems are not unique to New York City. The Philadelphia police
department has come under fire for allegedly reporting major crimes as minor
ones. Police in Boca Raton, Fla., and Atlanta also have been accused of
doctoring statistics.
</P>
<P>
	   Commanders have always been held accountable for what goes on in their
precincts, but in the 1990s a program known in some departments as COMPSTAT -
which uses computerized statistics to more accurately outline crime patterns -
began to put commanders on the hot seat.
</P>
<P>
	   Criminologists say, however, that COMPSTAT is not to blame. They maintain
the problem arises because police brass put too much weight on the statistics,
without looking at the broader picture.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've often used the term criminal justice limbo stick - how low can you
go?" said James Alan Fox, a criminal justice professor at Northeastern
University.
</P>
<P>
	   "Can we hold someone accountable because you can't go lower, and the only
way left to go is up?," Fox added. "Holding a commander accountable purely
because the crime number increased, especially after falling for many years in a
row is shortsighted and unfair."
</P>
<P>
	   Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University, agrees.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can't fire everybody," he said. "You have to understand what some of
the external factors are - which are under the control of the precinct commander
and ... which are not."
</P>
<P>
	   Former New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton, who introduced
COMPSTAT in the city, said if commanders were being transferred solely on the
basis of an increase in crime statistics, that was wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   "Despite our best efforts and best people, sometimes crime is going to go
up," said Bratton, commissioner from 1994 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   New York City police Capt. John F. Driscoll, who heads the Captains
Endowment Association - the union for police captains - said a person cannot
judge the effectiveness of a commanding officer by crime statistics alone.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have to take into account a commander's supervisory skills,
administrative skills, relationships with his cops and command, and more
importantly, his relationship with the community," Driscoll said.
</P>
<P>
	   Driscoll has criticized what he claims is the New York police practice of
transferring commanders when crime rises in their precincts. In the past few
weeks, Capt. James Guida of the 88th Precinct in Brooklyn and Capt. Joseph W.
Byrne of the 104th Precinct in Queens were transferred after statistics showed
an increase in crimes in their commands.
</P>
<P>
	   Police Commission Howard Safir denies Driscoll's allegations. "When I look
at whether or not to transfer a precinct commander, I look at the totality of
his performance," Safir said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Crime reduction is, of course, a very important factor, but community
relations is a very important factor, civilian complaints are a very important
factor. Precinct morale is a factor. Nobody gets transferred based strictly on
one thing."
</P>
<P>
	   Guida replaced Capt. Charles F. Dowd when auditors found in 1988 that Dowd
had underreported crimes by classifying felonies as misdemeanors. Dowd was
transferred instead of being fired because officials said he had not willfully
deceived the department.
</P>
<P>
	   Also in 1998, the head of the Police Transportation Bureau, Chief Kenneth
Donohue, resigned after he was accused of underreporting subway crime. Earlier
that year, Safir said subway crime had been underreported for decades by as much
as 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Many crimes committed on trains or in stations were recorded as having
occurred above ground, he said, adding that the error was discovered during an
audit.
</P>
<P>
	   Other departments have seen similar problems. In 1998, the Philadelphia
police department came under fire when it was revealed that reports were being
rewritten to exclude key facts and that major offenses were being recast as
minor ones. The allegations prompted an inquiry by the FBI, and the city had to
withdraw its crime figures from the FBI for 1996, 1997 and part of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, Atlanta Deputy Police Chief Louis Arcangeli alleged that the
department's 1996 crime statistics were softened by writing off some unsolved
crimes and misclassifying some violent crimes as non-violent.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard claimed a state audit
exonerated his department of any wrongdoing, but the audit included an FBI
finding a significant number of robberies, rapes and car thefts were incorrectly
listed as unfounded.
</P>
<P>
	   Arcangeli has since been demoted to captain, but Harvard denied this was
because of his allegations. Arcangeli continues to work for the department and
said in a recent telephone interview that police commanders are now vigilant
about reporting crimes because the state is monitoring the department.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, Attorney General Janet Reno ordered an informal inquiry into the
Boca Raton, Fla., police department to see if officers downgraded hundreds of
crimes to enhance the city's image as a safe place to live. The scandal cost
Police Chief Peter Petracco and the department's No. 3 ranking officer their
jobs. The department allegedly downgraded burglaries and petty thefts to the
point where they did not need to be included in the city's annual report to the
state and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
	   Mary Victoria Pyne, unit chief with the Uniformed Crime Reporting Program
managed by the FBI, said the federal government scrutinizes crime data from
17,000 law enforcement agencies, making it hard for police officers doctoring
statistics to get away with it.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are not seeing a lot of inaccurate statistics," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bratton also said that COMPSTAT makes it nearly impossible to fudge
statistics without it eventually being uncovered.
</P>
<P>
	   "COMPSTAT is about transparency. You have to come out and show your peers
what you've done," he said. "If crime is way down in your precinct, your
colleagues will ask you how you did that, and you'll have to answer. There's
nowhere to hide."

<HEADLINE> Simon Estes carves niche as one of world's finest performers of  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Simon Estes was flying around the world, singing to
rousing ovations. But back in his hotel room at night, he was "crying like a
baby," says the towering 61-year-old baritone.
<P>
	   "And I had lumps in my throat bigger than grapefruits - before, during and
after the singing," Estes says of the personal struggle after his recent
divorce. "But I thought, well, I have to take this incredible pain and make
myself stronger, and go on."
</P>
<P>
	   With his patrician presence and rich voice, Estes has carved a niche for
himself as one of the world's finest performers of Verdi and Wagner, singing
alongside stars like Placido Domingo and Leontyne Price. And his new
autobiography is filled with photos of Estes in the company of world leaders -
Nelson Mandela, Pope John Paul II, former President Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   But the glossy tome begins with a simple boy growing up in Iowa amid fierce
segregation.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I was a kid, we couldn't go into the swimming pool with white people,"
Estes remembers. "They'd disinfect the pool, and then they'd let the white kids
come in. You know, those 'black' germs were in the water."
</P>
<P>
	   This kid had a splendid voice. He ended up at New York's Juilliard School
and soon became the only black male opera singer of great celebrity.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, he says, "the world did not let me forget that I have a darker skin
color than you."
</P>
<P>
	   For his 1965 debut at the Deutsche Oper in Berlin, he was subjected to
makeup that made him look "white as a ghost," he says.
</P>
<P>
	   And in the 1970s, "I remember singing in one of those Southern cities, and
the director of the opera house came up to me and said, 'Simon, I want to work
with you, but I can't because some of the people who are giving us money said if
I engaged you, they're going to take away the funds. And we need the money."'
</P>
<P>
	   Things have changed. In his hometown of Centerville, Iowa, the local high
school auditorium was named after him several years ago. "That was a way of
saying, 'Simon, we're sorry."'
</P>
<P>
	   He has given concerts around Iowa, and the state has given him the Iowan
Award, it's highest honor. This was the first time it went to a black person.
</P>
<P>
	   But his racially charged journey has left its mark.
</P>
<P>
	   When he teaches classes at Iowa State University, he speaks not only about
music, but about human values, telling students: "Don't ever compromise your
principles to try to get a job, or a position or relationship, or whatever."
</P>
<P>
	   And despite his success, he's still waging an age-old battle to bring more
talented black male singers into classical music. There are plenty of black
female stars, he says, but only a handful of men.
</P>
<P>
	   "Find me a group of people where one gender can sing, and the other gender
cannot sing!" he says. "It's one of the last big hurdles that we still have to
overcome."
</P>
<P>
	   Estes tempers such frustrations by thinking of Nelson Mandela, for whom he
has sung.
</P>
<P>
	   "Here was a man who was unjustly incarcerated for 27 years. He came out and
not one time did he speak of revenge or hatred or bitterness," Estes says. "In
order not to have hatred when you have been so unjustly treated requires an
inner strength that I personally think has to come from a higher source."
</P>
<P>
	   Before each performance, he prays. "I pray that the gift God has given me
touches somebody's heart out there," says Estes, his face illuminated by a
winter sun as he sits on the glassed-in porch of his New Jersey home.
</P>
<P>
	   He glances at his watch to make sure it's not too late to call Switzerland,
where his three daughters live with their mother.
</P>
<P>
	   He has just finished vacuuming the white carpet; again he's a bachelor who
does his own cooking, laundry and ironing. He doesn't need to do housework,
given his six-figure income from work at the Met, the Vienna State Opera and the
Washington Opera.
</P>
<P>
	   But this man has a different definition of success.
</P>
<P>
	   "The more I sing, the more, in quotes, 'success' I have - whatever that may
be - the more humble and grateful I'd like to become, instead of feeling that
everybody has to cater to me and I have to have the presidential suite and a
limousine that's 40 feet long," Estes said.
</P>
<P>
	   To him, success means "being at peace with yourself."
</P>
<P>
	   There's at least one sore spot: The divorce he granted his wife more than a
year ago. Leaving her and their three daughters, ages 12, 14 and 16, "was the
most difficult thing in my life."
</P>
<P>
	   And it made performing tough, especially the lead role in Wagner's "Flying
Dutchman" for which Estes is famed. He pointed out that his character says at
one point, "Oh, I'm without a wife and I'm without a child," and said that's
when the lump arose in his throat.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've always been a very strong person in my life. But this broke me, it
really broke me," he says. "I flew around the world, and I was in hotel rooms
crying like a baby."
</P>
<P>
	   He survived through friends and prayer, and the shows went on. And now, his
piano accompanist tells him, he's singing at his best again.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm almost cured," Estes says. "And I think about trying to improve my
life, to be a better person."
</P>
<P>
	   He sponsors an educational foundation that gives scholarships to talented
students. Two years ago, he founded the Simon Estes High School near Cape Town,
South Africa, with almost 200 students who are focused on music. Last year, 40
of them attended school in Iowa for the academic year.
</P>
<P>
	   The baritone has perhaps another dozen years of performing ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
	   In March, he'll appear at Carnegie Hall in Ponchielli's "La Gioconda,"
followed by Verdi's "Aida" in Los Angeles with Domingo, appearances in Tokyo and
opera dates all over Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   And he says he'll stop performing "while I can still sing. ... I want to try
to be like Michael Jordan."
</P>
<P>
	   His final, dream concert in Washington is already planned, except for the
exact date. The program will include "Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen," as
well as a rendition of the 27th Psalm, "The Lord is my light."
</P>
<P>
	   And Estes will offer a beloved song by Gustav Mahler, "Ich bin der Welt
Abhanden Gekommen," meaning "I am lost to the world."
</P>
<P>
	   It ends with the words: "I live alone in my heaven, in my love and in my
song...."

<HEADLINE> Latest poll says candidates remain neck and neck  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A new poll released Sunday on the U.S. Senate race finds
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in a statistical dead heat,
but with a majority expecting Giuliani to eventually win.
<P>
	   The survey by the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute shows Giuliani with a
45 to 42 percent lead over Clinton, but the difference disappears once the
3-point margin of error is figured in.
</P>
<P>
	   Ten percent of those surveyed were undecided.
</P>
<P>
	   But fully half of those polled - including some Clinton supporters - expect
the mayor to win. Only 31 percent expect Clinton to win.
</P>
<P>
	   Female voters of all races were about equally split between the two groups,
but white women prefer the mayor, 52 to 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey also found that Giuliani is regarded as more knowledgeable about
state issues, while Clinton is regarded as having a more suitable personality
for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Seventy-three percent of those surveyed said the mayor understands the
issues and problems facing New York State, but only 42 percent say the same of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   And while 70 percent think Clinton has the personality to be an effective
U.S. Senator, only 58 percent believe Giuliani does.
</P>
<P>
	   More than seven in 10 voters rated both of them high on leadership and
intelligence, although people gave Giuliani slightly higher marks for leadership
and her slightly higher marks for brains.
</P>
<P>
	   And a month after Clinton moved into her new Westchester home in Chappaqua,
46 percent still say that it bothers them that she's not from New York, compared
to 54 percent who say that it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
	   A Quinnipiac survey taken a year ago showed Clinton leading Giuliani 54-36,
with 57 percent saying they expected the mayor would ultimately win.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Clinton and Giuliani were given favorable ratings by a little more than
a third of those polled. That's a few points lower for Giuliani since January,
but Clinton's best favorability rating since June.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was to formally announce her candidacy Sunday while Giuliani got his
share of the media's attention with appearances on five TV talk shows.
</P>
<P>
	   "Today's big show by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton may cause a thaw, but
so far the Senate race seems frozen, with Mayor Giuliani holding on the high
side of a squeaker," Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac College Polling
Institute, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll surveyed 1,072 registered voters by phone from Feb. 2 to 5.

    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - State legislators have embarked on a display of very
public angst if not outrage over one of the biggest spikes in home heating oil
prices ever in peacetime.
<P>
	   At hearings last week, lawmakers probed expert witnesses about the global
petroleum distribution system, the size of national oil reserves, the effects of
cold weather on prices and other aspects of a problem that, ultimately, they
probably cannot affect one whit.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's not a lot I think you can do to intercede in the system," said
Michael Trunzo, chief executive officer of the Empire State Petroleum
Association and son of longtime state Sen. Caesar Trunzo. "There really isn't
anything they can do."
</P>
<P>
	   A former energy analyst under Gov. Mario Cuomo agreed there's nothing state
government can do about the current price crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   But you wouldn't know it in Albany, where no less than two legislative
hearings were held last week on the oil price increase. The state Senate will
hold another hearing Monday on the same subject, and says it has more planned.
</P>
<P>
	   "While it may be viewed by some as good politics, it can also result in good
policy," state Sen. James Wright, a Jefferson County Republican, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Richard Dollinger, D-Rochester, called the Legislature's gathering and
review of facts on the oil price spike "government at its finest."
</P>
<P>
	   Wright, chairman of the Senate Energy and Telecommunications Committee, will
be co-chairing the Legislature's third oil price hearing Monday with Republican
Sen. Charles Fuschillo, chairman of the Senate Consumer Protection Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   That's not to be confused with the joint oil price hearing in the Assembly
which was run by Energy Committee Chairman Paul Tonko, D-Amsterdam, and Audrey
Pheffer, D-Queens, chairwoman of the Assembly Consumer Affairs and Protection
Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Tonko said he suggested to Wright that the committees be combined to avoid
duplication of effort. Last week, four of the same witnesses testified before at
both the Assembly and Senate hearings.
</P>
<P>
	   Wright, however, said Senate and Assembly members from four committees would
be too unwieldy at one hearing. And besides, he said, the Senate's energy and
consumer protection committees were looking at the oil pricing problem
differently than the Assembly's energy and consumer affairs committees.
</P>
<P>
	   The sessions are shaping up along the lines of hearings in 1990, when prices
also jumped during another cold snap when supplies were low and utilities
temporarily switched large customers from natural gas to oil. Price gouging was
suspected then, too, but not proved. Trunzo said his testimony will mirror his
trade association's testimony in 1990,	   So why are lawmakers, who haven't
produced an on-time state budget since Ronald Reagan was president, taking on
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the free market system?
Heating oil users are also voters.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, the typical home heating oil price is starting to drop a few
pennies a gallon last week, according to the Empire State Petroleum Association.
The average price apparently peaked around Jan. 24 at about $1.67 a gallon -
compared to $1.19 on Jan. 10 and 90 cents a gallon in the fall. But competition
prompted retailers to absorb some of the wholesale price increase that doubled
over 14 days in January, according to the association.
</P>
<P>
	   The political outrage from New York officials so far hasn't seemed to light
a fire in Washington, or with OPEC.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. George Pataki a week ago said the Clinton administration response to
requests for help was inadequate. New York has 1.4 million poor people who could
get federal money to pay fuel bills and Pataki had sought between $35 million
and $40 million in emergency aid. Instead, New York got $2.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki, GOP Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, Democratic U.S. Sen.
Charles Schumer and others also called on Washington to release some of the
nation's oil reserves to help offset the high fuel prices, but U.S. Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson rejected that plea.
</P>
<P>
	   So the hearings continue to seek answers to why this crisis happened, what
can be done about it and how a repeat be can avoided.
</P>
<P>
	   In testimony in both hearings last week, the president of the state Energy
Research and Development Authority indicated there may not be much government
can do about a price spike in a free market. William Valentino's recommendation:
"We should continue to investigate and study the situation."

<HEADLINE> US Considers Ways To Cut Oil Prices  </HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. MANN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is trying to persuade world
oil producers to put more oil on the market and is studying whether emergency
U.S. stocks could or should be tapped to drive down prices, a top White House
official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Ideally, ``the market ought to set the price, but we're taking a look at
what options we have under the authorities and under the laws of the United
States,'' said John Podesta, the president's chief of staff said.
</P>
<P>
	   He was asked on ``Fox News Sunday'' about whether the administration would
dip into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to force down the price from its
current level of close to $30 a barrel. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said
repeatedly last week he does not intend to do that.
</P>
<P>
	   Podesta said Richardson's contacts with oil ministers of producing countries
-- several already, with visits to Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico planned --
are a major part of the administration's effort to bring down prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are meeting
next month to consider whether to extend a production hold-down of 5 million
barrels per day, which began in 1998 and expires March 31.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton released $45 million last week to help low-income people
in the frigid Northeast with their heating bills. Podesta said in addition to
such stopgap measures, ``We're also trying to see what we can do to see if we
can take some of the pressure off of oil prices'' through raising market
supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   To the suggestion the U.S. reserve was created only to compensate for
disruptions in supply, Podesta said it ``was put in place with its name in mind,
to have a strategic reserve to make sure that we had an adequate supply of oil,
and that's what it's used for.''
</P>
<P>
	   But he said: ``There are certain authorities under the law that are
available, and we're taking a look at those.''
</P>
<P>
	   The reserve, first suggested during World War II, was established in 1975.
Its only use so far was a partial drawdown in 1991 at the beginning of the
Persian Gulf War. That move by President Bush and production increases
internationally maintained market stability and kept down oil price increases
during the six-week war.
</P>
<P>
	   On other items, Podesta said:
</P>
<P>
	   --Although the president supports the death penalty, he has asked advisers
for research into whether it should be suspended for federal crimes, as Gov.
George Ryan did in Illinois. Ryan acted because of misgivings about the Illinois
justice system, which has seen more death row inmates exonerated and freed since
1987 than have been executed since 1976.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Given the facts in Illinois,'' Podesta said, ``he's just asked us to get
some more information.''
</P>
<P>
	   --The United States has ``made strong protests to the Russian government''
over the fate of Andrei Babitsky, a Russian reporter for the U.S. government's
Radio Liberty, who was arrested by Russian troops while covering the fighting in
Chechnya. The Russians contend they turned Babitsky over to Chechen rebels in
exchange for Russian prisoners-of-war, but the reporter has not been heard from
and is considered by many to have been slain by Russian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't know his status, and we're obviously very concerned about it,''
Podesta said. ``We have made our views known to the Russian government. We've
pressed them on this.''

<HEADLINE> For Hillary Clinton the battle begins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) - For Hillary Rodham Clinton, Sunday's formal entry
into the New York Senate campaign is the first step down a very bumpy road that
can lead to her becoming a political force in her own right or a footnote in
history.
<P>
	   With most polls showing her likely Republican rival, New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, slightly ahead, "it is she who must change the fundamental
dynamics. She's got to shake things up," Republican consultant Jay Severin said.
</P>
<P>
	   "She needs to, as the political consultants say, get on message and generate
a little more enthusiasm from her base supporters," pollster Lee Miringoff, head
of Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion, said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by an almost 5-3 margin,
Clinton not only finds herself trailing Giuliani overall, but with no advantage
among women voters.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, a Marist poll out Friday showed Giuliani leading Clinton among
white women, 52 percent to 34 percent. The poll also showed him taking 23
percent of Democratic voters while she landed just 12 percent of Republicans.
Among independent voters, Giuliani led Clinton, 57 percent to 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Not to worry, says former vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro, the
former congresswoman from Queens who twice unsuccessfully sought the Democratic
Senate nomination in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "Once people hear where he stands on issues that are important to us on a
federal level, it's a different ball game," Ferraro predicted. "Then, you will
see the Democratic voters running straight home to Hillary and you will see
women moving in great numbers into her column."
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, Clinton's campaign strategy has been clear for months. At every
opportunity, she stresses the need for better schools, more affordable quality
health care, lower transportation costs and more job-creating programs. And, she
questions whether the often blunt Giuliani has the proper temperament to get
along and get things done in the collegial Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   "The mayor always gets angry about things," she said late last year during a
stop in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
	   "She's got to engage the mayor on issues that play for her," veteran
Republican operative Nelson Warfield said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anything that lets her get in the game and actually start trading blows
with this guy has got to be good for her," Warfield added.
</P>
<P>
	   But the GOP consultant, who is not involved in the Senate race, cautioned
that Clinton's task isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every other contender who has ever gone up against Rudy Giuliani has tried
to bait him into making some sort of mistake," Warfield said. "But he's an
incredibly disciplined hothead, so he has largely avoided that fate. But she
will eventually attempt to pull it off."
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, Democratic consultant Hank Sheinkopf, who is also not
involved in the campaign, said Clinton's surrounding herself with family,
including President Clinton, at her campaign announcement Sunday was a smart
move.
</P>
<P>
	   "It shows she is a family person in spite of all the troubles they have
experienced," he said. "It makes her more human. It removes the sharp edges."
</P>
<P>
	   Sheinkopf said having President Clinton along could also be a big help for
her in heavily Democratic New York City where he remains highly popular and even
in the crucial suburbs of Long Island.
</P>
<P>
	   "He won Nassau County in '92 and '96," Sheinkopf recalled.
</P>
<P>
	   One issue still haunting Clinton is the carpetbagger charge. Until she moved
into a $1.7 million house in suburban Westchester County on Jan. 6 she had never
lived or worked in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   But the latest Marist poll found that for the first time since February of
last year, fewer than half the voters surveyed expressed concern that Clinton
lacked New York roots.
</P>
<P>
	   Forty-seven percent of voters said they were at least somewhat concerned
about Clinton not being from New York while 41 percent said they were not
concerned at all about that. In the Marist poll, the carpetbagger concern peaked
in December when 57 percent of voters said they were at least somewhat
concerned.
</P>
<P>
	   Miringoff said the bottom line in the Senate race is that while "Giuliani is
ahead, Clinton is within striking distance."
</P>
<P>
	   "She has to shore up her Democratic base and if she does that, she's fine,"
Ferraro said.

<HEADLINE> The 'other' Carnegie Hall brings music, art to West Virginia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LEWISBURG, W.Va. (AP) - The name "Carnegie Hall" conjures up
superlatives, a place where only the best perform.
<P>
	   It also conjures up New York.
</P>
<P>
	   But there are two other Carnegie Halls, also built with money from steel
baron Andrew Carnegie and used to present quality arts to their communities.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides New York and Carnegie's hometown of Dunfermline, Scotland, there is
Lewisburg, where this four-story Georgian Revival Carnegie Hall sits just a bit
off the beaten path.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're the humble stepsister," says Vivian Conly, executive director in
Lewisburg.
</P>
<P>
	   Once the richest man in the world, Carnegie gave away millions of his vast
fortune to fund libraries. And while many of those have music halls, including
the one in Pittsburgh, Carnegie seldom donated money to fund places solely
devoted to music and the performing arts.
</P>
<P>
	   The spacious New York hall can seat thousands; Lewisburg, which cost $33,000
in 1902, can hold only 400. And where gracefully curved tiered seating and plush
carpet add to the New York hall's luxury, dark red plaster walls and teal
leather seats help hide imperfections in Lewisburg.
</P>
<P>
	   Because it was built for the Lewisburg Female Institute, which later became
the Greenbrier College for Women, "it's institutional rather than elegant and
grand," Conly says.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, patrons and performers seem to enjoy the intimate setting, where
paintings by local artists grace the lobby and a hand-carved staircase leads to
the balcony above.
</P>
<P>
	   The red brick building also houses art and dance studios, a small museum and
meeting rooms. A kitchen is used for culinary classes, while several other rooms
are used for weaving, pottery, basket-making and glass art. Skills learned in
class are seen in a vibrant mosaic that covers a once drab wall.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Carnegie built his fortune as a steel tycoon in neighboring
Pennsylvania, he had no connection to West Virginia. He was persuaded by James
Lang, chairman of the Board of Trustees of the women's college, to donate money
to replace a structure destroyed by fire.
</P>
<P>
	   The men shared the same Scottish roots.
</P>
<P>
	   That simple connection produced a place that brings the arts to southern
West Virginia, with live performances by artists from around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., who with his own wealthy family has been a
staunch supporter of the arts, called the Lewisburg hall a "wonderful asset."
</P>
<P>
	   "It may not have the same stature as its New York cousin, but as far as I'm
concerned, it's the jewel of the Carnegie Hall family," Rockefeller says.
</P>
<P>
	   Carnegie Hall lay dormant for years after the women's college closed in
1972. For several years it was used as a mental hospital. But when the once
stately building was about to be condemned in 1983, local residents formed a
nonprofit group to save it.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1995, in the midst of a nearly $3 million renovation project, the
National Endowment for the Arts recognized the Lewisburg hall as a model for
rural arts agency management and arts education.
</P>
<P>
	   And two years later, it was chosen for inclusion in The John F. Kennedy
Performing Arts Center and Schools' Partners in Education program.
</P>
<P>
	   "Carnegie Hall," Conly says, "is one of West Virginia's greatest treasures."
</P>
<P>
	   Celebrated violinist Isaac Stern, the namesake of Carnegie Hall's main
auditorium in New York, played the West Virginia hall in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, country and bluegrass star Ricky Skaggs and
blues artist Taj Mahal are among the many performers to take the stage here,
along with the Vienna Boys' Choir, the National Theater of the Deaf and the
Mystical Arts of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
	   The monks, who have shared stages with Phillip Glass, Paul Simon, Patti
Smith, Natalie Merchant and the Beastie Boys, spent a week in Lewisburg last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   This season, the Millennium Performance Series includes artists Angela Au,
who, at age 11, played piano for Queen Elizabeth II; Celtic Rhythm, a group of
Irish step dancers and musicians; and The Dillards, who appeared as the Darling
family on the "Andy Griffith Show" in the 1960s.

<HEADLINE> Prosecution case to conclude with Diallo autopsy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - One of the 19 bullets pierced Amadou Diallo's aorta,
left lung and spine. Another tunneled through his liver and right lung. Others
broke his arm and leg.
<P>
	   A medical examiner is expected to present those findings and others in
gruesome detail at the close of the prosecution case against four police
officers accused of murdering the 22-year-old street vendor on his Bronx
doorstep. The official could testify by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Nineteen of the 41 bullets that the defendants fired at Diallo on Feb. 4,
1999, struck him. An autopsy found that one went into his right leg, traveled
upward and lodged behind his right knee - a route that could help prove
prosecutor Eric Warner's claim last week in opening statements that the officers
kept pulling their triggers after the West African immigrant "was falling down
or actually on the ground."
</P>
<P>
	   Kenneth Boss, 28; Sean Carroll, 36; Edward McMellon, 27; and Richard Murphy,
27, have pleaded innocent to the second-degree murder charges. If convicted,
they face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The killing of an unarmed black man by four white officers produced a flood
of pretrial publicity and protests alleging widespread abuse of minorities by
police. An appeals court responded by moving the case to Albany, where it is
being televised.
</P>
<P>
	   The plain clothes officers allegedly made a "conscious decision" to kill
Diallo. Without warning, they cornered him in the vestibule of his two-story
apartment house and opened fire, prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
	   But defense attorneys argue the shooting was a tragic - but justified -
mistake made while their clients searched Diallo's neighborhood for dangerous
suspects. They contend the victim caused a chain reaction by not heeding orders
to stop and suddenly pulling out a black wallet that, because of darkness,
appeared to be a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial, once expected to last a month or longer, is moving quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first two days, the jury - four black women, two white women and six
white men - heard from police and other witnesses who described the spot where
Diallo died as well lighted. One of Diallo's neighbors, Debbie Rivera, also
testified that she heard a volley of gunfire followed by a brief pause, then a
longer, final volley.
</P>
<P>
	   Another neighbor, a police recruit named Thomas Bell, reportedly will
testify this week that he also heard a pause. The testimony of Rivera and Bell
could be used to argue the officers had a clear chance to cease fire.
</P>
<P>
	   But in a defense case that should begin this week, attorneys hope to portray
the neighbors as unreliable. They plan to call a sergeant who interviewed Rivera
on the night of the shooting. His report says she heard one continuous burst.
</P>
<P>
	   Other defense witnesses include a paramedic who used a flashlight to view
Diallo's body in a vestibule because, attorneys say, the lighting was so poor.
Also, Murphy's attorney, James Culleton, told jurors they would hear from
someone who will "tell you that (Diallo) was acting suspicious, peeking in and
out of this vestibule" moments before the officers rolled up in an unmarked car.
</P>
<P>
	   The centerpiece of the defense case will be the officers themselves. All
four have said they want to take the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
	   "You will hear from Ken Boss," the officer's attorney, Steven Brounstein,
told jurors. "And what I will ask you to do is step inside his shoes and try to
view what he viewed and hear what he heard that night. When you do that, you
will find in your heart and your head that his conduct was justified."

<HEADLINE> Decent Housing Elusive for Navajos  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE RUSHLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) -- Wanda Segina and her four young children moved to
the capital of the nation's largest American Indian nation and promptly made one
home improvement.
</P>
<P>
	   They dug an outhouse.
</P>
<P>
	   The family has no electricity, no running water and no sewer. They cook over
an open fire and bathe in water hauled in by relatives. And though the trailer
the family shares has three bedrooms, they sleep in one, huddling together in
the cold winter nights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a living hell. It's a disaster for me as a mom,'' said Segina, whose
children attend the local elementary school.
</P>
<P>
	   Segina's living conditions are shared by thousands on the 4.8 million-acre
Navajo Reservation, which sprawls across portions of Arizona, New Mexico and
Utah, and throughout America's Indian reservations, where housing is in
desperately short supply and often substandard.
</P>
<P>
	   The National American Indian Housing Council estimates U.S. reservations
need 200,000 houses to alleviate overcrowding and replace inadequate dwellings.
</P>
<P>
	   More than half of the Navajo Reservation's 56,372 homes lack complete
plumbing and a large percentage still use wood as the primary heating source,
according to 1990 census figures.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The country is moving so rapidly, we're losing the chance to catch up,''
said Navajo community development director Benjamin Jones.
</P>
<P>
	   What keeps many American Indians from being able to buy or live in adequate
homes is a head-spinning host of problems: high unemployment, few willing
lenders, almost no private land and bureaucratic red tape.
</P>
<P>
	   Even basic knowledge about establishing good credit and applying for
mortgages can trip up many would-be buyers, said Ernest Goatson, director of the
Navajo Housing Service Department.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The (federal) housing program is more of a subsidy program than a home
ownership program,'' he said. ``They see a house more as a giveaway.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tradition can also prove a major obstacle to modern housing, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
	   Navajos have historically lived far apart, with the rugged northern Arizona
hills separating their corn crops and sheep from their neighbors. Their hogans,
round dwellings built from native trees, were constructed by individual
families.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The way they saw their homes was spiritual, more of a cathedral, not
property,'' Jones said. Building a home, he said, was a measure of manhood.
</P>
<P>
	   For Navajos like Segina, for whom traditional dwellings are less important,
money is an insurmountable obstacle.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Segina, roughly half of the Navajo Reservation's 151,105 residents are
unemployed.
</P>
<P>
	   The single mother's only sources of income are child support and the odd
auto-repair job, making it almost impossible for her to raise the $6,000 it
would cost to connect her to the closest power line and the $8,000 it would cost
for a water connection.
</P>
<P>
	   So instead, her children Maxine, Keevin, Marita and Thurman do their
homework by the daylight that seeps through the living room window or by a
Coleman lantern at night. They drink canned milk and eat canned meat.
</P>
<P>
	   Even Navajos with steady jobs face obstacles to home ownership.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones holds a position in Navajo government roughly equivalent to a Cabinet
post, yet he lives in government housing he calls a ``stall.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd be happy to buy a place if there was a place to buy, but there's
not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Indian reservations are generally made up of trust land controlled by the
federal government or family allotments, which can have dozens or even hundreds
of owners. Such allotments create so much red tape and uncertainty for lending
institutions that conventional mortgages are rarely granted.
</P>
<P>
	   Between 1992 and 1996, just 90 conventional loans were made in Indian
country, and half of those came from a tribally owned bank, said Christopher
Boesen, executive director of the National American Indian Housing Council in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Reservations sorely lack private financing because many lenders don't see
reservations as viable home loan markets, he said, forcing many Indians to live
in substandard housing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the land America has forgotten,'' said Scott Bray, who works with
the Navajo community development division but is not a tribal member. ``America
has forgotten about these people.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley to fight back in hope of rebounding  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Bruised by losses in Iowa and New Hampshire, Bill
Bradley's presidential campaign is fighting back against the aggressive campaign
being waged by rival Al Gore. Though the strategy is not entirely risk-free,
aides have concluded that Gore's tactics have left Bradley with little choice
but to respond.
<P>
	   "Part of our strategy will be drawing a contrast with the vice president,
which we will do increasingly," said Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking at a predominantly black church in Queens on Sunday to campaign
with activist Al Sharpton, Bradley said "I think I have to communicate better
with the Democratic base."
</P>
<P>
	   He wasted little time resuming his criticisms of Gore, which he had stepped
up in the closing days of the contest in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing earlier Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press," the former New Jersey
senator renewed his attack on Gore's fund-raising practices in the last
campaign, criticizing the vice president's 1996 appearance at a Buddhist temple
near Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think he has to explain more thoroughly what was happening at the
Buddhist temple, said Bradley. "If he didn't know it was a fund-raiser then he
was spectacularly naive."
</P>
<P>
	   He again warned that Republicans will hammer Gore with the issue in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no doubt in my mind that is going to happen," Bradley said. "This
is a real risk in the fall. The Democratic Party is taking a risk."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley also has challenged Gore on health care and his record on abortion
and says voters want a "fresh start," a thinly veiled reference to President
Clinton's troubles.
</P>
<P>
	   "America is about competition, political campaigns are about competition,"
said Bradley, defending his assault. "If your positions are misrepresented, you
can only take it so long. That's the way I'll continue for the next four or five
weeks."
</P>
<P>
	   By then, the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination could well be
decided, with a high-stakes showdown in California, New York and other states on
March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   "California is the neutral ground," said Gore campaign spokesman Chris
Lehane.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have to take off on March 7," acknowledged Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   One place to begin is within his own party. Much of the Democratic
establishment is behind Gore and one of Bradley's most urgent tasks is winning
back key constituencies like blacks and women who surveys show overwhelmingly
support the vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   Both rivals took a breather over the weekend before launching an intense
burst of campaigning leading up to the big round of March 7 primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley opened his week in New York and was heading to Florida. Gore, too,
was beginning in New York, and both were setting aside ample time for
California.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have to win California," Bradley said. "I know I have some ground to make
up."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore also has focused heavily on California, and has the backing of key
state leaders like Gov. Gray Davis and organized labor. Polls give Gore the edge
there - a Field poll in mid-January had him ahead 44 percent to 17 percent - but
they can be unreliable as voters begin to tune in to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Countering Bradley, Gore's aides said they will continue the kind of
grassroots, retail campaign that led to success in the opening contests in Iowa
and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   "Al Gore is a national candidate," said Lehane, Gore's spokesman. "We'll be
campaigning in virtually every state where they have a primary. There's only one
candidate in this race who is undefeated and that's Al Gore."
</P>
<P>
	   For Bradley, the debate has been one of tactics. A core campaign theme has
been his argument that he's a nontraditional candidate who operates above the
charges and countercharges that have become staples of political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   But in the face of early setbacks, Bradley's approach has shifted. Backers
like Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska have urged Bradley - who picks up Secret
Service protection Monday - to be more aggressive and respond to Gore - and
that's becoming apparent.

<HEADLINE> McCain Defends Special Interest Cash  </HEADLINE>
   By EUN-KYUNG KIM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate
who is barnstorming the country on a promise to break the grip of special
interests, on Sunday defended accepting contributions from such groups.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I welcome the support of anyone in the form of $1,000 contributions, but
they know clearly well where I stand, they know clearly I want to break the iron
triangle,'' the Arizona senator said on ABC's ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, whose push to overhaul federal campaign finance laws is the
centerpiece of his campaign, was accused Friday by GOP presidential rival George
W. Bush of engaging in ``Washington double talk'' for attacking special
interests while courting their support.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, recently came under fire
for writing letters on behalf of powerful interests and accepting contributions
from donors who often have business before his committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, stopped short of calling McCain a
hypocrite.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator McCain sees himself and portrays himself as an advent of campaign
finance reform, as somebody who is cleaner than anyone else around the table,
and yet he has accepted contributions and sought contributions from people with
legislation pending before his committee,'' Rove said on CBS' ``Face the
Nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   But McCain said there was nothing hypocritical about accepting contributions
from lobbyists, including some who represent clients with interests before the
committee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to get money from everybody in America and if someone who has a
special interest wants to give to my campaign and they're interested in reform,
that's fine,'' he said. ``The message is clear -- there's going to be a change
in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who plans a major fund-raiser Thursday in Washington that will be
broadcast via satellite to about 30 sites nationwide, said many of his
contributors support his efforts to change the way political campaigns are
financed.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has been on a roll since defeating Bush in the New Hampshire primary
last Tuesday. He said he has expected attacks from members of the GOP
establishment who feel threatened by his efforts, and that the attacks are
``coming at me from all sides.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm like Luke Skywalker trying to get through the Death Star,'' McCain
quipped.

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As President Clinton prepared to reveal a $1.84 trillion
farewell budget full of politically popular programs from health care to
education, the administration warned Sunday that Republican efforts to pass big
tax cuts would face another presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's final budget, coming out Monday and covering the 2001 fiscal year
that begins Oct. 1, promises a replay of last year's battle with the
GOP-controlled Congress over what to do with the $3 trillion or more in
surpluses the booming economy is projected to provide over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides would use two-thirds of the surplus, the portion generated by
Social Security, to wipe out the $3.7 trillion of publicly owned debt within the
$5.7 trillion national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   But it is the other third of the surplus, around $1 trillion, where big
disagreements occur.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton wants a large portion of the non-Social Security surplus to shore up
Medicare, the government's huge health program for the elderly, and to boost
spending on a wide range of services: education, the environment, increased
health-care coverage for the uninsured and many others.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans in Congress have pledged to fight for more generous tax cuts and
have attacked Clinton's budget for proposing billions of dollars in new
government spending.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's budget will offer $350 billion in tax relief to low- and
middle-income taxpayers while proposing $100 billion in tax increases, including
a renewed attack on closing corporate loopholes that Congress has rejected
before.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the president forces us to choose between his raising taxes or raiding
Social Security to fund his expansion of government, his budget is dead on
arrival,'' said House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio. ``A lame
duck president should not be able to derail us on the way toward retiring the
national debt, tax relief and saving Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans are putting together a rival tax-cutting strategy that seeks to
pass a variety of smaller targeted tax cut bills instead of the huge $792
billion tax cut package that Clinton vetoed last year.
</P>
<P>
	   John Podesta, the president's chief of staff, said on ``Fox News Sunday''
that the GOP strategy apparently was ``just take the tax bill that the president
vetoed last year, take the staples out of it and try to pass it one page at a
time. ... It was a bad bill last year, and doing it that way is a bad thing this
year.''
</P>
<P>
	   Podesta still offered hope for compromise with the Republican Congress to
provide tax relief but he made clear the administration would insist on a
spending plan that ``makes the important investments, that lives with a
realistic baseline for spending.''
</P>
<P>
	   This year's massive five-volume set of budget documents, which will go on
public sale and be transmitted to Congress on Monday, will feature a
white-on-black cover scheme to underscore that after 29 straight years of
deficits, the budget is now in the black.
</P>
<P>
	   While Clinton declared after the Republicans took control of Congress in
1994 that the ``era of big government is over,'' his final budget, perhaps with
a view to his legacy, pushes an activist agenda. It also provides a number of
issues that Democrats are likely to campaign on in the fall, especially if
Republican votes keep them from being enacted. Some, such as gun control and
health care, mirror programs Vice President Al Gore is pushing in his
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration already has released much of its budget in piecemeal
fashion over the past month, hoping to gain maximum exposure for the
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget includes tax breaks to help families afford college and pay the
cost of long-term care for sick relatives. The president also wants to help
alleviate the inequity in the current tax code that penalizes married couples,
but his remedy offers less relief than the Republican plan's would.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also is proposing to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit for the
working poor to include an additional 6.4 million low-income families.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget also proposes the biggest expansion in government health care
since the creation of Medicare by providing health insurance to at least five
million of the 44 million Americans not now covered.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also wants to expand Medicare to help the elderly pay
prescription drug bills and allow persons 55 to 65 to buy into the program.

<HEADLINE> LAPD Chief Says More Money Needed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The city's police chief says he needs at least $9 million
and hundreds of new employees to prevent a recurrence of a corruption scandal
that has rocked the department, the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   If steps are not taken to improve supervision and adherence to policies,
``it is not a question of 'if' but 'when' these deplorable circumstances would
recur,'' Chief Bernard C. Parks says in a budget request that the Police
Commission is to consider Tuesday, the Times reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The scandal erupted in September when a former officer implicated himself
and other officers in the Rampart Division in a host of alleged crimes, ranging
from improper shootings and false arrests to witness tampering, evidence
planting and perjury.
</P>
<P>
	   Parks has said at least 99 people were wrongly convicted of crimes because
Rampart officers planted evidence or perjured themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   Among his budget recommendations, Parks says he needs an additional 200
officers and civilians in the Internal Affairs Division over the next five
years, along with improvements in the screening process for new recruits.
</P>
<P>
	   He also wants to conduct secret ``integrity'' stings to ensure that officers
are honest.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani hits talk show circuit ahead of Mrs. Clinton's planned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A few hours before first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was
to officially declare her candidacy for the U.S. Senate, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
hit the political talk show circuit Sunday, saying he would probably run against
her.
<P>
	   Giuliani's comments - made during a series of national television interviews
- represent the closest he has come to saying he will run.
</P>
<P>
	   "May we assume that you wouldn't be running this Sunday morning gauntlet (of
talk shows) if you were not running?" asked Brit Hume on "Fox News Sunday."
</P>
<P>
	   "Ahhh, yes," the mayor said, momentarily hesitating.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked on ABC's "This Week" if he planned to run, Giuliani responded,
"Looks that way."
</P>
<P>
	   And on CNN, he said: "Well, there's always doubt. Otherwise, I might as well
make some kind of Hollywood-style announcement of some kind or other. But right
now, it's very much a direction we're moving in. We've raised over $12 million,
we have over 90,000 donors."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani however, said he is unlikely to follow Mrs. Clinton's lead and
declare his candidacy in a grand way because he is superstitious about making
such pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
	   "In 1989, when I ran for mayor, I announced, I lost," he said on Fox. "In
1993, when I didn't announce, I forgot ... In 1997, I decided not to announce
and I won with the largest margin a Republican has ever won in Democratic New
York City. So I said to myself, 'You got to find a better way to do this then,
the big kind of announcement thing."'
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani added, "I have a very demanding full time job and the shorter I can
make this campaign, the better it's going to be ... I do have less time to
campaign (than Clinton)."
</P>
<P>
	   In all, Guiliani's whirlwind schedule Sunday morning took him to five
national political talk shows in about three hours as he scrambled to and from
midtown Manhattan television studios.
</P>
<P>
	   On ABC, he acknowledged that he and Clinton hold strikingly similar
positions on a number of issues - for example, both support abortion rights, the
death penalty, gun control, gay rights and welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are a lot of issues on which we agree," he said. "There are a lot of
issues in which we disagree. I think there's a fundamental difference ... I
believe in solutions that don't necessarily involve building larger government."
</P>
<P>
	   He said his campaign would focus on his success in reducing crime and
welfare and cutting taxes and was unlikely to bring up the Whitewater scandal as
a political issue.
</P>
<P>
	   "I doubt it, unless some relevant facts come out," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani also acknowledged that the line between his campaign and mayoral
staffs had blurred at times, but said the White House has aided Clinton as well.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's always going to be questions about overlap," he said on Fox. "Even
if somebody would argue with us, we've paid (from our campaign funds) for a lot
more."
</P>
<P>
	   Although Clinton has promised to serve her full six-year term if she is
elected, Giuliani refused to do the same.
</P>
<P>
	   And when asked whether he has the proper temperament for the U.S. Senate,
Giuliani said on "Meet the Press" that he had successfully worked with the
overwhelmingly Democratic City Council to pass budgets and other legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   "I tend to be a leader," he said. "I have strong ideas, I push very, very
hard for those ideas...We could use a Senator from New York who is a strong
advocate."

<HEADLINE> Prosecution case to conclude with Diallo autopsy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - One of the 19 bullets pierced Amadou Diallo's aorta,
left lung and spine. Another tunneled through his liver and right lung. Others
broke his arm and leg.
<P>
	   A medical examiner is expected to present those findings and others in
gruesome detail at the close of the prosecution case against four police
officers accused of murdering the 22-year-old street vendor on his Bronx
doorstep. The official could testify by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Nineteen of the 41 bullets that the defendants fired at Diallo on Feb. 4,
1999, struck him. An autopsy found that one went into his right leg, traveled
upward and lodged behind his right knee - a route that could help prove
prosecutor Eric Warner's claim last week in opening statements that the officers
kept pulling their triggers after the West African immigrant "was falling down
or actually on the ground."
</P>
<P>
	   Kenneth Boss, 28; Sean Carroll, 36; Edward McMellon, 27; and Richard Murphy,
27, have pleaded innocent to the second-degree murder charges. If convicted,
they face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The killing of an unarmed black man by four white officers produced a flood
of pretrial publicity and protests alleging widespread abuse of minorities by
police. An appeals court responded by moving the case to Albany, where it is
being televised.
</P>
<P>
	   The plain clothes officers allegedly made a "conscious decision" to kill
Diallo. Without warning, they cornered him in the vestibule of his two-story
apartment house and opened fire, prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
	   But defense attorneys argue the shooting was a tragic - but justified -
mistake made while their clients searched Diallo's neighborhood for dangerous
suspects. They contend the victim caused a chain reaction by not heeding orders
to stop and suddenly pulling out a black wallet that, because of darkness,
appeared to be a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial, once expected to last a month or longer, is moving quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first two days, the jury - four black women, two white women and six
white men - heard from police and other witnesses who described the spot where
Diallo died as well lighted. One of Diallo's neighbors, Debbie Rivera, also
testified that she heard a volley of gunfire followed by a brief pause, then a
longer, final volley.
</P>
<P>
	   Another neighbor, a police recruit named Thomas Bell, reportedly will
testify this week that he also heard a pause. The testimony of Rivera and Bell
could be used to argue the officers had a clear chance to cease fire.
</P>
<P>
	   But in a defense case that should begin this week, attorneys hope to portray
the neighbors as unreliable. They plan to call a sergeant who interviewed Rivera
on the night of the shooting. His report says she heard one continuous burst.
</P>
<P>
	   Other defense witnesses include a paramedic who used a flashlight to view
Diallo's body in a vestibule because, attorneys say, the lighting was so poor.
Also, Murphy's attorney, James Culleton, told jurors they would hear from
someone who will "tell you that (Diallo) was acting suspicious, peeking in and
out of this vestibule" moments before the officers rolled up in an unmarked car.
</P>
<P>
	   The centerpiece of the defense case will be the officers themselves. All
four have said they want to take the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
	   "You will hear from Ken Boss," the officer's attorney, Steven Brounstein,
told jurors. "And what I will ask you to do is step inside his shoes and try to
view what he viewed and hear what he heard that night. When you do that, you
will find in your heart and your head that his conduct was justified."

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton wasn't the only New York politician
caught on camera Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Her unannounced GOP Senate rival, Rudolph Giuliani, found time to appear on

<HEADLINE> Political Bigs Battle in Missouri  </HEADLINE>
   By LIBBY QUAID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- On a chilly November evening, Missouri's leading
contenders for the U.S. Senate rose from their tables at a chamber of commerce
dinner and made their way toward one another. They shook hands and exchanged
pleasantries.
</P>
<P>
	   The mannerly encounter between Republican Sen. John Ashcroft and Democratic
Gov. Mel Carnahan contrasted mightily with the reality of a race that, for sheer
hostility, has at times rivaled the New York brawl between Hillary Rodham
Clinton and New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hillary and Rudy are tame by comparison,'' said Norm Ornstein, an analyst
at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington research center. ``The bottom
line here is that you just don't usually see this level of personal acrimony.''
</P>
<P>
	   The two camps have been relatively civil since the handshake -- they even
signed a ``Framework of Civility'' last week -- but few people expect a lasting
truce.
</P>
<P>
	   After all, animosity between the men goes back more than a decade when, as
governor, Ashcroft went to court to ensure Carnahan -- then the lieutenant
governor -- could not become acting governor when Ashcroft took trips outside
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
	   Their Senate campaign began when Carnahan declared his candidacy a full two
years before the 2000 election. It has featured allegations of racism that
included a 40-year-old photo of Carnahan in blackface, and a battle over capital
punishment.
</P>
<P>
	   The death penalty controversy began after Carnahan met with Pope John Paul
II in January 1999 and two days later commuted a murderer's death sentence
without notifying the victim's parents, as required by Missouri law.
</P>
<P>
	   Ashcroft responded by having the parents of the 19-year-old paraplegic man
testify before a Senate committee hearing, this one in St. Louis where the
pontiff had asked that the killer's life be spared.
</P>
<P>
	   For years, Missouri political analysts and observers have remarked on the
dislike between Ashcroft and Carnahan. Both continue to say their relationship
has been misrepresented.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Frankly, reporters tell me, and they report, that the governor has a very
serious dislike for me,'' Ashcroft said last year. ``And I don't understand that
because I don't have any reason to dislike the governor.''
</P>
<P>
	   Carnahan, whose father was a congressman and U.S. ambassador, says he and
Ashcroft ``have almost no personal relationship. I think the characterization of
it is much overstated.''
</P>
<P>
	   Both are well-liked by voters but come from opposite ends of the political
spectrum. Ashcroft allies call the governor a tax-and-spend liberal; Carnahan's
campaign labels the senator a right-wing extremist.
</P>
<P>
	   The son of a fundamentalist minister, Ashcroft, 57, is a social and fiscal
conservative. During his two-term governorship, he signed restrictive abortion
laws later upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   Carnahan, who will turn 66 on Friday, succeeded Ashcroft seven years ago and
has vetoed a concealed weapons bill and legislation to further restrict
abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   When Ashcroft ran for the Senate in 1994, Carnahan ridiculed what he called
Ashcroft's do-nothing policies as governor. And one day after the 1998 election,
Carnahan launched his challenge, calling himself a moderate progressive and
attacking Ashcroft's ``radical, far-right views.''
</P>
<P>
	   Then mulling a bid for the White House, Ashcroft took himself out of the
running to focus on the Senate race. And he softened his rhetoric on abortion
and President Clinton's character.
</P>
<P>
	   Things got ugly in a hurry. In the fall, Missouri Republicans circulated the
old photograph of Carnahan singing in blackface. Carnahan accused Ashcroft of
having his operatives pass it around. Ashcroft denied responsibility, then
claimed Carnahan was responsible for allegations of racism directed at him after
a black judge's nomination was defeated in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the pact signed last week, the two pledged to ``refrain from using
deception, half-truths, falsification or innuendo in describing your
opponents.''
</P>
<P>
	   The earlier negativity of the campaign turned off some voters, and may have
contributed to the cease fire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Neither of them has struck me as being particularly senatorial in their
campaigns,'' Eddie Adelstein, a 62-year-old pathologist, said in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
	   Both candidates are well-funded. Ashcroft has taken in $4.7 million and has
at least $3.4 million on hand, compared to Carnahan's $3.9 million raised and
$2.5 million in the bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Their bankrolls mean they can end their cease-fire and begin lobbing attacks
any time. Ornstein expects that will be soon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Once you start down this path, it's difficult to stop,'' he said. ``Even
if you as a candidate want to stop, the people around you don't. They get upset,
they get charged up.''

<HEADLINE> 'Scream 3' Carves Up Competition  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- "Scream 3," billed as the last hurrah of the hit horror
franchise, had a killer debut of $35.2 million to top the weekend box office,
according to industry estimates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Scream 3" swooped into a movie market crowded with holdovers, grossing more
than the rest of the top 10 combined. It was the biggest February opening ever
and the best for a horror film, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   It also was distributor Miramax's best opening.
</P>
<P>
	   The prison drama "The Hurricane" was second with $4.9 million, followed by
"Stuart Little" with $4.8 million and "Next Friday" with $4.3 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Last weekend's top film, the thriller "Eye of the Beholder," fell to No. 5
with $4.04 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Billed as the last in a trilogy, "Scream 3" reunites the survivors of the
first two movies -- Neve Campbell, David Arquette and Courtney Cox -- on a
Hollywood movie lot where they are terrorized by a new slasher.
</P>
<P>
	   In releasing "Scream 3" in February, Miramax took advantage of the
franchise's notoriety and the quiet movie season, said Paul Dergarabedian,
president of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks the box office.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you come into a slow marketplace with an event picture like this, you're
going to clean up. You're going to dominate the market," Dergarabedian said. "I
think people were questioning whether this was the right time to release a
horror film. Obviously, in hindsight, it was the perfect time."
</P>
<P>
	   "Next Friday" and the romantic campus comedy "Down to You" had been the only
teen and 20-something movies in a crowd of cartoon features and films generally
aimed at older adults.
</P>
<P>
	   Opening in more theaters than its two predecessors, "Scream 3" averaged an
impressive $10,153 on 3,467 screens. "The Hurricane" averaged $2,281 in 2,148
cinemas.
</P>
<P>
	   "Scream" opened in 1,413 theaters and took in $6.4 million the weekend
before Christmas in 1997, while "Scream 2" debuted a year later on 3,112 screens
and grossed $32.9 million its first weekend. The movies went on to gross just
over $100 million each.
</P>
<P>
	   "Scream 3" helped jump-start a market where the top 12 films grossed a
meager $43.9 million last weekend. The total for Friday through Sunday was $72.4
million, compared with $62 million for the same weekend a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Two new movies opened in a few hundred theaters. "Gun Shy," starring Liam
Neeson and Sandra Bullock in a dark comedy about a shaky drug agent, earned
$700,000 from 296 theaters. The horse-racing caper "Simpatico," starring Nick
Nolte, Jeff Bridges and Sharon Stone, grossed $500,000 in 283 theaters.
</P>
<P>
	   "Simpatico" had a limited run late last year for Oscar consideration.
</P>
<P>
	   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North American theaters,
according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures were to be released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   1. "Scream 3," $35.2 million.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Campaigns in Delaware  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMYRNA, Del. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes portrayed
himself Sunday as a Washington outsider not beholden to special interests as he
campaigned in advance of the state's GOP primary next week.
</P>
<P>
	   At a town meeting at Smyrna fire hall, the millionaire magazine publisher
outlined for an audience of about 200 people his platform in favor of school
choice, a flat federal tax, a stronger military and his opposition to abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Washington politicians, the special interests, they don't have their
hooks into me,'' Forbes said to applause. ``If we got rid of the tax code, half
of the lobbyists would have to find a new line of work. I'm a compassionate guy,
and I would consider some retraining.''
</P>
<P>
	   He planned another town meeting Sunday evening in Newark.
</P>
<P>
	   Delaware Republicans gave Forbes his first primary victory in 1996, when he
was the sole contender to stump in the state. After placing a distant third in
New Hampshire with 13 percent of the vote last week, Forbes is looking to repeat
that win on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   But he must contend with Republican presidential front-runner George W.
Bush, who also has campaigned here. Sen. John McCain of Arizona has ignored
Delaware to focus on the GOP contest Feb. 19 in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Campbell, a consultant for a technology company from Clayton and a
registered Democrat, said afterward that he would vote for Forbes if he could.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we need a businessman versus a lawyer to run this country as a
business,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nancy Koska of Smyrna, who brought her 11-year-old daughter Tracy, said she
had been debating between Forbes and McCain but that after hearing Forbes speak
she said she liked what he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He gave me some points to go back and look at McCain,'' Koska said. ``I
think Bush is too tied up with lobbyists.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley to fight back in hope of rebounding  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Bruised by losses in Iowa and New Hampshire, Bill
Bradley's presidential campaign is fighting back against the aggressive campaign
being waged by rival Al Gore. Though the strategy is not entirely risk-free,
aides have concluded that Gore's tactics have left Bradley with little choice
but to respond.
<P>
	   "Part of our strategy will be drawing a contrast with the vice president,
which we will do increasingly," said Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking at a predominantly black church in Queens on Sunday to campaign
with activist Al Sharpton, Bradley said "I think I have to communicate better
with the Democratic base."
</P>
<P>
	   He wasted little time resuming his criticisms of Gore, which he had stepped
up in the closing days of the contest in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing earlier Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press," the former New Jersey
senator renewed his attack on Gore's fund-raising practices in the last
campaign, criticizing the vice president's 1996 appearance at a Buddhist temple
near Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think he has to explain more thoroughly what was happening at the
Buddhist temple, said Bradley. "If he didn't know it was a fund-raiser then he
was spectacularly naive."
</P>
<P>
	   He again warned that Republicans will hammer Gore with the issue in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no doubt in my mind that is going to happen," Bradley said. "This
is a real risk in the fall. The Democratic Party is taking a risk."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley also has challenged Gore on health care and his record on abortion
and says voters want a "fresh start," a thinly veiled reference to President
Clinton's troubles.
</P>
<P>
	   "America is about competition, political campaigns are about competition,"
said Bradley, defending his assault. "If your positions are misrepresented, you
can only take it so long. That's the way I'll continue for the next four or five
weeks."
</P>
<P>
	   By then, the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination could well be
decided, with a high-stakes showdown in California, New York and other states on
March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   "California is the neutral ground," said Gore campaign spokesman Chris
Lehane.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have to take off on March 7," acknowledged Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   One place to begin is within his own party. Much of the Democratic
establishment is behind Gore and one of Bradley's most urgent tasks is winning
back key constituencies like blacks and women who surveys show overwhelmingly
support the vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   Both rivals took a breather over the weekend before launching an intense
burst of campaigning leading up to the big round of March 7 primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley opened his week in New York and was heading to Florida. Gore, too,
was beginning in New York, and both were setting aside ample time for
California.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have to win California," Bradley said. "I know I have some ground to make
up."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore also has focused heavily on California, and has the backing of key
state leaders like Gov. Gray Davis and organized labor. Polls give Gore the edge
there - a Field poll in mid-January had him ahead 44 percent to 17 percent - but
they can be unreliable as voters begin to tune in to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Countering Bradley, Gore's aides said they will continue the kind of
grassroots, retail campaign that led to success in the opening contests in Iowa
and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   "Al Gore is a national candidate," said Lehane, Gore's spokesman. "We'll be
campaigning in virtually every state where they have a primary. There's only one
candidate in this race who is undefeated and that's Al Gore."
</P>
<P>
	   For Bradley, the debate has been one of tactics. A core campaign theme has
been his argument that he's a nontraditional candidate who operates above the
charges and countercharges that have become staples of political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   But in the face of early setbacks, Bradley's approach has shifted. Backers
like Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska have urged Bradley - who picks up Secret
Service protection Monday - to be more aggressive and respond to Gore - and
that's becoming apparent.

<HEADLINE> Navy Maps Wreckage of Alaskan Crash  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTINE HANLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- Navy crews on Sunday mapped more of the ocean
floor near the crash site of Alaska Airlines Flight 261, leaving the plane's
wreckage alone but collecting some human remains.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Transportation Safety Board wants a detailed picture of the
aircraft debris before pieces of the plane are brought to the surface.
</P>
<P>
	   Exactly what will be brought up will depend on further interpretation of
flight data and cockpit voice recorders, which were still being analyzed in
Washington, an NTSB spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The ships have been out all night long,'' said Terry Williams. ``There's
more mapping that's going on. Naturally, in the process, if they find any bodies
or other remains they're bringing them up.''
</P>
<P>
	   The debris area is about 10 miles offshore in the Santa Barbara Channel,
covering an area about the size of a football field in water 640 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, more memorials were held for families and friends of the 88
people lost with the plane. Among them was a service by Cardinal Roger Mahony,
archbishop of Los Angeles, who led a service near Los Angeles International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   The Alaska Airlines MD-83 crashed a week ago, killing all 88 people on
board, during a flight from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, bound for San Francisco and
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane's voice recorder shows that for at least 30 minutes prior to the
crash the pilots were struggling to correct a problem with the tail-mounted
horizontal stabilizer, which they said had jammed.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses who saw the plane go down said it rolled upside down and spiraled
into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ventura County Medical Examiner's Office, which is responsible for
identifying the victims, has said that it has several nearly complete bodies.
Sheriff's spokesman Eric Nishimoto said it could be a week before any are
identified.

<HEADLINE> Some NJ SAVER checks not covering cost of 1999 tax increase  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Tax rebate checks mailed to New Jerseyans in
September were supposed to offset school tax increases for homeowners. But
published reports say the savings aren't adding up for a lot of the Garden
State's 566 municipalities, with the 1999 tax rates exceeding the amounts of the
checks.
<P>
	   Statewide, the rebates averaged $120. The average tax increase last year was
$135, according to the Star-Ledger of Newark, which cited data from the Office
of Legislative Services and the state Treasury Department in Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a tax cut but it was certainly a modest one. It's really kind of
laughable," Summit resident Bob Wolfenbarger told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfenbarger said he received a $76 rebate, which wasn't enough to cover the
$200 increase in 1999 property taxes on his home. But Wolfenbarger fared
slightly better than other homeowners in Summit, which got an average tax
increase of $399. Summit residents received the same amount in the rebate
program.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the program, which Governor Christie Whitman signed last April, the
rebate is calculated using the local 1997 school tax rate on the first $45,000
of a home's value. In that way, the amount each homeowner receives in a town is
the same.
</P>
<P>
	   "As my mother used to say, it's better than a sharp stick in the eye,"
Roosevelt resident Gayle Donnelly told the Gannett New Jersey bureau for
Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
	   Donnelly and her husband, David, said they recently sold their house in
Roosevelt because of the high taxes. Gayle Donnelly said the tax rebate the
couple received was $248, but also said the couple's school tax bill last year
amounted to more than $700.
</P>
<P>
	   The Star-Ledger reported 239 of the state's municipalities are paying more
than the statewide average increase of $135, the highest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman put the program to work amid hoopla, but also had asserted the
program wasn't meant to reduce property tax rates. Whitman instead urged local
governments and school districts to embrace structural change and reduce costs
through shared services, mergers and regionalization.
</P>
<P>
	   But critics maintain the state can do more. And the idea of merging doesn't
appeal to many.
</P>
<P>
	   Gannett New Jersey reported only 15 of the state's 566 municipalities have
applied for the $10 million Regional Efficiency Development Incentive program,
which was included in a $35 million package of bills Whitman signed at about the
time the tax rebate program was offered. The package was intended to encourage
local governments to share services.
</P>
<P>
	   In Roosevelt, for example, Mayor Michael Hamilton said residents have mixed
feelings about merging with other municipalities.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm willing to pay for it, even if I have to starve to death. It's a choice
and that's the way I feel," Roosevelt resident Sol Libsohn, 86, told Gannett.
</P>
<P>
	   Libsohn said although he would consider a merger under certain
circumstances, he like the borough the way it is.
</P>
<P>
	   Meantime, Whitman's proposed 2001 budget calls for boosting the statewide
average of the rebates to $240. But that wouldn't have kept up with the increase
in property taxes from 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unless there is some dramatic change ... you're not going to be reducing
property taxes. You're just going to be reducing the rate of increase," said
Henry Coleman, director of Rutgers University's Center for Government Services.
</P>
<P>
	   Coleman said the state's total property tax bill has been increasing by $400
million to $500 million annually. The Star-Ledger reported the average 1999 tax
bill increased by 3.28 percent over the year previous, or from $4,109 to $4,244.
</P>
<P>
	   The New Jersey Policy Perspective, a think tank, recently issued a report
calling on the state to absorb 50 percent of local educational costs, increase
the state income tax, levy taxes on stocks and bonds, and expand NJ SAVER to
ease the tax bill for all property taxes, not just the school tax.
</P>
<P>
	   "The public's not getting the message that they are getting what the
governor argues is property tax relief. I think the issue remains a very, very
ripe one for the election in 2001," said Sen. Bernard Kenny, (D-Hudson). "The
property taxpayer is in no better shape than this."

<HEADLINE> Giuliani hits talk show circuit ahead of Mrs. Clinton's  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A few hours before first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
officially declared her candidacy for the U.S. Senate, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
hit the political talk show circuit Sunday, saying he would probably run against
her.
<P>
	   Giuliani's comments - made during a series of national television interviews
- represent the closest he has come to saying he will run.
</P>
<P>
	   "May we assume that you wouldn't be running this Sunday morning gauntlet (of
talk shows) if you were not running?" asked Brit Hume on "Fox News Sunday."
</P>
<P>
	   "Ahhh, yes," the mayor said, momentarily hesitating.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked on ABC's "This Week" if he planned to run, Giuliani responded,
"Looks that way."
</P>
<P>
	   And on CNN's "Late Edition", he said: "Well, there's always doubt.
Otherwise, I might as well make some kind of Hollywood-style announcement of
some kind or other. But right now, it's very much a direction we're moving in.
We've raised over $12 million, we have over 90,000 donors."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani however, said he is unlikely to follow Mrs. Clinton's lead and
declare his candidacy in a grand way because he is superstitious about making
such pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
	   "In 1989, when I ran for mayor, I announced, I lost," he said on Fox. "In
1993, when I didn't announce, I forgot ... In 1997, I decided not to announce
and I won with the largest margin a Republican has ever won in Democratic New
York City. So I said to myself, 'You got to find a better way to do this then,
the big kind of announcement thing."'
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani added, "I have a very demanding full time job and the shorter I can
make this campaign, the better it's going to be ... I do have less time to
campaign (than Clinton)."
</P>
<P>
	   In all, Guiliani's whirlwind schedule Sunday morning took him to five
national political talk shows in about three hours as he scrambled to and from
midtown Manhattan television studios.
</P>
<P>
	   On ABC, he acknowledged that he and Clinton hold strikingly similar
positions on a number of issues - for example, both support abortion rights, the
death penalty, gun control, gay rights and welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are a lot of issues on which we agree," he said. "There are a lot of
issues in which we disagree. I think there's a fundamental difference ... I
believe in solutions that don't necessarily involve building larger government."
</P>
<P>
	   He said his campaign would focus on his success in reducing crime and
welfare and cutting taxes and was unlikely to bring up the Whitewater scandal as
a political issue.
</P>
<P>
	   "I doubt it, unless some relevant facts come out," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani also acknowledged that the line between his campaign and mayoral
staffs had blurred at times, but said the White House has aided Clinton as well.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's always going to be questions about overlap," he said on Fox. "Even
if somebody would argue with us, we've paid (from our campaign funds) for a lot
more."
</P>
<P>
	   Although Clinton has promised to serve her full six-year term if she is
elected, Giuliani refused to do the same.
</P>
<P>
	   And when asked whether he has the proper temperament for the U.S. Senate,
Giuliani said on "Meet the Press" that he had successfully worked with the
overwhelmingly Democratic City Council to pass budgets and other legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   "I tend to be a leader," he said. "I have strong ideas, I push very, very
hard for those ideas...We could use a Senator from New York who is a strong
advocate."

<P>
	   Bradley also has challenged Gore on health care and his record on abortion
and says voters want a ``fresh start,'' a thinly veiled reference to President
Clinton's troubles.
</P>
<P>
	   ``America is about competition, political campaigns are about competition,''
said Bradley, defending his assault. ``If your positions are misrepresented, you
can only take it so long. That's the way I'll continue for the next four or five
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
	   By then, the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination could well be
decided, with a high-stakes showdown in California, New York and other states on
March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   ``California is the neutral ground,'' said Gore campaign spokesman Chris
Lehane.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have to take off on March 7,'' acknowledged Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   One place to begin is within his own party. Much of the Democratic
establishment is behind Gore and one of Bradley's most urgent tasks is winning
back key constituencies like blacks and women who surveys show overwhelmingly
support the vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think I have to communicate better with the Democratic base,'' said
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking to shore up that base, Bradley campaigned Sunday at Allen AME
Church, the state's largest black church, with activist Al Sharpton, who
proposed that the Democratic rivals debate in New York before a mostly black
audience.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley agreed, and aides said they would present the idea to Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am not taking the African-American vote for granted,'' said Bradley. ``I
have a lot of friends in New Work. We are building organizations in all the
March 7 states.''
</P>
<P>
	   Aides said Bradley would spend much of his campaign week on the issue of
race relations, heading to Florida to talk about affirmative action and South
Carolina to wade into the fight over the flying of the Confederate battle flag.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted that racial harmony was the topic of the first major speech he gave
as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's who I am, it's what I live,'' said Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Both rivals took a breather over the weekend before launching an intense
burst of campaigning leading up to the big round of March 7 primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley opened his week in New York and was heading to Florida. Gore, too,
was beginning in New York, and both were setting aside ample time for
California.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have to win California,'' Bradley said. ``I know I have some ground to
make up.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore also has focused heavily on California, and has the backing of key
state leaders like Gov. Gray Davis and organized labor. Polls give Gore the edge
there -- a Field poll in mid-January had him ahead 44 percent to 17 percent --
but they can be unreliable as voters begin to tune in to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Countering Bradley, Gore's aides said they will continue the kind of
grassroots, retail campaign that led to success in the opening contests in Iowa
and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Al Gore is a national candidate,'' said Lehane, Gore's spokesman. ``We'll
be campaigning in virtually every state where they have a primary. There's only
one candidate in this race who is undefeated and that's Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
	   For Bradley, the debate has been one of tactics. A core campaign theme has
been his argument that he's a nontraditional candidate who operates above the
charges and countercharges that have become staples of political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   But in the face of early setbacks, Bradley's approach has shifted. Backers
like Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska have urged Bradley -- who picks up Secret
Service protection Monday -- to be more aggressive and respond to Gore -- and
that's becoming apparent.

<HEADLINE> Bradley to fight back in hope of rebounding  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Bruised by losses in Iowa and New Hampshire, Bill
Bradley's presidential campaign is fighting back against the aggressive campaign
being waged by rival Al Gore. Though the strategy is not entirely risk-free,
aides have concluded that Gore's tactics have left Bradley with little choice
but to respond.
<P>
	   "Part of our strategy will be drawing a contrast with the vice president,
which we will do increasingly," said Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, Bradley wasted little time Sunday resuming his criticisms of Gore,
which he had stepped up in the closing days of the contest in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing on NBC's "Meet the Press," the former New Jersey senator renewed
his attack on Gore's fund-raising practices in the last campaign, criticizing
the vice president's 1996 appearance at a Buddhist temple near Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think he has to explain more thoroughly what was happening at the
Buddhist temple, said Bradley. "If he didn't know it was a fund-raiser then he
was spectacularly naive."
</P>
<P>
	   He again warned that Republicans will hammer Gore with the issue in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no doubt in my mind that is going to happen," Bradley said. "This
is a real risk in the fall. The Democratic Party is taking a risk."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley also has challenged Gore on health care and his record on abortion
and says voters want a "fresh start," a thinly veiled reference to President
Clinton's troubles.
</P>
<P>
	   "America is about competition, political campaigns are about competition,"
said Bradley, defending his assault. "If your positions are misrepresented, you
can only take it so long. That's the way I'll continue for the next four or five
weeks."

<HEADLINE> Dot-Com Boom Forces Raises for Some  </HEADLINE>
    By ERICA NOONAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- When the technology law firm of Testa, Hurwitz &AMP; Thibeault
announced a 40 percent raise for their attorneys last week, dozens of associates
flooded management with grateful e-mail.
</P>
<P>
	   Messages ranged from the restrained, "This is exceedingly generous. Thank
you very much," to the ebullient, "Just wanted to let you know this has created
a lot of goodwill in the hallways. ... If anyone still complains, I will
personally pop them!"
</P>
<P>
	   The pay hikes for already well-compensated lawyers have nothing to do with
the cost of living, said partner Timothy McGuire -- they were incentives to
retain attorneys vulnerable to offers from high-tech companies promising big
paychecks and lucrative stock options.
</P>
<P>
	   The high-tech expansion has lured employees away from nearly every field,
said Jim Boone, president of The Americas of Korn/Ferry International, the
world's largest executive search firm.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's tremendous pressure on companies today to keep people," said Boone.
"Everyone's scrambling for good people."
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers and high-tech workers aren't the only employees enjoying the booming
economy. Last month, the nation's unemployment rate hit a 30-year low of 4
percent. Approximately 387,000 new jobs were created in January, the largest
leap since September 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The boom means hospitals in Illinois need qualified nurses so badly that
they're willing to offer higher salaries, paid tuition, flex time and referral
bonuses.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Border Patrol in Texas was recently handing out $2,000 signing
bonuses to new recruits who make it through the academy. Even McDonald's offered
$3,500 signing bonuses to new assistant managers.
</P>
<P>
	   In the legal field, the competition to retain and attract talent is forcing
the kind of pay hikes that make partners wince.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's largest law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom, last
week gave associates 40 percent raises; New York-based Davis Polk and Wardwell
hiked salaries by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   At Testa, first-year associates will make $140,000 -- up from $100,000 --
while sixth-year associates will see their annual salaries rise to $205,000.
</P>
<P>
	   McGuire said his firm, which counts Lycos, Inc., among its clients, didn't
want to risk losing its associates to up-and-coming Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sure people want to poach our attorneys," he said. "What do the dot-coms
have that we don't? Stock options."
</P>
<P>
	   The firm is working on that end of things too, by investing in companies and
passing along stock profits to associates who stay loyal to the firm, McGuire
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Stock options are being offered to a variety of professionals to sweeten the
employment deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Though many dot-com companies don't have mega-million initial public
offerings, executive-level workers in marketing, sales, computer programming,
law, human resources and accounting can become millionaires if a stock booms.
</P>
<P>
	   Even mid-level workers making annual salaries of $30,000 to $50,000 are
finding themselves beneficiaries of stock options and profit sharing incentives.
</P>
<P>
	   "The saying in the industry is, 'Now I know what it's like to be in
Sacramento in 1848 for the Gold Rush,"' Boone said. "The excitement runs across
many sections of business stratum. It's not just the CEOs and the CFOs."
</P>
<P>
	   Some employers look beyond the paycheck. Retailing giant Wal-Mart says it
retains employees with opportunities for advancement, bonuses based on store
performance and a supportive, caring culture.
</P>
<P>
	   "Work life issues are what drive us, and they're what our associates tell us
they have a need for," said Cole Peterson, vice president of the company's
People division.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the company's management team, 65 percent were promoted from within.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you are successful in keeping people you have, you need less people,"
Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
	   But there seems to be no end in sight for compensation packages in other
industries.
</P>
<P>
	   "For now, it looks like the answer to the whole thing is more, more, more,"
said Ed Archer, vice president of Pearl, Meyer and Partners, a New York-based
executive search firm. "The risk associated with dot-coms are that they are the
biggest winners and the biggest losers."
</P>
<P>
	   Although some technology speculators are bound to be disappointed, job
hoppers won't be bound to a failed company, Archer said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll see it (the market) continue to run, run, run," he said. "If you're
at a losing company, people will hop around to find a winning one."

<HEADLINE> Some NJ SAVER checks not covering cost of 1999 tax increase  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Tax rebate checks mailed to New Jerseyans in
September were supposed to offset school tax increases for homeowners. But
published reports say the savings aren't adding up for a lot of the Garden
State's 566 municipalities, with the 1999 tax rates exceeding the amounts of the
checks.
<P>
	   Statewide, the rebates averaged $120. The average tax increase last year was
$135, according to the Star-Ledger of Newark, which cited data from the Office
of Legislative Services and the state Treasury Department in Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a tax cut but it was certainly a modest one. It's really kind of
laughable," Summit resident Bob Wolfenbarger told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfenbarger said he received a $76 rebate, which wasn't enough to cover the
$200 increase in 1999 property taxes on his home. But Wolfenbarger fared
slightly better than other homeowners in Summit, which got an average tax
increase of $399. Summit residents received the same amount in the rebate
program.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the program, which Governor Christie Whitman signed last April, the
rebate is calculated using the local 1997 school tax rate on the first $45,000
of a home's value. In that way, the amount each homeowner receives in a town is
the same.
</P>
<P>
	   "As my mother used to say, it's better than a sharp stick in the eye,"
Roosevelt resident Gayle Donnelly told the Asbury Park Press for Sunday's
editions.
</P>
<P>
	   Donnelly and her husband, David, said they recently sold their house in
Roosevelt because of the high taxes. Gayle Donnelly said the tax rebate the
couple received was $248, but also said the couple's school tax bill last year
amounted to more than $700.
</P>
<P>
	   The Star-Ledger reported 239 of the state's municipalities are paying more
than the statewide average increase of $135, the highest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman put the program to work amid hoopla, but also had asserted the
program wasn't meant to reduce property tax rates. Whitman instead urged local
governments and school districts to embrace structural change and reduce costs
through shared services, mergers and regionalization.
</P>
<P>
	   But critics maintain the state can do more. And the idea of merging doesn't
appeal to many.
</P>
<P>
	   The Asbury Park Press reported only 15 of the state's 566 municipalities
have applied for the $10 million Regional Efficiency Development Incentive
program, which was included in a $35 million package of bills Whitman signed at
about the time the tax rebate program was offered. The package was intended to
encourage local governments to share services.
</P>
<P>
	   In Roosevelt, for example, Mayor Michael Hamilton said residents have mixed
feelings about merging with other municipalities.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm willing to pay for it, even if I have to starve to death. It's a choice
and that's the way I feel," Roosevelt resident Sol Libsohn, 86, told the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   Libsohn said although he would consider a merger under certain
circumstances, he like the borough the way it is.
</P>
<P>
	   Meantime, Whitman's proposed 2001 budget calls for boosting the statewide
average of the rebates to $240. But that wouldn't have kept up with the increase
in property taxes from 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unless there is some dramatic change ... you're not going to be reducing
property taxes. You're just going to be reducing the rate of increase," said
Henry Coleman, director of Rutgers University's Center for Government Services.
</P>
<P>
	   Coleman said the state's total property tax bill has been increasing by $400
million to $500 million annually. The Star-Ledger reported the average 1999 tax
bill increased by 3.28 percent over the year previous, or from $4,109 to $4,244.
</P>
<P>
	   The New Jersey Policy Perspective, a think tank, recently issued a report
calling on the state to absorb 50 percent of local educational costs, increase
the state income tax, levy taxes on stocks and bonds, and expand NJ SAVER to
ease the tax bill for all property taxes, not just the school tax.
</P>
<P>
	   "The public's not getting the message that they are getting what the
governor argues is property tax relief. I think the issue remains a very, very
ripe one for the election in 2001," said Sen. Bernard Kenny, (D-Hudson). "The
property taxpayer is in no better shape than this."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Senate Candidacy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton on Sunday formally launched her
campaign for the U.S. Senate in a state she has called home for only a month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am honored today to announce my candidacy for the U.S. Senate from New
York,'' she said as the crowd of 2,000 people in a gymnasium at a state
university campus in Purchase chanted ``Hillary! Hillary!''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I may be new to the neighborhood, but I'm not new to your concerns,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Recalling a speech she made at her college commencement at Wellesley in
1969, she said: ``I often return to one thing I said back then, that politics is
the art of making possible what appears to be impossible. I still believe that
today. We can do what seems impossible if we have the vision the passion and the
will to do it together.''
</P>
<P>
	   Her remarks were preceded by tributes from U.S. Sens. Charles Schumer and
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and U.S. Reps. Nita Lowey of Westchester and Charles
Rangel of Harlem. They joined her on stage as she delivered her speech. On her
other side were President Clinton, her mother Dorothy and daughter Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton went on to describe her commitment to better schools, better health
care and gun control.
</P>
<P>
	   But she also took pains to describe herself as a ``new Democrat''.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't believe that government is the source of all our problems or the
solutions to them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The race for the Senate seat being vacated by Moynihan is expected to pit
Clinton against Rudolph Giuliani, the Republican mayor of New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   No other first lady has ever run for public office. In doing so, Clinton
steps out of the long and scandal-scarred shadow of her husband. President
Clinton is said to be one of her top advisers as she resumes the career she put
aside to help him capture the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani has not made a formal campaign announcement, but he came on ABC's
``This Week,'' one of five TV talk shows he appeared on Sunday. When asked if he
planned to run, he said, ``Looks that way.''

<TEXT>
    	   PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) - Surrounded by her family and political supporters,
Hillary Rodham Clinton on Sunday formally launched her campaign for the U.S.
Senate in a state she has called home for only a month.
<P>
	   "I am honored today to announce my candidacy for the U.S. Senate from New

other side were President Clinton, her mother Dorothy and daughter Chelsea, with
a red, white and blue "Hillary" banner behind them.
</P>
<P>
	   The president helped her write her speech, but did not himself speak during
the event - a switch of their roles in which he played the supportive spouse
while she took center stage.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton went on to describe her commitments on a wide variety of issues,
from better schools, better health care, environmentalism and gun control, to
reviving the economy of upstate New York, to working for passage of a
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty and in support of peace from Northern
Ireland to Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   But she also took pains to describe herself as "a new Democrat. I don't
believe that government is the source of all our problems or the solutions to
them."
</P>
<P>
	   The race for the Senate seat being vacated by Moynihan is expected to pit
Clinton against Rudolph Giuliani, the Republican mayor of New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   No other first lady has ever run for public office and in doing so, Clinton
steps out of the long and scandal-scarred shadow of her husband. Bill Clinton is
said to be one of her major advisers as she resumes the career she put aside to
help him capture the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   There is little real doubt that Clinton will face Giuliani, but the mayor
has not made his own formal campaign announcement. About the closest he's come
was on ABC's "This Week," one of five TV talk shows he appeared on Sunday. When
asked if he planned to run, he said, "Looks that way."
</P>
<P>
	   Recent polls have shown Giuliani with a slight lead over Clinton and running
even with her among women voters. That's a far cry from a year ago when talk was
fresh about a possible Clinton campaign that many doubted would ever come to
pass. Sympathy was strong from the Monica Lewinsky scandal and polls showed her
well ahead of the mayor if she did run.
</P>
<P>
	   Five months later, she formed a Senate committee and began raising money for
the race. At Moynihan's sprawling farm on a bright July day she kicked off a
summer-long "listening tour" of the state that bled over into the fall and took
her from Broadway to Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
	   By December, she was assuring supporters she intended to run. In early
January, she moved into a $1.7 million house in suburban Westchester County just
north of New York City to establish residency in the state she had decided to
adopt. President Clinton said he would move there when he left the White House
at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Other than a closeness to her new home, political experts said there was
good reason for Clinton to stage her announcement in Westchester.
</P>
<P>
	   "When duck hunting, one goes where the ducks are," Republican consultant Jay
Severin explained. "The independent suburban ducks are the ducks in this
campaign that are yet to be bagged."
</P>
<P>
	   In statewide races, suburban voters from Westchester County and Long Island
are considered a key to success and a Marist College poll released Friday showed
Giuliani leading in the suburbs, 56 percent to 34 percent, his strongest showing
in any region of the state.
</P>
<P>
	   While Giuliani dismissed the Clinton announcement as "a Hollywood type of
thing," a top Democratic strategist not connected to the Clinton campaign said
it served a real purpose, especially for a famous out-of-towner still viewed
skeptically by many New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It makes people understand this is for real and not a joke. It's not a game
anymore," Hank Sheinkopf said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton campaign arranged for about 500 house parties to be held
simultaneously around the state for more than 20,000 supporters who would watch
the announcement on television and then listen in on a conference telephone call
from the candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Clinton was to fly to Buffalo to begin a tour across the state
that would take her to Rochester on Tuesday, Syracuse on Wednesday and Albany on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   As of the end of last year, she had raised $8 million and Giuliani, who
started fund raising three months earlier, had raised almost $12 million. It is
expected to be the most expensive Senate race in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
	   In seeking to replace Moynihan in the Senate, Clinton hopes to make another
kind of history. No woman has ever been independently elected to statewide
office in New York. Former vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro
unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Senate nomination in 1992 and 1998.

<HEADLINE> Croatians Choose in Runoff Election  </HEADLINE>
   By SNJEZANA VUKIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- Croats choose a successor Monday to the only
president they have known, selecting from two candidates who promise to end the
autocratic style of the late independence leader Franjo Tudjman and integrate
this Balkan country into Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   The runoff between Stipe Mesic and Drazen Budisa -- the top finishers among
nine candidates in Jan. 24 balloting -- is almost symbolic: Their personalities
are different, but their political distinctions are subtle.
</P>
<P>
	   Western governments like both of them. And regardless of who wins, the new
center-left majority in parliament plans to reduce presidential powers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's no more Tudjman, and that's what matters,'' said Nadja Marinovic, a
46-year-old dancer.
</P>
<P>
	   It took Croats only a month to completely change the political landscape of
their country after the Dec. 10 death of Tudjman, who ruled with an iron hand
since Croatia seceded from Yugoslavia in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   In parliamentary elections Jan. 3, Tudjman's conservative Croatian
Democratic Union was swept away after nine years of majority rule in favor of a
Western-oriented coalition of Social Democrats and Social Liberals.
</P>
<P>
	   The change has been welcomed in the West as an opportunity for Croatia to
emerge from the political and economic isolation brought about by Tudjman's
defiance of Western demands for greater democracy and respect of human rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Suddenly, doors to the NATO's Partnership for Peace, the World Trade
Organization and even the European Union have been unlocked. And Croatia is
peering in.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Western leaders who stayed away from Tudjman's Dec. 13 funeral are
expected to attend the inauguration of the new president.
</P>
<P>
	   The parliamentary elections and the first round of the presidential contest
have showed that ``any government can be replaced, that nothing is eternal
anymore in Croatia,'' said columnist Slobodan Snajder of the independent
newspaper Novi list.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nothing can stop the final democratization of this country,'' Snajder
said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first round, Mesic, a laid-back, witty politician, finished 13
percent ahead of Budisa, a serious-minded co-leader of the ruling center-left
coalition. Surveys show Mesic still ahead going into the finale.
</P>
<P>
	   For many Croats, it almost doesn't matter who wins.
</P>
<P>
	   Mesic and Budisa both support constitutional changes to curtail presidential
powers that critics say Tudjman abused. Both pledge to work closely with the
parliamentary government to carry out economic reforms. Both say integration
into Western institutions is their major foreign policy goal. Both describe
neighboring countries as friends.
</P>
<P>
	   The public is focusing on personality.
</P>
<P>
	   Mesic, Tudjman's close aide until 1994, is informal, relaxed, charming, his
supporters say. ``A hero of anti-Tudjmanism,'' said Jelena Lovric, a political
analyst for Novi list. For many Croats, Budisa, a former student leader jailed
under communism, has been a symbol of morality and patriotism for nearly three
decades.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Air Jet Returns to Airport  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. (AP) -- An Alaska Airlines MD-83 jetliner returned to Reno's
airport shortly after takeoff when the pilot reported problems with the
horizontal stabilizer -- the third such incident involving that jet model within
a week.
</P>
<P>
	   The Seattle-bound jet's problems Saturday night were similar to those
discussed by pilots in the tense minutes before Alaska Airlines Flight 261
crashed into the Pacific on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of that accident, in which 88 people died, has not been
determined.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, an American Airlines MD-83 had trouble with its horizontal
stabilizer after takeoff from Phoenix. It returned safely to the airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines does not plan to ground its 35 MD-83 jetliners or to make
any unscheduled maintenance checks, said Jack Evans, a spokesman for the
Seattle-based airline.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We obviously understand there's some stress out there,'' he said in a
telephone interview Sunday. ``Despite the accident, we're launching about 400
flights a day and trying to conduct the normal side of our business.''
</P>
<P>
	   The horizontal stabilizer is a wing-like part on the tail manipulated by the
pilot to provide balance along the entire fuselage. An MD-83 stabilizer is about
40 feet wide, according to Boeing.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines believes the Reno problem occurred because pilots are being
overly cautious and running the stabilizer through several complete up-and-down
cycles before takeoff, ``overheating the motors,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Seattle-bound jet, Flight 631, left Reno/Tahoe International Airport at
about 7 p.m. Saturday. It headed back after seven or eight minutes when the
pilot reported that the motors that control the stabilizer were operating
improperly, Evans said.
</P>
<P>
	   The pilot told passengers he had a major mechanical problem, said passenger
Dennis Smythe of Anchorage, Alaska. Smythe, who has a commercial pilots'
license, said the plane was moving up and down.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The pilot seemed like he was trying to get in control of our porpoising,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   As the plane crossed Interstate 80 on its descent, Smythe said he felt the
right wing pitch and wondered if the pilot was in control of the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was a lot of crying and a lot of praying because a lot of people
were probably thinking about that (earlier) crash,'' he said. Passengers cheered
as the pilot made a rough landing.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal Aviation Administration officials did not immediately return calls
seeking comment on the flight.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's King Speeds Up Reforms  </HEADLINE>
   By JAMAL HALABY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- King Abdullah II had a little advice for ministers and
business leaders disagreeing over how to bring about educational reforms in his
country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Roll up your sleeves and get down to work,'' the 38-year-old king roared
as he presided over a meeting on upgrading the school system. ``Unless we move
fast on this track within a year or two, we risk losing the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
	   Since Abdullah became the surprise choice to succeed his father, King
Hussein, a year ago, the energetic and often impatient new leader's
preoccupation has been speeding up reforms in his destitute country.
</P>
<P>
	   Hussein, who died last Feb. 7, was credited with transforming a land of
nomadic Bedouins into a largely cosmopolitan nation that exports doctors and
engineers to the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
	   Challenges at least as great face his son.
</P>
<P>
	   Jordan is saddled with foreign debt of $7 billion and unemployment that
officially stands at 14 percent but is said to be nearly twice that. About 20
percent of its 4.8 million people live in poverty. Corruption is rampant, and
bureaucracy hampers foreign and local investment. The 1994 peace treaty with
Israel has brought little dividends, and the West and oil-rich Persian Gulf Arab
states have been hesitant to help.
</P>
<P>
	   Abdullah's hands-on approach has earned him the nickname ``Jordan's chief
executive officer,'' and his calls for greater public freedoms, civil rights,
social justice and equality have raised blood pressures in a government and
parliament dominated by conservative politicians.
</P>
<P>
	   The new king also has staged raids on state institutions to inspect the
services citizens receive. He personally fired two doctors in charge of the
public al-Bashir Hospital three months ago when they ignored his instructions to
fix two elevators. Abdullah sometimes posed as an old man, a television reporter
or a taxi driver -- a ploy that allowed him to freely listen to complaints from
his countrymen.
</P>
<P>
	   ``After my first several visits, it was like Elvis,'' a chortling Abdullah
told foreign media correspondents recently. ``There were sightings all over the
country, but what it did too, it created fear in the civil service.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``They started treating everybody as a king because they didn't know whether
the next guy standing in line was the (real) king,'' he said. ``Now people are
on their toes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Such moves have sent Abdullah's popularity soaring among younger Jordanians,
who had revered Hussein for his liberal outlook but see in the new king a
determination to make changes that would improve their lives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``King Hussein was the father of all Jordanians, but King Abdullah is the
brother of the Jordanians,'' said 39-year-old Samer Abed al-Hadi, a civil
engineer.
</P>
<P>
	   Until his father's deathbed decision, Abdullah was a tank company commander
with little experience in affairs of state. He was considered a long shot to
assume the Hashemite Throne -- one of the Middle East's key political posts --
since his uncle, Prince Hassan, had been crown prince since 1965. But Hussein
deposed Hassan just days before he died.
</P>
<P>
	   Abdullah was labeled a political novice, but has shown himself capable of
setting his own agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   He has forged crucial strategic alliances to ensure the survival of a
country that had been ostracized by the Arabs. Hussein was seen as favoring Iraq
during the 1990-91 Persian Gulf crisis over Kuwait, and vilified for his warm
ties with Israel when prospects for a Middle East settlement faded under a past
hard-line Israeli administration.
</P>
<P>
	   Abdullah has kept both Iraq and Israel at arms length, earning praise from
Persian Gulf Arabs and powerful neighbors like Syria, which had long accused
Hussein of being Israel's ``puppet.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also was able to end a rift with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who
distrusted Hussein's policy in the West Bank territory that Jordan ruled for 17
years until it was seized by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
	   Abdullah has gone out of his way to lend support for Palestinian calls for
an independent state in the West Bank and has vowed to cede authority over
Muslim shrines in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem to the Palestinians -- a
right claimed by Hussein, a descendant of the 7th Century Prophet Mohammad of
Islam.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past year, the king also has dismissed his uncle's loyalists in the
army, government, intelligence services, and even palace aides.
</P>
<P>
	   Support for Abdullah came from a royal family fearful over the fate of the
Hashemite dynasty amid speculation that Hussein's successor might be Prince
Hamzeh, then a 19-year-old college student.
</P>
<P>
	   Abdullah, Hussein's son from his marriage to Briton Toni Gardiner, named
Hamzeh -- Hussein's son from a later marriage to American-born Queen Noor -- as
heir to the throne in his first royal decree.
</P>
<P>
	   Hussein has three other sons and six daughters from four marriages.
</P>
<P>
	   Abdullah and his wife, Rania, have two children -- Prince Hussein, 5, and
Princess Iman, 3.

<HEADLINE> At least 60 people displaced from four north Jersey fires  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   UNION CITY, N.J. (AP) - At least 60 people were homeless after four
large fires broke out in three northern New Jersey cities Saturday night and
Sunday morning.
<P>
	   A string of blazes in Union City, Jersey City, and Paterson displaced at
least 17 families, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Union City, a fire began inside the top floor of a three-story building
on Bergenline Avenue around 7 p.m. Saturday, and spread quickly to three others,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ten families living in the second- and third-floor apartments were able to
escape with minor injuries, according to Union City Mayor Rudy Garcia.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire was brought under control around 11 p.m., Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents were able to pick up what was left of their belongings on Sunday
morning, but it was unclear if they would be able to move back in.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're still assessing the damage, and we're not sure if all four are
completely destroyed," said Garcia on Sunday. "We will need to determine if any
one of them have to be razed."
</P>
<P>
	   He said that decision will be made later in the week.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire was caused by a faulty lighting fixture in a third-floor apartment,
according to city spokesman Brian Stack.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jersey City, a father, his three children and a firefighter suffered
smoke inhalation Saturday in a three-alarm blaze that heavily damaged three
rowhouses on Zabrieski Street, which left at least seven families homeless,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Justo Madero, 44, and his three children, aged 2, 7 and 14, were taken to
Jersey City Medical Center, according to Steve McGill, assistant director of the
Jersey City Fire Department. The family lived on the second floor of a two-story
rowhouse where the fire began.
</P>
<P>
	   "The father threw them out the window of the second floor and then he jumped
out," said McGill on Saturday. "There were residents on the ground floor that
caught them."
</P>
<P>
	   The father also jumped, and was taken to the same hospital, suffering from
neck and back pains, McGill said. Madero was treated and released, according to
a nursing supervisor at Jersey City Medical Center. No information was released
on Madero's three children.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the 55 firefighters who battled the blaze was treated and released at
St. Francis Hospital for smoke exhaustion, according to a nursing supervisor.
</P>
<P>
	   McGill said the Red Cross was at the scene helping displaced families,
including residents of a four-story home converted into apartments, and a
two-story building housing an apartment over a bar. Both two-story buildings
were heavily damaged and two apartments in the taller building also were left
uninhabitable.
</P>
<P>
	   McGill said the fire began about 4:30 p.m. and was extinguished by 7 p.m.
Its cause was still under investigation on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   In Paterson, firefighters en route to a one-alarm fire on Spring Street
around 6 a.m Sunday, noticed heavy smoke coming from a three-story building on
Main Street, said Deputy Chief Norman Morley.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire at 624 Main Street had spread to two others buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   About 20 residents were able to escape their second- and third-floor
apartments, but a dog on the second died, Morley said.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire is believed to have begun inside a vacant store on the first floor
of 624 Main Street, Morley said. It was brought under control shortly after 8
a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   A crane was demolishing the building Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents were staying with relatives or at a nearby hotel, Morley said.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire was declared suspicious and is under investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   A one-alarm fire at Spring Street began outside the building and had spread
to the basement, officials said. No one was injured, and it was unclear how many
residents were inside the building, but they were able to return.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire was under control around 7 a.m., and was also declared suspicious,
pending an investigation.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Queen Assumes Lesser Role  </HEADLINE>
   By JAMAL HALABY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Queen Noor gets a little less of the limelight in
Jordan now that she is no longer first lady.
</P>
<P>
	   But she still enjoys the advantages of being a queen and the mother of
Prince Hamzeh, the 20-year-old heir to the Hashemite Throne.
</P>
<P>
	   Noor, 48, is widely popular among Jordanians who watched her puffy-eyed
vigil at the bedside of a gravely ill King Hussein before his death from cancer
last Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am no longer the wife of the head of state,'' Noor said in a recent CNN
interview. ``But the rest of the details and how I am referred to ... hasn't
changed.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am simply Queen Noor, my husband's wife and widow. And in Jordan, I
remain for many people an extension of him, a part of him.''
</P>
<P>
	   The American-born Lisa Halaby of Washington D.C. adopted the name Noor
al-Hussein, or light of Hussein, when she converted to Islam before her
marriage. She was instrumental in forging warm ties with the United States and
ending Jordan's international ostracism for its perceived tilt toward Iraq
following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
	   These days, the queen leads seminars at home and abroad on issues such as
ridding the world of mines, child care and combating drug abuse and violence
against women.
</P>
<P>
	   She is often seen visiting indigent Jordanian families or inspecting
state-financed social projects in remote villages of the kingdom, sometimes with
Queen Rania, the wife of King Abdullah II.
</P>
<P>
	   There had been speculation that Noor had ruffled family feathers by grooming
her son, Hamzeh, for the throne that for 34 years was reserved for Hussein's
younger brother, Prince Hassan.
</P>
<P>
	   But days before his death, Hussein deposed Hassan and appointed Abdullah as
his successor. When he became king, Abdullah named Hamzeh as his heir.
</P>
<P>
	   In public gatherings, Noor is seen kissing, hugging, chatting and laughing
with Abdullah and other family members. In state functions, she is usually
seated next to Abdullah and his wife. People close to the royal family say Noor
and Abdullah visit each other often.
</P>
<P>
	   Noor lives in a home on Amman's outskirts that she moved to with Hussein in
1998, called Bawabet as-Salam, or the Gate of Peace Palace. Hamzeh lives with
Noor along with his two sisters -- Princess Iman, 17, and Princess Raiyah, 14.
His brother, Prince Hashim, 19, is now studying at Britain's Sandhurst military
academy.

<HEADLINE> Russian Tanker Carried Iraqi Oil  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tests confirm a Russian tanker seized by the U.S. Navy in
the Persian Gulf was carrying Iraqi oil in violation of the U.N. economic
embargo, Defense Secretary William Cohen said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Volga-Neft-147 was being taken to Muscat, the capital of Oman, and the
Omani government will determine the fate of the merchant vessel and its crew,
Cohen told reporters while flying back from Germany, where he attended a
conference on European security.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen also disclosed that an Iraqi naval officer was on board the ship when
it was seized by U.S. Navy SEAL commandoes.
</P>
<P>
	   The tests were completed Sunday on samples of oil from the tanker that was
seized Wednesday on suspicions it was carrying Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They do reveal that the oil was from Iraq,'' Cohen said. ``But the
government of Oman will make a determination as to what they will do with the
ship itself. That's up to the Omanis at this point.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the Russians were informed of results of the tests but was unaware
of any immediate response from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   Under normal procedure, the contraband would be sold and the profits used
partly to offset the costs of the nation that agrees to take the vessel and
partly to pay for the maritime force operation, U.S. officials have said.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked what effect the development might have on U.S.-Russian ties, Cohen
said: ``I don't think it will have any impact on relations.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen pointed out that the ship was privately owned, and not the property of
the government. Moscow had protested the seizure and demanded the vessel's
release.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department referred all questions to the Pentagon. Calls to the
Russian Foreign Ministry in Moscow went unanswered.
</P>
<P>
	   When it was ordered to stop on Wednesday, the tanker ignored U.S. Navy
demands, so armed Navy SEALs were dispatched by helicopter to board and seize
the vessel, the Pentagon said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials had said earlier that the Russian crew offered no resistance
to being boarded Wednesday and cooperated with U.S. Navy personnel involved.
</P>
<P>
	   Once the SEALs got on board, the Russian crew cooperated, and no shots were
fired, a Pentagon official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. ship was part of a multinational maritime interception force that
enforces the 9-year-old U.N. embargo against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia, which maintained that the oil was from Iran, long has supported
steps that would lead to the eventual lifting of the U.N. economic embargo
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration has insisted on full Iraqi compliance with the
U.N. Security Council resolutions, including a requirement Iraq not possess
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington said it merely was merely enforcing the embargo against Iraq in
ordering the seizure.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq is banned from most international commerce but is allowed to export up
to $5.2 billion in oil every six months in order to buy food, medicine and other
essentials for its people, and spare parts for its oil industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the effort to enforce the U.N. sanctions, the State Department said
last week that illicit oil exports from Iraq average 100,000 barrels a day,
compared with 50,000 barrels in 1998, when oil prices were much lower.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan War Crimes Suspect Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A Rwandan man accused of genocide during the 1994 slaughter in
his homeland has been arrested in Britain, authorities said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Tharcisse Muvunyi, 46, was detained Saturday in southeast London on an
extradition warrant issued by the International Criminal Tribunal of Rwanda
alleging ``genocide and acts of inhumanity,'' Scotland Yard said.
</P>
<P>
	   Muvunyi, who faces a court appearance Monday, was allegedly in charge of
soldiers who helped to slaughter more than 100,000 Rwandans in the southern
university town of Butare in April 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   A lieutenant-colonel in the former Rwandan army, Muvinyi allegedly commanded
units when massacres against Tutsis were set into motion and his soldiers
allegedly manned roadblocks or aided militiamen in hunting people down.
</P>
<P>
	   According to U.S.-based Human Rights Watch, Muvinyi once claimed he was not
trusted by his superiors and that the soldiers who killed were from other units.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, at least 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus were
killed in the 100-day bloodbath carried out by the extremist Hutu government.
The fighting ended when Tutsi-led rebels won power in July 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Muvunyi had been living in Britain since March 1998, said the Home Office,
which is responsible for immigration. The tribunal was informed of his
whereabouts later that year, the office said. News reports said he was living
with his wife and three children in southeast London.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. Security Council established the tribunal in Arusha, Tanzania, in
November 1994 to prosecute the architects and chief perpetrators of the
government-sponsored slaughter.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, the court has handed down seven verdicts. Currently, 39 people
are being held in custody in a U.N. detention facility in Arusha, awaiting trial
or the outcome of their appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   Rwandan courts are also conducting war crimes trials. More than 300 trials
have been held and 116 suspects have been sentenced to death.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Refugees Tell of Horrors  </HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW KRAMER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SLEPTSOVSKAYA, Russia (AP) -- After enduring months of bombing and shelling,
at least 22 civilians emerged from hiding in Chechnya's capital only to be
deliberately killed by advancing Russian troops, human rights workers and
refugees say.
</P>
<P>
	   According to their accounts, the killings occurred between Dec. 22 and Jan.
21 as soldiers were searching for rebel fighters and allegedly looting homes in
the Staropromyslovsky district of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   Lying in a hospital bed in the neighboring republic of Ingushetia -- where
up to 250,000 Chechens have taken refuge from the war -- 40-year-old Kheida
Makhayuri recounted how she and two other women had come upon troops stealing
mattresses from an apartment building. Three soldiers led them to a Russian
checkpoint, then to a bombed-out building.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They said 'the commander ordered us to bind your eyes','' Makhayuri
recalled, her voice rising barely above a whisper.
</P>
<P>
	   The blindfolded women were terrified and held hands, and the soldiers shot
them from behind with assault rifles, she said. Makhayuri's companions were
killed instantly, but she was wounded in the shoulder and pretended to be dead.
</P>
<P>
	   The soldiers ripped her earrings off -- leaving a tear in her right ear --
and she feared they would cut her finger off when they had trouble twisting off
a ring. The soldiers piled mattresses on the women and doused them with
gasoline, but the fire failed to spread across the fabric because it was damp.
</P>
<P>
	   Makhayuri said she dared to move only about half an hour later when she
heard a bird land nearby, and she knew the soldiers had gone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They left thinking I was dead,'' she said. A wad of gauze bandages covered
a bullet wound in her shoulder, and her legs had burns from the gasoline.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian military has repeatedly denied that its troops have
intentionally harmed civilians in their drive to take over the breakaway
republic.
</P>
<P>
	   But the New York-based Human Rights Watch group has documented eight
incidents in the Staropromyslovsky district in which it says a total of 22
civilians were killed. There are also unconfirmed reports of more than a dozen
other murders associated with an alleged weeks-long rampage in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A disturbing number of civilians have been murdered by Russian troops in
Grozny,'' said Peter Bouckaert, a researcher with Human Rights Watch. He accused
Russian commanders of turning a blind eye to the killings.
</P>
<P>
	   Saipudin Saadulayev, 39, a former oil worker and Grozny native, witnessed
Russian soldiers shoot an elderly man at point-blank range.
</P>
<P>
	   The old man, Said Tugoyev, had spent five months in Grozny cellars. He
survived repeated bombardments -- only to be killed as he walked across a yard
to tell two Russian soldiers that civilians were in the basement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They shot him with a machine-gun and then a soldier leaned over and shot
him in the head,'' Saadulayev said.

<HEADLINE> IRA Dissidents Suspected in Bombing  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Suspected Irish Republican Army dissidents
bombed a rural hotel Sunday -- an attack that caused no reported injuries but
gave Northern Ireland a bitter reminder of the days the province is struggling
to leave behind.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first such attack here since 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   A caller claiming to be from the Continuity IRA, a small dissident group
opposed to the IRA's 1997 truce, told the BBC in Belfast that bombs had been
left at two hotels in rural County Fermanagh.
</P>
<P>
	   Police evacuated both hotels shortly before a bomb, apparently inside a car,
went off at the rear of Mahon's Hotel in the village of Irvinestown. Police said
they couldn't find any suspicious devices at the other threatened hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There will always be people who try to undermine the peace process,'' a
spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair's Downing Street office said in London.
``We will do what we can to make sure they do not succeed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Sunday, Protestants and Catholics prayed for the salvation of
Northern Ireland's peace process -- and for an unprecedented leap of faith from
the IRA.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA's refusal to say whether it will disarm has left the province's new
government teetering on the brink of collapse.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even if until this moment you never intended to decommission (weapons), it
is possible for you to change,'' the leader of the Methodist Church in Ireland,
Kenneth Wilson, said in an appeal to the IRA. ``It is possible for you to make a
magnanimous gesture -- not to march in time to the British tune or the
(Protestant) unionist tune but, if I may say, to God's tune.''
</P>
<P>
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair emphasized Sunday that he wants to gain a
disarmament commitment from the IRA this week. Otherwise, Britain intends to
take back the powers it transferred in December to the province's new
Protestant-Catholic coalition Cabinet in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
	   That transfer of power was a key part of the 1998 Good Friday peace accord.
It ended 27 years of direct rule of the province from London.
</P>
<P>
	   Rendering the four-party coalition powerless would decrease the risk that
its major Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, would collapse the Cabinet
outright by resigning.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, the Ulster Unionists accepted the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party as
Cabinet colleagues on condition that IRA disarmament follow. But the province's
disarmament commission reported Jan. 31 that its two months of secret
discussions with IRA figures had produced no concrete gains.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, IRA commanders said British and Ulster Unionist pressure
wouldn't spur them to disarm -- but hinted they might begin disarming someday,
saying for the first time that ``the issue of arms needs to be dealt with in an
acceptable way.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein said the IRA's statement represented a significant change in
policy. But Blair said it didn't answer the question of whether the IRA will
disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the moment when we simply need to know,'' Blair told a conference
of his governing Labor Party in Blackpool, northwest England. ``Because this
issue of decommissioning is not going to change, it's not going to disappear,
it's not going to alter in its essentials. It's just got to be confronted and
resolved now.''
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to Sinn Fein complaints that his government's blunt appeals would
only make the IRA dig in its heels, Blair said: ``I'm not speaking in anger. I'm
not standing here as the British prime minister making demands. I can't make
anyone do this. I can only say that now is when we need to know whether it's
going to happen, or it's not.''

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Announces Senate Run  </HEADLINE>
   By MARC HUMBERT AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) -- With the president beside her and 2,000 supporters
chanting her name, Hillary Rodham Clinton formally launched her campaign Sunday
to be U.S. senator from New York, a state she has lived in only a month.
</P>
<P>
	   The race for the seat being vacated by fellow Democrat Daniel Patrick
Moynihan is likely to pit Clinton against New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in
what could be one of the most flamboyant political campaigns in memory.
</P>
<P>
	   No other first lady has ever run for public office.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am honored today to announce my candidacy for the U.S. Senate from New
York,'' Clinton said as shouts of ``Hillary! Hillary!'' rang through a
university gymnasium not far from her new home the suburbs north of New York
City.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I may be new to the neighborhood, but I'm not new to your concerns,'' she
said, while President Clinton; her mother, Dorothy; and daughter Chelsea sat
beaming behind her.
</P>
<P>
	   The president is said to be one of his wife's top advisers as she resumes
the career she put aside to help him capture the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Recalling a speech she made at her college commencement at Wellesley in
1969, Clinton said: ``I often return to one thing I said back then, that
politics is the art of making possible what appears to be impossible. I still
believe that today. We can do what seems impossible if we have the vision the
passion and the will to do it together.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton described her commitment to better schools, better health care and
gun control. But she also took pains to describe herself as a ``new Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't believe that government is the source of all our problems or the
solutions to them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Her remarks were preceded by tributes from Moynihan, Sen. Charles Schumer
and Reps. Nita Lowey of Westchester and Charles Rangel of Harlem, who joined her
on stage during her speech and stayed after to shake hands with supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent polls have shown Giuliani with a slight lead over Clinton and running
even with her among women voters. That's a far cry from a year ago when sympathy
was strong from the Monica Lewinsky scandal and polls showed her well ahead of
the mayor.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday morning talk shows, Giuliani reminded viewers of Clinton's late
arrival to New York politics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My record of success comes out of my knowledge, experience, background and
life experience as a lifetime resident of the state,'' he said on CBS' ``Face
the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``How is it that the Democratic Party can't come up with a candidate for the
Senate from the state of New York? What does that say about the Democratic
Party?''
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani has not made a formal campaign announcement, but he came close on
ABC's ``This Week,'' one of the five TV talk shows he appeared on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked if he planned to run, he said: ``Looks that way.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last July at Moynihan's sprawling farm, Clinton kicked off a summer-long
``listening tour'' of the state that extended into the fall and took her from
Broadway to Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
	   By December, she was assuring supporters she intended to run. And in early
January, she moved into a $1.7 million house in suburban Westchester County to
establish residency.
</P>
<P>
	   Political experts said there was good reason Clinton chose the State
University of New York at Purchase to make her announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When duck hunting, one goes where the ducks are,'' Republican consultant
Jay Severin said. ``The independent suburban ducks are the ducks in this
campaign that are yet to be bagged.''
</P>
<P>
	   As of the end of the year, Clinton had raised $8 million and Giuliani, who
started fund raising three months earlier, had raised almost $12 million. It is
expected to be the most expensive Senate race in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton campaign also arranged for about 500 house parties to be held
simultaneously around the state during Clinton's announcement so more than
20,000 supporters could watch on television and then listen in on a conference
telephone call from the candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   In seeking to replace Moynihan, Clinton hopes to make another kind of
history. No woman has ever been independently elected to statewide office in New
York. Former vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro unsuccessfully sought
the Democratic Senate nomination in 1992 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's terrific,'' Ferraro said. ``I think it's taking the role of
the first lady and putting it in the perspective of the 21st century.''

<HEADLINE> Prisoner's Rosary Mulled By Courts  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN FINUCANE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- In the early morning hours of a hot July day in 1997, Peter
Kane was rousted by a corrections officer in his cell at the Massachusetts state
prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the items confiscated by the guards was Kane's rosary, a
black-and-white beaded string that Department of Correction officials said could
signify gang affiliation.
</P>
<P>
	   But Kane claims the guards took his religious freedom, and the state's
highest court is to hear arguments in his case Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In an affidavit, Peter Pepe Jr., superintendent of the prison in Shirley,
said gangs were becoming ``a major source of disruption to the safety, security
and internal order of Massachusetts prisons.''
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the department's crackdown, restrictions were placed on certain
items of jewelry and clothing, including rosaries, Pepe said.
</P>
<P>
	   Department spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said Kane, who denies being a member of
any gang, can have rosary beads -- as long as they are only one color.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The policy has to be applied to every inmate or the policy wouldn't be
fair,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   A lower court agreed with the agency, saying that inmates' rights ``may be
curtailed in order to achieve legitimate correctional goals or to maintain
prison security.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kane's attorney, John Reinstein of the American Civil Liberties Union, said
the message officials are sending is: ``If you want to pray, pray our way.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The net effect of what the Department of Correction is doing here is to
make it more difficult for people to pray,'' he said. ``I certainly don't think
you want to deprive people of the focus and sustenance they get from religion.''
</P>
<P>
	   C.J. Doyle, executive director of the Catholic Action League, was skeptical
of the state's policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It seems that, given the easy availability of drugs and knives in
Massachusetts correctional facilities, it's hard to believe a set of rosary
beads would constitute a mortal danger,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Talks Suspended  </HEADLINE>
   By SAMAR ASSAD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Palestinian and Israeli peace negotiators suspended talks
Sunday to wait for U.S. proposals to get them back on track, a senior
Palestinian negotiator said.
</P>
<P>
	   The negotiations are aimed at meeting a Feb. 13 deadline for the outline of
a final peace agreement between the two sides. They were suspended on what was
to have been the seventh of 10 days of marathon talks, senior Palestinian
negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are waiting for the Americans, nothing can happen until they come back
with responses,'' Abed Rabbo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Larry Schwartz, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, confirmed the
U.S. efforts. But, he said, the sides should continue direct talks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is the most fruitful way to make progress,'' Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli officials refused to confirm whether the negotiations -- often held
at a secret location -- were indeed canceled. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
visiting King Abdullah II in Jordan, said Israel continued to insist on direct
talks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it is our responsibility with the Palestinians to get to a
solution,'' he said in comments translated from Hebrew by Israeli foreign
ministry officials. Abdullah sent his foreign minister to Cairo later to brief
visiting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on the meeting with Barak.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israelis object to U.S. intervention. Both sides believe President
Clinton is seeking a legacy in his last year in office and is likely to press
Israel into concessions.
</P>
<P>
	   The marathon peace talks are addressing thorny final status issues,
including the future of Jerusalem, refugees and borders between Israel and a
future Palestinian state. But the dispute that led to the suspension centers on
an interim issue -- a 6.1 percent withdrawal from the West Bank that Israel has
promised to carry out this week.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israelis want to hand over mostly uninhabited stretches of West Bank
land to Palestinian control. But the Palestinians want populous Arab suburbs of
Jerusalem, a city both sides claim as their capital.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians say Israel's failure to take their considerations into
account on the less important interim issues makes negotiating the crucial final
status issues impossible.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There has been no accurate, honest implementation of what was signed
between us and Barak himself,'' Arafat told reporters in Gaza after returning
from consultations with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Palestinian and Israeli officials acknowledge now that the Feb. 13
deadline is likely to be missed.
</P>
<P>
	   After the breakdown, both sides began round-the-clock consultations. In
addition to meeting Mubarak, Arafat sent envoys to Jordan and Egypt. Barak flew
to Jordan on Sunday to consult with Abdullah about the breakdown with the
Palestinians, as well as the stalled Syrian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jordan, Barak threatened to retaliate against Muslim militants targeting
Israeli soldiers in South Lebanon, but stressed that he will stick to his
previous pledge to withdraw from the area by July.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whoever hits us in South Lebanon, we will hit him back,'' Barak told
reporters after a two-hour meeting with Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
	   His comments came hours after an Israeli soldier was killed in a roadside
bomb in Israeli-occupied South Lebanon. The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla
group claimed responsibility. The soldier was the fifth Israeli fatality in less
than two weeks in South Lebanon, the last active Israeli-Arab warfront.
</P>
<P>
	   Standing next to Barak on Sunday, Jordanian Prime Minister Abdur-Ra'uf S.
Rawabdeh said King Abdullah reiterated to Barak Jordan's support for Syria,
Lebanon and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
	   A communique issued after the talks said Abdullah urged Barak to ``remove
the obstacles facing the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, because this track
constitutes the core of the peace process.'' The communique, read over Jordan
radio, said Abdullah also urged Barak to give the Syrian talks the care they
deserve because ``the Syrian leadership is committed to achieving a just
peace.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere Sunday, top Egyptian, Jordanian, Palestinian and Israeli officials
met in Cairo to discuss the fate of Palestinians displaced in the 1967 Middle
East war. Both sides have agreed to discuss the issue multilaterally with Jordan
and Egypt. Jordan and Egypt have hosted hundreds of thousands of displaced
Palestinians since the war.

<HEADLINE> CIA Says Attorney Failed Polygraph  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Jewish attorney who says the CIA fired him because of
anti-Semitism within the agency failed two lie-detector tests about whether he
gave or sold U.S. secrets ``to an Israeli national,'' an agency memo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Adam Ciralsky, 28, of Milwaukee, joined the spy agency in December 1996 as a
contract employee in the Office of General Counsel. By the following October,
Ciralsky had been placed on unpaid leave. His top-secret security clearance was
revoked in July 1998, and he was fired in late 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Ciralsky was airing his complaints against the agency Sunday night on CBS'
''60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
	   The agency said it acted against Ciralsky because he did not fully reveal a
relationship with two people holding dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship, both
employees of Israeli defense firms with possible ties to Israeli intelligence.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Harlow, CIA public affairs director, disputed Ciralsky's allegations of
anti-Semitism. He said the allegations had been reviewed by the agency's
inspector general, by several congressional panels and by a citizens' review
group.
</P>
<P>
	   The memorandum about Ciralsky's case, first reported Sunday by The
Washington Post, was written by Alan Wade, the CIA's associate deputy director
for security.
</P>
<P>
	   The memo said Ciralsky failed two polygraph examinations. The questions he
was asked, Wade wrote, were about ``deliberately compromising U.S. government
classified information to an Israeli national, accepting compensation from an
Israeli national in exchange for U.S. government classified information, and
deliberately concealing from the U.S. government a relationship with an Israeli
national.''
</P>
<P>
	   The CIA's Harlow refused to discuss the memo Sunday. He said the agency had
been willing to publicly discuss details of Ciralsky's case, but that his
lawyers had blocked them from doing so by invoking the Privacy Act.

<HEADLINE> Republicans demand figures on candidate's travel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Republicans renewed a demand Sunday that Hillary Rodham
Clinton account for costs of her campaign travels, saying the first lady has
made "more than 50" politics-related trips costing taxpayers far more than the
$34,000 her aides say has been reimbursed to the White House.
<P>
	   "It would be a good time for Mrs. Clinton to play fair with the people of
New York," Patricia Harrison, co-chair of the Republican National Committee,
told reporters just before Clinton formally declared herself a candidate for
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want her to try to begin her campaign by telling the truth."
</P>
<P>
	   As first lady, Clinton travels with the security and other trappings of the
White House and her campaign is supposed to reimburse the White House Travel
Office for some of the costs, but neither of those entities has released figures
on how much has been spent or paid back, Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
	   The $34,000 Clinton aides have reported reimbursing is based on the price of
first-class travel. It is not intended to pay the full cost of security for the
first lady, for whom the price of travel soars because of her position as the
president's wife.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Harrison said Clinton's travel expenses don't add up.
</P>
<P>
	   "The taxpayers should not have to foot the bill for her trips," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Harrison said her office had found that Clinton's campaign travels were
"comparable" with those of Vice President Al Gore, which cost him $323,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's probable opponent in the Senate race, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, has
made 14 campaign-type trips costing $150,000, "all flights fully paid for,"
Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
	   On a TV news program earlier in the day, Giuliani himself acknowledged that
the line between his campaign and mayoral staffs had blurred at times, saying:
"There's always going to be questions about overlap."
</P>
<P>
	   A list compiled by the GOP about Clinton's campaign showed 51 appearances by
the first lady between July 7 and Dec. 22, 1999, most of them in New York state.
It also included fund-raisers in Massachusetts, Philadelphia, Chicago, Las
Vegas, Los Angeles, Cincinnati, Rhode Island and Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
	   And Harrison said the list was incomplete.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't know how many trips she has taken or how much they cost ... or
whether payment for trips has been made," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton campaign aides did not immediately return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   However, in a statement handed out at Harrison's news conference by a
Clinton campaign volunteer, Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson described the
Republican demands for disclosure as "negative attacks," and "politics - pure
and simple."

<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Here are quotes in reaction to Hillary Rodham Clinton's
formal announcement of her candidacy Sunday:
<P>
	   --"Hillary, Eleanor Roosevelt would love you," said U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan to the first lady.
</P>
<P>
	   --"You might ask the following question: How is it that the Democratic Party
can't come up with a candidate for the Senate from the state of New York?" said
New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Clinton's likely Republican opponent, on
CBS' "Face the Nation."
</P>
<P>
	   --"She unleashes people's energies. When you're in the Senate, you need to
bring people together and lift them up and she's very good at that," said
President Clinton in the 18-minute video, "Hillary," shown at the campaign
kick-off.
</P>
<P>
	   --"It's a great day for women and it's a great day for everyone who cares
about New York," said Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, daughter of the late Robert F.
Kennedy; Kennedy once represented New York in the U.S. Senate and like Clinton,
was from out of state.
</P>
<P>
	   --"Mayor Giuliani's live television appearances Sunday were typical New York
-- spontaneous, honest and direct," said Kim Serafin, spokeswoman for Giuliani's
campaign. "Mrs. Clinton's was typical Hollywood -- scripted, choreographed and
directed by others."
</P>
<P>
	   -- "She's got the smarts, she's got the heart, she's a fighter, she doesn't
take no for an answer, and we will make a great team in the United States
Senate," said U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., speaking in tribute to the
first lady before she made her announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   --"Hillary, please don't run," said state Assemblyman Dov Hikind,
D-Brooklyn, an Orthodox Jew who criticized Clinton's meeting with Suha Arafat
and her lack of a position on clemency for Jonathan Pollard, an American
convicted of spying for Israel. "New York Democrats are more disenchanted now
than they were six months ago. Democrats can do better."
</P>
<P>
	   --"The more people get to see and hear Mr. Giuliani, the better she'll do,
particularly upstate," said Michael Schell, chairman of the state Democratic
Party's Executive Committee and a former Jefferson County party chairman.
"Upstaters are really more Midwesterners."
</P>
<P>
	   --"We want her to try to begin her campaign by telling the truth," said
Patricia Harrison, co-chair of the Republican National Committee, at a Sunday
press conference where she accused the first lady of making many more trips
related to her campaign than she has reimbursed taxpayers for.

<HEADLINE> Many Protest Spanish Woman's Slaying  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL EJIDO, Spain (AP) -- Angered by the slaying of a Spanish woman, scores of
protesters armed with bats and sticks threatened a group of North Africans
Sunday, but riot police separated the groups without any reports of injury.
</P>
<P>
	   Police helicopters flew overhead as officers patrolled the streets of this
city of 50,000 in southern Spain, where hundreds of African immigrants work.
</P>
<P>
	   The standoff came a day after the stabbing death of 26-year-old Encarnacion
Lopez Valverde and the arrest of a Moroccan suspect.
</P>
<P>
	   Government officials who attended her funeral Sunday were attacked by
mourners outside the church.
</P>
<P>
	   Spanish television showed footage of Fernando Hermoso, the Spanish
government's top representative in Almeria, being punched in the head and back.
He and other officials rushed back into the church for safety.
</P>
<P>
	   Tensions have been high in El Ejido for the past two weeks following the
death of two Spanish farmers, allegedly at the hands of a North African.
</P>
<P>
	   They boiled over on Saturday after Lopez was stabbed to death while shopping
at a flea market. The newspaper El Pais said she was a month away from getting
married.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said a young man tried to steal her purse but she resisted, and was
stabbed in the abdomen. She died almost instantly, as other shoppers looked on
in horror.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities arrested a 20-year-old Moroccan immigrant. The Interior
Ministry's top representative in the surrounding Andalusia region, Jose Torres
Hurtado, said the man had a history of mental problems.
</P>
<P>
	   In the hours immediately after the stabbing, protesters overturned cars and
burned shops owned by Moroccans, Hanafi Hamza, president of the Association of
Moroccan Immigrant Workers in Spain, told the news agency Efe.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Police Raid University  </HEADLINE>
   By NIKO PRICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- In a surprisingly smooth conclusion to the 9 1/2-month
occupation of Latin America's largest university, police raided the main campus
Sunday and arrested 632 striking students.
</P>
<P>
	   The raid ended an exasperating ordeal in which Mexican authorities from
President Ernesto Zedillo on down seemed unable to wrest the country's most
important academic institution from a tiny band of radical students with names
like Mosh and The Devil.
</P>
<P>
	   Armed only with batons and shields, about 2,400 federal police marched into
an all-night meeting of the student strike council at 6:45 a.m. and rounded up
about 430 students, including the eight top strike leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   The strikers didn't resist arrest and there were no injuries. Police then
swept through the giant campus, detaining hundreds more strikers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A democratic society cannot allow the kidnapping of the national
university,'' said Interior Secretary Diodoro Carrasco.
</P>
<P>
	   Rector Juan Ramon de la Fuente said that, where possible, the university
would withdraw criminal complaints filed against students during the strike. In
cases where the university lacks the authority to withdraw complaints, Fuente
called on prosecutors to offer leniency. He also asked them to drop charges
against minors.
</P>
<P>
	   Several hundred strikers were already jailed on various charges before
Sunday's raid. It was unclear how many would be affected by Fuente's
declaration.
</P>
<P>
	   The 291-day strike at the 260,000-student National Autonomous University of
Mexico began in April to protest plans to raise annual tuition, which had been
just a few cents, to the equivalent of $140.
</P>
<P>
	   The university backed down, but a small core of radical students continued
to occupy the campus. They pushed a six-point agenda to reverse recent academic
reforms and give students more power within the university administration. They
also used the strike as a stage to denounce the free-market economy and Mexico's
political system.
</P>
<P>
	   What little public sympathy that may have existed for the strikers gradually
faded as a result of their traffic-clogging and sometimes violent protests,
vandalism of university buildings, intolerance of dissenting opinions and
intransigence in negotiations. A referendum last month showed students and
teachers overwhelmingly sided with the university in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   But, fearing bloodshed, officials were reluctant to forcibly retake the
campus. The strikers were believed to have guns and explosives. No one wanted to
risk repeating one of the darkest moments in modern Mexican history: a 1968
massacre of striking university students.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday's raid came five days after a clash that injured 37 security guards
and two days after a failed negotiating session. It seemed calculated to
minimize the potential for violence. Police did not carry guns and human rights
officials went along as observers.
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Francisco Arrellano, general coordinator of the Federal Preventative
Police, said his officers sealed off the campus, then moved in. Only a handful
of strikers were guarding the barricades and, other than chanting about police
repression, they didn't resist.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberto Garduno, a local reporter covering the strike council meeting at the
Che Guevara auditorium, said strikers had heard rumors of a raid, but stopped
worrying about it when it hadn't happened by 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours later, the police marched into the auditorium in a column, Garduno
said. Students yelled at one another to stay calm, sit down and not provoke the
police, he said. The students were moved to one side of the auditorium while
police checked their identification.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, police swept the university building by building for the
other strikers and took them to the auditorium.
</P>
<P>
	   Alberto Gonzalez Camacho, a 27-year-old law student, said he was sleeping
when police arrived. He said he escaped by running into the hills behind the
university.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were aggressive. They came in swinging,'' he said. ``They took
everyone they could. There was no resistance. We were sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
	   The only weapons police reported finding were six bottles converted into
Molotov cocktails, two screwdrivers, a pair of scissors and a souvenir machete.
They also seized a few scraggly marijuana plants.
</P>
<P>
	   Sixteen buses carried the strikers from the university as parents and
supporters outside the police line flashed victory signs at them and cursed at
the police.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are treating us like animals when all we want is to find out what's
happening with our children,'' said Marco Antonio Lopez, the father of a
striker.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of people held protest marches on behalf of the strikers later
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Police continued to occupy the campus and it was not known when classes
would resume. The university will have to repair damaged equipment and replace
materials that were looted.
</P>
<P>
	   The government indicated talks would continue on issues raised in the
strike. Carrasco, the interior secretary, said the retaking of the university
``isn't enough to resolve the conflict'' but will help the university community
carry out changes ``with freedom and responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some strikers say they're not giving up.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're thinking of retaking the installations,'' said Gonzalez, the law
student. ``The government isn't going to defeat us.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Defends Special Interest Cash  </HEADLINE>
   By EUN-KYUNG KIM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate
who is barnstorming the country on a promise to break the grip of special
interests, on Sunday defended accepting contributions from such groups.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I welcome the support of anyone in the form of $1,000 contributions, but
they know clearly well where I stand, they know clearly I want to break the iron
triangle,'' the Arizona senator said on ABC's ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, whose push to overhaul federal campaign finance laws is the
centerpiece of his campaign, was accused Friday by GOP presidential rival George
W. Bush of engaging in ``Washington double talk'' for attacking special
interests while courting their support.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, recently came under fire
for writing letters on behalf of powerful interests and accepting contributions
from donors who often have business before his committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, stopped short of calling McCain a
hypocrite.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator McCain sees himself and portrays himself as an advent of campaign
finance reform, as somebody who is cleaner than anyone else around the table,
and yet he has accepted contributions and sought contributions from people with
legislation pending before his committee,'' Rove said on CBS' ``Face the
Nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   But McCain said there was nothing hypocritical about accepting contributions
from lobbyists, including some who represent clients with interests before the
committee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to get money from everybody in America and if someone who has a
special interest wants to give to my campaign and they're interested in reform,
that's fine,'' he said. ``The message is clear -- there's going to be a change
in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who plans a major fund-raiser Thursday in Washington that will be
broadcast via satellite to about 30 sites nationwide, said many of his
contributors support his efforts to change the way political campaigns are
financed.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Bush plans to sharpen his message against McCain beginning Monday
with a speech in Delaware that aides say will draw distinctions between the
reforms Bush has achieved as governor of Texas and the lack of progress made by
politicians in Washington, specifically McCain. Bush, who came out swinging at
McCain after losing to him in New Hampshire, plans to touch on a range of issues
-- including education -- to make the case against Washington-style politics and
McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has been on a roll since defeating Bush in the New Hampshire primary
last Tuesday. He said he expected attacks from members of the GOP establishment
who feel threatened by his efforts, and they are now ``coming at me from all
sides.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm like Luke Skywalker trying to get through the Death Star,'' McCain
quipped.

<HEADLINE> Silver to release report on western New York economy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - When it comes to job growth in the state's 62
counties, Cattaraugus County comes in 58th. Erie County comes in 57th. Niagara
56th.
<P>
	   Manufacturing has fallen 42.1 percent since 1970, more than 3,000 health
care jobs have been lost, and retail is at a whimper.
</P>
<P>
	   It's all according to a study the Legislature's top Democrat plans to
release Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Western New York continues to be left out of the benefits the rest of the
country and other regions of our state have been receiving from the historic
national boom," Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said.
</P>
<P>
	   Silver called the 50-page report the first in a series of regional economic
analyses to be prepared by the Assembly's Ways and Means Committee. He said
suggestions for economic recovery would be coming later in the week.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite having plenty of colleges and universities, a low cost of living,
tourist attractions and a skilled labor force, the study found that there are
more people out of jobs in western New York than anywhere else in the state
outside of New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Less lucrative retail jobs are now more plentiful than manufacturing jobs,
but they have been dropping five out of the six years between 1992 and 1998. The
drop in health care jobs comes as more than 8,800 health care jobs have been
added in the rest of the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Compared to Detroit, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Milwaukee, Dayton, and Allentown
- cities hard hit by auto industry restructuring since 1975, Buffalo and Niagara
Falls experienced the slowest employment growth of the past decade.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sadly this comes as no surprise to the working families, stores, businesses
and industries of Buffalo and the surrounding region," Silver said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokeswoman Suzanne Morris said that although the governor had not
yet seen the study, he was well aware that there were problems in upstate New
York. But don't blame the state's Republican leadership, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Western New York suffered heavily under the previous administration which
largely ignored upstate," Morris said. "Over the last 5 years we've taken
forward steps, dragging the Assembly at every turn to turn that around.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're hopeful the Assembly will continue to work with us to improve pace of
economic improvement in New York by passing the governor's job creating budget
initiatives," she said.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Announces Senate Run  </HEADLINE>
   By MARC HUMBERT AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) -- With the president beside her and 2,000 supporters
chanting her name, Hillary Rodham Clinton formally launched her campaign Sunday
to be U.S. senator from New York, a state she has lived in only a month.
</P>
<P>
	   The race for the seat being vacated by fellow Democrat Daniel Patrick
Moynihan is likely to pit Clinton against New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in
what could be one of the most flamboyant political campaigns in memory.
</P>
<P>
	   No other first lady has ever run for public office.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am honored today to announce my candidacy for the U.S. Senate from New
York,'' Clinton said as shouts of ``Hillary! Hillary!'' rang through a
university gymnasium not far from her new home the suburbs north of New York
City.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I may be new to the neighborhood, but I'm not new to your concerns,'' she
said, while President Clinton; her mother, Dorothy; and daughter Chelsea sat
beaming behind her.
</P>
<P>
	   The president is said to be one of his wife's top advisers as she resumes
the career she put aside to help him capture the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Recalling a speech she made at her college commencement at Wellesley in
1969, Clinton said: ``I often return to one thing I said back then, that
politics is the art of making possible what appears to be impossible. I still
believe that today. We can do what seems impossible if we have the vision the
passion and the will to do it together.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton described her commitment to better schools, better health care and
gun control. But she also took pains to describe herself as a ``new Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't believe that government is the source of all our problems or the
solutions to them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Her remarks were preceded by tributes from Moynihan, Sen. Charles Schumer
and Reps. Nita Lowey of Westchester and Charles Rangel of Harlem, who joined her
on stage during her speech and stayed after to shake hands with supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent polls have shown Giuliani with a slight lead over Clinton and running
even with her among women voters. That's a far cry from a year ago when sympathy
was strong from the Monica Lewinsky scandal and polls showed her well ahead of
the mayor.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday morning talk shows, Giuliani reminded viewers of Clinton's late
arrival to New York politics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My record of success comes out of my knowledge, experience, background and
life experience as a lifetime resident of the state,'' he said on CBS' ``Face
the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``How is it that the Democratic Party can't come up with a candidate for the
Senate from the state of New York? What does that say about the Democratic
Party?''
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani has not made a formal campaign announcement, but he came close on
ABC's ``This Week,'' one of the five TV talk shows he appeared on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked if he planned to run, he said: ``Looks that way.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last July at Moynihan's sprawling farm, Clinton kicked off a summer-long
``listening tour'' of the state that extended into the fall and took her from
Broadway to Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
	   By December, she was assuring supporters she intended to run. And in early
January, she moved into a $1.7 million house in suburban Westchester County to
establish residency.
</P>
<P>
	   Political experts said there was good reason Clinton chose the State
University of New York at Purchase to make her announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When duck hunting, one goes where the ducks are,'' Republican consultant
Jay Severin said. ``The independent suburban ducks are the ducks in this
campaign that are yet to be bagged.''
</P>
<P>
	   As of the end of the year, Clinton had raised $8 million and Giuliani, who
started fund raising three months earlier, had raised almost $12 million. It is
expected to be the most expensive Senate race in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton campaign also arranged for about 500 house parties to be held
simultaneously around the state during Clinton's announcement so more than
20,000 supporters could watch on television and then listen in on a conference
telephone call from the candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   In seeking to replace Moynihan, Clinton hopes to make another kind of
history. No woman has ever been independently elected to statewide office in New
York. Former vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro unsuccessfully sought
the Democratic Senate nomination in 1992 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's terrific,'' Ferraro said. ``I think it's taking the role of
the first lady and putting it in the perspective of the 21st century.''

<HEADLINE> Uranium Workers Used in Experiments  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Some workers at a federal uranium processing plant
participated in experiments in the 1950s that had them breathing the radioactive
element, The Courier-Journal reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the participants at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant volunteered
for the tests, but some may not have been informed of the dangers, according to
a draft report by the Department of Energy on an investigation of health, safety
and environmental problems at the western Kentucky plant.
</P>
<P>
	   In one experiment, staff members volunteered to breathe a radioactive gas to
see how quickly uranium was excreted in their urine, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
	   In other tests, a senior staffer drank a solution containing uranium, and at
least 14 workers tested the effectiveness of respirators against radioactive
dust, gas and smoke, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
	   A copy of the report was obtained by The Courier-Journal.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the general dangers of radiation were known at the time of the
experiments, its interactions with the human body were not entirely understood.
Many believed that uranium dust and byproducts of the enrichment process posed
little or no hazard for humans.
</P>
<P>
	   The draft report also says wholesale pollution of the air, ground and water
around the plant -- in quantities that may have been significantly underreported
-- may have exposed residents to radiation.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked about the report, Energy Department officials said only that it
was under review. The Paducah plant has been managed by the department, as well
as by predecessor federal agencies and private contractors.
</P>
<P>
	   The report details a range of problems at Paducah from 1952 to 1990. For
years, investigators found, workers were not always told of the dangers they
faced working with highly toxic radioactive materials. And their families may
have been exposed when workers took contaminated clothing home to be laundered.
</P>
<P>
	   Vast amounts of uranium-contaminated smoke, steam and gas were vented into
the open air -- sometimes secretly in what employees called ``midnight
negatives.'' Inside some buildings, workers were exposed to unplanned releases
and leaks of radioactive gases and hazardous chemicals such as hydrofluoric
acid, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   The department began its review after a lawsuit by three employees alleged
that former plant operators Lockheed Martin Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp. had
profited by lying to the government about the extent of environmental pollution
and worker exposure to radiation.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigators said that although measured exposures to radiation were
high by today's standards, total exposures were comparable to those occurring at
Defense Department facilities, commercial nuclear power plants and other DOE
factories.
</P>
<P>
	   However, documents showed that, during the 1950s, 40 to 60 workers sought
medical help every four months after exposure to accidental releases of uranium,
hydrogen fluoride and fluorine.

<HEADLINE> Bush Accepts Hunting Group's Award  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN GRIFFITH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Ignoring a plea by the Humane Society of the United
States, Texas Gov. George W. Bush has accepted a conservation award from an
organization of trophy hunters that the society says promotes the killing of
rare species.
</P>
<P>
	   Former President Bush accepted the Safari Club International's ``Governor of
the Year'' award on behalf of his son here Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The former president was the keynote speaker at the club's 28th annual
convention. The Republican governor was in Texas resting up for his presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The governor receives awards all the time and it's my understanding
they're recognizing him for his conservation efforts in Texas,'' said Bush
campaign spokesman Scott McClellan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My understanding is the group promotes conservation and wildlife
management, and that's why they're recognizing the governor. That's why he
decided to accept the award.''
</P>
<P>
	   Humane Society Vice President Wayne Pacelle earlier urged Bush to decline
the award, saying he may not be aware that the Safari Club ``promotes
competitive killing of rare wildlife throughout the world.''
</P>
<P>
	   The society, boasting more than 7 million members worldwide, considers the
32,000-member hunting club ``to be a particularly destructive and unethical
trophy hunting organization,'' Pacelle said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This activity is way outside the mainstream of sport hunting,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   McClellan refused to say whether the governor shares the society's concerns
about the killing of rare species.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Prepares Final Budget Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will send Congress on Monday a $1.84
trillion farewell budget with burgeoning surpluses that the president proposes
using to wipe out the government's public debt, provide modest tax cuts and
greatly expand government health care.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's final budget, for the 2001 fiscal year that begins in October,
projects that the surpluses will total a gigantic $2.9 trillion over the next
decade with $746 billion of that coming from non-Social Security sources,
according to Democrats familiar with Clinton's budget.
</P>
<P>
	   These Democrats said Clinton's budget projects a $179 billion surplus for
the current fiscal year, then dipping slightly to $171 billion in the 2001
budget, before beginning to rise and hitting $457 billion in fiscal 2010.
</P>
<P>
	   Delivery of the budget to Capitol Hill will kick off a bruising battle that
promises to be a replay of last year's fight as Democrats and Republicans put
forward vastly different plans on how to use the surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides would use two-thirds of the surplus, the portion generated by
Social Security, to wipe out the $3.7 trillion of publicly owned debt within the
$5.7 trillion national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   But it is the other third of the surplus where big disagreements will occur
with Republicans pushing for much larger tax cuts and less government spending
that Clinton seeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither side can even agree on the size of the non-Social Security surplus.
The $746 billion surplus being projected by Clinton is less than half the $1.9
trillion best-case figure the Congressional Budget Office projected last month.
</P>
<P>
	   The difference is that the CBO assumes less government spending than
Clinton, who in his budget will formally propose loosening the tight spending
limits that were enacted as part of the 1997 balanced budget agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton would devote all of the $2.17 trillion surplus from Social Security
to paying down debt plus almost half -- $350 billion -- of the $746 billion in
non-Social Security surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   Other parts of the non-Social Security surplus would be used to expand
health care coverage by $91 billion, provide prescription drug benefits through
Medicare and supply a modest range of tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   By expanding the spending limits, Clinton would provide for increased
spending for a host of government programs ranging from education to protecting
the environment.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans in Congress have pledged to fight for more generous tax cuts and
have attacked Clinton's budget for proposing billions of dollars in new
government spending.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's budget will offer $350 billion in tax relief to low- and
middle-income taxpayers while proposing close to $100 billion in tax increases,
including a renewed attack on closing corporate loopholes that Congress has
rejected before.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the president forces us to choose between his raising taxes or raiding
Social Security to fund his expansion of government, his budget is dead on
arrival,'' said House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio. ``A lame
duck president should not be able to derail us on the way toward retiring the
national debt, tax relief and saving Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans are putting together a rival tax-cutting strategy that seeks to
pass a variety of smaller targeted tax cut bills instead of the huge $792
billion tax cut package that Clinton vetoed last year.
</P>
<P>
	   John Podesta, the president's chief of staff, said on ``Fox News Sunday''
that the GOP strategy apparently was ``just take the tax bill that the president
vetoed last year, take the staples out of it and try to pass it one page at a
time. ... It was a bad bill last year, and doing it that way is a bad thing this
year.''
</P>
<P>
	   This year's massive five-volume set of budget documents, which will go on
public sale and be transmitted to Congress on Monday, will feature a
white-on-black cover scheme to underscore that after 29 straight years of
deficits, the budget is now in the black.
</P>
<P>
	   While Clinton declared after the Republicans took control of Congress in
1994 that the ``era of big government is over,'' his final budget, perhaps with
a view to his legacy, pushes an activist agenda. It also provides a number of
issues that Democrats are likely to campaign on in the fall, especially if
Republican votes keep them from being enacted. Some, such as gun control and
health care, mirror programs Vice President Al Gore is pushing in his
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration already has released much of its budget in piecemeal
fashion over the past month, hoping to gain maximum exposure for the
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget includes tax breaks to help families afford college and pay the
cost of long-term care for sick relatives. The president also wants to help
alleviate the inequity in the current tax code that penalizes married couples,
but his remedy offers less relief than the Republican plan's would.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also is proposing to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit for the
working poor to include an additional 6.4 million low-income families.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget also proposes the biggest expansion in government health care
since the creation of Medicare by providing health insurance to at least five
million of the 44 million Americans not now covered.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also wants to expand Medicare to help the elderly pay
prescription drug bills and allow persons 55 to 65 to buy into the program.

<HEADLINE> Virus Sends Sen. Kennedy to Hospital  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Edward Kennedy was hospitalized Sunday for a viral
illness that left him with back and shoulder pain, an aide said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennedy, D-Mass., ran a fever and had a cough Saturday evening and was
driven to Sibley Memorial Hospital the following morning, said his spokesman,
Will Keyser.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He is in good spirits, he is resting comfortably and he felt good enough
to watch the America's Cup race last night,'' Keyser said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Kennedy, who turns 68 on Feb. 22, will remain overnight for
observation.
</P>
<P>
	   Fern Stone, a spokeswoman at Sibley, referred all calls about the senator to
Kennedy's office.
</P>
<P>
	   The senator's son, Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., was at a House Democratic
retreat in Hot Springs, Va., when he learned about his father. The younger
Kennedy canceled his plans and flew back to Washington, said his press
secretary, Larry Berman.

<HEADLINE> Israel Court Denies Spy's Request  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BY JACK KATZENELL Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's Supreme Court on Sunday refused to intervene to
help convicted American spy Jonathan Pollard win his release from a U.S. prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Pollard, a former civilian analyst for the U.S. Navy, was convicted of
espionage in 1985 for giving Israel tens of thousands of top-secret documents.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel has acknowledged that Pollard was its agent and every Israeli prime
minister has asked the United States to release him.
</P>
<P>
	   In its ruling, the Supreme Court rejected Pollard's request to appoint a
judge to oversee the government's efforts to release him, saying it is not the
function of the judiciary to supervise the day-to-day running of the government.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-judge panel said it ``believes that the government will fulfill
its obligations to take care of the needs of the petitioner and do what is
necessary to secure his release from prison.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pollard's wife, Esther, who was present in court, said she was dismayed by
the court's ``cavalier attitude'' to her husband's plight.
</P>
<P>
	   Pollard contended in his petition to the high court that since taking
office, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has cut off contact with him and has
not worked to release him.
</P>
<P>
	   Esther Pollard has accused President Clinton of reneging on a deal to
release her husband in 1998 as part of an Israeli-Palestinian peace accord
brokered in Wye River, Md. Clinton has said he is reviewing a clemency request.
</P>
<P>
	   The court also turned down a request to grant Pollard $1.75 million in legal
expenses as well as a request that it order the government to release documents
related to the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Pollard is being held at a federal prison in Butner, N.C.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Switches Roles With Wife  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) -- Not a word.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton grinned, chuckled, clapped and leapt to his feet in
admiration as his wife made her formal political debut Sunday, but the president
was a silent partner. For perhaps the first time since he became president seven
years ago, the famously talkative president attended a political rally and
didn't go near the podium.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton felt strongly that Hillary
Rodham Clinton's Senate announcement should be a solo affair.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Perhaps he was adapting the classic advice to the mother of the groom --
shut up and wear beige,'' said Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton chose a dark suit and sat behind his wife as she made her candidacy
official at the state University of New York at Purchase. He appeared to be
bursting with pride and a little nervous, too.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton helped with the 30-minute speech, which contained scant reference to
him. A naturally polished speaker, he also apparently coached his less-practiced
wife on her delivery.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking rather like a parent at a child's piano recital, he leaned forward
and nodded along as Mrs. Clinton delivered key lines.
</P>
<P>
	   He was first on his feet to applaud when she said the words: ``I am honored
today to announce my candidacy for the United States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before her speech, the partisan crowd watched an 18-minute video biography
of Mrs. Clinton's life. Her husband's name was never mentioned, although he
appeared briefly and has a one line speaking part in the production.
</P>
<P>
	   The video is the work of Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, the Hollywood television
producer, whose soft focus video about Clinton himself called, ``A Man from
Hope,'' introduced the candidate during the 1992 convention.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton has taken other pains recently to separate herself from the
White House, something pollsters say she must do to win in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   She largely moved out of the White house last month and spends most of her
time campaigning.
</P>
<P>
	   Her new campaign website, Hillary2000.org, refers to her simply as
``Hillary,'' with nary a mention of the first couple's shared last name.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesmen for both the president and the first lady were vague last week
about Clinton's role in Sunday's careful script.
</P>
<P>
	   As it turned out, Clinton played even less of a role in his wife's campaign
event than she usually has played in his. New York Democratic Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, whose job Mrs. Clinton hopes to take in November, made the
introduction, while the president remained seated behind him.
</P>
<P>
	   After the speech, Clinton, the first lady, daughter Chelsea, and Mrs.
Clinton's mother, Dorothy Rodham, greeted supporters and campaign workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked by a television crew about his wife's performance on stage, the
president said: ``She was fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was to attend political fund-raisers for his wife later Sunday, but
on Monday they return to parallel universes.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, the president, had a busy day planned, beginning with an early
flight back to Washington to present his final presidential budget proposals to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, the Senate candidate, planned to begin a weeklong campaign swing
through upstate New York.

<HEADLINE> Hijacked Afghan Plane Leaves Moscow  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY RENFREW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- The Afghan passenger airliner forced by hijackers on a tense
journey across Central Asia and Europe left Moscow early Monday after nine
passengers were freed.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane's destination was not immediately known, but a spokesman for
Russia's Federal Security Service said the hijackers had demanded European
flight maps before leaving.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate indication of why the nine passengers were released,
security service spokesman Alexander Zdanovich told reporters at Moscow's
Sheremetyevo-1 airport. He said the hijackers had made no political demands.
</P>
<P>
	   Similar releases took place at the plane's previous refueling stops in
Kazakstan and Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
	   None of the people aboard the Boeing 727 belonging to Afghanistan's Ariana
Airlines had been harmed, Zdanovich said, although it remained unclear how many
people were aboard. Russian news reports said there were 131 passengers and nine
crew before the release in Moscow, but other sources said there were as many as
160 aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   The passengers included 20 women and 23 or 24 children, said Zdanovich. All
the passengers released in Moscow were male.
</P>
<P>
	   Zdanovich said the hijackers had asked only for food, for the plane's
toilets to be cleaned and for refueling. He said the plane was headed for
Western Europe, but had no specifics; Russian news agencies, citing unspecified
sources, said the hijackers were considering London, Madrid, Paris and
Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane, carrying at least 140 people including the hijackers, landed in
Moscow about 9:20 p.m. Sunday. Trucks and buses loaded with elite commando
teams, police and rescue workers converged on the airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Sniper teams moved into Sheremetyevo-1, the terminal where the plane landed,
and security was heavy in the area. Afghan diplomats arrived at the airport
about 90 minutes after the plane landed and Russian news agencies said they were
in negotiations with the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
	   One diplomat who declined to give his name said the hijackers were seeking
the release of a prisoner from the Afghan city of Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
	   An emergency official in Kazakstan, where the plane landed before heading to
Moscow Sunday morning, said there were 20 hijackers aboard the Boeing 727, but
three passengers who were released in Kazakstan said eight to 10 hijackers were
aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   Ten passengers were released in Uzbekistan, the hijacked plane's first stop,
according to an Afghan opposition spokesman, identified only as Abdullah. A
further three were released in Kazakstan.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijacking comes six weeks after an eight-day hijacking of an Indian
Airlines plane ended peacefully in southern Afghanistan. The hijackers in that
case freed their hostages after India released three pro-Kashmiri militants from
jail.
</P>
<P>
	   Abdullah denied that the Afghan opposition was responsible for the latest
hijacking, saying, ``We condemn any act of terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Afghan media earlier had speculated that the hijackers wanted the release of
opposition figure Ismail Khan, a former regional governor who has been held
since 1997 by Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement. He reportedly is being held
in Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia does not recognize the Taliban and the Afghan diplomats in Russia
have ties to the opposition.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ariana Airlines plane was seized earlier Sunday while on a domestic
flight from the Afghan capital, Kabul, to the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
After four hours in the Uzbek capital, Tashkent, it took off for Kazakstan.
</P>
<P>
	   The aircraft next landed in the northern Kazak city of Aktyubinsk, where
Kazak special forces surrounded it and officials negotiated with the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane was forced to land in Aktyubinsk because of a leak in its right
fuel tank, the Kazak spokesman said. It was not immediately known whether the
leak was fixed while on the ground in Kazakstan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Afghan state-run airline is under international sanctions and is not
permitted to fly international routes.
</P>
<P>
	   Ariana has four aging Boeing 727 aircraft and five Russian-made Antonov
aircraft. Maintenance conditions are considered extremely poor in the country,
which is bankrupt and has been battered by more than 20 years of war. The
Taliban, who rule 90 percent of Afghanistan, are fighting their northern-based
enemies on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations imposed sanctions against Afghanistan's state-owned
airline in November to punish the ruling Taliban movement for its refusal to
extradite suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden, who has been living in
Afghanistan for the past few years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Taliban say they won't turn over bin Laden because Afghan culture and
tradition make it impossible to hand over a guest to his enemies.

<HEADLINE> Pfizer to acquire Warner-Lambert; AHP gets largest breakup fee  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - In a deal that will create the world's second-largest
drug company, Pfizer Inc. will announce Monday it is acquiring Warner-Lambert
Co. for $84.4 billion in stock, according to people familiar with the
negotiations. The combined company's medicine cabinet includes the impotence
treatment Viagra and Lipitor, the blockbuster cholesterol fighting drug.
<P>
	   The deal will mark the end of a takeover battle that started in November
when Warner-Lambert announced a $58.3 billion merger with its New Jersey
neighbor American Home Products Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer will pay American Home Products $1.8 billion - the largest breakup
fee in history - for the company to sever its contract with Warner-Lambert.
American Home Products, which makes the hormone replacement drug Premarin,
decided not to wage a lengthy and expensive court battle to stop Pfizer,
according to a person involved in the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home Products could use the windfall as a cushion against
larger-than-expected verdicts or settlements related to its fen-phen diet drug
combination. The company has already set aside $4.7 billion for such claims.
</P>
<P>
	   But while Pfizer won its hostile bid for Warner-Lambert, relations between
the top executives are anything but friendly. Warner-Lambert's chairman and
chief executive officer, Lodewijk J.R. de Vink, will leave the company after the
deal closes in four to six months, said the sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   De Vink, 54, who joined Warner-Lambert in 1988, became chairman and chief
executive officer in April. Under the company's golden parachute plan, de Vink's
will get three years' salary and bonus (before he became CEO he made about $2
million a year), and his stock options have a market value of $245 million,
based on Pfizer's offer.
</P>
<P>
	   De Vink won't be the only one out of a job. Pfizer also is expected to cut
hundreds of jobs - most of them from Warner-Lambert - from their combined work
force of 87,400 as the two companies unite their sales and research teams as
well as consolidate administration jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   The combined company will keep Pfizer's name and headquarters in New York.
Warner-Lambert's headquarters in Morris Plains, N.J., will become the base for
the consumer products division, which will include household names like
Listerine, Rolaids, Bain de Soleil and Visine.
</P>
<P>
	   The newly merged company will have sales of $29 billion, profits of $4.9
billion and a research budget of $4.7 billion. Still, the new-and-improved
Pfizer will only control about 6.3 percent of the world's medicine market,
assuaging most antitrust concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   This is the third pharmaceutical takeover as many months. Last month, Glaxo
Wellcome PLC struck a $76 billion deal to acquire SmithKline Beecham PLC to
become the world's largest pharmaceutical company. In December, Pharmacia &AMP;
Upjohn Co. announced a $27 billion merger with Monsanto Co.
</P>
<P>
	   And the trend likely will continue.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home Products is expected to find another partner soon. The company
is expected to sell its agricultural chemical business by June, according to a
person familiar with the company's plans. That should make American Home
Products a more attractive takeover target.
</P>
<P>
	   The agricultural division, known as American Cyanamid, is expected to fetch
about $3 billion. Prospective buyers include Dow Chemical Co., E.I. Dupont De
Nemours &AMP; Co. and in Europe, Bayer AG and BASF AG.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the terms of Pfizer's deal with Warner-Lambert. Pfizer will issue 2.75
shares of its stock, worth about $98.31 based on Friday's closing price, for
each share of Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert shareholders will own 38 percent of the combined company.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldier Killed in Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
   By BUTROS WANNA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) -- A roadside bombing in southern Lebanon on Sunday
killed one Israeli soldier and injured seven others, prompting Israel to vow
retaliation against the Muslim guerrillas who claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli army said 1st Sgt. Jedidia Gefen, 20, was killed during the
evacuation of the area following the bombing, when Hezbollah fighters fired on
the troops. The death was the fifth Israeli fatality in southern Lebanon in less
than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   The bombing is certain to escalate a week of fighting -- the worst in six
months -- which has claimed the lives of three Israeli soldiers, the No. 2
officer in the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army militia and a Hezbollah
guerrilla.
</P>
<P>
	   An Israeli soldier also was killed in a guerrilla rocket attack Jan. 25.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past, Israel has sometimes responded to such attacks by launching
commando operations targeting guerrilla leaders deep inside Lebanon. Amid fears
that Israeli threats of retaliation could mean more such operations, the
Lebanese government put its armed forces on ``the highest state of alert,'' a
security official said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The official said the move was made ``in anticipation of any possible
Israeli aggression.'' The orders applied to all army and police personnel and
their weapon formations -- units numbering about 85,000 that largely stayed out
of the fighting between Hezbollah and Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   Hezbollah claimed responsibility for Sunday's attack near Blatt, three miles
from the Israeli border, saying the group targeted an Israeli foot patrol of
nine soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   As an Israeli unit rushed to evacuate the patrol, fighters pounded the area
with rockets, inflicting more casualties, a Hezbollah statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   The attack was ``in retaliation to repeated Israeli aggression,'' the
statement issued in Beirut said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hezbollah is trying to oust 1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500 SLA militiamen
from a buffer zone Israel established in 1985 to protect its northern towns from
guerrilla attacks. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has pledged to withdraw
from South Lebanon by July, and he reiterated that Sunday despite the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli army said seven soldiers were wounded, four of them seriously.
The casualties were evacuated by military helicopters to hospitals in Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses in government-controlled territory facing the Israeli-occupied
zone said Hezbollah supporters broadcast details of the attack over loudspeakers
from cars and mosques.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak promised retaliation, increasing the specter of more tit-for-tat
attacks along the last active Arab-Israeli warfront.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel ``will retaliate for any attack coming from south Lebanon and if it
is Hezbollah, then we will hit Hezbollah,'' Barak said in Jordan following talks
with King Abdullah II.
</P>
<P>
	   The largest partner in Barak's coalition, the ultra-Orthodox Jewish Shas
party, demanded Sunday that peace talks with Syria be suspended until Damascus
stops Hezbollah from attacking Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak needs Shas' support to push a peace treaty with Syria through
parliament and a national referendum.
</P>
<P>
	   In light of the escalation in Lebanon, Shas Health Minister Shlomo Benizri
told Israel TV, ``Why do we have to make an agreement with Syria?''
</P>
<P>
	   Israel maintains that Hezbollah could not operate without the consent of
Syria, which wields enormous power in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday Hezbollah's leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, threatened to fire
Katyusha rockets at Israel in retaliation for Israeli airstrikes on a southern
Lebanon village that wounded seven civilians and a commander of the guerrilla
group on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Nasrallah said the strike violated an April 1996 agreement designed to
protect civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   The stepped-up Hezbollah attacks and increased Israeli losses further
complicate efforts to get Syrian-Israeli peace talks going again. Barak had
demanded that Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, rein in Hezbollah before
the U.S.-brokered talks resume.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli army in Jerusalem kept news of Sunday's guerrilla attack under
wraps, as is usually the case until the deceased's next of kin are notified.
</P>
<P>
	   An Israeli army spokesman, however, confirmed there was an incident in
southern Lebanon in which several Israeli soldiers were wounded. The spokesman
did not provide further details.
</P>
<P>
	   A few hours after the guerrilla attack, Israel sent its jets to fire several
missiles in two retaliatory bombing raids on Jebal al-Botom, an area on the edge
of the occupied zone from which guerillas are thought to launch their attacks.
There was no word on casualties from the afternoon airstrikes, which the Israeli
army confirmed.
</P>
<P>
	   Hezbollah said in a statement Sunday that one its fighters, Ahmed al-Ashhab,
28, died Saturday from wounds suffered in recent fighting. It did not elaborate.

<HEADLINE> IRA Dissidents Suspected in Bombing  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Suspected Irish Republican Army dissidents
bombed a rural hotel Sunday -- an attack that caused no reported injuries but
gave Northern Ireland a bitter reminder of the days the province is struggling
to leave behind.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first such attack here since 1998, and it came as international
pressure was building on the mainstream IRA to begin disarming in support of
Northern Ireland's peace accord.
</P>
<P>
	   A caller claiming to be from the Continuity IRA, a small dissident group
opposed to the IRA's 1997 truce, told the BBC in Belfast that bombs had been
left at two hotels in rural County Fermanagh.
</P>
<P>
	   Police evacuated both hotels shortly before a bomb, apparently inside a car,
went off at the rear of Mahon's Hotel in the village of Irvinestown. Police said
they couldn't find any suspicious devices at the other threatened hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   Every political party in Ireland condemned the attack, including the
IRA-allied Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness, a former IRA commander who is education
minister in Northern Ireland's power-sharing Cabinet, said the Continuity IRA
was ``unrepresentative of Irish republicans'' and should ``disband
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the blast underscored demands from the province's major Protestant
party, the Ulster Unionists, for an immediate start to IRA disarmament.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We cannot allow any paramilitary organization, republican or (pro-British)
loyalist, to remain in existence with illegal guns and explosives,'' said Ken
Maginnis, Fermanagh's Ulster Unionist member of British Parliament. ``Even if
they adhere to their own cease-fires, their weapons of war will inevitably end
up in the hands of dissidents.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Continuity IRA began bombing targets after the IRA called a 1994
cease-fire. The shadowy group's sporadic attacks have caused only minor injuries
and no deaths, but it has never called a formal cease-fire. Only last month,
police in the neighboring Irish Republic arrested a suspected Continuity IRA
activist in possession of a van loaded with weapons and explosives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There will always be people who try to undermine the peace process,'' a
spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair's Downing Street office said in London.
``We will do what we can to make sure they do not succeed.''
</P>
<P>
	   The bombing came as Protestants and Catholics are hoping for the salvation
of Northern Ireland's peace process -- and for an unprecedented leap of faith
from the IRA. The IRA's refusal to say whether it will disarm has left the
province's new government teetering on the brink of collapse.
</P>
<P>
	   Blair emphasized Sunday that he wants to gain a disarmament commitment from
the IRA this week. Otherwise, Britain intends to take back the powers it
transferred in December to the province's new Protestant-Catholic coalition
Cabinet in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
	   That transfer of power was a key part of the 1998 Good Friday peace accord.
It ended 27 years of direct rule of the province from London.
</P>
<P>
	   Rendering the four-party coalition powerless would decrease the risk that
its major Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, would collapse the Cabinet
outright by resigning.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, the Ulster Unionists accepted the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party as
Cabinet colleagues on condition that IRA disarmament follow. But the province's
disarmament commission reported Jan. 31 that its two months of secret
discussions with IRA figures had produced no concrete gains.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, IRA commanders said British and Ulster Unionist pressure
wouldn't spur them to disarm -- but hinted they might begin disarming someday,
saying for the first time that ``the issue of arms needs to be dealt with in an
acceptable way.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein said the IRA's statement represented a significant change in
policy. But Blair said it didn't answer the question of whether the IRA will
disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the moment when we simply need to know,'' Blair told a conference
of his governing Labor Party in Blackpool, northwest England. ``Because this
issue of decommissioning is not going to change, it's not going to disappear,
it's not going to alter in its essentials. It's just got to be confronted and
resolved now.''

<HEADLINE> Ramsey Father Denies Suspect List  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- In his only sworn testimony since his daughter was
killed in 1996, John Ramsey denied reports that he and his wife gave police a
list of suspects in the murder of 6-year-old JonBenet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unfortunately, a lot of people had keys to our house -- contractors,
plumbers, cleaning ladies, neighbors,'' Ramsey said in a deposition. ``We
honestly don't think we know anybody that could be this evil.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ramsey gave the deposition in October 1998 as part of a libel suit filed by
Boulder photographer Stephen Miles, who had sued Ramsey and the National
Enquirer after an October 1997 article referred to Miles as a drug addict and a
pedophile.
</P>
<P>
	   The article promised an ``Exclusive interview with the man Ramseys say
killed JonBenet.'' It quoted a ``source close to the Ramseys'' but didn't quote
Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit was dismissed and the judge unsealed Ramsey's 110-page
deposition in November. The Daily Camera reported its contents Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We never gave a list to the police of people we thought could be
responsible,'' said Ramsey, who has otherwise never given sworn testimony during
the investigation into his daughter's death.
</P>
<P>
	   Ramsey was asked if he suspected anyone of having killed his daughter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let me say two things. One, when you have something like this happen in
your life, you lose trust. Virtually anyone. So do you suspect everyone? Yes,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Secondly, I try to remind myself to not rush to judgment, as obviously
happened in this case, and I don't want to be guilty of that myself.
Unfortunately, you suspect everyone.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ramsey said his daughter's death took an emotional toll and that he was
taking an anti-depressant medication at the time of the deposition.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton announces Senate candidacy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) - Surrounded by family and almost 2,000 cheering
supporters, Hillary Rodham Clinton declared Sunday "I may be new to your
neighborhood, but I'm not new to your concerns," as she launched her campaign
for senator from the state she has only called home for a month.
<P>
	   "I am honored today to announce my candidacy for the U.S. Senate from New
York," she said as the crowd in a state university gymnasium chanted "Hillary!
Hillary!"
</P>
<P>
	   Recalling a speech she made at her college commencement at Wellesley in
1969, she said: "I often return to one thing I said back then: That politics is
the art of making possible what appears to be impossible. I still believe that
today. We can do what seems impossible if we have the vision the passion and the
will to do it together."
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton, her mother Dorothy and daughter Chelsea were on one side
of the stage as she spoke, along with U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. On the
other side were U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, and U.S. Reps. Nita Lowey of
Westchester and Charles Rangel of Harlem, who had spoke in tribute to the first
lady.
</P>
<P>
	   Behind them all hung a red, white and blue "Hillary" banner - no last name,
just "Hillary" - bearing the address for her Website, www.Hillary2000.org.
</P>
<P>
	   In a switch of their usual roles, the president played the supportive spouse
while the first lady took center stage. Although the president helped write her
speech, he did not speak during the event.
</P>
<P>
	   Over and over again, Clinton pledged "I'll be on your side" as she described
her commitment to better schools, better health care, environmentalism and gun
control.
</P>
<P>
	   She went on to outline her support for a wide variety of other issues:
reviving the economy of upstate New York, working for passage of a comprehensive
nuclear test ban treaty and support of peace from Northern Ireland to Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   But she also took pains to describe herself as "a new Democrat" who supports
balanced budgets and welfare reform. "I don't believe that government is the
source of all our problems or the solutions to them," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The race for the Senate seat being vacated by Moynihan is expected to pit
Clinton against Rudolph Giuliani, the Republican mayor of New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has often criticized the mayor's combative style, and while she
didn't mention him by name Sunday, she pledged to would work against "the
divisive politics of revenge and retribution. ... I'll work to lift people up,
not push them down."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also tried to get a little New York swagger into her delivery.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know it's not always going to be an easy campaign, but - hey! THIS is New
York," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   No other first lady has ever run for public office and in doing so, Clinton
steps out of the long and scandal-scarred shadow of her husband. Bill Clinton is
said to be one of her major advisers as she resumes the career she put aside to
help him capture the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   There is little real doubt that Clinton will face Giuliani, but the mayor
has not made his own formal campaign announcement. About the closest he's come
was on ABC's "This Week," one of five TV talk shows he appeared on Sunday. When
asked if he planned to run, he said, "Looks that way."
</P>
<P>
	   Recent polls have shown Giuliani with a slight lead over Clinton and running
even with her among women voters. That's a far cry from a year ago when talk was
fresh about a possible Clinton campaign that many doubted would ever come to
pass. Sympathy was strong from the Monica Lewinsky scandal and polls showed the
first lady well ahead of the mayor if she did run.
</P>
<P>
	   Five months later, she formed a Senate committee and began raising money for
the race. At Moynihan's sprawling farm on a bright July day she kicked off a
summer-long "listening tour" of the state that bled over into the fall and took
her from Broadway to Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
	   By December, she was assuring supporters she intended to run. In early
January, she moved into a $1.7 million house in suburban Westchester County just
north of New York City to establish residency in the state she decided to adopt.
President Clinton said he plans to move there when he leaves the White House at
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Other than a closeness to her new home, political experts said there was
good reason for Clinton to stage her announcement in Purchase, which lies in
Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
	   "When duck hunting, one goes where the ducks are," Republican consultant Jay
Severin explained. "The independent suburban ducks are the ducks in this
campaign that are yet to be bagged."
</P>
<P>
	   In statewide races, suburban voters from Westchester County and Long Island
are considered a key to success and a Marist College poll released Friday showed
Giuliani leading in the suburbs, 56 percent to 34 percent, his strongest showing
in any region of the state.
</P>
<P>
	   While Giuliani dismissed the Clinton announcement as "a Hollywood type of
thing," a top Democratic strategist not connected to the Clinton campaign said
it served a real purpose, especially for a famous out-of-towner still viewed
skeptically by many New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It makes people understand this is for real and not a joke. It's not a game
anymore," Hank Sheinkopf said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton campaign arranged for about 500 house parties to be held
simultaneously around the state for more than 20,000 supporters who would watch
the announcement on television and then listen in on a conference telephone call
from the candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Clinton was to fly to Buffalo to begin a cross-state tour that
would take her to Rochester on Tuesday, Syracuse on Wednesday and Albany on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   As of the end of last year, she had raised $8 million and Giuliani, who
started fund raising three months earlier, had raised almost $12 million. It is
expected to be the most expensive Senate race in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
	   In seeking to replace Moynihan in the Senate, Clinton hopes to make another
kind of history. No woman has ever been independently elected to statewide
office in New York. Former vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro
unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Senate nomination in 1992 and 1998.

<HEADLINE> Elian Won't Appear in Internet Ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives have turned down an offer for
the 6-year-old Cuban boy to appear in a national advertisement for an Internet
search site.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Elian is not going to be appearing in any ads,'' family spokesman Armando
Gutierrez said Sunday. ``The family will not allow Elian to be used for anything
and have turned down every offer that's been made.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wieden &AMP; Kennedy, an advertising firm based in Portland, Ore., said in
issues of Time magazine that go on sale Monday that it was making a pitch to
Elian's U.S. relatives about using the boy's image in a national spot for
AltaVista, one of the oldest Internet search engines.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was rescued Thanksgiving Day after clinging to an inner tube for two
days following a shipwreck that killed his mother.
</P>
<P>
	   The first-grader has been living in Miami with his great-uncle Lazaro
Gonzalez. His U.S. relatives hope to keep him despite an immigration order to
send him back.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno last week, Elian's father, who
wants his son returned to him in Cuba, said he was concerned about the ``present
condition'' of his son.
</P>
<P>
	   Juan Miguel Gonzalez wrote: ``The boy has been forced to pose for TV cameras
day and night with people he does not know and who are unscrupulously
manipulating him.''

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton starts building grassroots network with house parties  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) - Nancy Denofio placed her speakerphone on
the arm of her couch and waited, her guests from this famed New York resort town
quietly talking among themselves as they snacked on cake and punch around the
dining room table.
<P>
	   In 600 other houses in New York state, people were doing the same. As
Hillary Rodham Clinton was announcing her U.S. Senate candidacy in Purchase,
activists around the state gathered their friends, family and future Clinton
campaign workers in their homes to watch the first lady's announcement on
television and begin setting up a grassroots network for her.
</P>
<P>
	   Denofio, who worked on President Clinton's New Hampshire campaign steering
committee in 1995, took advantage of the lull to start passing out volunteer and
pledge cards, but a few seconds later, Clinton's voice came from the telephone.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to thank all of you," said the first lady, on a cell phone only
minutes after she announced that she would run for New York's U.S. Senate seat.
"I want to start by thanking the nearly 600 families and individuals who have
hosted these house parties, opening your homes to your friends and your
neighbors to hear my announcement."
</P>
<P>
	   But the first lady wasn't just talking to people in Denofio's home across
from the Saratoga Performing Arts Center. She was conferenced in to all of the
homes at the same time. "I thought it was a misprint when I heard that there
were 25,000 people at all of these house parties but it seems that there is,"
Clinton said. "It is because of your interest and your commitment to this
campaign that I think we have such a great beginning today."
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady soon hung up - cell phone problems, she said - and the
50-year-old Denofio, a former New Hampshire Clinton/Gore campaign worker, went
back to work pitching volunteer work for the Clinton campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're trying to reach the common person," she said. "While we're also
trying to raise money, it's not about the money. It's about the people instead."
</P>
<P>
	   Denofio had about 25 people in her home during the speech - a cheer broke
out around the dinner table as Mrs. Clinton acknowledged the house parties - and
no one left without signing a mailing list.
</P>
<P>
	   And this isn't the only Hillary party going on here. Across town, Saratoga
Springs' Democratic Mayor Ken Klotz, who upset a two-term incumbent Republican
last year, held one as well.
</P>
<P>
	   This is a unique way of doing this," said Denofio, daughter of former
longtime Republican Schenectady Mayor Frank Duci. "We need the workers and the
volunteers and what better place to find them than from your family and friends?
We hope to have a strong network here for Hillary."
</P>
<P>
	   Denofio shares a similar problem with Clinton - Clinton is a new New Yorker,
Denofio's a new Saratogian, having just moved there in November. When quizzing
her guests about where Mrs. Clinton should visit while in Saratoga Springs,
Denofio suggested Starbucks. An immediate cry went up among the group for her to
be taken to a local coffee shop called Uncommon Grounds instead.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sorry," Denofio laughed. "I just moved here."

simultaneously around the state for more than 20,000 supporters who would watch
the announcement on television and then listen in on a conference telephone call
from the candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Clinton was to fly to Buffalo to begin a cross-state tour that
would take her to Rochester on Tuesday, Syracuse on Wednesday and Albany on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   As of the end of last year, she had raised $8 million and Giuliani, who
started fund raising three months earlier, had raised almost $12 million. It is
expected to be the most expensive Senate race in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
	   In seeking to replace Moynihan in the Senate, Clinton hopes to make another
kind of history. No woman has ever been independently elected to statewide
office in New York. Former vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro
unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Senate nomination in 1992 and 1998.

<HEADLINE> Texas Cleric Denies Terror Links  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Lawyers for a Muslim leader in Texas denied accusations by
federal prosecutors that he served as an intermediary for Osama bin Laden's
suspected terrorist network.
</P>
<P>
	   Moataz Al-Hallak, imam of the Islamic Society of Arlington mosque, provided
only religious advice to a pilot on how to handle the purchase of a small jet in
accord with Islamic law, said his lawyer, Stan Cohen.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane crashed in the early 1990s while being used by one of bin Laden's
businesses, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Al-Hallak was questioned about a jet purchase by a New York federal grand
jury investigating bin Laden's activities, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Al-Hallak has not been charged with any crime.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The whole thing is crap,'' Cohen said in Sunday's Dallas Morning News.
``If they had anything on Al-Hallak, they would have indicted him a long time
ago.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a late December court filing, prosecutors cited the plane deal to support
their charge that Al-Hallak ``provided cover'' for the business activities of
Wadih El Hage, a bin Laden associate. They contend that Al-Hallak ``facilitated
the purchase of a jet plane for bin Laden after bin Laden relocated to the
Sudan.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire exile, is accused of masterminding the 1998
bombing of two U.S. embassies in Africa. The attacks in Kenya and Tanzania
killed 224 people, including 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   El Hage, a friend of Al-Hallak and member of his mosque, is jailed in New
York on federal charges of aiding an alleged international conspiracy by bin
Laden to murder Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said Al-Hallak shuns violence, does not know bin Laden and has not
been associated with any of his enterprises.
</P>
<P>
	   Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in New York,
declined to comment on the airplane transaction.
</P>
<P>
	   El Hage has pleaded innocent but remains jailed without bond and is
restricted from contacting Al-Hallak.
</P>
<P>
	   Sam Schmidt, an attorney for El Hage, said his client's contacts with
Al-Hallak did not involve bin Laden's operations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In our papers, we indicated that the communications between El Hage and
Al-Hallak had nothing to do with terrorism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors have called Al-Hallak ``a contact point for El Hage's
co-conspirators'' and cited documents linking the two men. They also mentioned
that Al-Hallak had obtained ``business equipment'' for El Hage including a
combat knife and professional lock-picking sets.

<HEADLINE> Haider OKs Holocaust Compensation  </HEADLINE>
   By ROLAND PRINZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Right-wing populist Joerg Haider said Sunday the new
Austrian government in which his party shares power will take appropriate
measures to compensate Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
	   In a televised interview, Haider also promised to moderate his tough talk
and refrain from meddling in the coalition Cabinet. He will not hold a Cabinet
post.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider's comments came two days after the new government -- made up of his
far-right Freedom Party and the center-right Austrian People's Party -- was
sworn in by a stone-faced President Thomas Klestil. The coalition won approval
despite a wave of protests and moves by the European Union and other nations to
isolate Austria diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider's remarks Sunday were relatively conciliatory compared to the verbal
salvos he has fired recently against foreign leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   He told his interviewers that the previous government led by Austria's
Social Democrats had not really dealt with the Nazi past, including issues like
the compensation of forced laborers. He said the new government would seek to
redress their grievances and those of Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Where we have inflicted great injustice on our Jewish fellow citizens or
wiped out their families, we must take pertinent measures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider won international notoriety for statements praising Adolf Hitler's
``orderly employment'' policies and lauding veterans of the Waffen SS as
``decent people of good character'' -- comments for which he has since
apologized. The rise to power of his party has polarized a society with dark
memories of defeats in two world wars.
</P>
<P>
	   Referring to his past vitriolic attacks on other Austrian leaders, Haider
said his party would refrain from ``oppositional reflexes and unnecessary
sharpness ... and prove that, factually, we can reason very well.''
</P>
<P>
	   However, Haider also said there was need to clarify reports that former
Chancellor Viktor Klima and President Klestil allegedly solicited international
criticism of the new coalition government.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he could ``not rule out'' a parliamentary inquiry should the
suspicions be substantiated.
</P>
<P>
	   An inquiry would be ``in the interest of those (involved) ... so they can
credibly prove .... that they have not committed a kind of political high
treason against Austria,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Austria's new chancellor defended his coalition with Haider's party.
Wolfgang Schuessel said Sunday he is deeply disappointed by what he called
Europe's exaggerated reaction to the inclusion of a far-right party in the
government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yes, Haider is a populist, but he is no Hitler,'' Shuessel said during a
television appearance on Germany's ARD network. ``Why should the big European
Union with 360 million people be afraid of a state of eight million like
Austria? That's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere Sunday, Israeli Interior Minister Natan Sharansky announced that
Haider is banned from entering Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   The ban is the latest formal Israeli protest against the Freedom Party's
inclusion in government. Israel recalled its ambassador from Vienna as soon as
the Austrian coalition was approved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is a very important symbolic act to know that he is not desired in our
country. We hope that other countries follow our example,'' Sharansky said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Haider has expressed an interest in visiting Israel, and that his
party tried unsuccessfully to hire a local public relations firm to spruce up
his image there.
</P>
<P>
	   The Freedom Party's inclusion in government has drawn public protests both
inside and outside Austria. On Sunday night, about 4,000 people marched through
downtown Vienna for a third straight night. Police reported no incidents. In
Paris, about 300 demonstrators gathered outside the Austrian embassy and shouted
``Haider, fascist, collaborator.''

<HEADLINE> Giuliani hits talk show circuit ahead of Mrs. Clinton's  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A few hours before first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
officially declared her candidacy for the U.S. Senate, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
hit the political talk show circuit Sunday, saying he would probably run against
her.
<P>
	   Giuliani's comments - made during a series of national television interviews
- represent the closest he has come to saying he will run.
</P>
<P>
	   "May we assume that you wouldn't be running this Sunday morning gauntlet (of
talk shows) if you were not running?" asked Brit Hume on "Fox News Sunday."
</P>
<P>
	   "Ahhh, yes," the mayor said, momentarily hesitating.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked on ABC's "This Week" if he planned to run, Giuliani responded,
"Looks that way."
</P>
<P>
	   And on CNN's "Late Edition", he said: "Well, there's always doubt.
Otherwise, I might as well make some kind of Hollywood-style announcement of
some kind or other. But right now, it's very much a direction we're moving in.
We've raised over $12 million, we have over 90,000 donors."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani however, said he is unlikely to follow Mrs. Clinton's lead and
declare his candidacy in a grand way because he is superstitious about making
such pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
	   "In 1989, when I ran for mayor, I announced, I lost," he said on Fox. "In
1993, when I didn't announce, I forgot ... In 1997, I decided not to announce
and I won with the largest margin a Republican has ever won in Democratic New
York City. So I said to myself, 'You got to find a better way to do this then,
the big kind of announcement thing."'
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani added, "I have a very demanding full time job and the shorter I can
make this campaign, the better it's going to be ... I do have less time to
campaign (than Clinton)."
</P>
<P>
	   In all, Giuliani's whirlwind schedule Sunday morning took him to five
national political talk shows in about three hours as he scrambled to and from
midtown Manhattan television studios, in addition to attending to his usual
mayoral duties.
</P>
<P>
	   On ABC, he said that although he supports abortion rights, he would not use
anyone's position on abortion as a "litmus test" for whether they should be
appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   He also acknowledged that he and Clinton hold strikingly similar positions
on a number of issues - not only abortion rights, but also the death penalty,
gun control, gay rights and welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are a lot of issues on which we agree," he said. "There are a lot of
issues in which we disagree. I think there's a fundamental difference ... I
believe in solutions that don't necessarily involve building larger government."
</P>
<P>
	   He said his campaign would focus on his success in reducing crime and
welfare and cutting taxes and was unlikely to bring up the Whitewater scandal as
a political issue.
</P>
<P>
	   "I doubt it, unless some relevant facts come out," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani also acknowledged that the line between his campaign and mayoral
staffs had blurred at times, but said the White House has aided Clinton as well.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's always going to be questions about overlap," he said on Fox. "Even
if somebody would argue with us, we've paid (from our campaign funds) for a lot
more."
</P>
<P>
	   Although Clinton has promised to serve her full six-year term if she is
elected, Giuliani refused to do the same.
</P>
<P>
	   And when asked whether he has the proper temperament for the U.S. Senate,
Giuliani said on "Meet the Press" that he had successfully worked with the
overwhelmingly Democratic City Council to pass budgets and other legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   "I tend to be a leader," he said. "I have strong ideas, I push very, very
hard for those ideas...We could use a Senator from New York who is a strong
advocate."

<HEADLINE> N. Korea Threats Overshadow Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL SHIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- U.S. and South Korean officials plan sensitive
arms reduction talks this week amid North Korean threats that it would resume
testing its long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
	   The North Korean threats, made over the weekend, heightened concerns of a
possible arms race between the on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
	   The two-day U.S.-South Korea meeting in Hawaii starting on Tuesday continues
a series of missile nonproliferation talks between the allies which began in
1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest round in Seoul in November made little progress, with South Korea
resisting U.S. efforts to restrict its program to develop a longer-range missile
capable of hitting any part of North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We anticipate progress in this week's talks,'' said Chang Chul-kyun, a
spokesman for Seoul's Foreign Ministry. ``We need a missile strong enough to
provide a deterrent to North Korean threats.''
</P>
<P>
	   Chang said the talks in Hawaii will center on the issue of allowing the
United States to get involved in every stage of South Korean missile
development. Seoul has rejected the U.S. request.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the weekend, North Korea strongly protested South Korea's plan to build
a commercial ``satellite launch station'' by 2005, arguing that it is a disguise
for development of long-range ballistic missiles. The North accused Washington
of supporting the program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The U.S. application of double standards strengthens our will for test and
development of missile,'' the North's foreign news outlet, KCNA, said in a
report.
</P>
<P>
	   North Korea, the report said, will ``immediately and unhesitatingly take a
strong countermeasure'' when the South's ``satellite launch station'' is
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
	   North Korea's missile capability is a matter of grave concern to the United
States. The reclusive country is believed to have missiles capable of reaching
Hawaii and Alaska.
</P>
<P>
	   Last September, North Korea agreed to forgo a test of a newly developed
longer-range missile for the duration of talks with the United States. In
return, Washington lifted some of its half-century-old economic sanctions on
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the moratorium, North Korea rattled nerves in Asia and Washington by
testing a rocket that flew over Japan and landed in the Pacific Ocean in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Talks Suspended  </HEADLINE>
   By SAMAR ASSAD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Palestinian and Israeli peace negotiators suspended talks
Sunday to wait for U.S. proposals to get them back on track, a senior
Palestinian negotiator said.
</P>
<P>
	   The negotiations are aimed at meeting a Feb. 13 deadline for the outline of
a final peace agreement between the two sides. They were suspended on what was
to have been the seventh of 10 days of marathon talks, senior Palestinian
negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are waiting for the Americans, nothing can happen until they come back
with responses,'' Abed Rabbo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Larry Schwartz, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, confirmed the
U.S. efforts. But, he said, the sides should continue direct talks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is the most fruitful way to make progress,'' Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli officials refused to confirm whether the negotiations -- often held
at a secret location -- were indeed canceled. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
visiting King Abdullah II in Jordan, said Israel continued to insist on direct
talks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it is our responsibility with the Palestinians to get to a
solution,'' he said in comments translated from Hebrew by Israeli foreign
ministry officials. Abdullah sent his foreign minister to Cairo later to brief
visiting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on the meeting with Barak.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israelis object to U.S. intervention. Both sides believe President
Clinton is seeking a legacy in his last year in office and is likely to press
Israel into concessions.
</P>
<P>
	   The marathon peace talks are addressing thorny final status issues,
including the future of Jerusalem, refugees and borders between Israel and a
future Palestinian state. But the dispute that led to the suspension centers on
an interim issue -- a 6.1 percent withdrawal from the West Bank that Israel has
promised to carry out this week.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israelis want to hand over mostly uninhabited stretches of West Bank
land to Palestinian control. But the Palestinians want populous Arab suburbs of
Jerusalem, a city both sides claim as their capital.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians say Israel's failure to take their considerations into
account on the less important interim issues makes negotiating the crucial final
status issues impossible.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There has been no accurate, honest implementation of what was signed
between us and Barak himself,'' Arafat told reporters in Gaza after returning
from consultations with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Palestinian and Israeli officials acknowledge now that the Feb. 13
deadline is likely to be missed.
</P>
<P>
	   After the breakdown, both sides began round-the-clock consultations. In
addition to meeting Mubarak, Arafat sent envoys to Jordan and Egypt. Barak flew
to Jordan on Sunday to consult with Abdullah about the breakdown with the
Palestinians, as well as the stalled Syrian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jordan, Barak threatened to retaliate against Muslim militants targeting
Israeli soldiers in South Lebanon, but stressed that he will stick to his
previous pledge to withdraw from the area by July.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whoever hits us in South Lebanon, we will hit him back,'' Barak told
reporters after a two-hour meeting with Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
	   His comments came hours after an Israeli soldier was killed in a roadside
bomb in Israeli-occupied South Lebanon. The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla
group claimed responsibility. The soldier was the fifth Israeli fatality in less
than two weeks in South Lebanon, the last active Israeli-Arab warfront.
</P>
<P>
	   Standing next to Barak on Sunday, Jordanian Prime Minister Abdur-Ra'uf S.
Rawabdeh said King Abdullah reiterated to Barak Jordan's support for Syria,
Lebanon and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
	   A communique issued after the talks said Abdullah urged Barak to ``remove
the obstacles facing the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, because this track
constitutes the core of the peace process.'' The communique, read over Jordan
radio, said Abdullah also urged Barak to give the Syrian talks the care they
deserve because ``the Syrian leadership is committed to achieving a just
peace.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere Sunday, top Egyptian, Jordanian, Palestinian and Israeli officials
met in Cairo to discuss the fate of Palestinians displaced in the 1967 Middle
East war. They said a technical committee on displaced persons will meet
regularly beginning in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides have agreed to discuss the issue multilaterally with Jordan and
Egypt. Jordan and Egypt have hosted hundreds of thousands of displaced
Palestinians since the war, and Israel and the Palestinians disagree about
whether those people should be allowed to return to their homes. Israel has said
it will allow only a few thousand to return since it has already let more than
66,000 people back in since 1994.

<HEADLINE> McCain Defends Special Interest Cash  </HEADLINE>
   By EUN-KYUNG KIM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate
who is barnstorming the country on a promise to break the grip of special
interests, on Sunday defended accepting contributions from such groups.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I welcome the support of anyone in the form of $1,000 contributions, but
they know clearly well where I stand, they know clearly I want to break the iron
triangle,'' the Arizona senator said on ABC's ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, whose push to overhaul federal campaign finance laws is the
centerpiece of his campaign, was accused Friday by GOP presidential rival George
W. Bush of engaging in ``Washington double talk'' for attacking special
interests while courting their support.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, recently came under fire
for writing letters on behalf of powerful interests and accepting contributions
from donors who often have business before his committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, stopped short of calling McCain a
hypocrite.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator McCain sees himself and portrays himself as an advent of campaign
finance reform, as somebody who is cleaner than anyone else around the table,
and yet he has accepted contributions and sought contributions from people with
legislation pending before his committee,'' Rove said on CBS' ``Face the
Nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   But McCain said there was nothing hypocritical about accepting contributions
from lobbyists, including some who represent clients with interests before the
committee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to get money from everybody in America and if someone who has a
special interest wants to give to my campaign and they're interested in reform,
that's fine,'' he said. ``The message is clear -- there's going to be a change
in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who plans a major fund-raiser Thursday in Washington that will be
broadcast via satellite to about 30 sites nationwide, said many of his
contributors support his efforts to change the way political campaigns are
financed.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Bush plans to sharpen his message against McCain beginning Monday
with a speech in Delaware that aides say will draw distinctions between the
reforms Bush has achieved as governor of Texas and the lack of progress made by
politicians in Washington, specifically McCain. Bush, who came out swinging at
McCain after losing to him in New Hampshire, plans to touch on a range of issues
-- including education -- to make the case against Washington-style politics and
McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has been on a roll since defeating Bush in the New Hampshire primary
last Tuesday. He said he expected attacks from members of the GOP establishment
who feel threatened by his efforts, and they are now ``coming at me from all
sides.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm like Luke Skywalker trying to get through the Death Star,'' McCain
quipped.
</P>
<P>
	   In a news conference late Sunday, McCain labeled ``bizarre'' a story in the
Arizona Republic on Sunday that tried to link the senator to a murder
investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was briefly interviewed by a sheriff's deputy because the murdered
man, Ronald J. Bianchi, had once spread rumors about McCain. McCain's campaign
distributed statements from four involved parties, including two county
investigators, who said they believed McCain had nothing to do with Bianchi's
death.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's so bizarre, it speaks for itself,'' McCain said of the story.

<HEADLINE> Republicans demand figures on candidate's travel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Republicans renewed a demand Sunday that Hillary Rodham
Clinton account for costs of her campaign travels, saying the first lady has
made "more than 50" politics-related trips costing taxpayers far more than the
$34,000 her aides say has been reimbursed to the White House.
<P>
	   "It would be a good time for Mrs. Clinton to play fair with the people of
New York," Patricia Harrison, co-chair of the Republican National Committee,
told reporters just before Clinton formally declared herself a candidate for
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want her to try to begin her campaign by telling the truth."
</P>
<P>
	   As first lady, Clinton travels with the security and other trappings of the
White House and her campaign is supposed to reimburse the White House Travel
Office for some of the costs, but neither of those entities has released figures
on how much has been spent or paid back, Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
	   The $34,000 Clinton aides have reported reimbursing is based on the price of
first-class travel. It is not intended to pay the full cost of security for the
first lady, for whom the price of travel soars because of her position as the
president's wife.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Harrison said Clinton's travel expenses don't add up.
</P>
<P>
	   "The taxpayers should not have to foot the bill for her trips," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Harrison said her office had found that Clinton's campaign travels were
"comparable" with those of Vice President Al Gore, which cost him $323,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's probable opponent in the Senate race, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, has
made 14 campaign-type trips costing $150,000, "all flights fully paid for,"
Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
	   On a TV news program earlier in the day, Giuliani himself acknowledged that
the line between his campaign and mayoral staffs had blurred at times, saying:
"There's always going to be questions about overlap."
</P>
<P>
	   Later, asked at another forum about Clinton's travel costs, Giuliani said he
didn't have details and "we'll never know until the White House Travel Office
releases the records."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's very hard to figure out how you do an allocation in which Hillary
Rodham Clinton would pay only $34,000," Giuliani said. "They are going to have
to explain all that."
</P>
<P>
	   A list compiled by the GOP about Clinton's campaign showed 51 appearances by
the first lady between July 7 and Dec. 22, 1999, most of them in New York state.

	   And Harrison said the list was incomplete.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't know how many trips she has taken or how much they cost ... or
whether payment for trips has been made," she said.

<P>

</P>
<P>
	   However, in a statement handed out at Harrison's news conference by a
Clinton campaign volunteer, Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson described the
Republican demands for disclosure as "negative attacks," and "politics - pure
and simple."

<HEADLINE> Bradley Adopts Fighting Strategy  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bruised by losses in Iowa and New Hampshire, Bill Bradley's
presidential campaign is fighting back against the aggressive campaign being
waged by rival Al Gore. Though the strategy is not entirely risk-free, aides
have concluded that Gore's tactics have left Bradley with little choice but to
respond.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Part of our strategy will be drawing a contrast with the vice president,
which we will do increasingly,'' said Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, Bradley wasted little time Sunday resuming his criticisms of Gore,
which he had stepped up in the closing days of the contest in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' the former New Jersey senator renewed
his attack on Gore's fund-raising practices in the last campaign, criticizing
the vice president's 1996 appearance at a Buddhist temple near Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think he has to explain more thoroughly what was happening at the
Buddhist temple, said Bradley. ``If he didn't know it was a fund-raiser then he
was spectacularly naive.''
</P>
<P>
	   He again warned that Republicans will hammer Gore with the issue in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no doubt in my mind that is going to happen,'' Bradley said.
``This is a real risk in the fall. The Democratic Party is taking a risk.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley also has challenged Gore on health care and his record on abortion
and says voters want a ``fresh start,'' a thinly veiled reference to President
Clinton's troubles.
</P>
<P>
	   ``America is about competition, political campaigns are about competition,''
said Bradley, defending his assault. ``If your positions are misrepresented, you
can only take it so long. That's the way I'll continue for the next four or five
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
	   By then, the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination could well be
decided, with a high-stakes showdown in California, New York and other states on
March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   ``California is the neutral ground,'' said Gore campaign spokesman Chris
Lehane.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have to take off on March 7,'' acknowledged Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   One place to begin is within his own party. Much of the Democratic
establishment is behind Gore and one of Bradley's most urgent tasks is winning
back key constituencies like blacks and women who surveys show overwhelmingly
support the vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think I have to communicate better with the Democratic base,'' said
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking to shore up that base, Bradley campaigned Sunday at Allen AME
Church, the state's largest black church, with activist Al Sharpton, who
proposed that the Democratic rivals debate in New York before a mostly black
audience.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley agreed, and aides said they would present the idea to Gore. Lehane
said late Sunday that, ``We're in discussions with the Bradley campaign about
debates and I assume this (proposal) will be part of those discussions.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am not taking the African-American vote for granted,'' said Bradley. ``I
have a lot of friends in New Work. We are building organizations in all the
March 7 states.''
</P>
<P>
	   Aides said Bradley would spend much of his campaign week on the issue of
race relations, heading to Florida to talk about affirmative action and South
Carolina to wade into the fight over the flying of the Confederate battle flag.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted that racial harmony was the topic of the first major speech he gave
as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's who I am, it's what I live,'' said Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Both rivals took a breather over the weekend before launching an intense
burst of campaigning leading up to the big round of March 7 primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley opened his week in New York and was heading to Florida. Gore, too,
was beginning in New York, and both were setting aside ample time for
California.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have to win California,'' Bradley said. ``I know I have some ground to
make up.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore also has focused heavily on California, and has the backing of key
state leaders like Gov. Gray Davis and organized labor. Polls give Gore the edge
there -- a Field poll in mid-January had him ahead 44 percent to 17 percent --
but they can be unreliable as voters begin to tune in to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Countering Bradley, Gore's aides said they will continue the kind of
grassroots, retail campaign that led to success in the opening contests in Iowa
and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Al Gore is a national candidate,'' said Lehane, Gore's spokesman. ``We'll
be campaigning in virtually every state where they have a primary. There's only
one candidate in this race who is undefeated and that's Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
	   For Bradley, the debate has been one of tactics. A core campaign theme has
been his argument that he's a nontraditional candidate who operates above the
charges and countercharges that have become staples of political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   But in the face of early setbacks, Bradley's approach has shifted. Backers
like Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska have urged Bradley -- who picks up Secret
Service protection Monday -- to be more aggressive and respond to Gore -- and
that's becoming apparent.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Prostitutes Paid To Quit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- A state that recently enacted Islamic law is offering
to pay $250 to every prostitute willing to give up her trade and get married.
</P>
<P>
	   The payments, which have so far been accepted by 27 ex-prostitutes, are
designed to help the women set up small businesses, said Karima Ahmed Sani, the
wife of Zamfara state governor Ahmed Sani, who was elected on a campaign to
enact Sharia, or Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
	   Nigerian newspapers have reported that dozens of prostitutes have already
fled the state, fearing prosecution.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Sani said the northern state was also trying to improve education for
girls, many of whom are not sent to school by their families.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Sani signed two bills on January 27 making Zamfara the first
Nigerian state to adopt Sharia, some of its aspects were adopted months ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Women-only taxis have been operating in Zamfara since last year and most
schools now separate boys and girls. Nearly all bars have been closed and almost
every store has been forced to stop selling alcohol.
</P>
<P>
	   Zamfara state authorities have repeatedly assured the Christian community
that Sharia will only apply to Muslims. But they also have said schools and
public transportation eventually will be completely segregated by gender.
</P>
<P>
	   A number of other states in Nigeria's largely Muslim north are considering
following suit.
</P>
<P>
	   Nigeria, a country of 120 million people, is sharply divided along ethnic
and religious lines. Muslims and Christians each make up about one-third of
Nigeria's population.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Militant Calls for Nonviolence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- A leader in the insurgent group that assassinated
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat urged his organization Sunday to quit fighting
and pursue Islamic goals peacefully.
</P>
<P>
	   Osma Ayoub Sidiq said in a statement faxed to The Associated Press in Cairo
that the violence of Jihad is no longer in the interests of Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am calling on all my brothers inside and outside Egypt to halt military
operations and direct their efforts to Islam's biggest causes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   If the call is endorsed by other Jihad leaders, it would mean that
leadership of both of Egypt's two main militant groups would have called for a
change to nonviolent tactics. Leaders of Islamic Group called for a cease-fire
in 1997, but the move has not been endorsed by all members.
</P>
<P>
	   Jihad, which means holy war, killed Sadat in 1981. It is believed to be in
the throes of a leadership crisis. Recent reports in the Arabic press suggested
that its leader, Ayman al-Zawahri, had resigned over a strategy dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   Al-Zawahri is believed to be close to Osama bin Laden, the Afghanistan-based
Saudi dissident wanted for the bombing of the U.S. embassies in east Africa in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Jihad members were apparently opposed to al-Zawahri's decision to ally
the group with bin Laden in a coalition dedicated to attacking American citizens
and interests.
</P>
<P>
	   It is thought that Sidiq's call is in line with those Jihad leaders who
wanted to distance the group from bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
	   Sidiq, who has been sentenced in absentia to 40 years imprisonment for
insurgency, suggested that members should strive to ``liberate Jerusalem'' from
Israeli control. He did not explain whether this should be by peaceful or
violent means.

<HEADLINE> Britain Millennium Dome Chief Fired  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The chief executive of Britain's troubled Millennium Dome has
been sacked and replaced with a French executive who helped reverse the fortunes
of Disneyland Paris, the company that runs the dome said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Pierre-Yves Gerbeau, 34, takes over from Jennie Page, 55, said Bob Ayling,
chairman of the New Millennium Experience Company. Gerbeau was operations
director at Disneyland Paris,
</P>
<P>
	   News reports said sponsors of the $1.2 billion dome had demanded action
after a series of setbacks, including problems with getting guests to the grand
opening on Dec. 31. When the dome opened to the public on Jan. 1, there were
long lines for some attractions.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, a day after Page was fired, the company announced that attendance
in January was just 366,000, well short of the figure needed if the dome is to
reach its target of 12 million visitors for the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Cabinet Office Minister Lord Falconer denied the government was behind the
sacking, although it has been embarrassed by problems at the dome. ``This is a
board decision,'' he said in an interview with British Broadcasting Corp. radio.
</P>
<P>
	   Dome officials said Gerbeau, who joined Disney in 1991, was a key player in
transforming Disneyland Paris from a commercial disaster into one of Europe's
most successful theme parks.

<HEADLINE> N. Korea Threats Overshadow Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL SHIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- U.S. and South Korean officials plan sensitive
arms reduction talks this week amid North Korean threats that it would resume
testing its long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
	   The North Korean threats, made over the weekend, heightened concerns of a
possible arms race on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
	   The two-day U.S.-South Korea meeting in Hawaii starting on Tuesday continues
a series of missile nonproliferation talks between the allies which began in
1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest round in Seoul in November made little progress, with South Korea
resisting U.S. efforts to restrict its program to develop a longer-range missile
capable of hitting any part of North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We anticipate progress in this week's talks,'' said Chang Chul-kyun, a
spokesman for Seoul's Foreign Ministry. ``We need a missile strong enough to
provide a deterrent to North Korean threats.''
</P>
<P>
	   Chang said the talks in Hawaii will center on the issue of allowing the
United States to get involved in every stage of South Korean missile
development. Seoul has rejected the U.S. request.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the weekend, North Korea strongly protested South Korea's plan to build
a commercial ``satellite launch station'' by 2005, arguing that it is a disguise
for development of long-range ballistic missiles. The North accused Washington
of supporting the program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The U.S. application of double standards strengthens our will for test and
development of missile,'' the North's foreign news outlet, KCNA, said in a
report.
</P>
<P>
	   North Korea, the report said, will ``immediately and unhesitatingly take a
strong countermeasure'' when the South's ``satellite launch station'' is
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
	   North Korea's missile capability is a matter of grave concern to the United
States. The reclusive country is believed to have missiles capable of reaching
Hawaii and Alaska.
</P>
<P>
	   Last September, North Korea agreed to forgo a test of a newly developed
longer-range missile for the duration of talks with the United States. In
return, Washington lifted some of its half-century-old economic sanctions on
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the moratorium, North Korea rattled nerves in Asia and Washington by
testing a rocket that flew over Japan and landed in the Pacific Ocean in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Group: NATO Killed Yugo Civilians  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID HO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Last year's NATO bombing campaign in the former
Yugoslavia killed about 500 civilians in 90 separate incidents, a human rights
group concluded after an independent investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   NATO, which is reviewing the Human Rights Watch report, said it took
``scrupulous care'' to avoid civilian casualties but was unable to make an
educated estimate of deaths and injuries during the 78-day bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All too often, NATO targeting subjected the civilian population to
unacceptable risks,'' Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch,
said in the investigation report released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York-based international monitoring organization conducted a
three-week inquiry in August. Investigators went to 91 cities and towns and
inspected 42 sites where civilians were killed.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation found no evidence of war crimes but concluded NATO
violated international humanitarian law by not properly warning civilians and
failing to identify them in road convoys and other bombing targets.
</P>
<P>
	   Alliance aircraft also attacked targets of questionable military value and
used imprecise bombs near populated areas, Human Rights Watch charged.
</P>
<P>
	   NATO says it has received the report and is studying it, NATO spokesman Lee
McClenny. He said it is impossible for NATO to give a solid estimate of the
number of civilian casualties in the campaign to end violence by Serb-led
Yugoslav security personnel against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   McClenny stressed NATO's deep regret for civilian casualties but said such
incidents must be weighed against the enormity of the NATO's mission to halt ``a
systematic policy of ethnic cleansing, deportation and persecution.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have to repeat that we took scrupulous care to avoid all possible
civilian casualties,'' McClenny said.
</P>
<P>
	   The bombing eventually drove Yugoslav soldiers and police from Serbia's
southern province. Serb officials have said as many as 5,000 civilians were
victims of NATO bombs.
</P>
<P>
	   The pullout of Serb-led forces opened the way for an international
peacekeeping force in Kosovo, now administered by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   A Pentagon spokesman, Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, said last week that U.S.
officials never have come up with a figure on numbers of either civilians or
Yugoslav security forces killed in the Kosovo campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We felt that we couldn't do a particularly accurate job of that
estimation,'' Quigley said. But he added, ``This was an extremely carefully
planned air campaign and was the most accurate air campaign in history,
period.''
</P>
<P>
	   Quigley acknowledged ``unintentional civilian deaths'' but said, ``We tried
very, very hard to minimize those numbers, and we think we did a very good job.
But it wasn't perfect.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last June, the American Association of Jurists and other Western and Russian
law experts alleged in a report to a special Balkans war crimes court in the
Netherlands that the U.S.-dominated bombardment violated international law by
recklessly killing civilians. The U.N. court's prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte of
Switzerland, denied that a formal investigation of NATO was under way but said
her staff had looked into the allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   The Human Rights Watch report found about one-third of the 90 incidents
where civilians died occurred in Kosovo; many were killed during attacks on
military forces in the field or on the move.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigators found seven incidents related to attacks on convoys
particularly troubling and questioned whether NATO pilots flew too high for
accurate identification of their targets.
</P>
<P>
	   Some civilians may have been killed while being used as ``human shields'' by
the Yugoslav military, as in a village called Korisa where 87 people died on May
13, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 30 incidents happened in densely populated urban areas, including
six in the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, despite the use there of so-called
``smart weapons.'' Cluster bombs, which release small bomblets to cause a wide
area of smaller explosions, killed between 90 and 150 civilians, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We used cluster bombs during the conflict,'' Pentagon spokesman P.J.
Crowley said Saturday. ``They were effective weapons in terms of denying Serbia
the use of aircraft or airfields to threaten our forces.''
</P>
<P>
	   A third of all incidents and more than half the deaths resulted from attacks
on questionable targets, the report said. Attacks that killed civilians but
served no military purpose included the bombing of Serbia's radio and television
headquarters in Belgrade, a Belgrade heating plant and seven bridges that were
not major transportation routes.

<HEADLINE> Bradley to fight back in hope of rebounding  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Bruised by losses in Iowa and New Hampshire, Bill
Bradley's presidential campaign is fighting back against the aggressive campaign
being waged by rival Al Gore. Though the strategy is not entirely risk-free,
aides have concluded that Gore's tactics have left Bradley with little choice
but to respond.
<P>
	   "Part of our strategy will be drawing a contrast with the vice president,
which we will do increasingly," said Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, Bradley wasted little time Sunday resuming his criticisms of Gore,
which he had stepped up in the closing days of the contest in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing on NBC's "Meet the Press," the former New Jersey senator renewed
his attack on Gore's fund-raising practices in the last campaign, criticizing
the vice president's 1996 appearance at a Buddhist temple near Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think he has to explain more thoroughly what was happening at the
Buddhist temple, said Bradley. "If he didn't know it was a fund-raiser then he
was spectacularly naive."
</P>
<P>
	   He again warned that Republicans will hammer Gore with the issue in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no doubt in my mind that is going to happen," Bradley said. "This
is a real risk in the fall. The Democratic Party is taking a risk."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley also has challenged Gore on health care and his record on abortion
and says voters want a "fresh start," a thinly veiled reference to President
Clinton's troubles.
</P>
<P>
	   "America is about competition, political campaigns are about competition,"
said Bradley, defending his assault. "If your positions are misrepresented, you
can only take it so long. That's the way I'll continue for the next four or five
weeks."
</P>
<P>
	   By then, the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination could well be
decided, with a high-stakes showdown in California, New York and other states on
March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   "California is the neutral ground," said Gore campaign spokesman Chris
Lehane.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have to take off on March 7," acknowledged Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   One place to begin is within his own party. Much of the Democratic
establishment is behind Gore and one of Bradley's most urgent tasks is winning
back key constituencies like blacks and women who surveys show overwhelmingly
support the vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think I have to communicate better with the Democratic base," said
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking to shore up that base, Bradley campaigned Sunday at Allen AME
Church, the state's largest black church, with activist Al Sharpton, who
proposed that the Democratic rivals debate in New York before a mostly black
audience.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley agreed, and aides said they would present the idea to Gore. Lehane
said late Sunday that, "We're in discussions with the Bradley campaign about
debates and I assume this (proposal) will be part of those discussions."
</P>
<P>
	   "I am not taking the African-American vote for granted," said Bradley. "I
have a lot of friends in New Work. We are building organizations in all the
March 7 states."
</P>
<P>
	   Aides said Bradley would spend much of his campaign week on the issue of
race relations, heading to Florida to talk about affirmative action and South
Carolina to wade into the fight over the flying of the Confederate battle flag.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted that racial harmony was the topic of the first major speech he gave
as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's who I am, it's what I live," said Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Both rivals took a breather over the weekend before launching an intense
burst of campaigning leading up to the big round of March 7 primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley opened his week in New York and was heading to Florida. Gore, too,
was beginning in New York, and both were setting aside ample time for
California.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have to win California," Bradley said. "I know I have some ground to make
up."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore also has focused heavily on California, and has the backing of key
state leaders like Gov. Gray Davis and organized labor. Polls give Gore the edge
there - a Field poll in mid-January had him ahead 44 percent to 17 percent - but
they can be unreliable as voters begin to tune in to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Countering Bradley, Gore's aides said they will continue the kind of
grassroots, retail campaign that led to success in the opening contests in Iowa
and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   "Al Gore is a national candidate," said Lehane, Gore's spokesman. "We'll be
campaigning in virtually every state where they have a primary. There's only one
candidate in this race who is undefeated and that's Al Gore."
</P>
<P>
	   For Bradley, the debate has been one of tactics. A core campaign theme has
been his argument that he's a nontraditional candidate who operates above the
charges and countercharges that have become staples of political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   But in the face of early setbacks, Bradley's approach has shifted. Backers
like Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska have urged Bradley - who picks up Secret
Service protection Monday - to be more aggressive and respond to Gore - and
that's becoming apparent.

<HEADLINE> Junior College Coach Wagstaff Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TYLER, Texas (AP) -- Floyd Wagstaff, a Texas Sports Hall of Fame basketball
coach who is second on the junior college victory list, died Saturday. He was
89.
</P>
<P>
	   Wagstaff coached Tyler Junior College from 1946-75 and served as athletic
director until retiring in 1984. He led the Apaches to national basketball
championships in 1949 and 1951, and a record 11 NJCAA national tournament
appearances.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's hard to verbalize the impact of the loss of coach Wagstaff to Tyler
Junior College and the city of Tyler," TJC president Dr. William R. Crowe told
the Tyler Morning Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a tremendous loss. Coach Wag epitomized athletic achievement to this
college, to this city. He was a great friend, a mentor, a terrific competitor
and a wonderful human being."
</P>
<P>
	   During his three-decade coaching career, Wagstaff had a 734-221 record, won
10 conference titles and tied for four others. The junior college's gym bears
his name.
</P>
<P>
	   Wagstaff also was the college's first football coach and compiled a 130-36
record. His 1948 team won the Junior Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Born Jan. 8, 1911, in Shelby County near the Louisiana border, Wagstaff
graduated from Stephen F. Austin State University in 1937. Wagstaff joined Tyler
Junior College in 1946 as the first basketball and football coach.
</P>
<P>
	   Wagstaff is survived by brothers Travis Wagstaff of Madisonville and Bob
Wagstaff of Pineland; sisters Neta Hanna of Jacksonville and Bonnie Myers of
Hide-a-way Lake; daughters Becky Craig of Rowlett, Betsy Caddell of Richardson
and Peggy Smith of Tyler; and six grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
	   A memorial service is set for Tuesday at the First Presbyterian Church in
Tyler.

<HEADLINE> Ruling Party Candidate Wins in Japan  </HEADLINE>
   By GARY SCHAEFER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- A candidate backed by Japan's ruling coalition won an
important local election Sunday, giving a badly needed victory to Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi's government.
</P>
<P>
	   Fusae Ota's victory makes her Japan's first woman governor, succeeding Knock
Yokoyama, who stepped down in December amid charges that he sexually harassed a
campaign worker.
</P>
<P>
	   The Osaka prefectural election has been closely watched since opposition
lawmakers walked out of Parliament last month in protest over the forced passage
of a bill to reduce the 500-seat lower house of parliament by 20 seats.
</P>
<P>
	   A poor performance Sunday by candidates supported by the ruling coalition
would have been seen as a sign of public disapproval and probably would have
encouraged the opposition to prolong the boycott.
</P>
<P>
	   The coalition, however, had little to worry about. Ota received 1,380,583
votes in the final count. She was followed by Makoto Ajisaka, who was backed by
the Japan Communist Party and pulled in 1,020,483 votes.
</P>
<P>
	   Ota, a former senior bureaucrat with the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, stressed in her campaign the need to support businesses as Osaka
struggles with the rest of Japan to recover from economic recession.
</P>
<P>
	   Ota, 48, said in a television interview Sunday night that she would feel
``great responsibility'' as the first woman governor in Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Osaka is a city of small and medium sized firms and I will make the utmost
effort to stimulate economy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Osaka prefecture is an important commercial area that includes Japan's
second-largest city, Osaka. It is 250 miles west of Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Announces Senate Run  </HEADLINE>
   By MARC HUMBERT AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) -- Becoming the first president's wife to run for
office, Hillary Rodham Clinton launched her Senate campaign Sunday from the
state she has called home for only a month, declaring, ``I may be new to your
neighborhood, but I'm not new to your concerns.''
</P>
<P>
	   The race for the seat being vacated by fellow Democrat Daniel Patrick
Moynihan is likely to pit Clinton against Republican New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani in what could be one of the most combative political campaigns in
memory.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am honored today to announce my candidacy for the U.S. Senate from New
York,'' Clinton said as shouts of ``Hillary! Hillary!'' rang through a
university gymnasium not far from her new home in the suburbs north of New York
City.
</P>
<P>
	   Behind her, President Clinton; her mother, Dorothy; and daughter Chelsea sat
beaming as nearly 2,000 supporters cheered.
</P>
<P>
	   No other first lady has ever run for public office and in doing so, Clinton
steps out of the long and scandal-scarred shadow of her husband. The president
is said to be one of her top advisers as she resumes the career she put aside to
help him capture the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Recalling a speech she made at her college commencement at Wellesley in
1969, Clinton said: ``I often return to one thing I said back then, that
politics is the art of making possible what appears to be impossible. I still
believe that today. We can do what seems impossible if we have the vision the
passion and the will to do it together.''
</P>
<P>
	   Over and over again during her announcement, Clinton pledged, ``I'll be on
your side'' as she described her commitment to better schools, better health
care, environmentalism and gun control. She also outlined her support for other
issues, including working for passage of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty
and peace from Northern Ireland to Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   She also took pains to describe herself as ``a new Democrat'' who supports
balanced budgets and welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't believe that government is the source of all our problems or the
solutions to them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has often criticized Giuliani's combative style, and while she
didn't mention him by name Sunday, she pledged to work against ``the divisive
politics of revenge and retribution. ... I'll work to lift people up, not push
them down.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also tried to get a little New York swagger into her delivery.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know it's not always going to be an easy campaign, but -- hey! THIS is
New York,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Her remarks were preceded by tributes from Moynihan, Sen. Charles Schumer
and Reps. Nita Lowey of Westchester and Charles Rangel of Harlem, who joined her
on stage.
</P>
<P>
	   About 600 house parties were held simultaneously around the state so more
than 20,000 supporters could watch the announcement on television and listen in
on a conference telephone call from the candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to thank all of you,'' the first lady said during the short call
from a cellular phone only minutes after her announcement. ``It is because of
your interest and your commitment to this campaign that I think we have such a
great beginning today.''
</P>
<P>
	   Recent polls have shown Giuliani with a slight lead over Clinton and running
even with her among female voters. That's a far cry from a year ago when
sympathy was strong from the Monica Lewinsky scandal and polls showed her well
ahead of the mayor.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday morning talk shows, Giuliani reminded viewers of Clinton's late
arrival to New York politics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My record of success comes out of my knowledge, experience, background and
life experience as a lifetime resident of the state,'' he said on CBS' ``Face
the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``How is it that the Democratic Party can't come up with a candidate for the
Senate from the state of New York? What does that say about the Democratic
Party?''
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani has not made a formal campaign announcement, but he came close on
ABC's ``This Week,'' one of the five TV talk shows he appeared on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked if he planned to run, he said: ``Looks that way.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last July at Moynihan's sprawling farm, Clinton kicked off a summer-long
``listening tour.''
</P>
<P>
	   By December, she was assuring supporters she intended to run. And in early
January, she moved into a $1.7 million house in suburban Westchester County to
establish residency.
</P>
<P>
	   Political experts said there were good reasons Clinton chose the State
University of New York at Purchase to make her announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When duck hunting, one goes where the ducks are,'' Republican consultant
Jay Severin said. ``The independent suburban ducks are the ducks in this
campaign that are yet to be bagged.''
</P>
<P>
	   As of the end of the year, Clinton had raised $8 million and Giuliani, who
started fund raising three months earlier, had raised almost $12 million. It is
expected to be the most expensive Senate race in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
	   In seeking to replace Moynihan, Clinton hopes to make another kind of
history. No woman has ever been independently elected to statewide office in New
York. Former vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro unsuccessfully sought
the Democratic Senate nomination in 1992 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's terrific,'' Ferraro said. ``I think it's taking the role of
the first lady and putting it in the perspective of the 21st century.''

<HEADLINE> Republicans demand figures on candidate's travel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Republicans renewed a demand Sunday that Hillary Rodham
Clinton further account for costs of her campaign travels, saying the first lady
has made "more than 50" politics-related trips costing taxpayers far more than
the $34,000 her aides say has been reimbursed to the White House.
<P>
	   "It would be a good time for Mrs. Clinton to play fair with the people of
New York," Patricia Harrison, co-chair of the Republican National Committee,
told reporters just before Clinton formally declared herself a candidate for
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want her to try to begin her campaign by telling the truth."
</P>
<P>
	   As first lady, Clinton travels with the security and other trappings of the
White House and her campaign is supposed to reimburse White House Airlift
Operations for some of the costs. While Harrison complained about the federal
office not releasing figures on how much has been spent or paid back, Clinton
spokesman Howard Wolfson noted that details are included on the campaign's
financial filings with the Federal Elections Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   The $34,000 Clinton aides have reported reimbursing is based on the price of
first-class travel. It is not intended to pay the full cost of security for the
first lady, for whom the price of travel soars because of her position as the
president's wife.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Harrison said Clinton's travel expenses don't add up.
</P>
<P>
	   "The taxpayers should not have to foot the bill for her trips," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Harrison said her office had found that Clinton's campaign travels were
"comparable" with those of Vice President Al Gore, which cost him $323,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's probable opponent in the Senate race, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, has
made 14 campaign-type trips costing $150,000, "all flights fully paid for,"
Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
	   On a TV news program earlier in the day, Giuliani himself acknowledged that
the line between his campaign and mayoral staffs had blurred at times, saying:
"There's always going to be questions about overlap."
</P>
<P>
	   Later, asked at another forum about Clinton's travel costs, Giuliani said he
didn't have details and "we'll never know" until the White House releases the
records.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's very hard to figure out how you do an allocation in which Hillary
Rodham Clinton would pay only $34,000," Giuliani said. "They are going to have
to explain all that."
</P>
<P>
	   A list compiled by the GOP about Clinton's campaign showed 51 appearances by
the first lady between July 7 and Dec. 22, 1999, most of them in New York state.
It also included fund-raisers in Massachusetts, Philadelphia, Chicago, Las
Vegas, Los Angeles, Cincinnati, Rhode Island and Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
	   And Harrison said the list was incomplete.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't know how many trips she has taken or how much they cost ... or
whether payment for trips has been made," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfson denied that, noting that the trips have been adequately accounted
for with the FEC.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement handed out at Harrison's news conference by a Clinton
campaign volunteer, Wolfson described the Republican demands for disclosure as
"negative attacks," and "politics - pure and simple."

   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- A small plane flying to a rural village crashed in
the rugged terrain of southwest Alaska, killing all six people aboard,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   An Army National Guard helicopter crew reached the site of the crash near
Music Lake, about 250 miles southwest of Anchorage, Sunday afternoon and found
the victims in the wreckage, said Alaska State Trooper spokesman Tim Despain.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cessna 206, operated by Iliamna Air Taxi, left Iliamna Saturday
afternoon and was expected to arrive in the village of Koliganek 50 minutes
later. The crash site is about halfway between the two small communities.

<P>
	   There were five passengers and a pilot aboard the plane, Despain said. Their
identities were not released.
</P>
<P>
	   A woman who answered the phone at Iliamna Air Taxi on Sunday said the

</P>
<P>
	   A search began Saturday night, but was halted due to heavy snow and whiteout
conditions. The Alaska National Guard, state troopers and volunteers resumed the
search Sunday morning.

<HEADLINE> IRA Dissidents Suspected in Bombing  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Suspected Irish Republican Army dissidents
bombed a rural hotel Sunday -- an attack that caused no reported injuries but
gave Northern Ireland a bitter reminder of the days the province is struggling
to leave behind.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first such attack here since 1998, and it came as international
pressure was building on the mainstream IRA to begin disarming in support of
Northern Ireland's peace accord.
</P>
<P>
	   A caller claiming to be from the Continuity IRA, a small dissident group
opposed to the IRA's 1997 truce, told the BBC in Belfast that bombs had been
left at two hotels in rural County Fermanagh.
</P>
<P>
	   Police evacuated both hotels shortly before a bomb went off at the rear of
Mahon's Hotel in the village of Irvinestown. They said the bomb was placed
beneath the hotel's main oil storage tank, causing a fire that spread to nearby
cars.
</P>
<P>
	   Officers and British soldiers couldn't immediately find any suspicious
devices at the other threatened hotel. They expected to resume their search at
daybreak.
</P>
<P>
	   No IRA dissident group had launched such an attack since 1998. There were
several bombings in the province last year, but they were the work of
pro-British Protestant groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Every political party in Ireland condemned the attack, including the
IRA-allied Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness, a former IRA commander who is education
minister in Northern Ireland's power-sharing Cabinet, said the Continuity IRA
was ``unrepresentative of Irish republicans'' and should ``disband
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the blast underscored demands from the province's major Protestant
party, the Ulster Unionists, for an immediate start to IRA disarmament.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We cannot allow any paramilitary organization, republican or (pro-British)
loyalist, to remain in existence with illegal guns and explosives,'' said Ken
Maginnis, Fermanagh's Ulster Unionist member of British Parliament. ``Even if
they adhere to their own cease-fires, their weapons of war will inevitably end
up in the hands of dissidents.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Continuity IRA began bombing targets after the IRA called a 1994
cease-fire. The shadowy group's sporadic attacks have caused only minor injuries
and no deaths, but it has never called a formal cease-fire. Only last month,
police in the neighboring Irish Republic arrested a suspected Continuity IRA
activist in possession of a van loaded with weapons and explosives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There will always be people who try to undermine the peace process,'' a
spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair's Downing Street office said in London.
``We will do what we can to make sure they do not succeed.''
</P>
<P>
	   The bombing came as Protestants and Catholics are hoping for the salvation
of Northern Ireland's peace process -- and for an unprecedented leap of faith
from the IRA. The IRA's refusal to say whether it will disarm has left the
province's new government teetering on the brink of collapse.
</P>
<P>
	   Blair emphasized Sunday that he wants to gain a disarmament commitment from
the IRA this week. Otherwise, Britain intends to take back the powers it
transferred in December to the province's new Protestant-Catholic coalition
Cabinet in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
	   That transfer of power was a key part of the 1998 Good Friday peace accord.
It ended 27 years of direct rule of the province from London.
</P>
<P>
	   Rendering the four-party coalition powerless would decrease the risk that
its major Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, would collapse the Cabinet
outright by resigning.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, the Ulster Unionists accepted the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party as
Cabinet colleagues on condition that IRA disarmament follow. But the province's
disarmament commission reported Jan. 31 that its two months of secret
discussions with IRA figures had produced no concrete gains.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, IRA commanders said British and Ulster Unionist pressure
wouldn't spur them to disarm -- but hinted they might begin disarming someday,
saying for the first time that ``the issue of arms needs to be dealt with in an
acceptable way.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein said the IRA's statement represented a significant change in
policy. But Blair said it didn't answer the question of whether the IRA will
disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the moment when we simply need to know,'' Blair told a conference
of his governing Labor Party in Blackpool, northwest England. ``Because this
issue of decommissioning is not going to change, it's not going to disappear,
it's not going to alter in its essentials. It's just got to be confronted and
resolved now.''

<HEADLINE> No. 25 Maryland 78, NC State 73  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GINSBURG AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- Early in the second half, Gary Williams
acknowledged the pressure of the situation by peeling off his sweat-soaked suit
jacket. Not long after that, Maryland's fiery coach couldn't repress a recurring
image.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was one of those games when the thought goes through your head that
we're not going to win," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fortunately for the No. 25 Terrapins, Lonny Baxter scored a career-high 31
points and led a furious comeback as Maryland overcame a 12-point deficit in the
final seven minutes to beat North Carolina State 78-73 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Juan Dixon added 17 points for the Terrapins (16-6, 5-4 Atlantic Coast
Conference), who scored the game's final 10 points after trailing 73-68 with
2:59 left. Maryland has won 11 straight at home against the Wolfpack, but this
was by far the most difficult.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was incredible," said Williams, who choked up during his postgame news
conference when talking about Baxter, who was 14-for-22 from the field.
</P>
<P>
	   "When he came here and they were saying our recruiting was crap. He may turn
out to be the best to play here," Williams said. "I love to watch that kind of
thing happen."
</P>
<P>
	   Justin Gainey scored 21 points and Anthony Grundy 16 for the Wolfpack (15-5,
5-4). NC State led by 17 in the first half but ended up falling to 0-4 on the
road in the ACC this season.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've battled on the road. It's not like we're just stinking up the joint,"
NC State coach Herb Sendek said. "Our guys have fought tooth-and-nail against
some great teams on the road."
</P>
<P>
	   A 3-pointer by Gainey made it 58-51 with 10 minutes left, and his two free
throws sparked a 7-0 run that put the Wolfpack up 65-53 with 7:03 to go. Minutes
later, Gainey hit two foul shots to make it 71-63.
</P>
<P>
	   Then Maryland took charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Baxter made a three-point play and Terence Morris sank two free throws.
After a basket by NC State, the Wolfpack's Damon Thornton was called for his
fifth foul on a charge and received a technical, too. Juan Dixon made the two
foul shots, then scored from the baseline to make it 73-72 with 2:33 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked to comment on the call, an obviously distraught Sendek said, "You know
I can't talk about that. Why even ask the question?"
</P>
<P>
	   Said Baxter: "That changed the tempo of the game."
</P>
<P>
	   After Grundy missed two free throws, a short hook by Baxter with 1:15 left
gave Maryland its first lead since 2-0. Baxter then hit a layup with 40 seconds
left for a 76-73 lead, and the Wolfpack's last gasp failed when Marshall
Williams fired up an air-ball from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
	   "Lonny Baxter was sensational," Sendek said. "Obviously, we did not have an
answer for him."
</P>
<P>
	   NC State, looking for its first win in Cole Field House since 1989, tried
something different by donning black road uniforms in place of its traditional
red and white garb. The new-look Wolfpack bolted to a 22-5 lead and appeared
poised to hand Maryland only its third home loss in 28 games, but the Terrapins
wouldn't let it happen.
</P>
<P>
	   "Coach said with 3:30 left that if we shut them down, we win this game.
Those were his exact words," Dixon said. "We shut them down the last three
minutes. That's how we got the win."
</P>
<P>
	   Gainey was 6-for-9 from the field, including 4-for-5 from 3-point range, and
made all five of his free throws. Thornton had 12 points and 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   NC State went 17-for-30 and hit six 3-pointers to take a 41-29 halftime
lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Maryland point guard Steve Blake started on the bench because of a sore
ankle, but coach Gary Williams quickly ushered him into the lineup after the
Terrapins fell behind 8-2 with just over two minutes gone. Blake had little
immediate effect, as the Wolfpack added three baskets to go up 15-2 on the
strength of 6-for-6 shooting.

<HEADLINE> Gogel, Brooks Leads, Tiger Lurks  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG FERGUSON AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- His hopes hanging on a cliff, Tiger Woods made
a great escape Sunday in the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. Now all he needs is a
great comeback to catch Matt Gogel and Mark Brooks for his sixth straight
victory.
</P>
<P>
	   On another bizarre day at Pebble Beach -- a weather delay under gorgeous
sunshine because of fog on another course -- Gogel made birdies from all the
wrong places for a 5-under 67 that gave him a share of the lead at 12-under 204.
</P>
<P>
	   It will be the second time in three weeks that Gogel, the career leader in
Nike Tour victories but a rookie on the PGA Tour, will be in the final group.
</P>
<P>
	   For Brooks, it's his best chance to win since the PGA Championship in 1996.
Brooks had a 6-under 66 at Poppy Hills, the easiest of the three courses.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the heavy fog at Spyglass Hill, Vijay Singh's round was delayed 1
1/2 hours. He was even-par for the day, 11-under for the tournament, with five
holes to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods, trying to become the first player since Ben Hogan in 1948 to win six
consecutive PGA Tour events, wound up with a 4-under 68 and was at 209, five
strokes out of the lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods' largest final-round comeback on the PGA Tour is four strokes -- Las
Vegas in 1996 and the Mercedes Championship in 1997, both won in playoffs. His
greatest comeback ever was eight strokes against Ernie Els in the 1998 Johnnie
Walker Classic in Thailand, also won in a playoff.
</P>
<P>
	   During his five-tournament winning streak, he has been no worse than one
stroke behind going into the final round, at the American Express Championship
in Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods did not stop to answer questions, instead going to the putting green
to work with coach Butch Harmon.
</P>
<P>
	   His 68 at calm, picturesque Pebble Beach could have been a lot better --
Woods missed five birdie putts inside 15 feet.
</P>
<P>
	   It also could have been much, much worse.
</P>
<P>
	   After a 34-minute delay because of the fog at Spyglass, Woods approach over
the ocean on No. 8 came up short, and a five-member search team was lucky to
find the ball in grass 10 inches deep in the hazard.
</P>
<P>
	   A regular stance would have risked him tumbling down the 50-foot hill that
leads to the rocky shore. He planted his feet firmly but awkwardly, slashed at
the tall weeds and popped the ball out to 20 feet.
</P>
<P>
	   He missed the putt and made bogey, but he stayed in the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Nothing came easily to Gogel. He made a 35-footer on No. 12 for his first
birdie, then got into trouble on the par-5 14th and had a 5-iron into the green
on his third shot. He went left of the green, then proceeded to chip in for
birdie.
</P>
<P>
	   He also faced trouble on the par-5 sixth, when his drive found the left
round and his approach failed to make it all the way up the hill. He blasted out
of the rough from 137 yards away into 10 feet for another birdie.
</P>
<P>
	   Forecasters believe the weather will cooperate for the final 18 holes
Monday, which would be only the second 72-hole tournament at Pebble Beach in the
past five years. If that's the case, Gogel hopes he has learned his lessons.
</P>
<P>
	   One stroke out of the lead in the Bob Hope Classic, he played it safe and
was left in the desert dust, finishing in a tie for seventh.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was like being in the Indy 500 watch cars go by you," he said.
"Conditions are soft here at Pebble with the weather. I would be surprised if
anything less than 14-under wins."
</P>
<P>
	   Notah Begay had a 72 at Spyglass and was two strokes off the lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those at 208 was Jay Williamson, who had a 69 at Pebble Beach for his
sixth consecutive round under par in this tournament, the longest active streak.
</P>
<P>
	   David Duval was in danger of missing the cut after a 75.
</P>
<P>
	   Brooks has finished in the top three since his first and only major
championship at Valhalla in '96. He declined to meet with reporters after his
round at Poppy.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods hit his approach into about 2 feet on No. 16, but he missed birdie
putts of 8 and 10 feet on the last two holes. Still five strokes back, his play
commands attention.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd feel a lot easier if he was about 2-under," Gogel said. "But you expect
him to be that close. You know he's going to put on a charge. I can't control
what Tiger is going to do. I'm going to have enough worries on my own just
handling myself in the final group."

<HEADLINE> Pfizer To Acquire Warner-Lambert  </HEADLINE>
    By NOELLE KNOX AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- In a deal that will create the world's second-largest drug
company, Pfizer Inc. will announce Monday it is acquiring Warner-Lambert Co. for
$84.4 billion in stock, according to people familiar with the negotiations. The
combined company's medicine cabinet includes the impotence treatment Viagra and
Lipitor, the blockbuster cholesterol fighting drug.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal will mark the end of a takeover battle that started in November
when Warner-Lambert announced a $58.3 billion merger with its New Jersey
neighbor American Home Products Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home Products will be paid $1.8 billion -- the largest breakup fee
in history -- to sever its contract with Warner-Lambert. American Home Products,
which makes the hormone replacement drug Premarin, decided not to wage a lengthy
and expensive court battle to stop Pfizer, according to a person involved in the
deal.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home Products could use the windfall as a cushion against
larger-than-expected verdicts or settlements related to its fen-phen diet drug
combination. The company has already set aside $4.7 billion for such claims.
</P>
<P>
	   But while Pfizer won its hostile bid for Warner-Lambert, relations between
the top executives are anything but friendly. Warner-Lambert's chairman and
chief executive officer, Lodewijk J.R. de Vink, will leave the company after the
deal closes in four to six months, said the sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   De Vink, 54, who joined Warner-Lambert in 1988, became chairman and chief
executive officer in April. Under the company's golden parachute plan, de Vink's
will get three years' salary and bonus (before he became CEO he made about $2
million a year), and his stock options have a market value of $245 million,
based on Pfizer's offer.
</P>
<P>
	   De Vink won't be the only one out of a job. Pfizer also is expected to cut
hundreds of jobs -- most of them from Warner-Lambert -- from their combined work
force of 87,400 as the two companies unite their sales and research teams as
well as consolidate administration jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Those job cuts will be part of the company's estimated $1.6 billion in cost
savings by 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   The combined company will keep Pfizer's name and headquarters in New York.
Warner-Lambert's headquarters in Morris Plains, N.J., will become the base for
the consumer products division, which will include household names like
Listerine, Rolaids, Bain de Soleil and Visine.
</P>
<P>
	   The newly merged company will have sales of $29 billion, profits of $4.9
billion and a research budget of $4.7 billion. Still, the new-and-improved
Pfizer will only control about 6.3 percent of the world's medicine market,
assuaging most antitrust concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   This is the third pharmaceutical takeover as many months. Last month, Glaxo
Wellcome PLC struck a $76 billion deal to acquire SmithKline Beecham PLC to
become the world's largest pharmaceutical company. In December, Pharmacia &AMP;
Upjohn Co. announced a $27 billion merger with Monsanto Co.
</P>
<P>
	   And the trend likely will continue.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home Products is expected to find another partner soon. The company
is expected to sell its agricultural chemical business by June, according to a
person familiar with the company's plans. That should make American Home
Products a more attractive takeover target.
</P>
<P>
	   The agricultural division, known as American Cyanamid, is expected to fetch
about $3 billion. Prospective buyers include Dow Chemical Co., E.I. Dupont De
Nemours &AMP; Co. and in Europe, Bayer AG and BASF AG.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the terms of Pfizer's deal with Warner-Lambert. Pfizer will issue 2.75
shares of its stock, worth about $98.31 based on Friday's closing price, for
each share of Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert shareholders will own 38 percent of the combined company and
have up to nine seats on the company's board, which would increase the size of
the board to 24.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Militant Calls for Nonviolence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- A leader in the insurgent group that assassinated
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat urged his organization Sunday to quit fighting
and pursue Islamic goals peacefully.
</P>
<P>
	   Osma Ayoub Sidiq said in a statement faxed to The Associated Press in Cairo
that the violence of Jihad is no longer in the interests of Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am calling on all my brothers inside and outside Egypt to halt military
operations and direct their efforts to Islam's biggest causes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   If the call is endorsed by other Jihad leaders, it would mean that
leadership of both of Egypt's two main militant groups would have called for a
change to nonviolent tactics. Leaders of Islamic Group called for a cease-fire
in 1997, but the move has not been endorsed by all members.
</P>
<P>
	   Jihad, which means holy war, killed Sadat in 1981. It is believed to be in
the throes of a leadership crisis. Recent reports in the Arabic press suggested
that its leader, Ayman al-Zawahri, had resigned over a strategy dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   Al-Zawahri is believed to be close to Osama bin Laden, the Afghanistan-based
Saudi dissident wanted for the bombing of the U.S. embassies in east Africa in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Jihad members were apparently opposed to al-Zawahri's decision to ally
the group with bin Laden in a coalition dedicated to attacking American citizens
and interests.
</P>
<P>
	   It is thought that Sidiq's call is in line with those Jihad leaders who
wanted to distance the group from bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
	   Sidiq, who has been sentenced in absentia to 40 years imprisonment for
insurgency, suggested that members should strive to ``liberate Jerusalem'' from
Israeli control. He did not explain whether this should be by peaceful or
violent means.

<P>
    KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Semeka Randall scored 19 points and Kara Lawson
added 13 to lead Tennessee to a 65-47 Southeastern Conference victory over
Alabama on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama (13-8, 3-5 Southeastern Conference), which trailed by 22 points
early in the second half, rallied to within 14 on Leigh Papisan's basket with
8:50 left in the game. But Tennessee (19-3, 7-1) used an 11-2 run to regain
control at 58-35 with 4:35 left.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lady Vols hit 10 of their first 12 shots to take a 22-6 lead after eight
minutes. Michelle Snow led the early charge with six points and April McDivitt
and Kristen Clement added 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee's aggressive defense posed problems for Alabama, which turned the
ball over 23 times in the game.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lady Vols' shooting cooled off considerably after the fast start.
Tennessee scored just 12 points in the final 10 minutes of the half.
</P>
<P>
	   But Alabama's offensive struggles continued, and despite Johnson's six
points in the final two minutes, the Crimson Tide trailed 34-16 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Shondra Johnson led Alabama with 19 points.

<HEADLINE> Jazz 93, Spurs 90  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Tim Duncan owned the first 46 minutes. John Stockton
took over for the final two.
</P>
<P>
	   Stockton's two clutch baskets helped the Utah Jazz break a six-game losing
streak as they defeated the San Antonio Spurs 93-90 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was just nice to get over the top," Stockton said. "It's only one win,
but it sure feels a lot better walking around the house."
</P>
<P>
	   With the Jazz down two points, Stockton made a 3-pointer with two minutes
remaining to put Utah ahead 89-88. After Terry Porter powered in for a layup,
Stockton's driving layup with 16 seconds remaining gave Utah a 91-90 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   On the next possession, Duncan was closely guarded by Karl Malone and
clanged a jumper off the back rim from 20 feet away. A loose ball foul on Jaren
Jackson gave Bryon Russell a pair of free throws which put Utah ahead 93-90.
</P>
<P>
	   Duncan, again closely guarded by Malone, airballed a 3-pointer at the
buzzer.
</P>
<P>
	   "We knew he was going to take the last shot," Malone said. "We just wanted
to make sure it was a tough shot."
</P>
<P>
	   Duncan led the Spurs with 32 points, 24 coming in the first half. He managed
just two points in the final period.
</P>
<P>
	   "He missed some shots," said Malone, who led Utah with 25 points. "Guys
played him tougher. We were not going to let him get into a rhythm in the second
half. I put a body on him, I made him step out."
</P>
<P>
	   "They started doubling in the second half," Duncan said. "They started
coming in a little quicker."
</P>
<P>
	   Duncan has totaled 172 points in his last five games against Utah. The last
time San Antonio faced the Jazz, he set a career high with 46 points on Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
	   "He got most of his points in the first three quarters," said Armen Gilliam,
who hit three jumpers in the final quarter to help the Jazz win.
</P>
<P>
	   The losing skid was Utah's worst since a nine-game slide in 1983, but the
Jazz were confident they'd bounce back.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't take it home," Stockton said. "I didn't kick the dog and I didn't
beat my kids."
</P>
<P>
	   "At least we stopped the bleeding a little bit," Jazz coach Jerry Sloan
said. "I thought our guys played a little bit harder today than what we have
been. It looked like we had a little bit more energy to try to compete."
</P>
<P>
	   The Jazz also rebounded from Friday's humiliating 113-67 loss to the Los
Angeles Lakers, their most lopsided defeat since losing 130-84 to the Lakers in
March of 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Hornacek scored 17 for Utah, including seven consecutive points during
Utah's third quarter run. Russell and Stockton added 16 for the Jazz.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Leads in Less-Bumpy Rides  </HEADLINE>
    By KARREN MILLS AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Northwest Airlines cut its teeth flying over the
northern United States, the bumpy route over the Rocky Mountains where
turbulence can be as common during a flight as the breakfast bagel.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline also has flown turbulence-prone routes to Alaska and Asia for
decades.
</P>
<P>
	   All the while, Northwest has been working to smooth out the ride. Today,
Northwest's Turbulence Plot System is recognized as the gold standard for the
industry.
</P>
<P>
	   "The system has enabled Northwest to achieve a turbulence avoidance record
that is the envy of the industry," said J.A. Donoghue, editor-in-chief of Air
Transport World magazine. The magazine on Feb. 21 will present an award to
Northwest in recognition of the system.
</P>
<P>
	   "Icing, clear air turbulence, wind shear are things that make a pilot gray,"
said Robert Vandel, executive vice president of the Flight Safety Foundation in
Alexandria, Va. "This is truly a great system."
</P>
<P>
	   Capt. Greg Cardis, a Northwest pilot for 15 years, said the turbulence
system goes beyond on-board equipment such as radar or reports from other
pilots.
</P>
<P>
	   "It gives us the ability to avoid areas of significant weather. It's another
aid," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest introduced clear-air turbulence forecasting techniques in the
1950s. In the early 1960s, Northwest worked with United Airlines on forecasting
and avoiding mountain wave turbulence, the changes in air flow patterns over
mountain ranges.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest's turbulence plotting system is different from on-board radar
being developed that may someday allow pilots to give passengers a one-minute
warning before hitting turbulence.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline launched its plotting system in 1968, providing forecasts for
its pilots on clear-air turbulence, mountain wave activity, thunderstorms and
some forms of low-altitude wind shear.
</P>
<P>
	   In the early days, turbulence data was hand-plotted on wall maps in the
airline's control centers, sent by teletype to Northwest airport offices, then
radioed to flight crews.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, Northwest's 25 meteorologists -- 16 in North America and nine in Asia
-- use a variety of high-tech tools to monitor the atmosphere, producing
forecasts that are automatically stored, distributed and displayed to
dispatchers and pilots.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1968, the airline has expanded the hazards it monitors to include
additional forms of low-altitude wind shear, volcanic ash, ozone and icing.
</P>
<P>
	   A Northwest pilot handbook cites Federal Aviation Administration data from
1980 through 1996 that show the carrier had the lowest turbulence encounter rate
among six major U.S. commercial carriers as measured by reported turbulence
accidents and incidents.
</P>
<P>
	   At Northwest's System Operations Control headquarters, Mike Sprengeler, the
airline's chief dispatcher for international flights, showed a reporter how the
system works by looking at three possible tracks for a flight from Seattle to
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   The most economical route passed through an area over Alaska where Northwest
meteorologists had identified heavy mountain wave turbulence.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have to avoid that area, so we pull up different routes," he explained.
No turbulence was detected over a track to the north so that route was chosen,
even though it would require more fuel. The plane could still reach Tokyo on
time.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is all preplanning. The plane hasn't left yet," Sprengeler said.
</P>
<P>
	   Once the plane is in the air, the route can be changed if necessary, based
on new information that flows into the system.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody wants to know where we're flying because they want to follow us,"
Sprengeler said. "They know we're not going to get bumped around."
</P>
<P>
	   The Northwest system soon will be in more widespread use. The airline is
making it available to other airlines through ARINC, an Annapolis, Md., company
that has purchased distribution rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines already is using the system. Continental Airlines and
Express Airlines I begin using it Feb. 14. Mesaba Airlines, Legend Airlines,
Piedmont Airlines and Virgin Atlantic Airways also have signed up, said Tom
Fahey, Northwest's meteorology manager.

<HEADLINE> McCain Defends Special Interest Cash  </HEADLINE>
   By EUN-KYUNG KIM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate
who is barnstorming the country on a promise to break the grip of special
interests, on Sunday defended accepting contributions from such groups. Chief
rival George W. Bush honed his case against McCain with plans for a new TV ad
and a hard-hitting stump speech.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I welcome the support of anyone in the form of $1,000 contributions, but
they know clearly well where I stand, they know clearly I want to break the iron
triangle,'' McCain said on ABC's ``This Week'' as the GOP campaign entered an
intense two weeks of campaigning before South Carolina's high stakes Feb. 19
primary. A loss in South Carolina would critically damage either campaign,
though McCain has less room for error because Bush is better funded and
organized.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizonan, whose push to overhaul federal campaign finance laws is the
centerpiece of his campaign, was accused Friday by Bush of engaging in
``Washington double talk'' for attacking special interests while courting their
support.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, recently came under fire
for writing letters on behalf of powerful interests and accepting contributions
from donors who often have business before his committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, stopped short of calling McCain a
hypocrite.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator McCain sees himself and portrays himself as an advocate of
campaign finance reform, as somebody who is cleaner than anyone else around the
table, and yet he has accepted contributions and sought contributions from
people with legislation pending before his committee,'' Rove said on CBS' ``Face
the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush plans to sharpen his message against McCain beginning Monday with a
speech in Delaware that aides say will draw distinctions between the reforms
Bush has achieved as governor of Texas and the lack of progress made by
politicians in Washington, specifically McCain. Bush, who came out swinging at
McCain after losing to him in New Hampshire, plans to touch on a range of issues
to make the case against Washington-style politics and McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor also planned to unveil a new ad this week accusing McCain
of breaking his promise to run a campaign free of attacks. McCain, who made the
pledge in a Michigan debate last month, has since raised questions about Bush's
Social Security plan and, in a more subtle fashion, the Texan's qualifications
for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   Debate footage will be featured in the ad, which ``will remind voters that
John McCain made a promise not to run negative ads and then he has run them,''
said Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky replied that Bush's campaign is behind
third-party ads critical of the senator, and he pointed out that a veteran's
activist blasted McCain in the presence of Bush at a recent South Carolina
event.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're accusing us of going negative? That's the pot calling the kettle
black,'' Opinsky said. ``John McCain's ads are factual.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain himself said there was nothing hypocritical about accepting
contributions from lobbyists, including some who represent clients with
interests before the committee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to get money from everybody in America and if someone who has a
special interest wants to give to my campaign and they're interested in reform,
that's fine,'' he said. ``The message is clear -- there's going to be a change
in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who plans a major fund-raiser Thursday in Washington that will be
broadcast via satellite to about 30 sites nationwide, said many of his
contributors support his efforts to change the way political campaigns are
financed.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has been on a roll since defeating Bush in the New Hampshire primary
last Tuesday. He said he expected attacks from members of the GOP establishment
who feel threatened by his efforts, and they are now ``coming at me from all
sides.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm like Luke Skywalker trying to get through the Death Star,'' McCain
quipped.
</P>
<P>
	   In a news conference late Sunday, McCain labeled ``bizarre'' a story in the
Arizona Republic on Sunday that tried to link the senator to a murder
investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was briefly interviewed by a sheriff's deputy because the murdered
man, Ronald J. Bianchi, had once spread rumors about McCain. McCain's campaign
provided The Associated Press affidavits from four involved parties, including
two county investigators, who said they believed McCain had nothing to do with
Bianchi's death.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's so bizarre, it speaks for itself,'' McCain said of the story.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Police Raid University  </HEADLINE>
   By NIKO PRICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- In a surprisingly smooth conclusion to the 9 1/2-month
occupation of Latin America's largest university, police raided the main campus
Sunday and arrested 632 striking students.
</P>
<P>
	   The raid ended an exasperating ordeal in which Mexican authorities from
President Ernesto Zedillo on down seemed unable to wrest the country's most
important academic institution from a tiny band of radical students with names
like Mosh and The Devil.
</P>
<P>
	   Armed only with batons and shields, about 2,400 federal police marched into
an all-night meeting of the student strike council at 6:45 a.m. and rounded up
about 430 students, including the eight top strike leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   The strikers didn't resist arrest and there were no injuries. Police then
swept through the giant campus, detaining hundreds more strikers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A democratic society cannot allow the kidnapping of the national
university,'' said Interior Secretary Diodoro Carrasco.
</P>
<P>
	   Rector Juan Ramon de la Fuente said that, where possible, the university
would withdraw criminal complaints filed against students during the strike. In
cases where the university lacks the authority to withdraw complaints, Fuente
called on prosecutors to offer leniency. He also asked them to drop charges
against minors.
</P>
<P>
	   Several hundred strikers were already jailed on various charges before
Sunday's raid. It was unclear how many would be affected by Fuente's
declaration.
</P>
<P>
	   The 291-day strike at the 260,000-student National Autonomous University of
Mexico began in April to protest plans to raise annual tuition, which had been
just a few cents, to the equivalent of $140.
</P>
<P>
	   The university backed down, but a small core of radical students continued
to occupy the campus. They pushed a six-point agenda to reverse recent academic
reforms and give students more power within the university administration. They
also used the strike as a stage to denounce the free-market economy and Mexico's
political system.
</P>
<P>
	   What little public sympathy that may have existed for the strikers gradually
faded as a result of their traffic-clogging and sometimes violent protests,
vandalism of university buildings, intolerance of dissenting opinions and
intransigence in negotiations. A referendum last month showed students and
teachers overwhelmingly sided with the university in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   But, fearing bloodshed, officials were reluctant to forcibly retake the
campus. The strikers were believed to have guns and explosives. No one wanted to
risk repeating one of the darkest moments in modern Mexican history: a 1968
massacre of striking university students.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday's raid came five days after a clash that injured 37 security guards
and two days after a failed negotiating session.
</P>
<P>
	   The clash seemed to mark a turning point. Zedillo said in a speech Sunday
evening that after hearing about the violence ``It became evident to me, very
sadly, that efforts to reach a resolution within the university community had
reached their limit and that they had to be complemented with the application of
the law.''
</P>
<P>
	   Zedillo said the strikers ``through force, converted into their own private
property a public asset, a university that is supported by all Mexicans.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday's raid seemed calculated to minimize the potential for violence.
Police did not carry guns and human rights officials went along as observers.
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Francisco Arrellano, general coordinator of the Federal Preventative
Police, said his officers sealed off the campus, then moved in. Only a handful
of strikers were guarding the barricades and, other than chanting about police
repression, they didn't resist.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberto Garduno, a local reporter covering the strike council meeting at the
Che Guevara auditorium, said strikers had heard rumors of a raid, but stopped
worrying about it when it hadn't happened by 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours later, the police marched into the auditorium in a column, Garduno
said. Students yelled at one another to stay calm, sit down and not provoke the
police, he said. The students were moved to one side of the auditorium while
police checked their identification.
</P>
<P>
	   Alberto Gonzalez Camacho, a 27-year-old law student, said he was sleeping
when police arrived. He said he escaped by running into the hills behind the
university.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were aggressive. They came in swinging,'' he said. ``They took
everyone they could. There was no resistance. We were sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
	   The only weapons police reported finding were six bottles converted into
Molotov cocktails, two screwdrivers, a pair of scissors and a souvenir machete.
They also seized a few scraggly marijuana plants.
</P>
<P>
	   Sixteen buses carried the strikers from the university as parents and
supporters outside the police line flashed victory signs at them and cursed at
the police.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are treating us like animals when all we want is to find out what's
happening with our children,'' said Marco Antonio Lopez, the father of a
striker.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of people held protest marches on behalf of the strikers later
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Police continued to occupy the campus and it was not known when classes
would resume.
</P>
<P>
	   The government indicated talks would continue on issues raised in the
strike.
</P>
<P>
	   Some strikers say they're not giving up.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're thinking of retaking the installations,'' said Gonzalez, the law
student. ``The government isn't going to defeat us.''

<HEADLINE> WB's Prime-Time Audience Slipping  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- A haircut, a missing creator and the switch of a
single station. Sometimes the little things mean the difference between a hot
network and a struggling one.
</P>
<P>
	   The WB was everyone's darling last season. Ratings were up, and it became a
particularly popular destination for tastemaking teen-age girls with smart
dramas like "Dawson's Creek," "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Felicity."
</P>
<P>
	   This year, though, its audience has dropped by more than 15 percent. Its
total prime-time viewership has even slipped behind the resurgent UPN, the
mini-network rival that many believed the WB had left behind for good.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps the first hint of trouble arrived in a card sent to "Felicity"
creator J.J. Abrams last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   It was from a vacationing Keri Russell, the series star. As a joke, Russell
sent a picture of herself in a wig, covering up her flowing, brown curls with a
short hairdo.
</P>
<P>
	   That got Abrams to thinking. Since the series planned to have Felicity break
up with her boyfriend, Ben, early this season, why not have Russell cut off her
hair? That's something a college sophomore might do to put a failed romance
behind her.
</P>
<P>
	   Bad idea. The show has been flooded with angry e-mails. Superficial as it
may seem, WB executives think the haircut may be one of the reasons the
"Felicity" ratings are off.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was distinctive," said Jamie Kellner, the WB's chief executive, "and we
cut off our distinctiveness."
</P>
<P>
	   Now there's a new rule on WB shows: no dramatic haircuts without permission.
</P>
<P>
	   Early this season, "Felicity" also effectively isolated Russell's character
from her friends, a no-no when you're trying to create an ensemble that appears
to care for each other like family, said Susanne Daniels, the WB's entertainment
president. A brief romance with a brooding professor's son didn't help, either.
</P>
<P>
	   Daniels believes "Felicity" is on the road back, starting with a critically
well-received special episode that was a "Twilight Zone" homage. She also hopes
a behind-the-scenes personnel change will right another listing ship, "Dawson's
Creek."
</P>
<P>
	   For much of this season, the show's special chemistry was buried beneath bad
soap opera plots. The introduction of Eve, a manipulative vixen, is seen in
retrospect as a telling mistake.
</P>
<P>
	   "It sort of took the show to a darker, harder, edgier place," Daniels said,
"and a lot of what works about the show is the hopefulness and the emotional
bonding of the characters."
</P>
<P>
	   The absence of Kevin Williamson, the series' creator, from any involvement
in the show is obvious; he often said the characters were based on different
aspects of his personality. Williamson went off to try other projects, so far
without much success.
</P>
<P>
	   Daniels has put one of the show's original writers in charge of the series
now. Its ultimate health may depend on whether Williamson can be coaxed back.
</P>
<P>
	   Kellner concedes that the WB's schedule is too heavy on dramas. As a result,
the network is concentrating most of its development efforts on establishing new
comedies.
</P>
<P>
	   A more subtle problem is the WB's effort to build a schedule with shows a
little too much like what they already have on the air. The idea is to promote a
natural audience flow from one to another so no one clicks the remote.
</P>
<P>
	   Unfortunately for the WB, competitors noticed that young dramas were working
and tried to imitate. The market quickly flooded, and a backlash may have set
in.
</P>
<P>
	   The WB has also suffered this year from the loss of a key affiliate, WGN in
Chicago. WGN is a superstation available on many cable systems, and it found it
was duplicating many local stations that also carried WB programming.
</P>
<P>
	   It was one more thing cutting in to the WB's viewership.
</P>
<P>
	   "We knew it would be a bump in the road," Kellner said, "but we were so
positive about our schedule we thought we would drive right over it. But we
haven't."
</P>
<P>
	   He looked uncomfortable talking about it. Kellner, who worked at Fox before
the WB, is used to growing networks, not stagnating ones.
</P>
<P>
	   But he insists there's no panic.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not changing our plan," he said. "We're not changing our people. We
are just going to be more aggressive."

<HEADLINE> New GM CEO Must Seek Young Buyers  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- When G. Richard Wagoner Jr. assumes the job of CEO of
General Motors Corp. on June 1, he will be the youngest chief executive ever at
GM, running the world's largest automaker at age 47.
</P>
<P>
	   But whether he can keep the company in good health will depend in part on
improving GM's standing among consumers half his age. With rivals hustling
harder for younger buyers, Wagoner will have to show that GM can compete
profitably for those consumers and keep bringing them back as they grow older.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's critical that we engage that group," Wagoner said Friday.
"History has shown that when you get a buyer into your family and treat them
well, it's easier to keep them than to attract someone new.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've got to focus on products that meet their needs. The challenge has
been getting something that's eye catching ... at a price point that they want
to pay."
</P>
<P>
	   The average American car buyer is in their early 50s, the time of life when
many Americans are able to afford new vehicles more often. While GM remains
strong with older buyers, research from The Polk Co. shows that the vehicle
lines with the most pull with buyers under the age of 35 are imports -- namely
makes such as Isuzu, Honda and Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
	   While Chevrolet, Pontiac and Saturn sell about one-fifth of their vehicles
to customers under 35, the number drops precipitously for other GM vehicle
lines, Polk found. Karen Piurkowski, director of loyalty with Polk, said buyers
in the age range from 23 to 35, commonly labeled Generation X, tend to consider
foreign manufacturers more than their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
	   "GM has a big challenge ahead of them as people move up through these
population segments," she said. "It's not as natural for (Generation X members)
to be as loyal to a domestic manufacturer, whereas the baby boomers were always
a Ford family or a GM family."
</P>
<P>
	   Younger buyers have not always been a major concern of automakers, since
they tend to choose cheaper, smaller vehicles that carry slim profits.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, GM has shifted its attention from small cars to trucks and
sport utility vehicles. The company has said it loses money on every Chevrolet
Cavalier and Pontiac Sunfire it builds; those models will be 10 years old by the
time GM brings out their replacements in 2004.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our research on younger buyers says they aren't necessarily interested in
small cars," Wagoner said. "I don't necessarily believe that traditional small
cars with more progressive styling are what young buyers are after."
</P>
<P>
	   Other automakers have gone after younger buyers with more force. Among the
new vehicles targeted at the market are Chrysler's Neon and upcoming PT Cruiser,
the Toyota Echo and Ford's Focus -- all well-equipped models that carry far more
options than cars of that size and price had before.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford said Friday that one fourth of all Focus buyers so far were under 25
years old -- a higher share of younger buyers than any other vehicle sold in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
	   To compete with those models, Wagoner said GM would use more expressive
vehicles that are a step above the bottom of the market.
</P>
<P>
	   He points to the Pontiac Aztek, a new SUV coming out this year and the
Pontiac Piranha, a concept car that will be shown for the first time at this
week's Chicago Auto Show, as the types of vehicles that eventually will bring
younger buyers back into the GM fold.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our view is that we're increasingly focused on the kind of things that will
attract youthful (buyers) into the family," Wagoner said. "That's why we're
putting so much more emphasis on the Internet, because more people are using it
and because of the kind of people that are using it as well."
</P>
<P>
	   Analyst Jim Hall with AutoPacific said the Aztek and an upcoming Saturn SUV
had the potential to make GM a contender for those consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   "The fact that they're developing vehicles like that at all is amazing,"
Hall said. "Their attitude for a long time was that they were going to be a fast
second to market with a new product. The irony is that being second to market is
a losing proposition."

<HEADLINE> Pfizer To Acquire Warner-Lambert  </HEADLINE>
    By NOELLE KNOX AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Pfizer Inc. emerged the victor of a three-month takeover
battle for control of Warner-Lambert Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer was to announce today it is acquiring Warner-Lambert Co. for $84.4
billion in stock, in a deal that will create the world's second-largest
pharmaceutical company.
</P>
<P>
	   The combined company's medicine cabinet includes the impotence treatment
Viagra and Lipitor, the blockbuster cholesterol fighting drug.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal will mark the end of a takeover battle that started in November
when Warner-Lambert announced a $58.3 billion merger with its New Jersey
neighbor American Home Products Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home Products will be paid $1.8 billion -- the largest breakup fee
in history -- to sever its contract with Warner-Lambert. American Home Products,
which makes the hormone replacement drug Premarin, decided not to wage a lengthy
and expensive court battle to stop Pfizer, according to a person involved in the
deal.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home Products could use the windfall as a cushion against
larger-than-expected verdicts or settlements related to its fen-phen diet drug
combination. The company has already set aside $4.7 billion for such claims.
</P>
<P>
	   But while Pfizer won its hostile bid for Warner-Lambert, relations between
the top executives are anything but friendly. Warner-Lambert's chairman and
chief executive officer, Lodewijk J.R. de Vink, will leave the company after the
deal closes in four to six months, said the sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   De Vink, 54, who joined Warner-Lambert in 1988, became chairman and chief
executive officer in April. Under the company's golden parachute plan, de Vink's
will get three years' salary and bonus (before he became CEO he made about $2
million a year), and his stock options have a market value of $245 million,
based on Pfizer's offer.
</P>
<P>
	   De Vink won't be the only one out of a job. Pfizer also is expected to cut
hundreds of jobs -- most of them from Warner-Lambert -- from their combined work
force of 87,400 as the two companies unite their sales and research teams as
well as consolidate administration jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Those job cuts will be part of the company's estimated $1.6 billion in cost
savings by 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   The combined company will keep Pfizer's name and headquarters in New York.
Warner-Lambert's headquarters in Morris Plains, N.J., will become the base for
the consumer products division, which will include household names like
Listerine, Rolaids, Bain de Soleil and Visine.
</P>
<P>
	   The newly merged company will have sales of $29 billion, profits of $4.9
billion and a research budget of $4.7 billion. Still, the new-and-improved
Pfizer will only control about 6.3 percent of the world's medicine market,
assuaging most antitrust concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   This is the third pharmaceutical takeover as many months. Last month, Glaxo
Wellcome PLC struck a $76 billion deal to acquire SmithKline Beecham PLC to
become the world's largest pharmaceutical company. In December, Pharmacia &AMP;
Upjohn Co. announced a $27 billion merger with Monsanto Co.
</P>
<P>
	   And the trend likely will continue.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home Products is expected to find another partner soon. The company
is expected to sell its agricultural chemical business by June, according to a
person familiar with the company's plans. That should make American Home
Products a more attractive takeover target.
</P>
<P>
	   The agricultural division, known as American Cyanamid, is expected to fetch
about $3 billion. Prospective buyers include Dow Chemical Co., E.I. Dupont De
Nemours &AMP; Co. and in Europe, Bayer AG and BASF AG.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the terms of Pfizer's deal with Warner-Lambert. Pfizer will issue 2.75
shares of its stock, worth about $98.31 based on Friday's closing price, for
each share of Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert shareholders will own 38 percent of the combined company and
have up to nine seats on the company's board, which would increase the size of
the board to 24.

<HEADLINE> 76ers 119, Kings 108  </HEADLINE>
    By KEN BERGER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Allen Iverson calmly sank two free throws, and the
magic number flashed on the scoreboard: 50 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time he did it, people had a problem with it.
</P>
<P>
	   This time, it was a milestone that showed how much things have changed.
</P>
<P>
	   Iverson tied his career high and made a mockery of his showdown with
Sacramento's Jason Williams as the 76ers beat the Kings 119-108.
</P>
<P>
	   Iverson's performance was reminiscent of the one in Cleveland three years
ago when he put up 50 in the city where he was booed during the rookie game at
All-Star weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, his team is in position to make the playoffs for the second straight
season after an eight-year drought, and Iverson is finally shedding his
reputation as a selfish showman who cares only about stats.
</P>
<P>
	   He was roundly criticized for his string of 40-point games as a rookie,
accused of padding his stats in a push for the Rookie of the Year award -- which
he won.
</P>
<P>
	   Iverson's response this time: "I don't mind taking 40 shots. That's what I
do."
</P>
<P>
	   "I played that game like it was my last when I was a rookie and scored 50,"
said Iverson, who equaled the most points scored in the NBA this season. "I did
the same thing tonight, just like I do every night. And we won."
</P>
<P>
	   Iverson, approaching his first All-Star game, had a slew of incredible
numbers: A career-high 20 field goals and 40 attempts, nine rebounds and six
assists.
</P>
<P>
	   He favorite stat was the one that goes in the standings. Unlike his other
50-point game, the Sixers won.
</P>
<P>
	   "Regardless of whether I score 50 points or five points, I'm going to play
as hard as I can," Iverson said. "I'm going to play every game like it's my
last. I've been saying it since I got here. Regardless if the shots go in or
not, I'm going to play hard."
</P>
<P>
	   Williams, the Kings' flashy point guard, had 14 points on 5-for-16 shooting
and was not a factor in the outcome or the highlight reel.
</P>
<P>
	   Both realms belonged to Iverson, who scored 50 for the first time since he
became the first rookie since Wilt Chamberlain to have four straight 40-point
games. He had 50 on April 12, 1997, in a 125-118 loss to Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
	   Iverson scored 12 in the first quarter, 15 in the second, 12 in the third
and 11 in the fourth. The Sixers improved to 3-10 in his career when he scores
40 or more.
</P>
<P>
	   "He took 40 shots?" said an incredulous Chris Webber, who led Sacramento
with 32 points and 15 rebounds. "He made a lot of them, though."
</P>
<P>
	   Sixers coach Larry Brown didn't mind the 40 shots, either.
</P>
<P>
	   "I played with Rick Barry, and a lot of guys would mumble about the number
of shots he takes," Brown said. "And his remark was, 'Half you guys can't get 40
shots.' And I think it's justified. I think it's a remarkable thing that Allen
can do that most nights and not look like he lost anything."
</P>
<P>
	   It was quite a show witnessed by Philadelphia's fourth sellout crowd this
season -- including comedian Bill Cosby -- and a national TV audience.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's nice to see Allen play well in a TV game," Brown said. "There was a
time we were never on it, and the reason we're on it now is because we've won a
couple of games and Allen's on the team."
</P>
<P>
	   Webber fouled out on a dizzying play that produced the two free throws that
gave Iverson 50 points. With Philadelphia leading 107-102 and Iverson sitting on
48 points, he knifed into the lane and got his shot blocked as the clock
approached the one-minute mark. Eric Snow clapped for him to give up the ball,
but Iverson went back into the lane and drew Webber's sixth foul.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown motioned to his star with two hands to settle down. After a timeout,
Iverson sank both free throws to hit 50 points, giving the Sixers a 109-102 lead
with 1:37 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Snow had 11 points, 13 assists and no turnovers in what Brown,a former point
guard, called "about the best game a point guard can have."
</P>
<P>
	   Iverson also hit 50 at the foul line three years ago in Cleveland, but under
very different circumstances. He'd been booed when winning the rookie game MVP
trophy in Cleveland, and was booed again on that April night. The Sixers were on
their way to a 22-60 season.
</P>
<P>
	   Iverson had been so worried about the crowd reaction he'd receive in
Cleveland that he called his mother, Ann, and told her not to attend the game.
He said those thoughts were far away Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wasn't even paying attention," Iverson said. "I was just playing my
game."

<P>
	   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- His hopes hanging on a cliff, Tiger Woods made
a great escape Sunday in the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. Now all he needs is a
great comeback to catch Matt Gogel and Mark Brooks for his sixth straight
victory.
</P>
<P>
	   On another bizarre day at Pebble Beach -- a weather delay under gorgeous
sunshine because of fog on another course -- Gogel made birdies from all the
wrong places for a 5-under 67 that gave him a share of the lead at 12-under 204.
</P>
<P>
	   It will be the second time in three weeks that Gogel, the career leader in
Nike Tour victories but a rookie on the PGA Tour, will be in the final group.
</P>
<P>
	   For Brooks, it's his best chance to win since the PGA Championship in 1996.
Brooks had a 6-under 66 at Poppy Hills, the easiest of the three courses.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the heavy fog at Spyglass Hill, Vijay Singh's round was delayed 1
1/2 hours. He was even-par for the day, 11-under for the tournament, with five
holes to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods, trying to become the first player since Ben Hogan in 1948 to win six
consecutive PGA Tour events, wound up with a 4-under 68 and was at 209, five
strokes out of the lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods' largest final-round comeback on the PGA Tour is four strokes -- Las
Vegas in 1996 and the Mercedes Championship in 1997, both won in playoffs. His
greatest comeback ever was eight strokes against Ernie Els in the 1998 Johnnie
Walker Classic in Thailand, also won in a playoff.
</P>
<P>
	   During his five-tournament winning streak, he has been no worse than one
stroke behind going into the final round, at the American Express Championship
in Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods did not stop to answer questions, instead going to the putting green
to work with coach Butch Harmon.
</P>
<P>
	   His 68 at calm, picturesque Pebble Beach could have been a lot better --
Woods missed five birdie putts inside 15 feet.
</P>
<P>
	   It also could have been much, much worse.
</P>
<P>
	   After a 34-minute delay because of the fog at Spyglass, Woods approach over
the ocean on No. 8 came up short, and a five-member search team was lucky to
find the ball in grass 10 inches deep in the hazard.
</P>
<P>
	   A regular stance would have risked him tumbling down the 50-foot hill that
leads to the rocky shore. He planted his feet firmly but awkwardly, slashed at
the tall weeds and popped the ball out to 20 feet.
</P>
<P>
	   He missed the putt and made bogey, but he stayed in the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Nothing came easily to Gogel. He made a 35-footer on No. 12 for his first
birdie, then got into trouble on the par-5 14th and had a 5-iron into the green
on his third shot. He went left of the green, then proceeded to chip in for
birdie.
</P>
<P>
	   He also faced trouble on the par-5 sixth, when his drive found the left
round and his approach failed to make it all the way up the hill. He blasted out
of the rough from 137 yards away into 10 feet for another birdie.
</P>
<P>
	   Forecasters believe the weather will cooperate for the final 18 holes
Monday, which would be only the second 72-hole tournament at Pebble Beach in the
past five years. If that's the case, Gogel hopes he has learned his lessons.
</P>
<P>
	   One stroke out of the lead in the Bob Hope Classic, he played it safe and
was left in the desert dust, finishing in a tie for seventh.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was like being in the Indy 500 watch cars go by you," he said.
"Conditions are soft here at Pebble with the weather. I would be surprised if
anything less than 14-under wins."
</P>
<P>
	   Notah Begay had a 72 at Spyglass and was two strokes off the lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those at 208 was Jay Williamson, who had a 69 at Pebble Beach for his
sixth consecutive round under par in this tournament, the longest active streak.
</P>
<P>
	   David Duval was in danger of missing the cut after a 75.
</P>
<P>
	   Brooks has finished in the top three since his first and only major
championship at Valhalla in '96. He declined to meet with reporters after his
round at Poppy.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods hit his approach into about 2 feet on No. 16, but he missed birdie
putts of 8 and 10 feet on the last two holes. Still five strokes back, his play
commands attention.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd feel a lot easier if he was about 2-under," Gogel said. "But you expect
him to be that close. You know he's going to put on a charge. I can't control
what Tiger is going to do. I'm going to have enough worries on my own just
handling myself in the final group."

<HEADLINE> Reagan Too Ill For Celebration  </HEADLINE>
   By DARA AKIKO WILLIAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. (AP) -- Ronald Reagan was too ill to join the 700 people
who gathered Sunday at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum to
celebrate his 89th birthday.
</P>
<P>
	   Nancy Reagan said Friday on CNN's ``Larry King Live'' show that her husband
-- diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 1994 -- was ``doing as well as can be
expected'' considering the disease is progressive.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I listened to him, it was like I was listening to my father. And
that's probably the biggest compliment I can give someone,'' Jan Tornquist of
Santa Barbara said Sunday during the library's barbecue and vintage car show.
``He was so down to earth.''
</P>
<P>
	   None of Reagan's relatives attended the celebration, but Nancy Reagan's
bright red 1970 Ford Custom Ranch Wagon was on display.
</P>
<P>
	   The library described the cars in the context of Reagan's life: a Ford
Roadster Deluxe with a rumble seat from 1932, the year he graduated from
college; a Chevrolet pickup truck from 1937, the year he worked on his first
movie ``Love is on the Air''; and a silver Rolls Royce Wraith Coupe from 1952,
the year he and Nancy married.
</P>
<P>
	   The car show was held to promote a new commemorative California license
plate that features a photo of Reagan wearing a cowboy hat. The Department of
Motor Vehicles must receive 5,000 applications by the end of the year for the
Reagan plate before it will be issued. About 2,000 orders have been placed, said
library spokeswoman Teri Saucier.

<HEADLINE> Suicide Attempt Halts Indian Film  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUCKNOW, India (AP) -- An Indian filmmaker was forced to halt work on a new
movie again Sunday amid protest by right-wing Hindu activists that included an
apparent suicide attempt.
</P>
<P>
	   The filming of ``Water,'' the third in a controversial trilogy by Deepa
Mehta, was first disrupted last week when a mob ransacked the movie set,
accusing the filmmaker of distorting traditions in her depiction of Indian
widows in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, a member of the Hindu nationalist Shiv Sena party tied stones
around his waist and jumped into the Ganges River after eating poison, the Press
Trust of India reported. He was rescued and rushed to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   As news of the attempted suicide spread in the city of Varanasa, the Hindu
activists began pelting the sets with stones, damaging vehicles and shops.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Hijacked Afghan Plane Leaves Moscow  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY RENFREW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- The Afghan passenger airliner forced by hijackers on a tense
journey across Central Asia and Europe left Moscow early Monday after nine
passengers were freed.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane flew across Belarus, Poland and into Germany, but officials said
they did not know where it was headed, the German Interior Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ariana Airlines plane was seized earlier Sunday while on a domestic
flight from the Afghan capital, Kabul, to the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
The plane made stops in Uzbekistan, Kazakstan and Russia before flying to
Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian security service spokesman Alexander Zdanovich told reporters at
Moscow's Sheremetyevo-1 airport that the hijackers released nine passengers, but
made no political demands. He said the hijackers had asked only for food, for
the plane's toilets to be cleaned and for refueling while in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   None of the people aboard the Boeing 727 had been harmed, Zdanovich said,
although it remained unclear how many people were aboard. Russian news reports
said there were 131 passengers and nine crew before the release in Moscow, but
other sources said there were as many as 160 aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   The passengers included 20 women and 23 or 24 children, said Zdanovich. All
the passengers released in Moscow were male.
</P>
<P>
	   An emergency official in Kazakstan said there were 20 hijackers, but three
passengers who were released in Kazakstan said eight to 10 hijackers were
aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   The identity of the hijackers remained unclear. A diplomat familiar with the
negotiations in Moscow said the hijackers were seeking the release of a prisoner
from the Afghan city of Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
	   Afghan media speculated that the hijackers wanted the release of opposition
figure Ismail Khan, a former regional governor who has been held since 1997 by
Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement.
</P>
<P>
	   But a spokesman for the alliance fighting Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
militia denied that the Afghan opposition was responsible for the latest
hijacking. ``We condemn any act of terrorism,'' the spokesman, identified only
as Abdullah, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ten passengers were also released in Uzbekistan, the hijacked plane's first
stop, Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijacking comes six weeks after an eight-day hijacking of an Indian
Airlines plane ended peacefully in southern Afghanistan. The hijackers in that
case freed their hostages after India released three pro-Kashmiri militants from
jail.
</P>
<P>
	   After being seized over Afghanistan Sunday morning, the Afghan plane was
flown to Tashkent, Uzbekistan and then landed in the northern Kazak city of
Aktyubinsk because of a leak in its right fuel tank, the Kazak spokesman said.
It was not immediately known whether the leak was fixed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Afghan state-run airline is under international sanctions and is not
permitted to fly international routes.
</P>
<P>
	   Ariana has four aging Boeing 727 aircraft and five Russian-made Antonov
aircraft. Maintenance conditions are considered extremely poor in the country,
which is bankrupt and has been battered by more than 20 years of war. The
Taliban, who rule 90 percent of Afghanistan, are fighting their northern-based
enemies on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations imposed sanctions against Afghanistan's state-owned
airline in November to punish the ruling Taliban movement for its refusal to
extradite suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden, who has been living in
Afghanistan for the past few years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Taliban say they won't turn over bin Laden because Afghan culture and
tradition make it impossible to hand over a guest to his enemies.

<HEADLINE> Gogel, Brooks Leads, Tiger Lurks  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG FERGUSON AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- His hopes hanging on a cliff, Tiger Woods made
a great escape Sunday in the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. Now all he needs is a
great comeback to catch Matt Gogel and Mark Brooks for his sixth straight
victory.
</P>
<P>
	   On another bizarre day at Pebble Beach -- a weather delay under gorgeous
sunshine because of fog on another course -- Gogel made birdies from all the
wrong places for a 5-under 67 that gave him a share of the lead at 12-under 204.
</P>
<P>
	   It will be the second time in three weeks that Gogel, the career leader in
Nike Tour victories but a rookie on the PGA Tour, will be in the final group.
</P>
<P>
	   For Brooks, it's his best chance to win since the PGA Championship in 1996.
Brooks had a 6-under 66 at Poppy Hills, the easiest of the three courses.
</P>
<P>
	   Vijay Singh was another stroke back after an even-par 72 at Spyglass Hill,
where his round was suspended for 1 1/2 hours because of fog.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods, trying to become the first player since Ben Hogan in 1948 to win six
consecutive PGA Tour events, wound up with a 4-under 68 and was at 209, five
strokes out of the lead.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel as though I have a chance, but it depends on the conditions," Woods
said. "If it's ugly, I'm in great shape. If it's calm, it's going to be tough to
make that many birdies."
</P>
<P>
	   Woods' largest final-round comeback on the PGA Tour is four strokes -- Las
Vegas in 1996 and the Mercedes Championship in 1997, both won in playoffs. His
greatest comeback ever was eight strokes against Ernie Els in the 1998 Johnnie
Walker Classic in Thailand, also won in a playoff.
</P>
<P>
	   During his five-tournament winning streak, he has been no worse than one
stroke behind going into the final round, at the American Express Championship
in Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods headed straight to the practice green after his round to work with
coach Butch Harmon, hundreds of fans standing three-deep around the green to
watch him.
</P>
<P>
	   His 68 at calm, picturesque Pebble Beach could have been a lot better --
Woods missed five birdie putts inside 15 feet.
</P>
<P>
	   It also could have been much, much worse.
</P>
<P>
	   After a 34-minute delay because of the fog at Spyglass, Woods approach over
the ocean on No. 8 came up short, and a five-member search team was lucky to
find the ball in grass 10 inches deep in the hazard.
</P>
<P>
	   "I saw it was a golf ball," he said. "I could see the 'R' in my name."
</P>
<P>
	   A regular stance would have risked him tumbling down the 50-foot hill that
leads to the rocky shore. He planted his feet firmly but awkwardly, slashed at
the tall weeds and popped the ball out to 20 feet.
</P>
<P>
	   He missed the putt and made bogey, but he stayed in the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Nothing came easily to Gogel. He made a 35-footer on No. 12 for his first
birdie, then got into trouble on the par-5 14th and had a 5-iron into the green
on his third shot. He went left of the green, then proceeded to chip in for
birdie.
</P>
<P>
	   He also faced trouble on the par-5 sixth, when his drive found the left
round and his approach failed to make it all the way up the hill. He blasted out
of the rough from 137 yards away into 10 feet for another birdie.
</P>
<P>
	   Forecasters believe the weather will cooperate for the final 18 holes
Monday, which would be only the second 72-hole tournament at Pebble Beach in the
past five years. If that's the case, Gogel hopes he has learned his lessons.
</P>
<P>
	   One stroke out of the lead in the Bob Hope Classic, he played it safe and
was left in the desert dust, finishing in a tie for seventh.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was like being in the Indy 500 watch cars go by you," he said.
"Conditions are soft here at Pebble with the weather. I would be surprised if
anything less than 14-under wins."
</P>
<P>
	   Notah Begay had a 72 at Spyglass and was two strokes off the lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those at 208 was Jay Williamson, who had a 69 at Pebble Beach for his
sixth consecutive round under par in this tournament, the longest active streak.
</P>
<P>
	   David Duval bogeyed the 18th hole at Pebble Beach for a 75. At 1-over 217,
he missed the cut by one stroke.
</P>
<P>
	   Brooks has finished in the top three since his first and only major
championship at Valhalla in '96. He declined to meet with reporters after his
round at Poppy.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods hit his approach into about 2 feet on No. 16, but he missed birdie
putts of 8 and 10 feet on the last two holes. Still five strokes back, his play
commands attention.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd feel a lot easier if he was about 2-under," Gogel said. "But you expect
him to be that close. You know he's going to put on a charge. I can't control
what Tiger is going to do. I'm going to have enough worries on my own just
handling myself in the final group."

<HEADLINE> Uranium Workers Used in Experiments  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Some workers at a federal uranium processing plant
participated in experiments in the 1950s that had them breathing the radioactive
element, The Courier-Journal reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the participants at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant volunteered
for the tests, but some may not have been informed of the dangers, according to
a draft report by the Department of Energy on an investigation of health, safety
and environmental problems at the western Kentucky plant.
</P>
<P>
	   In one experiment, staff members volunteered to breathe a radioactive gas to
see how quickly uranium was excreted in their urine, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
	   In other tests, a senior staffer drank a solution containing uranium, and at
least 14 workers tested the effectiveness of respirators against radioactive
dust, gas and smoke, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
	   A copy of the report was obtained by The Courier-Journal.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the general dangers of radiation were known at the time of the
experiments, its interactions with the human body were not entirely understood.
Many believed that uranium dust and byproducts of the enrichment process posed
little or no hazard for humans.
</P>
<P>
	   The draft report also says wholesale pollution of the air, ground and water
around the plant -- in quantities that may have been significantly underreported
-- may have exposed residents to radiation.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked about the report, Energy Department officials said only that it
was under review. The Paducah plant has been managed by the department, as well
as by predecessor federal agencies and private contractors.
</P>
<P>
	   The report details a range of problems at Paducah from 1952 to 1990. For
years, investigators found, workers were not always told of the dangers they
faced working with highly toxic radioactive materials. And their families may
have been exposed when workers took contaminated clothing home to be laundered.
</P>
<P>
	   Vast amounts of uranium-contaminated smoke, steam and gas were vented into
the open air -- sometimes secretly in what employees called ``midnight
negatives.'' Inside some buildings, workers were exposed to unplanned releases
and leaks of radioactive gases and hazardous chemicals such as hydrofluoric
acid, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   The department began its review after a lawsuit by three employees alleged
that former plant operators Lockheed Martin Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp. had
profited by lying to the government about the extent of environmental pollution
and worker exposure to radiation.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigators said that although measured exposures to radiation were
high by today's standards, total exposures were comparable to those occurring at
Defense Department facilities, commercial nuclear power plants and other DOE
factories.
</P>
<P>
	   However, documents showed that, during the 1950s, 40 to 60 workers sought
medical help every four months after exposure to accidental releases of uranium,
hydrogen fluoride and fluorine.
</P>
<P>
	   In a companion story focusing on a feed mill at the Paducah plant, The
Courier-Journal reported that workers were exposed to radiation levels so high
it was possible for a worker to be exposed to as much radiation in one day as
was then considered safe for an entire year.
</P>
<P>
	   The paper cited a newly released report, dated Feb. 21, 1961, that contained
data on radiation emissions.
</P>
<P>
	   During a typical week, about 60 to 70 men worked round the clock in four
shifts in the feed plant, producing fluorine from hydrofluoric acid and
combining the lethal gas with uranium powder. The feed mill was closed in the
late 1970s.

<HEADLINE> Haider OKs Holocaust Compensation  </HEADLINE>
   By ROLAND PRINZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Right-wing populist Joerg Haider said Sunday the new
Austrian government in which his party shares power will take appropriate
measures to compensate Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
	   In a televised interview, Haider also promised to moderate his tough talk
and refrain from meddling in the coalition Cabinet. He will not hold a Cabinet
post.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider's comments came two days after the new government -- made up of his
far-right Freedom Party and the center-right Austrian People's Party -- was
sworn in by a stone-faced President Thomas Klestil. The coalition won approval
despite a wave of protests and moves by the European Union and other nations to
isolate Austria diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider's remarks Sunday were relatively conciliatory compared to the verbal
salvos he has fired recently against foreign leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   He told his interviewers that the previous government led by Austria's
Social Democrats had not really dealt with the Nazi past, including issues like
the compensation of forced laborers. He said the new government would seek to
redress their grievances and those of Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Where we have inflicted great injustice on our Jewish fellow citizens or
wiped out their families, we must take pertinent measures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider won international notoriety for statements praising Adolf Hitler's
``orderly employment'' policies and lauding veterans of the Waffen SS as
``decent people of good character'' -- comments for which he has since
apologized. The rise to power of his party has polarized a society with dark
memories of defeats in two world wars.
</P>
<P>
	   Referring to his past vitriolic attacks on other Austrian leaders, Haider
said his party would refrain from ``oppositional reflexes and unnecessary
sharpness ... and prove that, factually, we can reason very well.''
</P>
<P>
	   However, Haider also said there was need to clarify reports that former
Chancellor Viktor Klima and President Klestil allegedly solicited international
criticism of the new coalition government.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he could ``not rule out'' a parliamentary inquiry should the
suspicions be substantiated.
</P>
<P>
	   An inquiry would be ``in the interest of those (involved) ... so they can
credibly prove .... that they have not committed a kind of political high
treason against Austria,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Austria's new chancellor defended his coalition with Haider's party.
Wolfgang Schuessel said Sunday he is deeply disappointed by what he called
Europe's exaggerated reaction to the inclusion of a far-right party in the
government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yes, Haider is a populist, but he is no Hitler,'' Schuessel said during a
television appearance on Germany's ARD network. ``Why should the big European
Union with 360 million people be afraid of a state of eight million like
Austria? That's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere Sunday, Israeli Interior Minister Natan Sharansky announced that
Haider is banned from entering Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   The ban is the latest formal Israeli protest against the Freedom Party's
inclusion in government. Israel recalled its ambassador from Vienna as soon as
the Austrian coalition was approved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is a very important symbolic act to know that he is not desired in our
country. We hope that other countries follow our example,'' Sharansky said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Haider has expressed an interest in visiting Israel, and that his
party tried unsuccessfully to hire a local public relations firm to spruce up
his image there.
</P>
<P>
	   The Freedom Party's inclusion in government has drawn public protests both
inside and outside Austria. On Sunday night, about 4,000 people marched through
downtown Vienna for a third straight night. Police reported no incidents. In
Paris, about 300 demonstrators gathered outside the Austrian embassy and shouted
``Haider, fascist, collaborator.''

Bouchard: Health Crisis Needs Cure
</P>
<P>
	   LAVAL, Quebec (AP) -- The Quebec government still has to cure its ailing
health care system before it can call another sovereignty referendum, Premier
Lucien Bouchard insisted on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   But he denied he was stalling calling a vote that opinion polls have
consistently shown is not wanted by Quebecers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't subordinate any referendum to the complete settlement of the
health problem,'' he told a news conference after a speech to about 400 members
of the Parti Quebecois governing council.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But I think the people need and they expect us to bring forward the kind
of solutions which will comfort them that we are in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
	   The premier ended the two-day meeting by urging delegates to push for
sovereignty but also left no doubt there was no imminent referendum on the
horizon.

Seal Hunters May Face Confrontations
</P>
<P>
	   ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) -- Seal hunters could face increased
confrontations with protesters during this spring's cull unless more ice gathers
soon in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, warns a top mammal biologist.
</P>
<P>
	   Usually, the seal hunt occurs many kilometers off shore in thick, tightly
packed fields of ice.
</P>
<P>
	   Pierre-Yves Daoust, a seal expert with the Atlantic Veterinary College in
Prince Edward Island, says that a lack of ice in the Gulf could drive thousands
of female harp seals inland to whelp.
</P>
<P>
	   And that would allow activists easier access to disrupt the hunt, Daoust
says.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is very little ice right now in the Gulf,'' says Daoust, who acted
as an observer during the seal hunt off Newfoundland last year. ``We could have
even more confrontation than when the seals are out on the ice floes in the Gulf
because it would be much more visible.''
</P>
<P>
	   The seal hunt generally takes place in mid-March on the ice floes off the
North Shore of Prince Edward Island

British Columbians Flout No-Smoke Law
</P>
<P>
	   VANCOUVER (AP) -- Where there's no smoke, there's fire.
</P>
<P>
	   One month into British Columbia's sweeping ban on smoking in restaurants,
bars and pubs, many customers are still lighting up.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the threat of mounting fines, some business owners say their patrons
can keep puffing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not the right way to go about it,'' said Teri Burleigh, the manager
of the BX pub in Prince George, British Columbia
</P>
<P>
	   If tobacco smoke is so bad, the government should ban it, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'd be behind them 100 per cent,'' Burleigh said. ``But that's not how
they're going about it. Making us fight it at this level just isn't the way to
go.''
</P>
<P>
	   It's been a month since the toughest nonsmoking policy in the country --
possibly in North America -- kicked in throughout British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
	   As of Jan. 1, restaurants, pubs and bars became subject to the provincial
Workers' Compensation Board regulations aimed at protecting workers from the
effects of secondhand smoke.

Report: Theft Search Spared Lockers
</P>
<P>
	   HALIFAX (AP) -- Navy detectives who searched HMCS Montreal for $32,500
stolen from the ship's safe did not check the crew's personal lockers, a newly
released report shows.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All areas on board with the exception of personal lockers were searched,''
says an investigation report obtained under the Access to Information Act.
</P>
<P>
	   The money, which disappeared last May and has never been found, could have
been stashed in someone's locker.
</P>
<P>
	   But investigators were unable to check the crew members' bed areas and
lockers because they're considered private space and require search warrants.
</P>
<P>
	   And no search warrants could be obtained because there wasn't enough
evidence to go before a judge, a military spokesman says.
</P>
<P>
	   The money -- 650 bills in $50 denominations -- disappeared from the pay
office safe sometime between May 27-31 while the frigate was docked in New York
during a visit.

Sparks May Fly When Parliament Resumes
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- There's bound to be fireworks Monday when Parliament resumes
in the midst of a government grants mess and debate on Quebec referendum
legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The feeding frenzy has already started,'' said Reform House leader Chuck
Strahl.
</P>
<P>
	   Several events have made federal Liberals an easy target for opponents in
the Commons, Strahl said, including a decision to help NHL teams that was later
dropped, a proposal to provide banks with tax relief and mismanagement of up to
$1 billion in Human Resources grants.
</P>
<P>
	   Finance Minister Paul Martin will deliver his seventh budget Feb. 28. With
surpluses expected to reach $100 billion over the next five years, Martin is
under increasing pressure to fund tax cuts and program spending.

anti-Semitism within the agency failed two lie-detector tests about whether he
gave or sold U.S. secrets ``to an Israeli national,'' an agency memo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Adam Ciralsky, 28, of Milwaukee, joined the spy agency in December 1996 as a
contract employee in the Office of General Counsel. By the following October,
Ciralsky had been placed on unpaid leave. His top-secret security clearance was
revoked in July 1998, and he was fired in late 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Ciralsky aired his complaints against the agency Sunday night on CBS' ''60
Minutes.'' ``The idea that I'm guilty of a lack of candor is ludicrous,'' he
said. But a network interviewer said Ciralsky acknowledged off camera that in a
series of polygraphs and interrogations he often challenged the questions and
quibbled about legalities.
</P>
<P>
	   Ciralsky said in the TV interview that he is thinking about filing a lawsuit
against the CIA, but will not ask for a lot of money. ``In fact it's a matter of
principle,'' he said. ``They have to clean my record and allow me the
opportunity to serve my country.''
</P>
<P>
	   The agency said it acted against Ciralsky because he did not fully reveal a
relationship with two people holding dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship, both
employees of Israeli defense firms with possible ties to Israeli intelligence.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Harlow, CIA public affairs director, disputed Ciralsky's allegations of
anti-Semitism. He said the allegations had been reviewed by the agency's
inspector general, by several congressional panels and by a citizens' review
group.
</P>
<P>
	   The memorandum about Ciralsky's case, first reported Sunday by The
Washington Post, was written by Alan Wade, the CIA's associate deputy director
for security.
</P>
<P>
	   The memo said Ciralsky failed two polygraph examinations. The questions he
was asked, Wade wrote, were about ``deliberately compromising U.S. government
classified information to an Israeli national, accepting compensation from an
Israeli national in exchange for U.S. government classified information, and
deliberately concealing from the U.S. government a relationship with an Israeli
national.''
</P>
<P>
	   The CIA's Harlow refused to discuss the memo Sunday. He said the agency had
been willing to publicly discuss details of Ciralsky's case, but that his
lawyers had blocked them from doing so by invoking the Privacy Act.

<HEADLINE> Library Celebrates Reagan's Birthday  </HEADLINE>
   By DARA AKIKO WILLIAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. (AP) -- About 700 people gathered on a sun-drenched
Sunday afternoon to celebrate Ronald Reagan's 89th birthday with a vintage car
show, barbecue lunch and country music.
</P>
<P>
	   The celebration was held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and
Museum, which charged $15 for the lunch and offered free birthday cake to all
museum visitors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I listened to him, it was like I was listening to my father. And
that's probably the biggest compliment I can give someone,'' said Santa Barbara
resident Jan Tornquist. ``He was so down to earth.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reagan, who last visited the library in May, was too ill to join the
celebration.
</P>
<P>
	   Nancy Reagan said Friday on CNN's ``Larry King Live'' show that her husband
-- diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 1994 -- was ``doing as well as can be
expected'' considering the disease is progressive.
</P>
<P>
	   None of Reagan's relatives attended the event, but Nancy Reagan's bright red
1970 Ford Custom Ranch Wagon was on display.
</P>
<P>
	   The vintage car show was held to promote a commemorative California license
plate that features a photo of a smiling Reagan wearing a cowboy hat. The
Department of Motor Vehicles must receive 5,000 applications by Dec. 31 for the
Reagan plate before it will be issued. About 2,000 orders have been placed, said
library spokeswoman Teri Saucier.
</P>
<P>
	   The library described the autos in the context of Reagan's life, including a
Ford Roadster Deluxe with a rumble seat from 1932, the year he graduated from
college; a Chevrolet pickup truck from 1937, the year he worked on his first
movie ``Love is on the Air''; and a Rolls Royce silver Wraith Coupe from 1952,
the year he and Nancy married.

<HEADLINE> Hijacked Afghan Plane Leaves Moscow  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY RENFREW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- The Afghan passenger airliner forced by hijackers on a tense
journey across Central Asia and Europe left Moscow early Monday after nine
passengers were freed.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane flew across Belarus, Poland, Germany and into British airspace,
the British Foreign Office said. The plane did not have enough fuel to return to
continental Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ariana Airlines plane was seized earlier Sunday while on a domestic
flight from the Afghan capital, Kabul, to the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
The plane made stops in Uzbekistan, Kazakstan and Russia before flying to
Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian security service spokesman Alexander Zdanovich told reporters at
Moscow's Sheremetyevo-1 airport that the hijackers released nine passengers, but
made no political demands. He said the hijackers had asked only for food, for
the plane's toilets to be cleaned and for refueling while in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   None of the people aboard the Boeing 727 had been harmed, Zdanovich said,
although it remained unclear how many people were aboard. Russian news reports
said there were 131 passengers and nine crew before the release in Moscow, but
other sources said there were as many as 160 aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   The passengers included 20 women and 23 or 24 children, said Zdanovich. All
the passengers released in Moscow were male.
</P>
<P>
	   An emergency official in Kazakstan said there were 20 hijackers, but three
passengers who were released in Kazakstan said eight to 10 hijackers were
aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   The identity of the hijackers remained unclear. A diplomat familiar with the
negotiations in Moscow said the hijackers were seeking the release of a prisoner
from the Afghan city of Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
	   Afghan media speculated that the hijackers wanted the release of opposition
figure Ismail Khan, a former regional governor who has been held since 1997 by
Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement.
</P>
<P>
	   But a spokesman for the alliance fighting Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
militia denied that the Afghan opposition was responsible for the latest
hijacking. ``We condemn any act of terrorism,'' the spokesman, identified only
as Abdullah, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ten passengers were also released in Uzbekistan, the hijacked plane's first
stop, Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijacking comes six weeks after an eight-day hijacking of an Indian
Airlines plane ended peacefully in southern Afghanistan. The hijackers in that
case freed their hostages after India released three pro-Kashmiri militants from
jail.
</P>
<P>
	   After being seized over Afghanistan Sunday morning, the Afghan plane was
flown to Tashkent, Uzbekistan and then landed in the northern Kazak city of
Aktyubinsk because of a leak in its right fuel tank, the Kazak spokesman said.
It was not immediately known whether the leak was fixed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Afghan state-run airline is under international sanctions and is not
permitted to fly international routes.
</P>
<P>
	   Ariana has four aging Boeing 727 aircraft and five Russian-made Antonov
aircraft. Maintenance conditions are considered extremely poor in the country,
which is bankrupt and has been battered by more than 20 years of war. The
Taliban, who rule 90 percent of Afghanistan, are fighting their northern-based
enemies on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations imposed sanctions against Afghanistan's state-owned
airline in November to punish the ruling Taliban movement for its refusal to
extradite suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden, who has been living in
Afghanistan for the past few years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Taliban say they won't turn over bin Laden because Afghan culture and
tradition make it impossible to hand over a guest to his enemies.

<HEADLINE> Budget May Loosen Food-Stamp Rules  </HEADLINE>
   By PHIL BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some 250,000 people who can't get food stamps because
they own a car that's worth more than the government allows would be eligible to
get them if Congress goes along with a proposal in President Clinton's new
budget.
</P>
<P>
	   Under existing rules, food stamp recipients cannot own a car that's valued
at more than $4,651.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's budget for fiscal 2001 would let each state set a different
automobile limit for food stamps according to what they now permit in their
respective welfare programs, federal officials said Sunday, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Some states place no limit on the value of a welfare recipient's car. In
many states, the limit ranges from $7,000 to $9,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The change would cost taxpayers $80 million a year, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's budget, which is being released Monday also resurrects an
administration proposal to restore food stamps to some legal immigrants who were
cut off of benefits by the 1996 welfare reform law.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 90,000 adults who are elderly or else living with children who are
eligible for food stamps would be covered by the change, estimated to cost $25
million in 2001. They had to be living in the United States at the time the
welfare law was enacted.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress has previously restored benefits to some but not all legal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration's proposals are included in legislation that has been
introduced in both the House and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   The food stamp program, which benefits 19 million people, is expected to
cost $21.2 billion in 2001, up $1.4 billion from this year.

<HEADLINE> Pfizer to acquire Warner-Lambert; AHP gets largest breakup fee  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - In a deal that will create the world's second-largest
drug company, Pfizer Inc. will announce Monday it is acquiring Warner-Lambert
Co. for $84.4 billion in stock, according to people familiar with the
negotiations. The combined company's medicine cabinet includes the impotence
treatment Viagra and Lipitor, the blockbuster cholesterol fighting drug.
<P>
	   The deal will mark the end of a takeover battle that started in November
when Warner-Lambert announced a $58.3 billion merger with its New Jersey
neighbor American Home Products Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home Products will be paid $1.8 billion - the largest breakup fee
in history - to sever its contract with Warner-Lambert. American Home Products,
which makes the hormone replacement drug Premarin, decided not to wage a lengthy
and expensive court battle to stop Pfizer, according to a person involved in the
deal.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home Products could use the windfall as a cushion against
larger-than-expected verdicts or settlements related to its fen-phen diet drug
combination. The company has already set aside $4.7 billion for such claims.
</P>
<P>
	   But while Pfizer won its hostile bid for Warner-Lambert, relations between
the top executives are anything but friendly. Warner-Lambert's chairman and
chief executive officer, Lodewijk J.R. de Vink, will leave the company after the
deal closes in four to six months, said the sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   De Vink, 54, who joined Warner-Lambert in 1988, became chairman and chief
executive officer in April. Under the company's golden parachute plan, de Vink's
will get three years' salary and bonus (before he became CEO he made about $2
million a year), and his stock options have a market value of $245 million,
based on Pfizer's offer.
</P>
<P>
	   De Vink won't be the only one out of a job. Pfizer also is expected to cut
hundreds of jobs - most of them from Warner-Lambert - from their combined work
force of 87,400 as the two companies unite their sales and research teams as
well as consolidate administration jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Those job cuts will be part of the company's estimated $1.6 billion in cost
savings by 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   The combined company will keep Pfizer's name and headquarters in New York.
Warner-Lambert's headquarters in Morris Plains, N.J., will become the base for
the consumer products division, which will include household names like
Listerine, Rolaids, Bain de Soleil and Visine.
</P>
<P>
	   The newly merged company will have sales of $29 billion, profits of $4.9
billion and a research budget of $4.7 billion. Still, the new-and-improved
Pfizer will only control about 6.3 percent of the world's medicine market,
assuaging most antitrust concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   This is the third pharmaceutical takeover as many months. Last month, Glaxo
Wellcome PLC struck a $76 billion deal to acquire SmithKline Beecham PLC to
become the world's largest pharmaceutical company. In December, Pharmacia &AMP;
Upjohn Co. announced a $27 billion merger with Monsanto Co.
</P>
<P>
	   And the trend likely will continue.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home Products is expected to find another partner soon. The company
is expected to sell its agricultural chemical business by June, according to a
person familiar with the company's plans. That should make American Home
Products a more attractive takeover target.
</P>
<P>
	   The agricultural division, known as American Cyanamid, is expected to fetch
about $3 billion. Prospective buyers include Dow Chemical Co., E.I. Dupont De
Nemours &AMP; Co. and in Europe, Bayer AG and BASF AG.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the terms of Pfizer's deal with Warner-Lambert. Pfizer will issue 2.75
shares of its stock, worth about $98.31 based on Friday's closing price, for
each share of Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert shareholders will own 38 percent of the combined company and
have up to nine seats on the company's board, which would increase the size of
the board to 24.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) -- Lincoln McIlravy, Cary Kolat, Joe Williams and Kerry
McCoy won gold medals Sunday to lead Team USA to the championship at the World
Cup of Freestyle Wrestling 2000.
</P>
<P>
	McIlravy's takedown with three seconds remaining against Yosmany Sanchez led
the U.S. team to a 19-10 victory over Cuba in Sunday's afternoon session.
</P>
<P>
	``I knew that I was really, really short on time,'' McIlravy said. ``This is
more of a complaint than a brag, but I've ended up winning a lot of those
matches through college and in international competition because I make some
mistakes early and have to come from behind. I'm really trying to eliminate
that.''
</P>
<P>
	The victory was McIlravy's fourth consecutive triumph over Sanchez, 24, who
finished seventh in the 1999 World Championships.
</P>
<P>
	``That really was amazing,'' U.S. coach Greg Strobel said of McIlravy, a
25-year-old from Iowa City, Iowa. ``A lot of people would just say: `Hey, that's
it. I can't win this.' But he just kept right on going. And that just sets the
tone for everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
	Kolat and McIravy carried that energy into the evening session by posting
technical falls during the United States' 22-9 victory over Russia.
</P>
<P>
	Kolat took a 10-0 decision over Russia's Zelimkhan Akhmadov in 2 minutes, 5
seconds at 138.75 pounds. McIlravy followed with an 11-1 victory over Zaour
Kazbekov in 5:51.
</P>
<P>
	Eric Akin opened the nightcap with a 10-6 victory over Russia's Maxim Molonov
at 119 pounds. After Russia's Miron Dzadzaev took a 7-3 decision over silver
medalist Eric Guerrero at 127.75 pounds, the U.S. quartet of Kolat, McIlravy,
Williams and Les Guthches reeled off four consecutive victories, the latter two
in overtime.
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Kouramagomed Kouramagomedov defeated U.S. Army Spc. Dominic Black 4-1
at 213.75 pounds. Super-heavyweight McCoy closed the match with a 4-0 decision
over Oleg Khorpiahov.
</P>
<P>
	Guerrero, Kolat and Williams also posted victories for the U.S. against Cuba.
McCoy won by forfeit over Cuba's injured Alexis Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
	In other matches, Iran beat Russia 17-15 in the afternoon session, and then
topped Ukraine 22-9 in the nightcap.

which is bankrupt and has been battered by more than 20 years of war. The
Taliban, who rule 90 percent of Afghanistan, are fighting their northern-based
enemies on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations imposed sanctions against Afghanistan's state-owned
airline in November to punish the ruling Taliban movement for its refusal to
extradite suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden, who has been living in
Afghanistan for the past few years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Taliban say they won't turn over bin Laden because Afghan culture and
tradition make it impossible to hand over a guest to his enemies.

<HEADLINE> Moldova's Economy Trapped in Freeze  </HEADLINE>
    By ROBERT H. REID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) -- Somebody stole the electricity meter in Tatiana
Nesterov's apartment. But she's not complaining. Now she doesn't have to pay for
the power she consumes. Otherwise, her children might freeze.
</P>
<P>
	   Capitolina Clinenco, a 74-year-old retired seamstress, has found another way
to cope with life in a country where there's virtually no heat and where, on a
good day, temperatures approach freezing. She turns on her stove and sets a
brick on the burner. That radiates a bit more heat.
</P>
<P>
	   "At night, I fill plastic bottles with warm water to warm up the bed so that
I can sleep," she adds.
</P>
<P>
	   Life is a struggle for the 4.5 million people in this landlocked,
Maryland-sized country in southeastern Europe that declared independence from
the Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Things weren't so bad at first. After independence, 70 percent of Moldova's
exports -- mostly wine, tobacco and other agricultural products -- still went to
Russia, Ukraine and other former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
	   Then came the Russian currency collapse of 1998. Markets vanished, and
Moldova's economy shrank by 8.6 percent. It has never recovered.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Russian currency crisis destroyed our banking system, our markets, and
created a budget crisis," former Prime Minister Ion Sturza says. "Statistically,
this country cannot exist."
</P>
<P>
	   Without its own raw materials, the government cannot pay for natural gas
from its sole supplier, Russia's Gazprom, or for the electricity it imports from
neighboring Ukraine and Romania.
</P>
<P>
	   On Dec. 15, Gazprom shut off the gas because Moldovans owed $600 million.
Supplies were switched back on the next day after Moldova promised to pay.
</P>
<P>
	   The two sides, however, still have not agreed on a payment schedule. Moldova
already owes $1.2 billion to overseas lenders -- an amount equal to about 10
percent of the value of its economy.
</P>
<P>
	   So the government's only option is to conserve energy -- even if it means
turning off the heat in the dead of winter. "It is very important to limit
consumption to the level we can pay," says Sturza, who is expected to run for
president this year.
</P>
<P>
	   At Chisinau's airport, customs guards and clerks at the check-in counters
bundle up in overcoats, fur hats and gloves just like people who work outdoors.
Authorities shut off the citywide hot water in December but promised to turn it
on again -- in the spring.
</P>
<P>
	   Even at reduced consumption, many Moldovans can't pay their utility bills.
With the economy in the deep freeze, the typical worker's monthly pay averages
only 260 lei, or about $21, while a normal utility bill runs about 300 lei a
month for a family of four.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wouldn't be able to survive if it weren't for my four children who help
me regularly," says Ianuaria Scufinschi, 73, a retired school teacher who
receives a monthly pension equivalent to $6.50 -- that is, when the state pays
her at all.
</P>
<P>
	   Aurica Gonta, a 17-year-old French language student, visits her parents 15
miles from Chisinau every week to pick up food her father grows. The money she
saves on food helps to pay the rent and utilities.
</P>
<P>
	   Nesterov is able to afford an electric space heater for the room where her
children, ages 5 and 8, sleep, but that's only "because the meter was stolen."
The power company bills her for less than she consumes.
</P>
<P>
	   She's not alone. As a legacy of communism, many Chisinau residents live in
large, Soviet-style complexes with only one meter for the entire building. So
the power company can't cut off service to non-payers without shutting off
electricity to everybody.
</P>
<P>
	   With heat in such short supply, parents bundle up their children in fur
coats, hats and gloves as if they were going skiing instead of to school. That
is, if there is any class at all.
</P>
<P>
	   Christmas vacation at more than 300 public schools was extended to the end
of January because of the lack of heat. Many teachers wouldn't have shown up
anyway. They were on strike because they hadn't been paid for up to a year.
</P>
<P>
	   In order to survive, many Moldovans take on second jobs -- often without
notifying tax authorities. For some, the transition requires shucking old values
in favor of the new and the pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
	   Natalia Coropat, 29, quit her job as a Russian language teacher, a
profession that accorded a degree of respect, and began selling stationery and
secondhand clothes in the market.
</P>
<P>
	   When she was a teacher, she and her husband, a policeman, earned a combined
$32 a month. Now, she makes about $170 a month as a vendor.
</P>
<P>
	   Even that requires economizing.
</P>
<P>
	   "We can't afford to eat meat more than once a week," Coropat says. "And I
can't afford to give my child dairy products every day."

<HEADLINE> Knicks 94, Heat 80  </HEADLINE>
    By CHRIS SHERIDAN AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Patrick Ewing sat at his locker a little longer than usual
Sunday, trying to convince everybody that this performance wasn't out of the
ordinary.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nothing different," he said with a straight face.
</P>
<P>
	   In truth, a lot was different.
</P>
<P>
	   Playing with a perfect mix of raw talent and enthusiasm -- a combination
that often had been missing from his repertoire this season -- Ewing scored a
season-high 25 points and grabbed 14 rebounds while outplaying Miami's Alonzo
Mourning as the New York Knicks defeated the Heat 94-80.
</P>
<P>
	   "I chuckle at the way he's been measured," Miami coach Pat Riley said of
Ewing, whose game is rounding back into form after missing the first 20 games
recovering from a partially torn Achilles' tendon. "You only have to coach a guy
like Patrick to know what kind of heart he has. I think he's just beginning to
show it."
</P>
<P>
	   The victory, which snapped Miami's three-game winning streak and moved the
Knicks within a half-game of the Heat in the Atlantic Division, came with a
price for New York as forwards Marcus Camby and Larry Johnson went down with
injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   Camby partially tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee when
he was flagrantly fouled by P.J. Brown, and Johnson chipped a bone in his left
foot. Camby will miss Monday night's game at Charlotte, staying in New York for
further examination. Johnson's status was listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no estimate from the Knicks on how long Camby will be sidelined.
</P>
<P>
	   Allan Houston also scored 25, Latrell Sprewell had 24 and Charlie Ward added
10 points, 11 rebounds, six steals and five assists. Ward had five steals in the
pivotal third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps most impressive for New York was the way the team responded after
Van Gundy screamed and ranted at them as they came off the court for a timeout
trailing by 15 points early in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was one of the worst I've ever seen," forward Kurt Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
	   By the midpoint of the third quarter, the Knicks had caught up. And after
that, they steadily pulled away to hand Miami one of its most lopsided losses of
the season.
</P>
<P>
	   Ewing, coming off a season-high 20-point performance against Portland on
Thursday night, was 10-for-19 from the field in a season-high 44 minutes and
helped hold Mourning to 5-for-13. Mourning finished with 12 points and five
rebounds after being hampered by foul trouble throughout the game.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't do anything to counter his game," Mourning said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tim Hardaway, who made nine of his first 10 shots, led Miami with 23 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Camby landed awkwardly on his knee after being fouled from behind by Brown
on a fast break with 6:28 left and the Knicks leading 74-69. Camby didn't get up
for several minutes before finally limping off.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite losing another forward to an injury -- Johnson went out late in the
first quarter -- the Knicks didn't have a letdown. chris Dudley made one of two
free throws and Ewing hit a tough shot while driving to his left.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm trying to mix it up," Ewing said. "If they play off me, I'm taking my
jumper. If they play up on me, I'm going to drive."
</P>
<P>
	   Mourning then missed a jumper, Sprewell hit two foul shots, Ewing rejected a
shot by Hardaway and Sprewell converted a fast-break layup on a pass from
Houston, making it 81-69.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the fourth straight victory for New York against an opponent that
entered the game with a superior record.
</P>
<P>
	   The Heat were ahead 30-15 when Van Gundy lit into his team, screaming at
them during a 20-second timeout.
</P>
<P>
	   "We weren't playing well, we weren't playing together and he was obviously
upset," Sprewell said.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the coach said brought the desired effect as the Knicks came back
with a 14-3 run to pull within four points. New York couldn't quite catch Miami
before halftime, though, and the Heat took a 45-39 lead into the locker room
behind 17 points from Hardaway on 7-for-8 shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   The Knicks took their first lead of the game midway through the third period
with a run spurred by Ward. He had a steal and fast-break reverse layup, cutting
Miami's lead to 55-54, then came up with another steal leading to two free
throws by Sprewell, putting the Knicks up 56-55.
</P>
<P>
	   Sprewell had a breakaway tomahawk dunk with 1:13 left in the third, helping
the Knicks to a 67-63 lead entering the fourth, and Miami eventually fell behind
by as many as 14.

<HEADLINE> Mavericks Set To Accept Rodman  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Despite the inevitable distractions that
Dennis Rodman will bring to Dallas, the Mavericks are anxious to welcome the
Worm to their team.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodman, who signed with Dallas on Thursday, is in the process of moving from
Los Angeles to Dallas and is expected to make his Dallas debut on Wednesday when
the Mavericks play host to the Seattle SuperSonics. His first appearance with
the team will come at the Mavericks' next practice, either Monday or Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We discussed it and everyone was accepting and happy to have him on board,
so hopefully, he'll join us real soon because he still hasn't shown up yet,"
guard Steve Nash said Sunday before Dallas played Vancouver. "I'm excited, I
think it's going to be great. I think he's going to add a lot of positives to
our team."
</P>
<P>
	   Nash said he's not worried that Rodman's celebrated unorthodox lifestyle --
including some run-ins with the law -- will upset the team's mix, considering
the Mavericks have won nine of their last 12 games.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's just a matter of us allowing him to affect us positively, and anything
that he would do to deter from our success just to ignore it and not allow it to
affect us," Nash said.
</P>
<P>
	   The players went so far as to hold a team vote last week in which they
expressed their approval of Rodman's signing.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was important to me because I share most everything with the team. I
don't know if it went the other way what we would've done," coach Don Nelson
said. "But they're like anybody else, they want to win and they think he can
help us win. Let's try it."
</P>
<P>
	   Nelson considers Rodman a good fit for the club, saying, "He brings what we
don't do, which is rebounds and defense."
</P>
<P>
	   Rodman, 38, played 23 games with the Los Angeles Lakers last season before
the team released him in April.

<HEADLINE> Hijacked Plane Lands in London  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY RENFREW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- The Afghan passenger airliner forced by hijackers on a tense
journey across Central Asia and Europe landed at London's Stansted airport early
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the plane was isolated on the airport grounds so that officials
could open negotiations with the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ariana Airlines plane was seized earlier Sunday while on a domestic
flight from the Afghan capital, Kabul, to the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
The plane made stops in Uzbekistan, Kazakstan and Russia before flying to
London.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers released nine passengers in Moscow, but made no political
demands, Russian security service spokesman Alexander Zdanovich told reporters
at Moscow's Sheremetyevo-1 airport. He said the hijackers had asked only for
food, for the plane's toilets to be cleaned and for refueling while in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   None of the people aboard the Boeing 727 had been harmed, Zdanovich said,
although it remained unclear how many people were aboard. Russian news reports
said there were 131 passengers and nine crew before the release in Moscow, but
other sources said there were as many as 160 aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   The passengers included 20 women and 23 or 24 children, said Zdanovich. All
the passengers released in Moscow were male.
</P>
<P>
	   An emergency official in Kazakstan said there were 20 hijackers, but three
passengers who were released in Kazakstan said eight to 10 hijackers were
aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   The identity of the hijackers remained unclear. A diplomat familiar with the
negotiations in Moscow said the hijackers were seeking the release of a prisoner
from the Afghan city of Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
	   Afghan media speculated that the hijackers wanted the release of opposition
figure Ismail Khan, a former regional governor who has been held since 1997 by
Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement.
</P>
<P>
	   But a spokesman for the alliance fighting Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
militia denied that the Afghan opposition was responsible for the latest
hijacking. ``We condemn any act of terrorism,'' the spokesman, identified only
as Abdullah, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ten passengers were also released in Uzbekistan, the hijacked plane's first
stop, Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijacking comes six weeks after an eight-day hijacking of an Indian
Airlines plane ended peacefully in southern Afghanistan. The hijackers in that
case freed their hostages after India released three pro-Kashmiri militants from
jail.
</P>
<P>
	   After being seized over Afghanistan Sunday morning, the Afghan plane was
flown to Tashkent, Uzbekistan and then landed in the northern Kazak city of
Aktyubinsk because of a leak in its right fuel tank, the Kazak spokesman said.
It was not immediately known whether the leak was fixed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Afghan state-run airline is under international sanctions and is not
permitted to fly international routes.
</P>
<P>
	   Ariana has four aging Boeing 727 aircraft and five Russian-made Antonov
aircraft. Maintenance conditions are considered extremely poor in the country,
which is bankrupt and has been battered by more than 20 years of war. The

<HEADLINE> Mich. State Student Gets Meningitis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- A Michigan State University student was being
treated Sunday for bacterial meningitis, a potentially deadly inflammation of
the lining around the spinal cord and brain.
</P>
<P>
	   University spokesman Terry Denbow said doctors are cautiously optimistic
that the student will fully recover.
</P>
<P>
	   In October, more than 16,000 students and faculty members at Michigan State
received free meningococcus vaccinations after another student contracted the
disease.
</P>
<P>
	   Adam Busuttil lost the tips of seven fingers and a toe as a result of the
rare illness. Three other Michigan State students have contracted meningitis
since 1997; two of them died.
</P>
<P>
	   The chance of contracting meningococcus is about one in 100,000, with about
10 percent of cases resulting in death. The odds are four to six times greater
for college dormitory residents, according to the federal Centers for Disease
Control and American College Health Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Meningitis is spread through close contact, such as kissing and sharing
eating utensils. University officials on Saturday and Sunday were contacting
people who came into contact with the sick student, who did not live on campus.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials also are urging current and incoming students to get the
meningococcus vaccine, effective against four of the disease's five strains. It
has no effect on type B, which accounts for about 30 percent of the 100 to 125
cases reported among college students annually.
</P>
<P>
	   Denbow said health officials had not yet determined which strain the sick
student has.

<HEADLINE> NFC Beats AFC 51-31  </HEADLINE>
    By BEN DiPIETRO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HONOLULU (AP) -- Randy Moss set records with nine catches for 212 yards, and
Mike Alstott scored three touchdowns in the NFC's 51-31 victory over the AFC on
Sunday in the highest-scoring Pro Bowl ever.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona's Aeneas Williams and Tampa Bay's Derrick Brooks returned
interceptions for touchdowns as the NFC dominated the game from the start in
snapping a three-game AFC win streak.
</P>
<P>
	   The 82 points broke the record of 64 set in 1980.
</P>
<P>
	   Moss, the 6-foot-4 Minnesota star selected the MVP, used his height
advantage to outleap the AFC defensive backs, particularly 5-11 Sam Madison of
Miami and 6-foot James Hasty of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
	   Moss' last catch was a 25-yard TD reception from Carolina's Steve Beuerlein
with 1:05 to play that closed the scoring.
</P>
<P>
	   Alstott, the Tampa Bay fullback, scored on runs of 1, 3 and 1 yards. He
finished with 13 carries for 67 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   Brooks picked off a pass from Jacksonville quarterback Mark Brunell and
raced untouched 20 yards for a touchdown to make it 44-24 with 11:12 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Jaguars receiver Jimmy Smith caught three touchdown passes, and finished
with eight catches for 119 yards. His last score, a 52-yarder from Indianapolis'
Peyton Manning, made it 44-31 with 6:30 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Manning had two touchdown passes and two interceptions, including the
62-yard return by Williams that gave the NFC a 7-0 lead less than three minutes
into the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Williams had an open field after Colts receiver Marvin Harrison fell down,
and he raced down the left sideline for the score.
</P>
<P>
	   The next time the NFC had the ball, St. Louis quarterback Kurt Warner
connected with Moss for 48 yards to put the ball on the AFC 5. Warner, the Super
Bowl MVP, was 8-of-11 for 123 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   Detroit's Jason Hanson kicked a 21-yard field goal to make it 10-0. He had
three field goals on the day, including a 51-yarder at the end of the first half
that tied a Pro Bowl record.
</P>
<P>
	   The AFC got on the board when Brunell teamed with Smith on a 5-yard
touchdown pass with 30 seconds left in the first quarter, capping a 68-yard
drive in which Tennessee's Eddie George gained half the yards.
</P>
<P>
	   The NFC pushed its lead to 17-7 three minutes into the second quarter on a
1-yard run by Allstott, following a 46-yard pass from Warner to Moss.
</P>
<P>
	   After an exchange of turnovers, Oakland quarterback Rich Gannon connected
with Kansas City tight end Tony Gonzalez on a 10-yard pass to make it 17-14.
</P>
<P>
	   Glyn Milburn of the Chicago returned a punt to the AFC 43, starting a
five-play drive that saw Alstott score from the 3 after running for 27 yards the
previous play.
</P>
<P>
	   Manning then led the AFC on an 87-yard drive that ended with a 21-yard TD
pass to Smith with 20 seconds left in the half.
</P>
<P>
	   A 66-yard return by Michael Bates of the Carolina Panthers set up Hanson's
51-yarder as time expired.

	   Police said the plane was isolated on the airport grounds so that officials

</P>
<P>
	   ``We are very well prepared for this type of event and hope to open up
peaceful negotiations very shortly,'' Kim White, a spokeswoman for Essex Police,
told the British Broadcasting Corp. She said negotiators were on site.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ariana Airlines plane was seized earlier Sunday while on a domestic

	   Ten passengers were also released in Uzbekistan, the hijacked plane's first
stop, Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijacking comes six weeks after an eight-day hijacking of an Indian
Airlines plane ended peacefully in southern Afghanistan. The hijackers in that
case freed their hostages after India released three pro-Kashmiri militants from
jail.
</P>
<P>
	   After being seized over Afghanistan Sunday morning, the Afghan plane was
flown to Tashkent, Uzbekistan and then landed in the northern Kazak city of
Aktyubinsk because of a leak in its right fuel tank, the Kazak spokesman said.
It was not immediately known whether the leak was fixed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Afghan state-run airline is under international sanctions and is not
permitted to fly international routes.
</P>
<P>
	   Ariana has four aging Boeing 727 aircraft and five Russian-made Antonov
aircraft. Maintenance conditions are considered extremely poor in the country,
which is bankrupt and has been battered by more than 20 years of war. The
Taliban, who rule 90 percent of Afghanistan, are fighting their northern-based
enemies on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations imposed sanctions against Afghanistan's state-owned
airline in November to punish the ruling Taliban movement for its refusal to
extradite suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden, who has been living in
Afghanistan for the past few years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Taliban say they won't turn over bin Laden because Afghan culture and
tradition make it impossible to hand over a guest to his enemies.

    AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Grant Hill scored 36 points in his return to the
Detroit lineup as the Pistons beat the Houston Rockets 109-105 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Hill, who missed five of the previous seven games with a bruised back,
helped the Pistons win their second straight after losing eight of nine. Jerry
Stackhouse added 23 points and Jerome Williams had 19 points and nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Kelvin Cato scored 23 points and matched a career-high with 12 rebounds for
the Rockets, who played without injured Steve Francis for the second game in a
row. Bryce Drew matched his career high with 20 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Hill looked like he hadn't missed a game, scoring 18 first-half points to
help the Pistons take a 46-41 halftime lead. Kelvin Cato kept the Rockets in the
game with 15 points and seven rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Hill kept it up at the start of the third, scoring eight points in the first
3:30 to help Detroit extend its lead to 60-49.
</P>
<P>
	   Houston pulled within 60-54, but the Pistons went on a 9-0 run to take a
15-point lead. Terry Mills started the surge with a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
	   Hill finished the quarter with a driving layup, giving him 16 points in the
quarter and Detroit a 80-67 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Houston trailed by 16 early in the fourth, but used a 13-5 run to get within
95-87 with 3:42 left. Kenny Thomas had two inside baskets during the run.
</P>
<P>
	   Williams scored six quick points, but it still wasn't enough to put the game
away. Hill's turnover gave the Rockets the ball with a minute left, trailing by
six.
</P>
<P>
	   After a basket by Drew, Hill threw the inbound pass away and Detroit fouled
Thomas. He hit both free throws to pull the Rockets within 103-101 with 40.4
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   But Hill calmly hit a 12-footer from the left wing, and after Cato's short
jumper, Stackhouse made a pair of free throws.

	   BOSTON (AP) -- Steve Smith scored 23 and Jermaine O'Neal scored nine of his
13 points in the fourth quarter on Sunday night as the Portland Trail Blazers
pulled away from the Boston Celtics and won 100-94.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal came off the bench to grab eight rebounds and score Portland's first
seven points of the fourth, getting two dunks and a three-point play as the
Blazers won for the eighth time in nine games.
</P>
<P>
	   Vitaly Potapenko scored 19 for Boston and Kenny Anderson had 11 with 10
assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Antoine Walker had 14 points and 10 rebounds for the Celtics, but made just
5-of-16 shots and 3-of-6 free throws. Paul Pierce also struggled for Boston,
going 6-for-14 from the field and 3-for-6 from the line to finish with 16
points.
</P>
<P>
	   Scottie Pippen, who scored 19, hit a 3-pointer with 2.2 seconds left in the
third quarter to give the Blazers a 71-70 lead. O'Neal opened the fourth with
two offensive rebounds and a fourth-chance dunk, then answered Tony Battie's
jumper with a dunk off an alley-oop to make it 75-72 with 10:41 left in the
game.
</P>
<P>
	   After Danny Fortson made two free throws for Boston, O'Neal's layup and free

Hijacked Plane Lands in London
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- British police a hijacked Afghan passenger airliner landed at
London's Stansted airport early Monday. The plane was isolated on the airport
grounds so that officials could open negotiations with the hijackers. The Ariana
Airlines plane was seized earlier Sunday while on a domestic flight from the
Afghan capital, Kabul, to the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif. The plane made
stops in Uzbekistan, Kazakstan and Russia before arriving in London just after 2
a.m. (9 p.m. EST Sunday). Officials say none of the people aboard the Boeing 727
had been harmed, although it remained unclear how many people were aboard.

<HEADLINE> Trail Blazers 100, Celtics 94  </HEADLINE>
    By JIMMY GOLEN AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- Jermaine O'Neal didn't have a lot of time to change the game.
</P>
<P>
	   And he didn't need it.
</P>
<P>
	   The 21-year-old forward scored 13 points in 13 minutes, pulling down a
team-leading eight rebounds on Sunday night to lead the Portland Trail Blazers
to a 100-94 victory over the Boston Celtics.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's hard sometimes when you watch the clock dwindle down. You think 'I
know I can make things happen,"' said O'Neal, the 10th of 10 Trail Blazers to
get into the game. "But there's a lot of talent on this team."
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Smith scored 23 and Scottie Pippen added 19, hitting a 3-pointer with
2.2 seconds left in the third period to give the Blazers a lead they never lost.
That's because O'Neal scored Portland's first seven points of the fourth
quarter, and pulled down five of his six offensive rebounds in the final period
as well.
</P>
<P>
	   "We went to Jermaine and said, 'Go in there and give us some energy on the
glass,"' Portland coach Mike Dunleavy said. "He gave us some energy and did some
good things off the boards."
</P>
<P>
	   With their eighth victory in nine games, the Blazers improved to 36-11 --
the best record in the NBA, one-half game ahead of the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
	   "We felt like we should win this game hands-down," said Celtics forward Paul
Pierce, who was just 6-for-14 from the floor and 3-for 6 from the line. "They're
the premier team in the league, but we felt we should have won. We just let it
slip away."
</P>
<P>
	   Vitaly Potapenko scored 19 for Boston and Kenny Anderson had 11 with 10
assists. Antoine Walker had 14 points and 10 rebounds for the Celtics, but shot
just 5-of-16 shots and missed three of six free throws.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blazers took a 71-70 lead into the fourth quarter before O'Neal opened
the fourth with two offensive rebounds and a fourth-chance dunk. He then
answered Tony Battie's jumper with a dunk off an alley-oop to make it 75-72 with
10:41 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
	   After Danny Fortson made two free throws for Boston, O'Neal's layup and free
throw gave the Blazers a 78-74 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Portland protected its lead until Boston made a weak charge in the final
minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Walker hit a running one-hander to make it 92-88 with 1:43 left. After
Pippen made a 3-pointer from the top of the key -- his only basket of the fourth
quarter -- Walker made another 3 to keep the lead at four points.
</P>
<P>
	   Portland made three of four free throws down the stretch to clinch it.

	   ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Budroyale beat Cat Thief by 1 1/4 lengths Sunday in
the $300,000 San Antonio Handicap at Santa Anita, reversing their finish in the
Breeders' Cup Classic.
</P>
<P>
	Budroyale, the 7-year-old gelding ridden by Garrett Gomez, ran 1 1-8 miles in
1:48 3-5, and paid $6, $2.60 and $2.40. He carried 121 pounds in the five-horse
race.
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief, ridden by Pat Day at 120 pounds, returned $2.60 and $2.60, and
Elaborate paid $3.40 to show.
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief won the $5 million Breeders' Cup Classic three months ago at
Gulfstream Park at 19-1 odds, while Budroyale finished second at odds of 26-1.
</P>
<P>
	Budroyale earned $180,000 to raise his career total to $2.65 million. He has 18
victories in 46 career starts.
</P>
<P>
	Elaborate finished more than a length behind the two leaders. Moore's Flat was
fourth, followed by Dixie Dot Com.
</P>
<P>
	``Bud always seems to get a perfect trip,'' trainer Ted H. West said. ``It's
like he knows how a race is run. I don't think most horses know you're supposed
to slow down early and finish up late. He knows exactly how he's supposed to
go.''
</P>
<P>
	Budroyale gained the lead from Moore's Flat entering the stretch. Cat Thief
closed while racing wide into the stretch, but never made an impact on the
gelding.
</P>
<P>
	In the $200,000 La Canada Stakes for 4-year-old fillies on Sunday, Scholars
Studio held off a late bid by favorite Smooth Player to win by three-quarters of

<P>
    AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Grant Hill didn't take long to show the Detroit
Pistons that he was ready to come back from a bruised back.
</P>
<P>
	   Hill, who missed five of the previous seven games, scored 36 points to help
the Pistons beat the Houston Rockets 109-105 Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's incredibly obvious to say this, but we are a much better team with
Grant on the floor," Pistons coach Alvin Gentry said. "It was good to have him
out there. It was really, really good."
</P>
<P>
	   Hill helped the Pistons win their second straight after losing eight of
nine. Things went much better this time than when he tried to play last week,
struggling through a game-and-a-half before returning to the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's still sore, but it isn't limiting me like it did the last time I tried
to play," he said. "I could do everything pretty well, and that was nice."
</P>
<P>
	   Jerry Stackhouse added 23 points and Jerome Williams had 19 points and nine
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was nice to have Grant back, because he gives all of us an edge,"
Stackhouse said. "He played really well, and that meant I could rest a bit."
</P>
<P>
	   Kelvin Cato scored 23 points and matched a career-high with 12 rebounds for
the Rockets, who played without injured Steve Francis for the second game in a
row. Bryce Drew matched his career high with 20 points.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need Steve back, but Bryce has done a great job running the team," Cato
said. "We're not losing any steps there on offense, just maybe a little on
defense. We played well, but Grant's a star. I knew he would come back before
the All-Star Game."
</P>
<P>
	   Right from the tip, Hill looked like he hadn't missed a game, scoring 18
first-half points to help the Pistons take a 46-41 halftime lead. Cato kept the
Rockets in the game with 15 points and seven rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Hill kept it up at the start of the third, scoring eight points in the first
3:30 to help Detroit extend its lead to 60-49.
</P>
<P>
	   Houston pulled within 60-54, but the Pistons went on a 9-0 run to take a
15-point lead. Terry Mills started the surge with a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
	   Hill finished the quarter with a driving layup, giving him 16 points in the
quarter and Detroit a 80-67 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Houston trailed by 16 early in the fourth, but used a 13-5 run to get within
95-87 with 3:42 left. Kenny Thomas had two inside baskets during the run.
</P>
<P>
	   Williams scored six quick points, but it still wasn't enough to put the game
away. Hill's turnover gave the Rockets the ball with a minute left, trailing by
six.
</P>
<P>
	   After a basket by Drew, Hill threw the inbound pass away and Detroit fouled
Thomas. He hit both free throws to pull the Rockets within 103-101 with 40.4
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   But Hill calmly hit a 12-footer from the left wing, and after Cato's short
jumper, Stackhouse made a pair of free throws.
</P>
<P>
	   "It wasn't pretty, but I'm not worried," Stackhouse said. "It's always hard
to maintain a big lead in this league, but we made the plays at the end that we
needed to make."
</P>
<P>
	   Drew, though, tried to look at the rally as a positive.
</P>
<P>
	   "That just showed us that no matter how far down you are, you can always
come back," he said. "If we had won, we would have definitely snuck out with one
because they were in control. But I guess it was encouraging to get close at the
end."

<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Jason Kidd had 22 points, 12 assists and seven rebounds and
Rodney Rogers added 22 points as the Phoenix Suns used a dominant third quarter
to beat the Seattle SuperSonics 105-93 on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Kidd had 16 points and eight assists in the second half. Penny Hardaway
added 19 points and six assists for the Suns, who lost in Seattle 94-86 on
Friday night. Rogers, who had a season-high 26 in Seattle, was 8-for-12 from the
field.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Gugliotta scored 13 of his 16 points in the second half and grabbed nine
rebounds for Phoenix, which split its season series with Seattle 2-2.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday night, Seattle's Gary Payton got the best of Kidd in a matchup of two
of the NBA's best point guards. This one, though, went to Kidd. Payton had 13
points on 4-for-18 shooting and scored one point in the second half. He had
seven assists and seven rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Rashard Lewis scored a career-high 21 for Seattle. Brent Barry added 14
points for the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
	   After a close first half, the Suns scored nine in a row to take a 57-47 lead
on Kidd's 3-pointer with 8:45 left in the third quarter. After Seattle cut it to
64-58 on Chuck Person's 3-pointer, Phoenix outscored the Sonics 13-4 over the
last three minutes of the third to go up 77-62 entering the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Kidd scored the first six points of the run on a driving stuff, two free
throws and a slick, left-handed cross-over move. Rogers capped the spurt with
two free throws and a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
	   Seattle coach Paul Westphal, who used to coach the Suns and once was a star
player for Phoenix, was ejected from the game on two technicals from referee
Jack Nies with 7:49 to play. Kidd made both free throws to give Phoenix its
largest lead, 90-70.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither team led by more than five points in the first half. The Suns led
46-45 at the break.

<HEADLINE> US Urged To Closely Eye Russia Nukes  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. efforts to keep Russia's nuclear weapons materiel
away from rogue nations or terrorists may fail without increased government
money and attention, a bipartisan group of foreign policy experts warns.
</P>
<P>
	   The report examined the worldwide threat posed by the potential theft of
nuclear materiel from Russia's haphazardly protected stockpiles. It urges
immediate action by the White House and Congress to expand the U.S. assistance
program -- or face a possible catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton, in his fiscal year 2001 budget being released Monday,
will seek sizable increases in money for the safeguard programs, according to
administration sources.
</P>
<P>
	   Ensuring the safety of hundreds of tons of Russian plutonium and highly
enriched uranium is among the most daunting post-Cold War challenges at a time
of political and economic turmoil in Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   The foreign policy experts urged that the United States buy $1 billion more
of highly enriched uranium from Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington also should step up efforts to help consolidate the more than
1,000 tons of plutonium and uranium now scattered in 300 buildings and 50 sites
across Russia, according to the 117-page report by the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a leading Washington foreign policy think tank.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The possibility that the essential ingredients of nuclear weapons could
fall into the hands of terrorists and proliferating states is all too real,''
the report warns.
</P>
<P>
	   The study was based on findings by leading foreign policy and nuclear
weapons proliferation experts, including former senior officials from past
Democratic and Republican administrations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must take action to prevent a catastrophe,'' said former Sen. San Nunn,
D-Ga., the group's chairman who also heads the center's global nuclear materials
management program.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1992, the Energy Department has spent about $1.2 billion on various
programs related to protecting Russian nuclear materiel. Among them: helping
Russian nuclear scientists find jobs, improving physical safeguards at nuclear
facilities and reducing the stockpile of weapons-grade uranium and plutonium.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, one of the report's authors, Matthew Bunn, said the money set aside
for these programs is ``woefully insufficient,'' and more spending would be
``tiny in comparison to the cost and risks of failure to act.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``For the cost of one B-2 bomber (about $2 billion), we might get all the
excess bomb uranium in Russia blended to a form that could never again be used
in weapons,'' said Bunn, a nuclear proliferation expert at Harvard's John F.
Kennedy School of Government.
</P>
<P>
	   He cautioned that ``the window for cooperation may be closing'' because of
increased hostility in Russia toward the West. ``It is clear already that the
atmosphere for sensitive nuclear cooperation is much worse today than it was in
1992 and 1993,'' said Bunn in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   The theft of just a few pounds of highly enriched Russian uranium or
plutonium ``could allow a rogue state or terrorists group to acquire a nuclear
capability, posing a severe threat to the international community,'' the study
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The ``lack of sufficient funding and senior leadership attention on the U.S.
side are among the major factors preventing faster and more effective actions to
reduce these serious security threats,'' the report continued.
</P>
<P>
	   Rose Gottmoeller, the Energy Department's assistant secretary in charge of
the programs, said she hopes the report will increase attention on the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've been chipping away at this problem steadily for eight years. But
there's a lot more work to do,'' Gottmoeller, a member of the expert panel, said
in an interview.

<HEADLINE> Hijackings in Recent Years  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Some of the more dramatic hijackings in recent years:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Five hijackers seize Indian Airlines flight carrying 178 passengers and
11 crew members on Dec. 24, 1999, after its departure from Katmandu, Nepal. The
captors kill one passenger and release others in the early stages of the
hijacking. The hijackers leave the parked plane in Afghanistan with 155 hostages
on board on Dec. 31 after India agrees to release three prisoners.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Shiite gunmen hijack a Kuwait Airways jumbo jet en route from Thailand to
Kuwait on April 5, 1988, and divert it to Iran, Cyprus and Algeria. They demand
Kuwait free 17 pro-Iranian terrorists. The hijackers kill two passengers. They
free the rest on April 20 and are allowed to leave Algiers .
</P>
<P>
	   -- Shiite gunmen seize the TWA Boeing 727, forcing it to Beirut, Lebanon on
June 14, 1985. They demand the release of 700 Arabs held by Israel. A U.S. Navy
diver is killed and 39 Americans are held until they are released on July 1
after Syrian mediation.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Shiite gunmen seize a Kuwait Airways plane from Dubai, United Arab
Emirates on Dec. 3, 1984, and force it to Tehran, Iran. The hijackers demand
that the Kuwaiti government free 17 people convicted of carrying out bombings of
U.S. and French facilities in Kuwait. Two Americans are killed. The standoff
ends on Dec. 8 when Iranian security forces disguised as cleaners storm the
jetliner.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Three Pakistanis commandeer a Pakistan International Airlines plane on a
flight from Karachi to Peshawar on March 2, 1981 and force the craft to fly to
Afghanistan and then to Syria. Hijackers leave the aircraft on March 14 after
Pakistan agrees to free 54 political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Palestinian and German terrorists hijack an Air France airliner to
Entebbe, Uganda, on June 27, 1976, and demand the release of 53 pro-Palestinian
prisoners in Israel, Kenya and Europe. Israeli commandos raid the craft and
rescue the hostages on July 4. Four civilians are killed during the rescue
operation.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine divert an El
Al flight from Rome to Tel Aviv, to Algiers on July 23 1968. The last hostages
are released Sept. 1.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Switches Roles With Wife  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) -- Not a word.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton grinned, chuckled, clapped and leapt to his feet in
admiration as his wife made her formal political debut Sunday, but the president
was a silent partner. For perhaps the first time since he became president seven
years ago, the famously talkative president attended a political rally and
didn't go near the podium.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton felt strongly that Hillary
Rodham Clinton's Senate announcement should be a solo affair.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps he also was adapting the classic advice to the mother of the groom
-- shut up and wear beige. Clinton chose a dark suit and sat behind his wife as
she made her candidacy official at the State University of New York at Purchase.
He appeared to be bursting with pride and a little nervous, too.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton helped with the 30-minute speech, which contained scant reference to
him. A naturally polished speaker, he also apparently coached his less-practiced
wife on her delivery.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking rather like a parent at a child's piano recital, he leaned forward
and nodded along as Mrs. Clinton delivered key lines.
</P>
<P>
	   He was first on his feet to applaud when she said the words: ``I am honored
today to announce my candidacy for the United States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before her speech, the partisan crowd watched an 18-minute video biography
of Mrs. Clinton's life. Her husband's name was never mentioned, although he
appeared briefly and has a one-line speaking part in the production.
</P>
<P>
	   The video is the work of Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, the Hollywood television
producer whose soft focus video about Clinton himself called ``A Man from
Hope,'' introduced the candidate during the 1992 convention.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton has taken other pains recently to separate herself from the
White House, something pollsters say she must do to win in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   She largely moved out of the White House last month and spends most of her
time campaigning.
</P>
<P>
	   Her new campaign website, Hillary2000.org, refers to her simply as
``Hillary,'' with nary a mention of the first couple's shared last name.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesmen for both the president and the first lady were vague last week
about Clinton's role in Sunday's careful script.
</P>
<P>
	   As it turned out, Clinton played even less of a role in his wife's campaign
event than she usually has played in his. New York Democratic Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, whose job Mrs. Clinton hopes to take in November, made the
introduction, while the president remained seated behind him.
</P>
<P>
	   After the speech, Clinton, the first lady, daughter Chelsea, and Mrs.
Clinton's mother, Dorothy Rodham, greeted supporters and campaign workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked by a television crew about his wife's performance on stage, the
president said: ``She was fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton attended a party for political supporters of Mrs. Clinton's later
Sunday, but on Monday they return to parallel universes.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, the president, had a busy day planned, beginning with an early
flight back to Washington to present his final presidential budget proposals to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, the Senate candidate, planned to begin a weeklong campaign swing
through upstate New York.

<HEADLINE> Oil Spills Into Pa. Wildlife Refuge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Thousands of gallons of crude oil spilled into a
national wildlife refuge in southwest Philadelphia during the weekend after a
refinery pipeline began leaking.
</P>
<P>
	   The 24-inch pipe began leaking Saturday and spread about 25,000 gallons of
oil beneath the icy surface of a pond, officials said. Scientists aren't sure
how severely wildlife in the 1,200-acre reserve will be affected.
</P>
<P>
	   Clean up crews were working round-the-clock Sunday to remove the oil.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a very unique situation. We've never had, in my experience, an oil
recovery situation beneath the surface of ice,'' said John McCann of the Sunoco
Refinery, which operates the pipeline that bisects the John Heinz National
Wildlife Refuge.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators won't know what caused the underground pipe to leak until they
dig it up, he said.

Hijacked Plane Lands in London
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- A hijacked Afghan passenger airliner landed at London's
Stansted airport early Monday, police say. The plane was isolated on the airport
grounds so that officials could open negotiations with the hijackers. The Ariana
Airlines plane was seized earlier Sunday while on a domestic flight from the
Afghan capital, Kabul, to the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif. The plane made
stops in Uzbekistan, Kazakstan and Russia before arriving in London just after 2
a.m. (9 p.m. EST Sunday). Officials say none of the people aboard the Boeing 727
had been harmed, although it remained unclear how many people were aboard.

Russians Seize Last Rebel Stronghold in Grozny

Russia's months-long drive to take the Chechen capital. Putin said federal
troops had taken control of the western Zavodskoi district of the capital and
raised the Russian flag over an administration building there. "A short while

interview with state-controlled ORT television. "So, we can say the operation to

Switzerland, derailed shortly after midnight at a switch, said German railways

<TEXT>
<P>
    NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Atiba Prater became Vanderbilt's career assist lead
and Dan Langhi scored 16 points to lead the 24th-ranked Commodores to a 76-58
victory over Boston College on Sunday night, the Eagles' ninth straight loss.
</P>
<P>
	   Prater, a 6-foot-1 senior, broke Frank Seckar's record early in the second
half with his 456th assist. He leads the Southeastern Conference this season
with 6.3 assists per game.
</P>
<P>
	   Vanderbilt (15-4) has won 33 straight non-conference home games. The last
team from outside the SEC to win at Memorial Gym was Boston College, which won
90-74 on Dec. 30, 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Uka Agbai had 19 points for the Eagles (9-13), who matched the school record
for a losing streak set from Jan. 2-31, 1990. Leading scorer Troy Bell finished
0-for-9 from the field.
</P>
<P>
	   The Commodores' 15 wins under first-year coach Kevin Stallings surpassed the
number they had last season.
</P>
<P>
	   A 19-9 run at the start of the second half helped BC climb within 55-46, but
Vanderbilt's Rick Jones hit a key 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
	   Boston College, which lost 59-58 at St. John's on Saturday, didn't arrive in
Nashville until about 10 p.m. Saturday. The Eagles elected not to practice
Sunday morning when they were told the only time available would be 10-11 a.m.,

<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rookie Elton Brand scored 21 points and the Chicago
Bulls overcame a 16-point deficit to beat the Los Angeles Clippers for the
eighth straight time, 100-90 on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Toni Kukoc had 20 points and 10 rebounds for the Bulls, who dealt the
Clippers their fourth straight loss and 18th in 20 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Maurice Taylor scored 23 points and Troy Hudson added 19 off the bench for
the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
	   Brand ignited a 14-2 run with a slam dunk and capped it with a short jumper,
as the Bulls turned a three-point deficit into a 66-57 lead with 2:55 left in
the third quarter. They maintained that margin through the end of the period
before the Clippers reduced it to 83-77 on consecutive layups by Hudson and
Taylor, followed by Taylor's 17-footer with 5:41 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   But Los Angeles never got closer, as Kukoc sealed the win for Chicago with
four free throws and a slam dunk in the final 3 1-2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bulls hit 12 of their first 17 shots in the second quarter, trimming a
16-point deficit to 45-44 with 1:07 left in the half. Kukoc fueled a 19-6 run
with 10 points in a span of 3 1-2 minutes, including a short hook shot that
capped the rally. Rookie Ron Artest's slam dunk one minute into the third
quarter gave the Bulls a 50-49 lead, their first since Artest's game-opening
layup.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Olowokandi, who didn't make more than five field goals in any of his
previous eight games, shot 5-for-6 in the first quarter alone to help Los
Angeles take a 29-13 lead. But he finished with only 12 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clippers forced 10 turnovers in the period en route to their second-best
defensive quarter of the season, and connected on 10 of their first 13 shots.
</P>
<P>
	   The game marked the first-ever meeting between Brand, the top pick in the
NBA draft, and Clippers rookie Lamar Odom, the fourth overall pick. Odom was the
rookie of the month in November and Brand earned the honors in January.

<HEADLINE> Hijacked Plane Lands in London  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY RENFREW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- The Afghan passenger airliner forced by
unidentified hijackers on a tense journey across Central Asia and Europe landed
at London's Stansted airport early Monday. So far there have been no reported
injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boeing 727 taxied to a secluded spot on a runway about half-mile from
the main terminal. Police and emergency vehicles assembled nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ariana Airlines plane was seized shortly after take off Sunday, about
12:30 a.m. EST Sunday, while on a domestic flight from the Afghan capital,
Kabul, to the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif. The plane made stops in
Uzbekistan, Kazakstan and Russia before arriving in London just after 2 a.m. (9
p.m. EST Sunday).
</P>
<P>
	   Essex Police Deputy Chief Constable Charles Clark said that negotiators had
made contact with the plane. He said he could not confirm the number or identity
of the hostage-takers, nor anything about the demands.
</P>
<P>
	   The talks were conducted in English, he said. Clark said the team includes
interpreters, but did not reveal what language the interpreters spoke. ``Things
seem to be calm at this moment'' on the plane, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark said that as far as police can tell, there are 140 people on the
plane, including the hijackers and crew.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our policing priority is clearly and will remain clearly the safe release
of everybody on that aircraft,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kim White, a spokeswoman for the local Essex Police department, said
authorities are well prepared for hijackings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a contingency plan which we regularly practice for these types of
events and have dealt with hijacks at Stansted in the past,'' White told the
British Broadcasting Corp. ``So we are very well prepared for this type of event
and hope to open up peaceful negotiations very shortly.''
</P>
<P>
	   When planes have been hijacked and crews have been ordered to land in
Britain, it has become routine to route them to Stansted, 38 miles north of
London. Planes can be kept well away from the terminal building and other
aircraft while negotiations can be carried on with the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers released nine passengers in Moscow, but made no political
demands, Russian security service spokesman Alexander Zdanovich told reporters
at Sheremetyevo-1 airport. He said the hijackers had asked only for food, for
the plane's toilets to be cleaned and for refueling while in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   None of the people aboard the jet had been harmed, Zdanovich said, although
it remained unclear how many people were aboard. Russian news reports said there
were 131 passengers and nine crew before the release in Moscow, but other
sources said there were as many as 160 aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   The passengers included 20 women and 23 or 24 children, said Zdanovich. All
the passengers released in Moscow were male.
</P>
<P>
	   An emergency official in Kazakstan said there were 20 hijackers, but three
passengers who were released in Kazakstan said eight to 10 hijackers were
aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   The identity of the hijackers remained unclear. A diplomat familiar with the
negotiations in Moscow said the hijackers were seeking the release of a prisoner
from the Afghan city of Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
	   Afghan media speculated that the hijackers wanted the release of opposition
figure Ismail Khan, a former regional governor who has been held since 1997 by
Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement.
</P>
<P>
	   But a spokesman for the alliance fighting Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
militia denied that the Afghan opposition was responsible for the latest
hijacking. ``We condemn any act of terrorism,'' the spokesman, identified only
as Abdullah, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ten passengers were also released in Uzbekistan, the hijacked plane's first
stop, Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijacking comes six weeks after an eight-day hijacking of an Indian
Airlines plane ended peacefully in southern Afghanistan. The hijackers in that
case freed their hostages after India released three pro-Kashmiri militants from
jail.
</P>
<P>
	   After being seized over Afghanistan Sunday morning, the Afghan plane was
flown to Tashkent, Uzbekistan and then landed in the northern Kazak city of
Aktyubinsk because of a leak in its right fuel tank, the Kazak spokesman said.
It was not immediately known whether the leak was fixed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Afghan state-run airline is under international sanctions and is not
permitted to fly international routes.
</P>
<P>
	   Ariana has four aging Boeing 727 aircraft and five Russian-made Antonov
aircraft. Maintenance conditions are considered extremely poor in the country,
which is bankrupt and has been battered by more than 20 years of war. The
Taliban, who rule 90 percent of Afghanistan, are fighting their northern-based
enemies on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations imposed sanctions against Afghanistan's state-owned
airline in November to punish the ruling Taliban movement for its refusal to
extradite suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden, who has been living in
Afghanistan for the past few years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Taliban say they won't turn over bin Laden because Afghan culture and
tradition make it impossible to hand over a guest to his enemies.

raised the Russian flag over an administration building there. "A short while

away from rogue nations or terrorists may fail without increased government
money and attention, a bipartisan group of foreign policy experts warns. The
report examined the worldwide threat posed by the potential theft of nuclear
materiel from Russia's haphazardly protected stockpiles. It urges immediate
action by the White House and Congress to expand the U.S. assistance program --
or face a possible catastrophe. The study was based on findings by leading
foreign policy and nuclear weapons proliferation experts, including former
senior officials from past Democratic and Republican administrations.

Texas Cleric Denies Terror Links

<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- Lawyers for a Muslim leader in Texas denied accusations by
federal prosecutors that he served as an intermediary for Osama bin Laden's
suspected terrorist network. Moataz Al-Hallak, imam of the Islamic Society of
Arlington mosque, provided only religious advice to a pilot on how to handle the
purchase of a small jet in accord with Islamic law, said his lawyer, Stan Cohen.
The plane crashed in the early 1990s while being used by one of bin Laden's
businesses, Cohen said. Bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire exile, is accused of
masterminding the 1998 bombing of two U.S. embassies in Africa. The attacks in
Kenya and Tanzania killed 224 people, including 12 Americans.
