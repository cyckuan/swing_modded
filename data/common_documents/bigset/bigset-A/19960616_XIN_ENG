LONDON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A 62nd minute goal by Irina Kuhnt
helped Germany to a 1-0 victory over Britain and put them at the
top of the table in the women's pre-Olympic field hockey

<P>
Kuhnt glanced the ball past Hilary Rose from Heike Latszch's

The Germans, Olympic silver medallists, created more scoring

<HEADLINE> At Least 60 Injured in Explosion in Manchester </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 60 people were injured
when a car blew up in central Manchester Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The car exploded around 11.20 a.m. local time (1020 GMT) in the
heart of the city's shopping center as bomb squad officers were
examining it, police said.
</P>
<P>
It's not clear whether the bomb is the work of the Irish
Republican Army, which broke off its 18-month ceasefire in
February in protest at the lack of progress over peace talks in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Police had started to clear the area after a coded telephone
warning when the car exploded.
</P>
<P>
"A vehicle was identified as being suspicious and evacuations
and roadblocks took place in the city center," police said.
</P>
<P>
"Shortly after 11.20 a.m., bomb disposal experts were examining
the vehicle using a mechanical device when it detonated", a police
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Forty people, most of them suffering from glass wounds, had
arrived at Manchester Royal Infirmary within an hour of the
explosion, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Another hospital said it was treating 21 people, including two
with major injuries.
</P>
<P>
The explosion shattered windows half a mile (800 meters) away,
and the blast could be heard 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) away.
</P>
<P>
"The Arndale Center, which is the heart of the city shopping
area, the whole side, the gable end, has just been blown away,"
said Gary O'Neil of the Manchester Fire Brigade.
</P>
<P>
A second explosion occurred sometime later, but police said
later it was a controlled explosion of a suspect package.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of soccer fans are in Manchester for Sunday's Euro 96
championship tournament match between Germany and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the bomb blast, Gerry Adams, president of Sinn
Fein, the IRA's political wing, said it remained firmly set on peace.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the cause of this morning's incident in Manchester,
Sinn Fein's focus remains firmly fixed on the need to restore the
peace process and we will not be deflected from that task," said
Adams.
</P>
<P>
Manchester was the target of Irish Republican Army bombing on
December 3, 1992. More than 60 people were injured by flying glass
and debris when two bombs exploded during a weekday rush hour.
</P>
<P>
Manchester, 180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of London, was
also among the cities hit by small IRA incendiary devices placed
in stores during the 1991 Christmas shopping season.
</P>
<P>
The IRA, which wants eventual unification between Northern
Ireland and Ireland, has bombed Britain frequently during its
25-year campaign to oust Britain from the province.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,200 people have died in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
A ceasefire announced by the IRA in September 1994, was broken
in February this year after the terrorist group bombed a an office
block in London in protest at the British government's refusal to
start substantive peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Talks finally started on June 10 among all the major players in
Northern Ireland, except Sinn Fein, who have been barred from the
talks because of the IRA's refusal to agree to Britain and
Ireland's insistence that the truce be restored.
</P>
<P>
The all-party talks are supposed to create cross-border ties
between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic and work out
details of disarming the IRA and its Protestant Loyalist foes.

<HEADLINE> China Beats South Korea in Olympic Basketball Warm-up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Asian champion China beat
runner-up South Korea 109-84 in the opening match of the 7th
Super Henderson Cup Basketball Invitational Championship here
Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese led the first half 61-38.
</P>
<P>
Both teams take the current event as one of their key warm-up
matches for the coming Olympic Games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
In the other match this evening, defending champion Energy of
Hong Kong came from 41-42 down at the first half to win over
Seapower 85-47.
</P>
<P>
China had a flying start as it took a 24-12 lead six minutes
into play and seven minutes later, they widened the gap to 23
points at 44-21.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese obviously slowed down from then on and their loose
defense was often ripped by South Korea's counter-offensives.
</P>
<P>
The South Koreans made the best use of the chances and
launched waves upon waves of effective attacks to narrow the gap.
</P>
<P>
But the taller and more skillful Chinese lost no more time to
stop the South Korean assault by taking most of the rebounds.
</P>
<P>
"Our players failed to make good use of our lead and they just
slackened off in the defense," said China's head coach Gong Luming.
</P>
<P>
"The main problem for us today is not offensives but the
defense. We've lost too much points," he added.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yudong, China's center forward, was the highest scorer with
32 points while forward Hyun Joo Yeup scored most for South Korea,
with 19 points.
</P>
<P>
Frankwell, the five-team event's other side, represented by the
Ukrainian national team, had a bye on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The team faces South Korea and China takes on Energy on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The five-day preliminaries end next Wednesday, with the top
four sides entering the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
The final is set for next Saturday.

WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States is ready for
any outcome of Sunday's Russian presidential election and will do
what is necessary to defend American interests, a senior
U.S. official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"This administration is ready for any conceivable outcome,"
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said when briefing
reporters before the poll which pits incumbent Russian President
Boris Yeltsin against his main challenger Communist Gennady
Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the U.S. government "will do what is necessary
to defend the interests of the United States," if Russia takes an
undemocratic turn after the poll.
</P>
<P>
Talbott, a close friend of U.S. President Bill Clinton and the
U.S. government's chief policy maker on Russia, said any
government in Russia would be judged on certain key issues.
</P>
<P>
He said these issues would center on military and security
concerns, including the two countries' continuing determination and
ability to manage their nuclear relationship.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Meets Serbian President on Bosnian Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
for Balkan affairs John Kornblum briefed Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic today on the outcome of a meeting in Florence,
Italy, especially about the decision to hold elections in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a meeting with the Serbian president, Kornblum
told reporters that they also discussed in detail the issue
concerning putting on extra pressure to oust Bosnian Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
At a ministerial meeting on Thursday and Friday in Florence,
the international community demanded a swift removal of Karadzic
from power and stated that his continued presence was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Kornblum, who attended the conference, arrived here today "to
deliver a strong message" to Milosevic on removing the indicted
Serb hardliner and his army commander Ratko Mladic, also indicted
as war criminal suspect, from the political scene, local reports
said.
</P>
<P>
"We expected President Milosevic to help the full
implementation of the Dayton peace agreement," Kornblum said.
</P>
<P>
He added that his exchange of views with Milosevic was "very
good" and that an understanding was demonstrated at the talks
about things that needed to be done for the further implementation
of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Kornblum's trip to Belgrade was part of the international
efforts to oust Karadzic and Mladic. The International community
has regarded the continued presence of the two Serb leaders in
power as the biggest obstacle to the peace process and the general
elections slated for September in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
At the talks, the two sides also discussed issues concerning
bilateral relations between Bosnia and the United States, a
statement issued by the Serbian presidential office said.
</P>
<P>
"It has been concluded that progress has been made in that
respect and that the normalization of relations between the two
countries is in the interest of strengthening peace and stability
in the region," it added.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Optimistic on Using New Therapy for AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists have expressed
optimism on use of a new therapy that has proved to be quite
successful in reducing the levels of H.I.V., the virus that can
cause AIDS, in patients' blood.
</P>
<P>
The new therapy involves combining a new class of anti-H.I.V.
drugs, called protease inhibitors, with older drugs like AZT and
related compounds, according to the New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
The new drugs block the action of protease, an enzyme necessary
for viral replication, and many of the older drugs interfere with
reverse transcriptase, another vital viral enzyme, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that months of studies with these drug
combinations indicate that the therapies can radically reduce the
levels of H.I.V. in patients blood.
</P>
<P>
Compared with earlier drug therapy that could reduce H.I.V.
levels to tenfold, the new teatments appear to cut blood viral
measurements by as much as 1,000 times, even to undetectable
levels, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
"This is the most hopeful therapy we have seen so far in
combining the AIDS," William E Paul, director of the office of
AIDS Research at the National Institutes of health, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The data on using the therapies for a year or more will be
reported next month at an international AIDS meeting in Vancouver
in the United States.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Promises Help For Bosnian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana said on Saturday that the Nato-led peace-keeping forces
will provide help as much as possible for the upcoming elections
in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
But the responsibility for the success of elections lies with
the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE),
said Solana following his meeting here with Bosnian president
Alija Izetbegovic.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to do our best within our ability so that the
elections are prepared and are a success," said the NATO chief who
was here for a one-day visit after an overnight stop in Zagreb
</P>
<P>
"But again it is not our responsibility, it is the
responsibility of OSCE to make those elections a success and we
are going to do our best," he said.
</P>
<P>
Solana said that as part of involvement in the elections, NATO
troops will "guarantee freedom of movement" throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic said that Solana and NATO top commander General
George Joulwan, who also attended the meeting, promised to help
implement the civilian aspects of the Dayton agreement, which
include freedom of movement and return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
OSCE, charged by the Dayton accord to organized the Bosnia
elections, is expected to announce an election date by the end of
the month. But many OSCE field workers fear that unless certain
conditions such as the freedom of movement are drastically
improved, there would not be "free and fair elections".

<HEADLINE> Bomb Explodes in English City of Manchester </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 15 (Xinhua) - A bomb exploded today in a parked
car in the center of the northern English city of Manchester and a
total of 206 people are reported hurt, four of them critically.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Manchester said police could not say for certain
at moment whether the blast was the result of a controlled
explosion. A police spokeswoman was quoted as saying "we had
received a coded warning and we had evacuated the Arndale Shopping
Center and told people to stay away".
</P>
<P>
The alert caused severe traffic disruption in the area around
Market Street and the shopping center. Bus and tram services were
also disrupted.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major blamed the Irish Republican
Army (IRA) for the blast in a statement issued by his office,
saying "this explosion looks like the work of the IRA."
</P>
<P>
Calling the attack a "callous act of terrorism", Major added,
"it is the work of a few fanatics and, as Irish Prime Minister
john Bruton has made clear, causes absolute revulsion in Ireland
as it does here."
</P>
<P>
Major demanded that the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein put
pressure on its guerilla allies to reinstate a ceasefire. Sinn
Fein is banned from talks on the future of Northern Ireland that
started last week and will not be allowed in until the IRA
reinstates the ceasefire it broke last February with a series of
bomb attacks in London.
</P>
<P>
The IRA often bombed cities in Britain's mainland as part of
its 25-year campaign to drive the British from Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Asked to Intervene in Burundi (by Pei Shanqin) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Burundi peace mediator
Mwalimu Julius Nyerere here today asked African countries to
intervene in the country if his peace initiatives failed.
</P>
<P>
The former Tanzanian President briefed the press of the
current political developments in that war-battered country.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere was reacting to a question posed on him on whether he
sanctioned the idea of military intervention as suggested by some
African countries recently.
</P>
<P>
"I don't find anything bad in intervening with the situation
in Burundi if it gets off-hand," he said, adding "we cannot keep
quite when we see our neighbours kill each other."
</P>
<P>
He said the current developments in Burundi indicated that the
country would plunge into blood-shed on a genocidal scale, like
the neighbouring Rwanda where some one million people were
slaughtered in 1994.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, there was a big possibility for the
antagonistic parties in Burundi to strike a deal for an
everlasting peace in their country through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The mediator said that the bone of the conflict was that both
the hutu and the tutsi feared for their existance.
</P>
<P>
The Hutu accounts for an estimated 85 percent of Burundi's 5.6
million people. Burundi's blood letting was triggered by a failed
coup against the government of Ndedaye and his Front for
Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU), which won 71 percent of the vote
in 1993 and ousted the Tutsi dominated UPRONA Party.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere said that Burundi should emulate the South African
experience where after years of antagonistic life between the
Boers and the black they had now burried their hatchets and lived
in harmony.
</P>
<P>
He said, just as the majority of the people in the South
African army were the whites, they were under the command of
President Mandela, who is a black man.
</P>
<P>
It could be easier for the Tutsi-dominated army to be faithful
to Hutu President Sylevestre Ntibantunganya, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere pointed out that one of the bottlenecks for an
overlasting peace in Burundi was that the army did not take
orders from politicians.
</P>
<P>
"The army should be taking orders from the politicians who are
the rulers and not the vice-versa," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism that one day the antagonistic parties in
Burundi would sit in a round table for a dialogue. enditem

one-China and called for stronger ties between Tanzania and
China.
</P>
<P>
He told Chinese Ambassador Xie Youkun at the State House this
morning that his government is committed to the strengthening of
the existing ties between the two countries in both the economic
and political spheres.
</P>
<P>
Following the economic restructuring taking place in the two

closely work with the private sector so as to inject a new
economic impetus.
</P>
<P>
Xie shared the president's view, saying the need to involve
more private actors in the economic field is essential.
</P>
<P>
He told Mkapa that a Chinese delegation led by Deputy Minister
for Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Liu Shanzai will arrive
here tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Liu will sign an agreement with the Tanzania government for a
new Chinese grant, part of which would be used for the Kiwira
coal project, which was established more then 10 years ago, with
Chinese assistance in Kiwira area, south-western Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Another agreement to be signed would involve the provision of
a Chinese soft loan as working capital for the Urafiki textiles
under the new Sino-Tanzania joint venture.

message from President Jiang Zemin of the People's Republic of

Nelson Mandela today voiced his cautious support of a joint rally
between the African National Congress (ANC) and the Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP) to cement peace efforts in Kwazulu/Natal
Province.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a luncheon for ANC veterans in

IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on Monday that he was
willing to host a joint rally between himself and Mandela in an
attempt to spread the message of peace and political tolerance to
supporters at grassroots level.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said he believed that the joint action by the ANC
and IFP leaders could bring an end to the increasing violence in
the strife-torn province.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the politically-motivated violence between
the ANC and IFP supporters in Kwazulu/Natal had claimed the lives
of about 20,000 people since the mid-1980s. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Charles Taylor and Alhaji Kromah,
two factional leaders in the Liberian dispute, have expressed
regret over the latest breach of the ceasefire in the country,
the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
This has raised doubts about the implementation of the Abuja
Peace Accord signed last August.
</P>
<P>
"We are all ashamed of the events of the last few weeks,"
Taylor of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia told
journalists on the entourage of Nigerian Foreign Affairs Minister
Tom Ikimi, who arrived in Monrovia, Liberia, on Tuesday for a
four-day working visit.
</P>
<P>
Taylor said in spite of the incident which involved the
bombardment of Roosevelt Johnson's camp at the Barclay training
center in Monrovia by troops loyal to him and Alhaji Kromah, they
were still committed to the implementation of the Abuja peace
plan.
</P>
<P>
He however called for the review of unspecified aspects of the
plan in line with the prevailing realities in the country, adding
that factional leaders should move quickly to evolve an
implementation timetable that would be presented to the meeting
of Foreign Ministers of the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS), scheduled for Abuja next month.
</P>
<P>
While expressing his regret, Alhaji Kromah said he is
optimistic that peace in Liberia would have been restored to the
level before the breach of ceasefire on April 6, by the next
ECOWAS meeting in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
He said the troops of his faction, the ULIMO-K, have been
ready to disarm in tandem with other factions in line with the
requirements of the Abuja peace accord.

<HEADLINE> Aid Workers Search for Liberian Refugee Ship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- International aid workers today
started to search for the Russian-flagged Liberian refugee ship
by sending a helicopter out above the Atlantic Ocean off the west
African coast.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Medecins Sans Frontiers (meaning Doctors
without Borders) said here today that concern was mounting over
the condition of the west Africans on board the ship, many of
them Liberians, who were last supplied with 25,000 liters of
water 11 days ago.
</P>
<P>
''We want to pinpoint where the ship is. We want to eyeball
it, because no one seems to know where it is and Ghana doesn't
want to tell,'' Phil Doherty said this afternoon before the
departure of the helicopter.
</P>
<P>
''If there are 450 people on that small, Russian fishing boat,
condition must be pretty bad for them,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
He was worried that they might have run out of drinking water.
</P>
<P>
An Australian doctor, a Spanish marine expert and a Canadian
logistician took off in the small helicopter from Abidjan, Cote
d'Ivoire, to scan the west African coast, mainly off Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Ghana, maintaining a hardline policy against refugees from
Liberia's six-year-old civil war, has refused to allow the
resting freighter Zolotitsa to dock, citing social unrest that
might be entailed from the action.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Ghanaian navy towed the vessel off
Takoradi port further into international waters and there has
been no news about the refugee ship.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the ship was heading towards Cote d'Ivoire but
the Abidjan port authority said it had had no word from the
captain.
</P>
<P>
''There would have been more hostile reception here than in
Ghana,'' said international aid workers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Abidjan authority had declared that it would not
admit any more Liberian refugees on top of more than 300,000 that
it had already hosted.
</P>
<P>
The international aid workers were now worried that even if
the refugee ship is identified, problems remained as to how to
persuade the west African governments to allow it to dock.

<HEADLINE> Complexion of ECOMOG Needs Change: Nigerian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- nigeria's Foreign Minister Tom
Ikimi said today that it might be necessary to change the
complexion of the West African Peacekeeping Force, known as
ECOMOG, which has been operating in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
As part of the strategy to return peace to war-torn Liberia,
this will enable ECOMOG to enforce peace in the country, Ikimi
said while reviewing his working visit to Liberia.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the News Agency of Nigeria reaching
today from Freetown, Sierra Leone, the minister said that it
would be ''unfortunate'' if the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) took the decision to pull out its
monitoring group from Liberia in view of the enormous investment
already made toward peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
Apart from this investment, he said, the refugee problem
created by the crisis should compel the sub-regional leaders to
renew their efforts to resolve the problem.
</P>
<P>
He called on the international community to redeem its pledge
toward the realization of the Liberian peace process, adding that
this support ''should be without conditionalities''.

<HEADLINE> Nepali PM Urges Cooperation from Private Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba today urged journalists in the private media to pay
more attention to the political stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
Launching a media development fund in a small town about 20
kilometers east of Kathmandu today, Deuba said journalists should
not only make comments on the government's personnel arrangements
like the recent expansion of the cabinet, or council of ministers.
</P>
<P>
Deuba expanded his cabinet last month for the third time since
his three-party government came to power last September in an
attempt to make the ruling coalition more stable.
</P>
<P>
With 47 ministers, state ministers or assistant ministers in
his cabinet, Deuba is leading a biggest ever government in Nepal's
history.
</P>
<P>
His repeated expansion of the cabinet triggered strong
criticism from local private newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Deuba said today that the expansion of the cabinet was a need
of the government, not because of the lust for ministerial posts
from his main ruling Nepali Congress (NC) party or its ruling
partner the National Democratic Party (RPP).

<HEADLINE> Chengde Wild Herbs Popular With Foreign Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Wild herbs from the mountains
have become favorite dishes for foreigners visiting Chengde, in
north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The area famous for being the summer residence of the emperors
of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) is now attracting people wanting a
fungal feast made with local ingredients.
</P>
<P>
In local restaurants and hotels, dishes made of wild herbs,
such as ferns, day lilies, mushrooms, wild almonds, and fungi, are
rivaling traditional royal delicacies for foreign gourmets at a
price of several US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the Chengde Hotel several German tourists kept on holding
up their thumbs and saying "OK" to the waiters while devouring a
dish of green ferns.
</P>
<P>
Two tourists from Japan showed a special favor for wild
mushrooms, ordering at least two mushroom dishes at every
meal in local restaurants.
</P>
<P>
Located in the mountainous areas beyond the Great Wall, Chengde
is rich in various edible wild herbs. But only in recent years
have the herbs become popular on the dining tables of urban
residents.
</P>
<P>
"This is because the wild herbs are not only delicious and
nutritious, but also free from any pollution," a local vegetable
expert explained.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that each year the city produces some 9,000
tons of wild herbs, 50 percent of which are sold to hotels and
restaurants in Chengde and other cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
Many foreigners also purchased packed wild herbs before they
left Chengde to share the pleasure with their relatives and
friends at home.
</P>
<P>
A local farmer selling wild herbs at a roadside stall said that
in each of the past three years, foreigners bought more than 400
kg of his herbs.
</P>
<P>
A local official noted that the wild herbs have brought about
considerable income for Chengde farmers living in the mountains,
with a yearly sales profit of over 250 million yuan (some 30
million US dollars) for wild almonds alone.
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact, quite a few farmers in several outskirts
counties have shaken off poverty and become prosperous through
selling wild herbs," he added.

<P>
CHANGCHUN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The world's first strain of
hybrid soybean is expected to be produced in 10 years, a leading
Chinese scientist predicted.
</P>
<P>
"The first strain of hybrid soybean is expected to be born
within a decade," Song Huan, deputy-president of the Jilin
Provincial Agricultural Academy, said. "It will increase the per
unit output of present high-yield strains by 20 to 30 percent."
</P>
<P>
With the new hybrid, the world's supply of quality protein will
increase drastically, Song said.
</P>
<P>
If problems with insect pollination can be resolved, the hybrid
soybean will become a reality, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that research on hybrid soybeans will be accelerated
if the government can increase investments to cover the scope of
experiment.
</P>
<P>
For many years, the worldwide per unit soybean output has
increased by only 0.5 percent annually, and limited progress has
been made toward a solution.
</P>
<P>
Song Huan, an expert in soybean genetics, first researched
hybrid soybeans in 1983. Findings from his research have
progressed from the theoretical to the practical stage, and from
small-scale research to large-scale field research.
</P>
<P>
The Jilin Provincial Agricultural Academy, in co-operation with
a western company, is conducting research in practical use of
materials for hybrid soybeans.
</P>
<P>
Jilin, an important grain production base in China, is also one
of the country's major soybean producing areas. The Soybean
Research Center of China, under the Provincial Agricultural
Academy, is considered by the Food and Agriculture Organization to
be one of two state-level soybean research centers in Asia. The
other is in India.

<HEADLINE> Deer-keeping Industry Develops Rapidly in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- China is set to become a main
exporter of pilose antlers due to its expanding deer-raising
industry, with nearly 500,000 deers raised on special farms.
</P>
<P>
Among the deers, most are sikas and red deer, mainly in
deer-raising bases of northeast China, northwest China and
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The history of feeding deers in China dates back to 200 years
ago, with northeast China's Jilin province being the place where
the deer-raising industry originated.
</P>
<P>
But it was 2,000 years ago that Chinese people realized the
medical value of deer antlers, and the country became one of the
first to use them to cure diseases.
</P>
<P>
After the foundation of new China in 1949 Dongfeng County in
Jilin province set up the country's first base to breed deers. It
has provided more than 10,000 fine varieties of sikas to
neighboring provinces, and trained over 600 experienced poultry
raisers for the country's deer-keeping industry.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting held in Dongfeng County to commemorate the 200th
anniversary of the deer-keeping industry in China, experts said
that deer-raising not only creates good economic results, but will
benefit wildlife, as well.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's annual development plan
for 1996-97 fixed at tk 125 billion (about 3.125 billion US
dollars) was approved today.
</P>
<P>
The National Economic Council approved the plan at a meeting
chaired by the chief adviser to the caretaker government M.
Habibur Rahman and attended by all other members of the
government, namely, the council of advisers.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the government will contribute
tk 59.26 billion (about 1.481 billion dollars) representing 47
percent of the total cost.
</P>
<P>
The finance and planning adviser, Dr. W. Mahmud, said that
priority was given to projects which were aimed at poverty
alleviation and human resources development, and infrastructural
development in support of private investment has also been
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that the total number of projects incorporated
into the plan is 1,122 including 148 new projects.
</P>
<P>
"The overall objective of this plan is to sustain the process
of economic recovery and to create conditions for stable and
balanced economic growth," Mahmud said, adding that the plan might
appear as ambitious in terms of resource availability and
implementation capability."
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that "domestic resource availability will
depend to a large extent on what steps the next elected government
will take to increase the revenue surplus and what policies it
will pursue regarding domestic borrowing."

<HEADLINE> Jiangxi Strives to Prevent Snail Fever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The infection rate of
schistosomiasis in east China's Jiangxi Province dropped sharply,
thanks to the government's efforts in eliminating snails.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the infection rate has dropped to 3.8
percent, a 62 percent decrease from 1990, and the acute infection
cases have dropped by 76 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991 the provincial government has poured over 48.5
million yuan into the prevention of schistosomiasis through
elimination of oncomelania, a kind of freshwater snail, which is
the intermediate host of the blood fluke.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years snails have been eliminated in
nearly 400 million sq m areas and 4.18 million people have
received medical checks for schistosomiasis, and more than
one-fourth of them have been treated.
</P>
<P>
Another seven counties in the province have eliminated or
basically eliminated snail fever.

<HEADLINE> Beijingers Know Fewer Neighbors Than Before, Survey Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Residents in the Chinese capital
seemed hesitant when asked a question on a sample survey: "Do you
know your neighbors?"
</P>
<P>
Only 18 percent of those surveyed in 16-35 age group said they
were well-acquainted with all their neighbors, and 62 percent
said they were only nodding acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
Two percent of 600 people questioned said they knew none of
their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
And nearly all said that of their close friends, only one percent
came from the same neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe the situation for people under 16 and over 35
is even more serious.
</P>
<P>
The survey report did not compare its results with those from
ten or more years ago. However, it concluded that as the city
becomes more crowded with high-rise buildings, people's
relationships seem to be less close.
</P>
<P>
The survey found only 15 percent of residents in apartment
buildings knew all their neighbors, compared with 34 percent in
residential areas.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, Beijing residents have been described as
"friendly, warm-hearted and delighted to help others."
</P>
<P>
People who lived in single-story housing compounds and in the
countless alleys that crisscross the city often kept close ties
with each other for several decades.
</P>
<P>
But in the 1980s, thousands of Beijingers had to say goodbye to their
neighbors and cramped houses and move into multi-storied
residential buildings when the city government began large-scale
construction efforts to improve housing conditions.
</P>
<P>
People living in apartments have fewer chances to know and help
neighbors, the survey report said.
</P>
<P>
Only 35 percent of the people surveyed had helped neighbors or
been helped by neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Lebed Confident of Joining Yeltsin in Runoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Retired general Alexander Lebed
today predicted a showdown with President Boris Yeltsin in the
runoff elections.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure of running in the second round of the presidential
elections together with Yeltsin," said Lebed, who ranked third in
recent opinion polls after front runners Yeltsin and Gennady
Zyuganov, chief of the Russian Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
"You will see it tomorrow (Monday)," he said after casting his
ballot at the No.2698 polling station in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The retired general told reporters at the polling station that
strengthening the Russian statehood should be the most important
task for the future president and he expressed readiness to form a
coalition government if he gets elected.
</P>
<P>
Most pundits, however, have predicted a nail-biting race
between Yeltsin and Zyuganov by suggesting a no-win in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
If none of 10 presidential candidates can get more than 50
percent of the votes today, a runoff election will be held for the
top two candidates no later than 15 days within the final vote
count is made known.
</P>
<P>
The final results of today's polling must be announced no later
than a month after elections.
</P>
<P>
Other candidates included liberal economist Grigory Yavlinsky,
nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, eye-surgeon Svyatoslav Fyodorov,
former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev, billionaire
entrepreneur Vladimir Bryntsalov, businessman Martin Shakkum and
ex-weightlifting champion Yuri Vlasov.
</P>
<P>
Aman Tuleyev withdrew from today's poll in favor of his ally
Communist Party leader Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
But turnouts seemed to be lower than expected as Dmitry
Oreshkin, chief of the Central Election Commission, disclosed the
early voting statistics.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news service quoted Oreshkin as saying that 15.7
million Russians had voted by 2 p.m. Moscow time (1000 GMT),
accounting for 14.75 percent of the country's 106.4 million
registered voters.
</P>
<P>
"The speed of voting in Russia is falling step by step and we
can now forecast that the turnout of voters will be about 65
percent, and not 70-75 percent as projected earlier," Oreshkin
said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 93,939 polling stations across 11 time zones are
open from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. local time throughout the country
while about 520,000 Russian citizens residing abroad were expected
to vote in 146 countries.

<HEADLINE> Shaanxi to Set Up Six Science Propagation Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Shaanxi Province
is to set up six science and technology propagation pilot networks
this year.
</P>
<P>
The plan is aimed at increasing the contribution that science
and technology makes to agricultural growth to over 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The province has the second largest science research power base
in China, next only to Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
However, the adoption of science and technology in agriculture
in Shaanxi is much lower in comparison with the latter.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural scientists have proposed that six science and
technology propagation pilot networks should be set up if the
province hopes to maintain a stable agricultural increase in the
coming five years. The proposal has been adopted by the government.
</P>
<P>
The six networks will put emphasis on quality breeds,
fertilizers, water-saving agriculture, high-efficiency
agriculture, byproduct processing, water and soil conservation,
and disaster precautions.
</P>
<P>
According to Sun Haiying, director of the provincial science
and technology commission, by the end of 2000 quality breeds will
be planted on 90 percent of farmland in the province. This will
increase grain output by one billion kg. The utilization rate of
fertilizer will be increased by ten percent, which will increase
the output of wheat by 900 million kg. The utilization rate of
rainfall will be increased by 20 percent, which is expected to
increase grain output by 600 million kg. And 100 hi-tech pilot
shelters will be built, which will increase vegetable output by
five billion kg.

<HEADLINE> Turnout Lower Than Expected in Russian Poll: Interfax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Early voting statistics have
pointed to a turnout lower than expected in today's presidential
poll, the Interfax news service reported today.
</P>
<P>
Interfax quoted Dmitry Oreshkin, chief of the Central Election
Commission, as saying that 15.7 million Russians had voted by 2
p.m. Moscow time (1000 GMT), accounting for 14.75 percent of the
country's 106.4 million registered voters.
</P>
<P>
"The speed of voting in Russia is falling step by step and we
can now forecast that the turnout of voters will be about 65
percent, and not 70-75 percent as projected earlier," Oreshkin
said.
</P>
<P>
A low turnout is likely to tilt the scale toward Gennady
Zyuganov, chief of the Russian Communist Party, whereas a high
turnout may favor Boris Yeltsin, observers said.
</P>
<P>
Most pundits here predicted a nail-biting race between Yeltsin
and Zyuganov, clear front runners of the presidential poll, by
suggesting a no-win in the first round.
</P>
<P>
If neither can get more than 50 percent of the votes today, a
runoff election will be held no later than 15 days within the
final vote count is made known.
</P>
<P>
The final results of today's polling must be announced no later
than a month after elections.
</P>
<P>
A total of 93,939 polling stations across 11 time zones are
open from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. local time while Russians residing
overseas will cast their ballots in 146 countries.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said at a polling station in the Krylatskoye
residential area of Moscow that he would watch the Russia-Germany
soccer match which he described as a "decisive clash" in the
current European championship.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Russian eleven will win out there "as well".
</P>
<P>
The president declined to disclose whom he would vote for and
said with a smile that campaigning was forbidden on the election
day.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told reporters that he would start working on Monday at
seven in the morning and he would continue making his tours both
at home and abroad including the planned trip to Lyon, France, for
the G-7 summit.
</P>
<P>
Though presidential candidate Zyuganov showed optimism about
today's poll, the Russian Communist Party chief was concerned with
a multilateral supervision of the counting of the ballots of the
poll, in which 10 candidates are contending.

ultimately come in across Russia and after which Russian citizens
should receive an opportunity to think calmly about work."

<HEADLINE> Fastfood Stores Blasted in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MACAO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Two outlets of a fastfood store in
downtown Macao were blasted early this morning but nobody was
injured, the "Va Kio" newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The two blasts happened at about two o'clock in the morning,
and seriously damaged the wall of one outlet of the McDonald's
fastfood shop. The other shop was slightly damaged.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the front wall of the shop was cut by half
and the glass of the showcase of the first shop were broken into
pieces while the big "M" board of the shop was dangling after the
explosion. Debris scattered a large area in front of the shop.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that a man of about 40 years old was seen at a
nearby place when the first explosion happened, and the man left
calmly after the blast.
</P>
<P>
The second blast happened almost at the same time, but only
damaged the rain canopy and part of its billboard.
</P>
<P>
Police said that the blasts were believed to have been caused by
some delay-fused explosives and the cases are under further
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The report implied that explosion may be connected with debt
disputes. The owner of the fastfood shop in Macao has been
threatened of blasts several times before.

<P>
WUHAN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- More than thirty entrepreneurs from
non-state enterprises nationwide have signed contracts for over 60
aid projects in the reservoir areas of the Three Gorges. The total
investment adds up to 1.7 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The reservoir areas are rich in mineral resources, which
constitute ideal sites for drawing investments, particularly from
the non-state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
To boost investment, the government has organized groups of
entrepreneurs from non-state enterprises to conduct on-the-spot
investigations in the reservoir areas.
</P>
<P>
To date over 3,000 non-state enterprises have put in 2 billion
yuan in the reservoir areas.
</P>
<P>
Hope Group from southeast China's Sichuan province, the
country's largest non-state enterprise, has invested 250 million
yuan to undertake the largest agricultural project in the
reservoir areas, according to Zhen Wantong, deputy-head of the
United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, who was
leading an inspection group there.
</P>
<P>
However, the largest non-state investor in the reservoir areas
is Zhao Zhangting from Yichang city of central China's Hubei
province, the site of the Three Gorges Project, who invested 600
million yuan in the aid items.

<HEADLINE> UN Team Leaves Baghdad with Standoff Unresolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A team of U.N. weapons inspectors
left Baghdad today to take a flight to Bahrain without inspecting
the five military sites suspected of containing illegal weapons
material because Iraq barred them from entering these sites.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief inspector, Nikita Smidovitch, a Russian missile
expert, told reporters before his departure for Bahrain, the base
of the U.N. special commission on disarming Iraq (UNSCOM) in the
Gulf region, that his team is leaving Baghdad because the Iraqi
government flatly denied access to the sites they want to inspect.
</P>
<P>
He said his inspectors, who had been surrounding three sites in
Baghdad, left the sites on Sunday evening after the refusal of
entrance by the Iraqi government for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
"On the instruction of the executive chairman of the UNSCOM,
the team left the sites that were kept secured for more than 50
hours," he added.
</P>
<P>
Smidovitch emphasized that his inspectors have the right to
inspect any site in Iraq, saying his departure does not mean an
end of the UNSCOM inspections in future.
</P>
<P>
"The inspection process will continue to fulfill the mandate
given to us by the Security Council. So the inspection process
will continue," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. inspectors are reported to be searching for items and
documents relating to Iraq's long-range missiles prohibited by the
United Nations. But Iraq said that it has provided the UNSCOM with
all that it has and nothing has been left hidden.
</P>
<P>
During almost a one-week confrontation between Iraq and
the U.N., the Iraqi government has accused UNSCOM chief Rolf Ekeus
of deliberately chosing "sensitive sites" for inspection which
concern Iraq's national security and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Iraq demanded that the U.N. should send a special delegation
representing permanent members of the Security Council to jointly
carry out the weapons inspection in Iraq, but the U.N. has
officially rejected Iraq's proposal.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM Chairman Ekeus is expected to arrive in Baghdad
Wednesday to defuse the present confrontation between Iraq and the
UNSCOM, and convince Iraq that it should implement the Security
Council resolution which provides for dismantling Iraq's
mass-destruction weapons, a condition required by the U.N. for a
total lifting of trade sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Parents Spend More on Education of Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A survey has shown that urban
Chinese parents are spending more on the education of their
children.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out in China's eight major cities including
Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, shows that urban parents usually
spend an average 1,585 yuan annually for their children's
education in colleges, and in addition, 1,272 yuan for the living
expenses of the children.
</P>
<P>
Carried out by the Horizon Market Survey and Analysis Company,
the survey also shows that parents usually spend between 1,604
yuan and 2,220 yuan for their senior middle school children,
between 878 yuan and 1,766 yuan for their junior middle school
children and between 738 yuan and 1,596 yuan for their primary
school children.
</P>
<P>
The spending accounts for one-fifth of each family's total
income, and one-third of each family's total expenses.
</P>
<P>
The survey says that 47 percent of Shanghai residents and
Beijingers as well as 54 percent of Wuhan residents plan to
deposit savings to pay for the education of their children.
</P>
<P>
Previously the company surveyed 600 Beijingers and asked them a
question "How much would they like to pay for their children's
education from primary school to college?'
</P>
<P>
Five percent said that they would pay no matter how
much their children asked for; 7.5 percent of them said that they
would like to pay 20,000 yuan; 8 percent said to pay 30,000 yuan,
and 9 percent of them want to pay 50,000 yuan. The highest payment
was 150,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The survey has also found that the proportion of money that
parents pay for their children's education is different with
different age groups or graders.
</P>
<P>
Analysis of individual cases has shown that education expenses
of primary and middle school students mainly centers on
after-school training of painting, dancing and computer and
foreign language studies. But college students usually buy books
and learn to master certain professional skills.

<HEADLINE> "Risk Contract" Saves Bankrupt State-owned Factories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Seventy-five industrial firms which
had been closed down or on the verge of bankruptcy in northeast
China's Heilongjiang Province resumed production in the wake of a
recent reform of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
As a leading heavy industrial bases in China, Heilongjiang is
the home of more than 4,000 state-owned enterprises. However,
many of those operated at a loss because of obsolete equipment,
inefficient management and lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the provincial government began to delegate the
managerial power of 160 loss-making factories to corporate legal
persons or individuals by signing "risk contracts" with them on a
trial basis.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 800 yuan-worth of fixed assets of bankrupt
factories were put to use again. Over 70 previously money-losing
firms have earned 10 million yuan in profit and tax payment.
</P>
<P>
An electric wire plant in Qiqihar, which had been closed down
for more than a year due to poor operation, was handed over to an
efficient township-run business last year. With better management,
the plant greatly improved its efficiency and made a favourable
turn in production and marketing.
</P>
<P>
Chinese economists described the move as a successful
experiment which might prove an effective way to extricate the
country's debt-ridden state-owned enterprises out of the difficult
situation.
</P>
<P>
Towards that, the practice will spread to 300 state-owned
factories this year, according to a provincial official. Local
government will set up more agencies serving as the go-between for
unprofitable enterprises and potential corporators.

<HEADLINE> APEC Advisors Call for Single Business Visa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Business advisors to the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) today called for a borderless
Asia-Pacific for businessmen as an initial step toward hastening
the pace of trade liberalization in the region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the end of the APEC Business
Advisory Council meeting (ABAC) here today, Jose Yulo, co-chairman
of the ABAC Committee on Cross-Border Movement and Flows, said
that business advisors want a five-year waiver of visa
requirements for businessmen from APEC member economies to speed
up the movement of people, goods, services, information and
capital flow.
</P>
<P>
"The realization of economic cooperation among APEC economies,
specifically within the business sector, inherently relies on the
facilitation of cross border movement and flows," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yulo said that the grant of a five-year visa-free structure for
businessmen is already widely accepted among ABAC members.
</P>
<P>
Only the question of how extensive and how soon the concept
could be applied would have to be discussed further by the
council, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that a consensus has been reached on the endorsement of
a multiple, 60-day per entry visa for businessmen certified by the
APEC.
</P>
<P>
"In the interim as a first step we suggest that by November
1997, or within a period of one year that APEC economies should
introduce a five-year, 60-day per entry business visa," Yulo said.
</P>
<P>
He said that those applying for a business visa will have to be
certified by a chamber of commerce or an equivalent prestigious
organization.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations by the ABAC will be considered in the
framing of the 1996 Manila action agenda for APEC, which will be
drawn up during the informal meeting of APEC leaders in Subic, the
Philippines, in November.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Nepali Government Faces Test of Resolve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government is facing
a test of its resolve to fight against corruption as details about
a 36 million US dollar banking scandal have been in its hands for
a week.
</P>
<P>
A special investigation panel last Sunday submitted a report to
the Finance Ministry, revealing a series of financial frauds in
which fraudulent businessmen transferred a large amount of foreign
currency by forging letters of credit (LCs) in local commercial
banks during a 15-month period.
</P>
<P>
More than 36 million dollars worth of foreign exchange had been
swindled out of the country through the fake bank documents during
the period and some 510 million rupees (less than 10 million
dollars) of national revenue was lost as the businessmen bypassed
the customs with forged clearance documents while dealing in
imports, the report said.
</P>
<P>
After receiving the report last Sunday, Finance Minister Ram
Sharan Mahat said that the government would take strong action
against those found guilty soon. He also promised to made the
panel report public at an earliest date.
</P>
<P>
According to the local press, the report indicated that about
60 individuals, including import dealers and bank clerks, and 78
trading firms were involved in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
Lava Raj Sharma, chairman of the investigation panel and a
veteran banker, said that on the basis of the report the
government could "file legal cases against the guilty."
</P>
<P>
Though the report has not pointed to any government official
directly, it gave a list of all LCs signed illegally by government
officials. Local newspapers hinted that some political leaders
were also involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Finance Minister's promise to publicize the scandal
report as soon as possible, he even failed to table it to a
cabinet meeting Thursday, raising suspicions among the local press
over the government's resolve to take action against those accused
by the report.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Ruling Party Holds Rallies To Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's ruling Movement for
Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) held rallies across the country on
Saturday in suuport of the recently-enacted constitution, which
bars former President Denneth Kaunda from contesting the
residency in the elections to be held late this year.
</P>
<P>
The MMD members condemned the recent bomb blasts and the
threats of bombings in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
MMD leader, President Frederick Chiluba told his supprters,
who held a rally here and then marched to the State House, that
his country has still been dependent on foreign aid but he urged
his countrymen to be resolute in the face of threats by donors to
withhold aid. The threats were hurled after the constitution
amendment bill was signed by Chiluba at the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba vowed to severely punish the secret group called Black
Mamba, which was blamed for the recent bombings.
</P>
<P>
He urged his supporters to report suspicious persons and
parcels to the police.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba defended the constitution, saying he wondered what
crime the government has committed in passing and assenting the
amendment bill in line with the people's will.
</P>
<P>
At the MMD gathering in Kitwe, northern Zambia, Defence
Minister Ben Mwila accused the biggest opposition United National
Independence Party (UNIP) led by Kaunda of contemplating to
invite foreign mercenaries to attack Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Mwila said that Zambia has trained a strong and capable
defence system to deal with the the mercenaries and any criminal
act of the Black Mamba.

<P>
However, the government has managed to prevent those found
guilty in the report from fleeing the country last week by putting
immigration officers on full alert at border check points.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the government had issued arrest warrants
against the suspects mentioned in the report but so far none of
them was taken into police custody.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Mahat Friday at a press conference declined to
name those involved in the case and disclose any timetable for
legal action against them, raising concern that government's delay
in action could give time for the culprits to escape.
</P>
<P>
Last August, an import dealer named Ram Kumar Agrawal, who had
cheated the state-run Nepal Banijya (commercial) Bank of 1.6
million dollars, fled the country with his family. His case led
the LC frauds to come to the light.
</P>
<P>
Generally traders doing import and export business deal through
letter of credit as it is supposed to be the most secure payment
system. But the recent LC scandal in Nepal has raised doubts over
the management of banking system and the implementation of related
government regulations in the country.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba has pledged to control the
rampant corruption in Nepal and initiated an anti-corruption
campaign last month by ordering his cabinet members and other
high-ranking officials to account for their personal property on a
regular basis.
</P>
<P>
"It is time for the prime minister to show his commitment to
fighting corruption," a local political observer said.
</P>
<P>
"In Nepal businessmen have intimate relations with the
political circles. Politicians need businessmen's financial help
in their elections. It would be a thorny task for the government
to tackle the LC issue," he said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
As the new parliament session is to begin later this month,
whether the government's hesitant reaction to the recently-exposed
scandal would affect its future is yet to be seen, while the main
opposition Communist Party of Nepal (UML) earlier vowed to
overthrow the present coalition government led by the Nepali
Congress (NC) in the forthcoming session.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin, Zyuganov Cast Ballots as Many Do in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A European soccer match and an
error-free ballot count seemed to be what concerned Boris Yeltsin
and Gennady Zyuganov most today when the Russian presidential poll
got underway.
</P>
<P>
President Yeltsin said at a polling station in the Krylatskoye
residential area of Moscow that he would watch the Russia-Germany
soccer match which he described as a "decisive clash".
</P>
<P>
He said that the Russian eleven will win out there "as well".
</P>
<P>
The president declined to disclose whom he would vote for and
said with a smile that campaigning was forbidden on the election
day.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told reporters that he would start working on Monday at
seven in the morning and he would continue making his tours both
at home and abroad including the planned trip to Lyon, France, for
the G-7 summit.
</P>
<P>
Though presidential candidate Zyuganov showed optimism about
today's poll, the Russian Communist Party chief was concerned with
a multilateral supervision of the counting of the ballots of the
poll, in which 10 candidates are contending.
</P>
<P>
Aman Tuleyev withdrew from today's poll in favor of his ally
Communist Party leader Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov was more outspoken at the polling station as he said
that he would be backed by "very many".
</P>
<P>
"The main thing is that ballot papers should be counted
correctly," said Zyuganov, Yeltsin's main rival in the
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Most pundits here predicted a nail-biting race between Yeltsin
and Zyuganov by projecting a no-win situation in the first round
of elections which is expected to draw a total of 106.4 million
registered voters who would cast their ballots in 93,939 polling
stations across the country and in 146 countries abroad.
</P>
<P>
If neither can get more than 50 percent of the votes today, a
second round of voting will be held no later than 15 days within
the final vote count is made known.
</P>
<P>
Though the poll has just got underway, Russian Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin was already looking ahead to a win by Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would discuss a cabinet reshuffle with Yeltsin
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We have something to discuss and to think over, including
cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
"He (Yeltsin) will form a new government and he will offer its
chairman," added the prime minister who has supported Yeltsin in
running for a reelection.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin promised after casting his own vote today: "These
are the elections after which political stability should
ultimately come in across Russia and after which Russian citizens
should receive an opportunity to think calmly about work."

<HEADLINE> Executives Forced to Study Rules on Construction Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Executives or directors of 48
construction enterprises, development companies and design
institutes in northeast China's Liaoning Province have been forced
to attend a two-day course on relevant laws and rules.
</P>
<P>
Their firms, scattered across 14 cities in the province, were
warned, criticized or degraded in the past two years for failing
to meet design or construction requirements.
</P>
<P>
Although the firms had been punished, many failed to pay enough
attention to the quality of construction, which remains a focus of
public attention.
</P>
<P>
Poor construction quality, that of housing projects in
particular, has aroused much public resentment,
as housing, along with interior decoration, is increasingly
becoming a top concern of people in general.
</P>
<P>
For that, corporate representatives of the problem-making firms
were summoned to take the course which was intended to make them
fully realize the gravity of inferior quality.
</P>
<P>
An official with the provincial construction department said
that 66 firms were ordered to attend the course, but some have
failed to turn up and, as a result, will not get the
necessary certificate for contracting projects.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 16 (Xinhua) --South African President
Nelson Mandela today urged youth in the country to shift gears
from the days of apartheid and instead devote their energies to
fighting crime and boosting the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Mandela made the statements when he was addressing a youth day
rally in Pietersburg to commemorate the 20th anniversary of
school pupils killed by police as they protested the forced use
of Afrikaans as a medium of instruction.
</P>
<P>
On June 16, 1976, South Afrcan Police of the apartheid regime
opened fire on 10,000 pupils in Soweto's Orlando West High
School, killing a 13-year-old student. Anda In the next 10 days
more than 140 people died and 1000 were injured.
</P>
<P>
"On that fateful day 20 years ago you jolted the nation from
its slumber and rejected the slave education that the apartheid
regime had implemented," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
On way to get youth involved in the transformation process is
to harness and channel their energy through a long-awaited
national youth commission that would be launched in July this
year, said the president.
</P>
<P>
About 300 mainly African National Congress (ANC) youths
gathered in Magogo Standium, north of Durban, this morning to
commemorate the youth day.
</P>
<P>
The mood was festive as the crowd was entertained by ragged
bands, drum majorettes and armed Zulu dangers.
</P>
<P>
The ex-wife of President Mandela also spoke at the Morris
Issacson School in Soweto for the commemoration of the youth day.

<P>
The huge loss has been incurred following the deliberate
vandalisation of equipment at all loading ports in the country
and considerate leakages and absence of appropriate control and
security of the country's crude oil exports, the " Third Eye"
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the impending action by the government
is as a result of its inability to ascertain the exact barrels
of crude oil lifted out of the country through the Nigeria
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).
</P>
<P>
It said that the recording meters installed at four of the
country's major oil export ports have been deliberately vandalised
by a powerful syndicate, in order to further enhance the
already existing high-level fraud at the nation's oil refineries.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the federal government recently
discovered that since 1991, none of the meters at these loading
ports had been functioning and no official report has been

KHARTOUM, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Irrigation Minister
Yacoub Abu Showra Mousa has confirmed his country's rejection of
an Ethiopian plan for the construction of two dams on the Blue
Nile tributaries, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published by Sudanese newspaper Akhbar el Yom,
the minister said that Ethiopian authorities have not notified the
Nile-basin countries of the plan.
</P>
<P>
Mousa noted that any action in this connection should be
carried out only after it is discussed and agreed upon with the
Nile-mouth countries, namely, Egypt and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the execution of such project would have an
extremely negative effect on the Nile-mouth countries and the
other Nile-basin countries.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the World Bank would finance the Ethiopian
project, the minister said: "Any financing organization should
clarify the harm which would result from building such dams before
they agree to finance them."
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's parliament at a session last week approved an
agreement signed by the Ethiopian government with the World Bank
for an Italian-American company to build the two dams.

HARARE, June 16 (Xinhua)-- Some people who had been diagnosed
hiv positive are practicing revenge sex targeting unsuspecting
young girls and boys.
</P>
<P>
In the stateemnt issued on Saturday at the end of a 10-day
workshop on AIDS education, the Artistic Director of the Zimbabwe
Association of Community (ZACT), Ngugi Wa Mirii, also warned
people to be wary of their sex partners since they might be
infected with the hiv virus, or the AIDS disease for which no
cure has been found.
</P>
<P>
He noted that although people know about the hiv virus, they
are not changing their behaviour.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe AIDS Program officials attending the workshop
highlighted the prevalence of HIV infection in Sub-Saharan
Africa, saying 18.5 million people have been diagnised HIV
positive in regions.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean Deputy Minister of Sport, Recreation and
Culture, Kembo Mohadi, said at the end of the workshop that
HIV/AIDS was no only a medical puzzle but also a problem that
calls for the re-examination of Zimbabwean cultural values in
order to avert the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
''This means the change of attitudes, cultural behaviour and
above all it calls for doing away with long held cultural
traditions and beliefs" which will do harm to the efforts for a
curb of the AIDS, said Mohadi.
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe, more than a million people out of a population of
10.5 million, are believed to be infected with the HIV virus, an
estimated 300 are said to be dying every week due AIDS-related
diseases.

</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's visit comes following a Middle East tour by
U.S. Middle East peace coordinator Dennis Ross, which is aimed at

Netanyahu, the right-wing Likud Party leader, was elected prime

</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's elections campaign statements that he would take a
tougher line than that of incumbent Prime Minister Shimon Peres in
Israel's negotiations with its Arab neighbors, have caused great
concern in the Arab world over the future of the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Arab leaders will hold an Arab summit in Cairo on June 21-23 in
a bid to close Arab ranks and forge a unified Arab stance to
continue the peace process with the principle of land-for-peace,
under which Israel is demanded to return occupied Arab land for
peace. Netanyahu has expressed his rejection of the principle.

<P>
TIANJIN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Korea Exchange Bank of the
Republic of Korea, has topped the list of all operational overseas
banks in this port city of north China in terms of assets and loan
volumes, president of the bank's local branch said.
</P>
<P>
"Our business in China has just begun," said the president, who
declined to provide specific figures but indicated that central
and western China could be next targets.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin branch of the People's Bank of China (PBC), the
central bank, said the the port city currently has 27 overseas
banks, 11 of which are licensed operational ones with combined
assets valued at 120 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The business scope of overseas banks includes accepting
deposits and giving loans in foreign exchange, settlements for
imports and exports, foreign exchange guarantee, investigation of
credit worthiness, among others, the local financial regulator
said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese financial regulations currently limit the client base
of overseas banks in China mainly to overseas-funded
ventures. Vice Mayor Ye Disheng said that there are nearly 10,000
overseas-funded enterprises in Tianjin, with total investment
exceeding 10 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the recent years have seen the
business volume of overseas banks in Tianjin doubling each
year. By the end of last year the overseas banks had 800 million
US dollars in outstanding loans and 200 million US dollars in
unpaid deposits. Their import and export settlements reached 700
million US dollars by then.
</P>
<P>
PBC Tianjin branch president Liu Zhaofu said that overseas
banks have helped raise funds worth 80 million US dollars for auto
projects alone over the past three years.
</P>

Overseas bank branches in Tianjin include those set up by
France's Societe Generale, Credit Lyonnais and Banque National de
Paris, Japan's Sakura Bank Ltd and Tokai Bank, and others from the

SHANGHAI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The population density in urban
areas of Shanghai, the largest industrial and commercial city in
China, has been decreasing sharply as more residents are moving to
suburban areas, according to the Shanghai municipal government.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Municipal Statistics Bureau said that the

square kilometer in 1995 from 27,230 persons per sq km in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Baoshu, a population expert with East China Teachers'
University, said that the decrease in the population density is
due partly to the inclusion of several suburban counties in
the urban area.
</P>
<P>
Another reason is that an estimated 638,550 residents moved out
of downtown Shanghai during the 1990-1993 period, he explained.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 16 (Xinhua) -- An international fair on
children's articles, the first of its kind in China, will be held
at the end of this year in Guangzhou, capital of south China's
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Some 250 exhibitors from China and 150 from overseas will
attend the fair and display new techniques, technology and
equipment related to toys, textiles, stationery, food and other
articles for children use.
</P>
<P>
China has a huge market potential for sales of children's
articles since the country has over 300 million people under the
age of 14.
</P>
<P>
However, domestic production of children's articles is only at
an infant stage. In recent years, major overseas producers of
children's articles began to move their factories to Guangdong. As
a result, production and trade of children's articles in the
province shoot up to 80 percent of the country's total.
</P>

SHENYANG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A three-day international
economic and technological trade fair hosted by the Shenyang
Economic Development Zone closed here Friday, snatching 35
investment contracts with a combined volume of 170 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 27 letters of intent were signed, attracting a
potential investment of more than 80 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Petrochemical Complex Plans Huge Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Jingmen Petrochemical Complex, one
of China's largest, will invest a total of 6.8 billion yuan (about
810 million US dollars) over the next five years on its technical
upgrading and expansion, according to a senior company executive.
</P>
<P>
The executive said that three billion yuan will be used for
technical renovations and the remaining 3.8 billion yuan for a new
catalytic cracking project.
</P>
<P>
A major economic benefit of the huge investment will be lift
the plant's annual gross profit volume from 745 million yuan in
1995 to 1.3 billion yuan by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The investment will also enable the firm to refine a total of
16 million tons of crude oil in the five years between now and the
year 2000, as against 2.5 million tons last year. The firm's gross
profits during the five-year period would then add up to five
billion yuan, just 200 million yuan less than that for the
previous 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Last year the petrochemical complex, based in Jingmen of
central China's Hubei Province, snatched the 21st place in a
comprehensive evaluation by the State Economic and Trade
Commission and the State Statistical Bureau.
</P>
<P>
With an annual refining capacity of five million tons and fixed
assets valued at 2.1 billion yuan by the end of last year, Jingmen
Petrochemical Complex is one of China's 162 super-large
enterprises.

<HEADLINE> China Tackles Geological Hazards in Three Gorges Reservoir Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- An official with the Ministry of
Geological and Mineral Resources said today that China is losing
no time in harnessing geological hazards in the Three Gorges
reservoir area to guarantee the navigation on the Yangtze River
and the safety of local towns.
</P>
<P>
The official stressed that geological hazards, such as possible
landslides and rockfalls, will not pose threats to the dam and
reservoir of the Three Gorges Project, the world's largest
water-control scheme.
</P>
<P>
Li Lierong, director general of the Geology and Environment
Management Department of the Ministry, told Xinhua that the
projects of harnessing Huanglashi landslide and Lianziya deformed
rock mass are expected to be completed by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
Huanglashi and Lianziya pose the most serious threats to the
reservoir area among all the dangerous geological hazards, which
are 64 km upstream and 25 km from Sandouping, or the dam site,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, China's highest governing body, attached
great importance to the two sections. In 1992, it asked the
ministry to take charge of their prevention and control.
</P>
<P>
Excessive rainfall is the major factor leading to
landslides. To prevent the revival of Huanglashi landslide, the
ministry has completed a water drainage project on the
ground. Nearly 20 channels with a combined length of 7,000 meters
have been dug to discharge water, the official said.
</P>
<P>
"The project proves to be effective because it stood the test
of last year's high-water season," he said.
</P>
<P>
Workers have also built underground facilities to drain out
water inside the landslide body, Li said, adding that the ministry
is now keeping a close watch on Huanglashi.
</P>
<P>
Lianziya (Chain Cliff), over 100 meters high, consists of
limestones. Since the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), local people began
to cut coal at the foot of the cliff. These factors and the
excessive rainfall have torn the cliff apart, turning it into a
deformed rock mass. There are over 30 fissures, which can be
several hundred meters long and several meters wide.

SEOUL -- A Cypriot ship and a Greek vessel collided with each
other on the sea off the coast of South Korea's South Kyongsang
Province late Saturday night, causing the sinking of one ship and
missing of its 26 crewmen, according to reports reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated Cyprus-flagged "Annaspiratou" ran into the
Greece-flagged "Polydefkis" about 10 kilometers off the coast of
Namyodo, South Kyongsang Province, at 11:50 p.m. local time (0250
GMT) Saturday, when it was navigating in a thick fog, reports
said. The collision left all 26 sailors of "Annaspiratou"
missing, while all 12 crewmen of the Greek freighter was safe with
no serious damage, reports quoted South Korea's Maritime Police

BELGRADE -- Bosnian Serb Vice-president Biljana Plavsic said
Saturday the Florence meeting had finally accepted reality on the
ground in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Serb radio in Serb administrative center Pale,
Plavsic said the international community had realized that any
dictate could be endured up to a certain point, after which the
outcome of the implementation of the Dayton agreement would be
completely uncertain if pressure against the Serbs continued.
</P>
<P>
At Thursday and Friday's Florence meeting, the international
community has demanded the removal of Serb President Radovan
Karadzic from power. But it did not accept proposal of reimposing
sanctions against Yugoslavia to press for the oust of Serb
President Radovan Karadzic, the twice-indicted war criminal
suspect.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic said it became clear after the Florence meeting that
the Dayton agreement had to be successfully implemented because
the U.S. elections will be held later this year which the "ruling
administration wishes to win on account of political points from
Bosnia."
</P>
<P>
Under strong international pressure, Karadzic decided a month
ago to transfer part of his presidential duties to Plavsic so as
he could "have more time to reorganize his political party and
other important issues."
</P>
<P>
MOSCOW -- Residents of the Chukotka region, in Russia's Far
East, Saturday flocked to the polling stations to cast their
ballots in Russia's nationwide presidential election on June 16,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Starting in Chukotka in Russia's Far East, the "election
marathon" will last 24 hours and wind up in Russia's "far West,"
in the Kaliningrad region on the Baltic Sea.
</P>
<P>
According to the elections law, the doors of over 93,000
polling stations should be open from 08:00 to 22:00 local time
across the country for the total of 106.4 million voters plus over
520,000 Russian citizens, temporarily or permanently living
abroad, who will be able to cast their ballots at 402 polling
stations in 146 countries of the world.
</P>
<P>
The voters will have to choose between 10 candidates competing
for the highest state post in the country. Initially 11 were
registered, but communist candidate Aman Tuleyev quit the race
four days ahead of the polls and called on his supporters to back
communist leader Gennady Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
The top five candidates include incumbent President Boris
Yeltsin, 65; Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, 52;
ultra-nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky, 50; liberal
economist Grigory Yavlinsky, 44; and law and order advocate
retired General Alexander Lebed, 46.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Land Shortage Problem Deteriorates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The shortage of land in Zimbabwe's
rural areas has reached crisis levels as thousands of people,
driven from urban areas by job retrenchments, drift into
overcrowded rural communities, the " Sunday Mail" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the country's 57 districts are almost full, forcing
people to squat on any piece of vacant land, sparking conflict
with the local community and the law, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The government efforts to buy more land for resettlement have
come unstuck because of a shortage of money or suitable land and
partly due to resistance by white commerical farmers, it said. As
a result, the 1980 target of buying 8.3 million hectares for
162,000 families has lagged behind with only 62,000 having been
resettle on 3.4 million hectares,it added.
</P>
<P>
The 1992 Land Acquisition Act, which makes it compulsory for
the government to acquire land for agricultural purposes,
continues to receive stiff opposition from over 4,400 commercial
farmers who attacked it as " racist" and a threat to agricultural
output, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> FAO Satisfied With Food Supply in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- In the wake of good harvests last
year, the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) has expressed
satisfaction with the food supply in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
In its latest edition of the world food outlook, aquarterly
journal of the FAO, FAO said cereal production in 1995 was
slightly above average despite government's ban on the importation
of fertiliser.
</P>
<P>
''The increase in Nigeria's food production was achieved through
government policies aimed at boosting agriculture and promoting
the growing of food crops,'' said the report.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the increase in food supply, the report noted
that only substantial quantities of rice and wheat were imported
for the 1995/96 marketing year, thus making the cereal input
requirement at about only 0.9 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The report also said the trend will extend to 1996 with the
early rainfall that started in mid-frebruary in the southern parts
of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the FAO has expressed concern over the food security
outlook of other sub-Sahara African nations, describing it as
''precarious.''
</P>
<P>
According to Abdul Rashid, FAO's Chief of Global International and
Early Warning System, a combination of unfavorable factors is
threatening sub-Sahara Africa's progress toward food security.
</P>
<P>
These factors include declining farm size, falling soil
productivity and land degradation, erratic rainfall, frequent
severe droughts and the under-development of farm inputs.
</P>
<P>
''Africa's precarious food security could lead to a genuine
human tragedy,'' if urgent steps are not taken, said Abdul Rashid.
</P>
<P>
Already, about 210 million people in Africa suffer from hunger
and malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming World Food Summit slated for November this year
in Rome is expected to discuss ways of heading off this situation.

<HEADLINE> China Tackles Geological Hazards in Three Gorges Reservoir Area (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To deal with possible rockfalls from Lianziya, workers are
using steel ropes to bind the separated rocks together. They have
erected a scaffold over 60 meters high for the drilling machines,
which looks "very spectacular," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Huanglashi and Lianziya, the ministry, in
cooperation with other relevant departments, has also carried out
research on, and tackled a number of geological hazards, such as
Erdaogou in Badong County, over the past decades.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that landslides and rockfalls will not affect the
construction of the Three Gorges dam and reservoir. Experts have
calculated that even a landslide or rockfall close to the dam
slips into Yangtze in the worst condition, the wave would only
rise another 2.7 meters high at the dam site, posing no threats to
the dam or other building structures.
</P>
<P>
In the reservoir area, geologists have discovered a total of
2.9 billion cubic meters of dangerous landslide bodies or
rockfalls. Supposing all of them slip into the river at the same
time, they will be of little significance because the reservoir
will have a holding volume of tens of billions of cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Landslides or rockfalls can only bring difficulties to
navigation or affect safety of nearby towns, he explained.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project, which started in 1993, is expected to
be completed in 2009. Its dam will be 185 meters high, holding
water as high as 175 meters. In the first stage of the project,
China plans to dam the river by the end of next year.

<HEADLINE> UF Government Government of Compromise: Surjeet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- General Secretary of the
Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI-M) H.S. Surjeet said that
the United Front (UF) government was a "government of compromise".
</P>
<P>
CPI-M is a partner of the 13-party UF but has not joined the UF
coalition government so far.
</P>
<P>
In an interview to home TV to be telecast next Monday, Surjeet
said that this compromise was a better option than having the
Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) stay in power at the center.
</P>
<P>
The 13-day-old BJP government was pulled down jointly by the UF
and Congress party in the parliament on May 28. They regarded the
BJP as "communal" force.
</P>
<P>
Asked why instead of reversing the economic policies of the
Congress party's government headed by P.V. Narasimha Rao, the UF
was extending these policies, he said that the verdict of the
people itself was for "compromise". No political party won a clear
majority in the recently concluded the 11th Lok Sabha ( lower
house of parliament) general elections.
</P>
<P>
Surjeet said that his party would not allow foreign investment
into the insurance sector or change its stand on support to sick
public sector units. In its minimum common program announced here
on June 5, the Deve Gowda government decided to open up the
country's insurance sector to private and foreign investors. It
also decided to reconstruct or privatize sick public sector units.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Congress party was under compulsion to support
the Gowda government after its defeat and rout in elections.

<HEADLINE> Crisis Emerges as Israeli Coalition Talks Near </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A crisis looms as the talks to
form Israel's new government are approaching the first deadline
previously set for today, because a major potential partner of the
Likud party threatens to join the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from the Likud and Israel Ba'aliya, an influential
Russian immigrant party, holding marathon meetings overnight,
failed to bridge the difference over the allocation of
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
Natan Sharansky, leader of Israel Ba'aliya, refused to back
off from his claim to the powerful Housing portfolio,
rejecting the offer of two relatively minor portfolios of
Absorption, and Industry and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky threatened that his party would rather join the
opposition if his demands were not met.
</P>
<P>
The Orthodox United Torah Judaism has made a claim
to the Housing portfolio, but Likud negotiators are trying to
persuade it to accept the deputy Housing post and the
chairmanship of Knesset (parliament) Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Likud reportedly intended to allocate the Housing
portfolio to its members of Knesset (MK) Ariel Sharon or Moshe
Katzav.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of Israel Ba'aliya from the coalition will
likely reduce the seats of the Likud-led faction in the 120-seat
Knesset to a razor-thin majority of 61.
</P>
<P>
Other Likud's potential coalition partners include two other
Orthodox religious parities of Shas and National Religious
Party (NRP), and the centrist Third Way.
</P>
<P>
The coalition talks are shifting to highest gear today as
Prime Minister-elect Binyamin Netanyahu strives to put together
the new government ahead of Monday, when the Knesset convenes
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli laws, Netanyahu is required to form
his government within 45 days after the formal publication of
election results on June 5.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the dispute with Israel Ba'aliya, there are
still plenty of hurdles ahead.
</P>
<P>
One new obstacle was erected by Shas, who complained about
the unfair distribution of portfolios between it and its rival
the NRP. Shas, which has 10 Knesset seats, was offered two
portfolios of Interior, and Labor and Social Affairs.
</P>
<P>
But the NRP, which has nine seats in Knesset, is expected to
take three portfolios - one major (Education), one medium
(Transport) and one minor (Energy).
</P>
<P>
Another outstanding hurdle the Likud negotiators have to
clear is the issue of religious status quo. Israel Ba'aliya
and the Third Way demanded freedom of vote on religious
affairs, which was strongly denied by the Orthodox parties.
</P>
<P>
The religious parties want to pass laws to reverse the
religious status quo back to that before 1992, which has
raised great concern among the Reform and Secular movements.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, chief Likud negotiator Avigor Lieberman remained
confident that Netanyahu will be able to form the new
coalition by Monday, when he will present his coalition
agreements and guidelines.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Former Tanzanian President
Julius Nyerere suggested that east African countries should form
a federation to help to end political problems in Rwanda and
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here Saturday, Nyerere said the
envisaged federation comprising Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania
and Uganda could help to find a lasting solution to the troubled
two countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
The war in Burundi has left thousands of people dead and many
more were made to flee their country as refugees, mostly to
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere urged the presidents of the three east African
countries, who signed a treaty of co-operation in Arusha three
months ago, to get united and form a federation. He believes that
the spirit of co-opeation could be translated into a wider
federation to include Rwanda and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"If that federation occurred, the problem of tribalism in
these countries and the problem of shortage of land in Rwanda and
Burundi would not be felt as badly as is the case at the moment,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Right now Rwanda and Burundi belong to nowhere, they have to
belong to a wider community if their problems are to be swallowed
by many more people in a bigger federal country," the former
Tanzanian President added.

<P>
TOKYO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese people may be able to

an electronic notarial system to be developed by the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (MITI), Kyodo reported today.
</P>
<P>
Major computer makers including the IBM Japan Ltd., NEC

<HEADLINE> Post-Poll Dhaka Stock Exchange Trading Buoyant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
DHAKA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Trading on Dhaka Stock Exchange
(DSE) was seen more lively Saturday, pushing the price index 11.52
points higher after Bangladesh's parliamentary elections held on
June 12.
</P>
<P>
The DSE trading has been closed for the last three days due to
election enthusiasm. The preliminary poll results showed that the
former largest opposition Awami (people's) League (AL) is hopeful
to form the next government.
</P>
<P>
Imtiyaz Hussain, chairman of DSE, said, "we welcome the AL's
victory although there is still some uncertainty."
</P>
<P>
He said that during the election campaign, AL chief Sheikh
Hasina encouraged an unhindered capital market, vigorous
privatization and local and foreign investment. This positive
stand will support the capital market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there was no major post election turmoil, which was
apprehended by most of the investors, resulting in more enthusiasm
among the DSE traders, he added.
</P>
<P>
As the trading atmosphere was positive, the buying pressure on
the DSE floor was prominent, leading the day's all share price
index to 915.82 over the previous day's 904.30.
</P>
<P>
The market capital of Saturday also rise to taka 61.18 billion
(about 1.54 billion US dollars) over the previous day's taka 61.40
billion (about 1.53 billion US dollars).

<HEADLINE> England Beats Arch-Rival Soctland in Euro Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The England national team defeated
its arch-rival Scotland 2-0 Saturday by stunning goals from
striker Alan Shearer and Paul Goscoigne at a group A match of the
European football championship at the London Wembley Stadium.
</P>
<P>
The England players, who were under unimaginable pressure to
win the match, failed to organize any effective attacks during the
first half of the match.
</P>
<P>
Ruud Gullilt, guest commentator of the BBC television, said
during the break that he was surprised that England team was
static and the players did not displayed any of their skills.
</P>
<P>
However, England launched the second half with astonishing
performances and top striker Shearer' great header at the 53rd
minute put England to a inspiring 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
Scoland, which forced the Neterlands to a goalless draw in
their openig match, had the perfect chance to equalize when Tonly
Adams, the England Captain, felled Gordon Durie, but Gary
McAllister's spot kick was brilliantly pushed away by England
goalkeper David Seaman.
</P>
<P>
At the 79th minute, Gascoigne, the England soccer genius,
flicked the goal over Scotland full-back Colin Hendry and volleyed
a superb second goal for the hosts.
</P>
<P>
"In the second half we came out and did exactly what I wanted
Jamie Redknapp got hold of the ball and we looked a different
team." said England coach Terry Venables after the match.
</P>
<P>
"When they got the penalty, I thought this was not going to be
our tournament. But we got the win and I think we deserve it. And
Gazza's (Gascoigne) goal was brilliant, this will really boost our
confidence," Venables added.
</P>
<P>
In a group B match between France and Spain later Saturday,
France nearly dominated nearly all stages of the match and Youri
Djorkaeff scored a superb goal at the 48th minute.
</P>
<P>
However, as the final minutes of the match are ticking away,
the Spanish players launched a desperate effort and Jose Caminero
equalized after good work from substitute Juli Salinas.
</P>
<P>
French coach Aime Jacquet admitted after the match that he was
concerned about France's standard of finishing after the 1-1 draw
with Spain.
</P>
<P>
"We made numerous chances but we were unable to take them and
our finishing is something of a worry. But we'll look forward to
the next game. This is a young team really looking to the future,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> China Reports Success in Developing Seaplanes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- China has developed two generations
of seaplanes over the past three or more decades, according to the
developer.
</P>
<P>
A press release by the 605 Research Institute of China National
Aviation Industry Corporation, China's sole hi-tech body
specializing in the research and development of seaplanes, shows
that China has developed two generations of water-bound aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The release said that the first model seaplane, SH5, was
produced in 1971, about ten years after the founding of the
research institute, which is based in Jingmen, a city of central
China's Hubei Province. Test flight of the model plane succeeded
in 1976.
</P>
<P>
The first group of seven SH5 seaplanes, with a maximum take-off
weight of 45 tons, a maximum range of 4,900 km and a maximum level
speed of 550 km, were dispatched to the navy in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Over the recent years, the model has been modified to be used
in eliminating forest fires and aerial farming.
</P>
<P>
In April of last year, China successfully test-flied its second
generation of civilian-use seaplanes -- the Seagull Model 200,
which can be used for passenger transportation, aerial seeding,
insecticide spraying, sports, environmental surveying, among
others. The new model has a maximum take-off weight of 510 kg and
a maximum level speed of 110 km.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Economy on Slow Recovery: Business Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A recent poll of Japan's major
companies showed they feel that the country's economy is slowly
recovering, the Kyodo News Service reported today.
</P>
<P>
Ninety of the 100 major companies polled said they feel the
economy has entered a slow recovery phase.
</P>
<P>
Only one said it sees a full-scale recovery in the poll which
was conducted on the top managers in early June.
</P>
<P>
Most of the companies attributed the recovery to the correction
of the yen's appreciation, public works spending and low interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
About half of the companies said they expect economic recovery
to last until the end of the first half of next year or the end of
the year, while only five companies said they expect the recovery
to last for several years.
</P>
<P>
Most of the companies said they are concerned about a lack of
public works, financial institutions' bad loans, the worsening
employment situation and a consumption tax hike.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that 60 companies expect increase in both sales
and profit over the previous year in fiscal 1996 ending next March
while 15 expect higher profits even though they see their sales
leveling off or falling.
</P>
<P>
Half of the companies plan to increase capital spending in
fiscal 1996 from the previous year, showed the poll.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- China's largest insecticide producer
is expected to break the new mark of 20,000 tons in annual
production this year, up more than one third year-on-year,
according to a company executive.
</P>
<P>
Hubei Shalongda Co. Ltd, based in Jingsha city of central
China's Hubei Province, produced 6,100 tons of pesticide in the
first four months of this year, an increase of 42 percent over a
year ago. Its profit during the period was up 192 percent to over
30 million yuan (about 3.6 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
As China's only listed company specialized in the production of
pesticides, Shalongda has outperformed its competitors nationwide
for four consecutive years in terms of pesticide output, export
earnings and profits and taxes. It was the first Chinese pesticide
plant to hit the mark of 10,000 tons in annual production in
1994. Its production exceeded 15,000 tons last year.
</P>
<P>
The executive said that Shalongda has planned its annual
pesticide production at 30,000 tons by the year 2000, and annual
profit and taxes at 300 million yuan. Currently Shalongda sells

DHAKA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh
Saturday said that the civil administration did not play a neutral
role in the June 12 parliament elections.
</P>
<P>
Jamaat Secretary General Rahman Nizami at a press conference
alleged massive rigging in polls and said the rigging was done in
cooperation with the election officials.
</P>
<P>
Jamaat-e-Islami has done poorly in the elections, winning only
three seats out of 273 announced so far.
</P>
<P>
Nizami said the polling was free and fair in very few centers
and the whole election machinery became politically partisan which
seriously hampered fair polling.
</P>
<P>
The Jamaat was a victim of various conspiracies and its
candidates were defeated through a planned plot, he added.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question whether the Jamaat would play any role
in the formation of the next government, the Jamaat secretary
general said his party was not in such a position.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Basketball surely helped a
boxer in title fight as Roy Jones warmed up in a pro-basketball
game and then retained his International Boxing Federation super
middleweight title in Jacksonville of Florida on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Jones, regarded as the world best pound-for-pound boxer,
dominated every round to beat his Canadian rival Eric Lucas after
11 rounds.
</P>
<P>
Jones did not seem to have much bounce in his legs early in the
fight, perhaps a residual effect of playing point guard for the
U.S. Basketball League's Jacksonville Barracudas earlier in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Lucas was bleeding from the nose and mouth by the middle of the
bout but insisted he wanted to continue when questioned by his
French Canadian cornerman at the referee's request following the
10th round.
</P>
<P>
Jones landed some damaging and solid punches to the Canadian's
head to cut a deep gash just above the right eye of the challenger
and the fight was stopped by referee between the 11th and 12th
rounds.
</P>
<P>
Jones, who raised his record to 32-0, had five points and one
rebound while playing 14 minutes at point guard in his team's
107-94 win.

BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat's coming visit to China is of great importance,
Palestinian Ambassador to China, Moustapha Saphariny, said here
shortly.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader is to begin his visit tomorrow, and he

peace process and exchange views with Chinese leaders, the
ambassador said at an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
This will be Arafat's 10th visit to China and its importance
lies in the fact that it comes after the Israeli election and
several days ahead of an Arab summit, the ambassador added.
</P>
<P>
China has been consistent in supporting the Middle East peace
process, he noted. Therefore, he said, the Middle East peace
process, the situations of Arab nations and Palestine, as well as
the latest developments of the peace process and their reactions
will be the focal points of the discussions between leaders of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said Arafat will also discuss with Chinese
leaders on Palestine's reconstruction and explore ways of
advancing bilateral economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the Arab summit to be held in Cairo from June 21,
the ambassador said that Palestine has made it clear that it will
support and adhere to the bases of the Middle East peace process,
namely all international resolutions safeguarding the legal rights
of the Palestinian people, the principle of "land for peace", as
well as the agreements concluded between Palestine and Israel.
</P>
<P>
"What we will appeal for at the Arab summit is peace," the
ambassador said. "A lasting and comprehensive peace is the legal
rights of the Palestinian people and all agreements signed by
Palestine and Israel."

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Janata Dal ( people's party)
is facing a crisis over the expulsion from the party for six years
of former Karnataka chief minister and senior leader R. Hedge,
with new chief minister J. H. Patel giving up his efforts to
mediate between Hedge and Prime Minister Deve Gowda.
</P>
<P>
Both Hedge and Gowda are senior leaders of the Janata Dal and
former chief ministers of Karnataka state. Deve Gowda was
appointed chief minister of Karnataka in 1983, but later he was
replaced by Hedge and he himself became minister of irrigation
under Hedge. Since then they developed differences. After the
United Front was formed and Deve Gowda elected its leader, Hedge
has filed severe criticism of the United Front.
</P>
<P>
The Political Affairs Committee (PAC) of the Janata Dal on June
15 unanimously endorsed the expulsion of R. Hedge for his
anti-party activities.
</P>
<P>
Following the expulsion of Hedge from the party, the Janata Dal
is witnessing conflict down the line between the factions owing
allegiance to Hedge and Prime Minister Gowda. following up on the
expulsion, Gowda, in consultation with his close associates, is
believed to have churned out moves to do away with those close to
Hedge from the party.
</P>
<P>
Hedge had said that he was determined to fight back, but he
refused to place all cards on the table at the moment. The United
Front is reported to have shown its unhappiness over the expulsion
of Hedge.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin's Major Election Rival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov, one of the 10 presidential candidates facing
decisive elections today, is seen as the major rival for President
Boris Yeltsin in the race for the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov was born on June 26, 1944 into a teacher's family in
Mymrino village of the Oryol region.
</P>
<P>
The communist leader, who has a PhD degree, was educated at the
Oryol State Pedagogical Institute and the Academy of Social
Science at the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the
Soviet Union (CPSU) in 1980.
</P>
<P>
From the age of 23, he started working with the Soviet Young
Communist League and the Communist Party. He had been chief of
the propaganda department of the Oryol regional committee of the
CPSU and deputy chief of the ideology department of the CPSU
Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
In 1990-1991 he was member of the party's powerful politburo
and secretary of the party's Central Committee. Soon after August
19 incident in 1991, he became one of the chief founders of the
"joint opposition" and a prominent ideologist in the then Supreme
Soviet of the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, he became the leader of the Russian Communist Party.
He is concurrently the leader of the parliamentary group of the
Communist Party, the biggest faction in the State Duma (lower
house of the parliament).
</P>
<P>
He fathers a daughter and a son.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov's election program emphasizes the "social aspect." He
promised "legislative guarantees for the subsistence wage, for the
right of all citizens to work and fair remuneration, to rest and
housing, to free education and medical services and to a dignified
old age."
</P>
<P>
Just as all other candidates, Zyuganov promises to end the war
in the breakaway republic of Chechnya and to prevent new armed
conflicts in Russia's territory. He also gives much attention to
combating organized crime and corruption.
</P>
<P>
He advocated the restoration of ties among former Soviet
republics, especially ties among Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and
Kazakhstan, which, in his opinion, will lay down the foundation
for voluntary restoration of a union state.
</P>
<P>
In the political area, Zyuganov stresses the need for
amendments to the Constitution limiting powers of the President
and meanwhile expanding powers of the parliament. He deems it
necessary to "hold direct elections of chiefs of the local
administration" following the presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
He also offered "a broad compromise" among all political groups
if he should win the elections.
</P>
<P>
He is in favor of a "multistructural economy" and supports
investment in "the most rapidly developing areas, regardless of
the form of economic management."
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov, who represents the popular patriotic election bloc,
is expected to get more votes even than Yeltsin in today's
polling, but is hard to win more than 50 percent of the votes,
which will enable him to get into the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
If none of the candidates win a majority of the votes today,
which is seen almost certain by analysts, Zyuganov will probably
have to face Yeltsin in the second round, in which his chances of
victory is expected to be slim.
</P>
<P>
Under Russia's election law, a second round of voting should be
held within 15 days after the official announcement of the resluts
of the first round. For this year, a second round, if it should
happen, is likely to be held on July 7 or 14, said the Itar-Tass
news agency.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Women Hold Anti-Poverty Rally in Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Canadian women rallied
at the capital's Parliament Hill today to express their anger at
the government's failure to carry out its promise to fight
poverty.
</P>
<P>
"To the prime minister we say, 'you promised us job creation,
you promised us a child-care program and you promised to protect
social programs,'" said NAC President Sunera Thobani. "Women are
here to ask you to deliver."
</P>
<P>
The rally, intended to highlight the poverty issue that affects
millions of Canadian women and children, was organized by the
National Action Committee (NAC) on the Status of Women and the
Canadian Labor Congress.
</P>
<P>
The majority of today's women crowd arrived on the Parliament
Hill on the final leg of the Women's March Against Poverty, which
began on May 14 in the western coast city of Vancouver and the
eastern coast city of St. Johns.
</P>
<P>
According to the NAC, some 40,000 to 50,000 people participated
at different times in more than 80 communities as the march
converged on the capital.

<HEADLINE> Canada Condemns Bombing in England </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government today
"firmly condemned" the bombing at the Arndale shopping center in
Manchester, England, which injured at least 200 people.
</P>
<P>
"Atrocities such as today's attack are abhorrent and should
never recur," said Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Manchester bombing is particularly revolting coming as it does
soon after the commencement of Northern Ireland peace talks and
against the backdrop of the admission by the Irish Republican Army
(IRA) that it was responsible for the murder of a Garda officer in
Adare, Ireland, last week," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Democratic and non-violent means, particularly the peace talks,
should be used to achieve peace and reconciliation in Northern
Ireland," Axworthy said.
</P>
<P>
"The Manchester bombing should not be permitted to deflect the
parties from their talks of moving the peace process forward. Canada
calls on Sinn Fein to go beyond statements and demonstrate its
commitment to the peace process by convincing the IRA of the
imperative need for unequivocal reinstatement of its ceasefire," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy also extended his sympathy to the many victims and their
families.

<HEADLINE> Banharn Calls for Leaner Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Thai prime minister Banharn
Silpa-Archa has said that the government is determined to keep the
public sector lean to get rid of red tape and reduce overlapping.
</P>
<P>
This message was sent out by Banharn on Saturday at a seminar
to the country's 1.5 million civil servants.
</P>
<P>
The government will continue to follow its policy imposed in
1994 to control the growth of public sector employment below 2
percent a year, Banharn said, noting a leaner public sector will
also help improve wages of civil servants, especially those at
lower levels.
</P>
<P>
The public sector wage bill currently accounts for 35-40
percent of the national budget in the country and it is a heavy
burden to the national development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Viravan, who chaired the State
Manpower Sizing Committee, said that the government will raise pay
to civil servants, introduce office automation, and distribute
more manpower to the provinces and rural areas to improve the
efficiency of the government.
</P>
<P>
The government also will hire more private firms to do work now
being done by the public sectors, Amnuay said.
</P>
<P>
Most public employees in Thailand are commissioned officers or
officials. Teachers account for 30 percent in the sector and
police account for nearly 20 percent.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
who is eager to win re-election in today's nationwide polls, has
been seen here as the most hopeful among all the 10 presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was born into a peasant's family on February 1, 1931 in
a village of Butka in the Sverdlovsk region.
</P>
<P>
He graduated from the Urals Politechnical Institute in 1955 as
a building engineer and then worked as a foreman, work
superintendent, chief engineer at construction enterprises in
Sverdlovsk and chief of the Sverdlovsk house-building complex.
</P>
<P>
He joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in
1961 and quit in 1990 at its 28th congress.
</P>
<P>
From 1968 to 1987, Yeltsin worked as party functionary: chief
of the construction department, secretary of the Sverdlovsk
regional committee of the CPSU, first secretary of the Sverdlovsk
regional committee of the CPSU, secretary of the CPSU Central
Committee and first secretary of the Moscow city committee of the
CPSU.
</P>
<P>
In October 1987, he was relieved of his duties both as party
Central Committee secretary and Moscow party boss by the then
party leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
In 1990-1991, he was elected chairman of the Supreme Soviet of
the Russian Federation. In June 1991, he, for the first time in
Russia's history, was elected president of the Russian Federation
by nationwide voting, with 45,552,041 voters, or 57.3 percent of
the electorate, casting their ballots for him.
</P>
<P>
He is married to Naina Yeltsina and has two daughters, Yelena
and Tatyana, and four grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
On May 31, Yeltsin set out the basic principles of his election
program entitled "Russia: man, family, society, state."
</P>
<P>
The main theses of his election program can be formulated as
follows:
</P>
<P>
-- The effort to combat poverty and ensure economic growth. He
believes that by the year 2000 the annual inflation rate will drop
to 5 percent, which will make it possible "to arrest price rises
and ensure prosperity of Russian families." He promises that the
rouble will become hard currency by the year 2000 and that "the
economy will be on the upturn with an annual growth of more than 4
percent."
</P>
<P>
-- The protection of the family, motherhood and childhood.
"The living standards and protection of children's rights should
be an important criterion of our development."
</P>
<P>
-- The development of culture, education and science.
</P>
<P>
-- The effort to combat crime and corruption.
</P>
<P>
A separate section in the presidential election program is
devoted to a settlement of the conflict in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin faces a strong challenge from Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov in running for the presidency. Opinion polls
indicate they are in a very close race.
</P>
<P>
If he fails to win outright in the first round of the election,
Yeltsin does not rule out "various forms of cooperation" with
other opponents-candidate including retired General Alexander
Lebed and liberal economist Grigory Yavlinsky.

<HEADLINE> Chile Opposes Possible U.S. Sanctions Against Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Chilean Foreign Minister Jose
Miguel Insulza said Friday that his country opposes possible
sanctions by the United States against Colombia after the
acquittal of President Ernesto Samper.
</P>
<P>
"In this case, as in others, we would not agree" with the
possible application of sanctions by the United States, because
the decision of the acquittal is in nature an internal affair,
Insulza told the press in Cauquenes.
</P>
<P>
Chile is profoundly respectful of the will of countries to
solve their problems by themselves, said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
"It is not our business to emit opinions about the procedures
used by Colombians or about the legitimacy of their judgement,"
Insulza added.
</P>
<P>
Colombia's Chamber of Deputies (lower house of the parliament)
resolved on Wednesday not to take to the Senate the charges
against Samper, who was accused of receiving drug trafficking
money to finance his 1994 electoral campaign that led him to the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
Insulza is in Cauquenes to brief producers there on the
negotiations about Chile's entry into the South American Common
Market (Mercosur).

MONTEVIDEO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A government economic team has

<HEADLINE> Olympic Torch Arrives in Boston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- As many as 75 Olympians,
Handicapped athletes, marathon veterans and community heroes
carried the Olympic torch along the marathon route from Hopkinton
to Boston Saturday as part of the 84-day 15,000-mile relay to the
Games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Thousands spectators were cheering along the route when the
torch relay was traveling the course through Ashland, Framingham,
Natick, Wellesley, Newton, Brookline and finally into Boston.
</P>
<P>
Rick Hoyt, who has cerebral palsy, and his father Dick Hoyt who
attended as a tandem team in 16 Boston Marathons, received the
torch just before Kenmore Square. Then they passed the flame to
Travis Roy, a former Boston University hockey player who was
paralyzed in an accident during a game last fall.
</P>
<P>
Roy handed the torch to Johnny Kelley, a 58-time Marathon
finisher and two-time champion, who ran the torch to the official
finish line for the marathon in Copley Square and passed the Flame
along to four-time Marathon champion Bill Rodgers to be carried
into City Hall Plaza.
</P>
<P>
The torch arrived from Nashua, N.H. early Saturday morning. A
re-enactment of the start of the first Boston Marathon was
performed at the official starting line in Hopkinton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic flame was lit in Greece 50 days ago and the 84-day
25,000-kilometer torch relay started in the United States in Los
Angeles on April 27 and has since been traveling the country by
runner, bicycle, horseback, train, boat and plane. It is due to

<HEADLINE> Congress Party Opens Door to Ex-members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The former ruling Congress
party headed by P.V. Narasimha Rao finally woke up to its
shrinking mass base and in a major decision, the party's working
committee has given a clarion call to all Congressmen who had left
the party since 1969, to come back to the mother organization.
</P>
<P>
President of the Congress Narasimha Rao had to bow down to the
demands of the members of the Congress Working Committee (CWC),
the highest policy-making body of the party, and made this
announcement late Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The announcement is being viewed as significant in political
circles, as most of the leaders now heading different political
groups have left the Congress party after 1969. The important
leaders included present Prime Minister Deve Gowda.
</P>
<P>
A party spokesman said that a final decision on those who
wanted to come back to the party would be taken by the Congress
Working Committee before the All-India Congress Committee session
scheduled to be held in July.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's five-hour CWC meeting, which continued till late
night, saw plenty of fireworks, with many members criticizing the
functioning of the leadership. The meeting laid stress on poll
analysis and self-criticism in the light of the severe drubbing in
the recently concluded general elections. The CWC members
identified some of the main reasons for the party's dismal
performance in the general elections: failure to communicate the
Congress government's policies, factionalism in the state units,
failure to get proper projection in the media and alienation of
minorities from the party.

BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Design of the terminal building
for the first phase of Pudong International Airport has been
completed, according to today's "Business Weekly" of China Daily.

<HEADLINE> Central China's Dabie Mountains Green Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The hills in the Dabie
mountainous area in the southern part of central China's Henan
Province have turned green again following ten years of
forestation efforts by local residents.
</P>
<P>
The Dabie mountains once were covered with primeval forest,
that later were destroyed by war and widespread logging.
</P>
<P>
In the mid 1980s, people from all counties in southern Henan
initiated a large-scale tree planting effort, and voluntarily
imposed a ban on cutting trees in the Dabie mountains.
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, one million mu of trees were planted,
bringing the total forest area in the Dabie mountains to 6 million
mu. Now, half of the hills in this area are covered by evergreens.
</P>
<P>
These forestation achievements greatly modified the local
climate, prompting sufficient rainfall and agreeable weather. On
the narrow but long plain at the foot of the mountains, more than
one million mu of farmland can now harvest three crops a year.
</P>
<P>
Green mountains helped many local farmers rise from poverty by
producing more than 100 million kg of fruits, teas, and medicinal
herbs worth 260 million yuan each year.
</P>
<P>
The improvement of the ecological environment also attracted
many rare wild animals, such as leopards and pangolins, which fled
the area when the hills were barren to return to their former homes.
</P>
<P>
"There are now 260,000 birds of 226 species, and 221 species of
vertebrates in the Dabie mountains," said a local zoologist.

<HEADLINE> Amnuay Reiterates Independent Policy on Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Amnuay Viravan Saturday reiterated that every
country has the right to conduct its own policy on Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay made this remark after meeting United States special
envoys William Brown and Stanley Roth in Pattaya.
</P>
<P>
All regional countries want the same objective of stability,
but the policy management may be different, Amnuay was quoted as
saying by local newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday defending ASEAN's constructive engagement
policy on Myanmar, Amnuay also indicated that the West's approach
of isolation and economic pressure against Myanmar would not be
productive.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is speeding
up its integration of Myanmar into the group, while the United
States urges the group to press Myanmar to meet the "standards" on
human rights before admitting the country.
</P>
<P>
Brown and Roth arrived in Thailand on Saturday after their tour
to Japan, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia "to
consult on coordinated responses towards Myanmar".
</P>
<P>
They said that their consultations over the past week covered
"specific steps" that the United States and other countries could
take to prevent a further deterioration of the political situation
inside Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
If the measures of deterrence did not work, the United States
will take additional bilateral, political, diplomatic, and
possibly economic steps as well, the envoys said.

<HEADLINE> Joint-Stock Bank Backs Non-state Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Non-state enterprises in China
have been the main beneficiaries of loans from the country's first
non-state bank in its first five months of operation, according to
the bank's spokesman Bi Enyuan.
</P>
<P>
The bank, launched last January by the All-China Federation of
Industry and Commerce (ACFIC), had lent 800 million yuan to 57
enterprises by the end of May, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Among them, 43 non-state enterprises, including overseas-funded
firms, used 600 million yuan of the total while the other loans
went to state-owned firms.
</P>
<P>
Minsheng now operates the business of extending loans,
interbank borrowing and lending and state treasury bonds
investment. It is not involved in the high-risk businesses of real
estate, stocks and futures.
</P>
<P>
The bank's first three branches will open in Shanghai,
Guangzhou and Chengdu in the second half of this year, Bi said.
</P>
<P>
Minsheng has chosen and will continue to choose developed
areas, especially those where the non-state economy is prosperous,
as locations of its domestic branches, he added.

<HEADLINE> Further Cut of Interest Rate Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank is likely to
cut interest rates again at the turn of the third and fourth
quarters of this year, Beijing-based English language newspaper
"China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate is expected to be cut by 0.6 to 0.8
percentage point if inflation is under control, the paper quoted
Xu Hongyuan, deputy director of the Economic Forecasting
Department of the State Information Center, as saying.
</P>
<P>
An inflation rate below the bank's interest rate would create
room for the additional rate cut, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
Retail price inflation fell to a year-on-year 7.3 percent in
the first five months of this year, against 14.7 percent last
year. Retail prices in May were only 6.5 percent greater than at
the same month of last year.
</P>
<P>
Another interest rate cut will further ease the burden of
state-owned enterprises and increase their profits, but it will
also prompt some depositors to consider how to make better use of
their money. Some deposits are liely to flow to the stock market
and speed the development of the country's securities industry.
</P>
<P>
The reduced bank rate will make the treasury bonds more
attractive and reduce the cost of fund raising.

Championship.
</P>
<P>
After the draw France and Bulgaria shared the top place in

<HEADLINE> China Suggests Building of Pan-Asia Oil Bridge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts today called for
the building of a Pan-Asia continental oil bridge, with oil and
gas pipelines linking China, Central Asia, Russia, the Middle East
as well as Japan and the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at developing regional oil markets into the
international arena, and boosting oil trade and cooperation
between countries in the eastern and western parts of the world's
largest continent, said the experts.
</P>
<P>
Experts stressed that cooperation between Asian countries in
terms of energy resources, particularly oil and gas resources, is
of important significance in maintaining sustainable and stable
economic development in the region into the next century.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Dai, an expert with the Chinese Academy of
Sciences and one of the advocators of the bridge, the proposed
continental oil bridge would link up oil and gas pipeline networks
in eastern China, western China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, Central Asian countries, Russia and Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
Significantly, the continental oil bridge will extend via China
to the Republic of Korea, Japan and China's Taiwan, and other
major east Asia oil and gas markets.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the State Planning Commission held that
countries along the bridge are strongly reciprocal in import and
export of oil and gas resources.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the proposed oil bridge will not only greatly
increase the oil transport and trade volumes between eastern and
western Asian countries, but will also smooth oil trade in Central
Asian countries, and stimulate cooperation between these countries
and Russia and China in terms of oil and gas exploration and
development.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the State Scientific Research Institute of
Petroleum Exploration and Development said that the construction
of an oil passage between the eastern and western parts of China is
expected to be speeded up by the concept of a continental oil
bridge, which is forecast to develop an annual oil transport
capacity of over 30 million tons.
</P>
<P>
They estimated that the proposed oil bridge will channel about
one fifth of the total oil needs into the oil import countries and
regions in east Asia.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tao, president of the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC)
said in an interview with Xinhua that basic conditions for the
construction of the Asian Continental Oil Bridge are ripe.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the key parts of the bridge: the
laying of oil and gas pipelines between eastern and western parts
of China, and gas pipelines between China and Russia and
Central Asia is either under way or about to start.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC president said that he will head for Russia this
month to sign formal contracts on co-building the gas pipelines
extending from east Siberia to China.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said that negotiations on building another gas
pipeline running through Central Asian countries, China, the
Republic of Korea and Japan have ended.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, laying oil and gas pipelines, running from Xinjiang
to the eastern parts of China, is under full preparation with some
local pipelines having already under construction.

WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today strongly condemned the bombing of a British shopping center
that injured at least 200 people.
</P>
<P>
"I am deeply outraged by the bomb explosion," Clinton said in a
statement released by the White House. "Such viciousness deserves
universal condemnation."
</P>
<P>
The explosion of a van in a parking lot outsite the shopping
center followed a coded telephone warning from a man with an Irish
accent. British Prime Minister John Major said that the blast
"looks like the work of the IRA (Irish Republican Army)."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he Joined Major and Irish Prime Minister John
Bruton in utterly condemning "this brutal and cowardly act of
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
"The bombing today underscores the need for all of us to
join together to fight terrorism and violence in all parts of
the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
The news of the blast came as Irish President Mary Robinson was
ending her state visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Robinson said at the Irish Embassy here that she was "shocked,
saddened and numbed" by the news of the terrorist violence.
</P>
<P>
The Irish president said that explosion, which police in
Manchester believed was IRA's work, would not stop the on-going
all-party peace talks for the future of Northern Ireland. Sinn
Fein, IRA's political wing, was barred from the talks because of
IRA's refusal to declare cease-fire in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We must continue to try to build a sustainable peace. I
utterly condemn violence," Robinson said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's sugar output
hit some 2 million tons in 1995, a 5.31 percent rise over 1994,
industry sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The Sugar Cane Producers Association (Asocana) said in a report
that the sugar output increase was obtained despite a drop in the
yield of sugar cane per hectare.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sugar exports last year gained by 19.2 percent to
amount to 862,000 tons, thanks to a drop in domestic demand, the
report added.
</P>
<P>
Domestic market sales were 1.2 percent less than those of 1994,
maintaining the dropping trend observed since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Importers of Colombian sugar included Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru,
the United States and China.

<HEADLINE> General Strike to be Staged in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A general strike will start
in Brazil Friday to demand employment and salary rises.
</P>
<P>
The strike has been called by the Unique Workers Central (CUT),
the biggest labor union in the country with 18 million members.
</P>
<P>
CUT General Secretary Joao Vaccari Neto said so far 3
million workers have confirmed their participation in the strike,
including civil servants, oil, metallurgical and construction
workers, bank and commerce employees and teachers.
</P>
<P>
The General Workers Confederation, the nation's second largest
labor union with some 8 million members, has not yet figured out
its stand toward the strike.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Vice President Marco Maciel said he would suggest
dialogue instead of the strike although the strike may solve the
unemployment issue.
</P>
<P>
Official figures put the unemployment rate at 4.5 percent last
year and 6 percent in May this year but local press reported 15
percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- At least 64 people were arrested by
London police during the day as England beat Scotland 2-0 in the
European football championship at the Wembley stadium here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time Scotland had played England at Wembley
since 1989 when an annual fixture was stopped after years of
hooliganism that included a pitch invasion in 1977 when Scottish
fans ripped down the goals.
</P>
<P>
Forty-eight arrests were at the match, mostly for drunkenness
and selling black market tickets. But the 76,000 fans, including
8,000 of Scottish fans, turned out in most of the time pleaceful
at the ground, according to the police.
</P>
<P>
There were reports of English and Scottish fans throwing
bottles at one another outside public houses, but police moved in
quickly to quell trouble.

<HEADLINE> China's Year Of The Earthquake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- China suffered 50 earthquakes
measuring magnitude five and more on Richter scale in 1995, a new
survey revealed today.
</P>
<P>
Included in the quakes were eight of above six magnitude and
one higher than seven.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows the number of strong quakes which occurred in
the country in 1995 is larger than in 1994, a rise of up to 18.5
percent. The average intensity of the quakes was also much higher.
</P>
<P>
A total 78 people were killed and more than 14,000 injured in
last year's disastrous quakes. The loss the country suffered came
to at least one billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The worst earthquake struck Dingwu, Southwest China's Yunnan
Province on December 24, last year, killing 52 people and leaving
13,815 injured, including 808 who were seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
Another quake which occurred in the same province around the
borders between China and Burma on July 12 caused 11 deaths and
injured 136 people. The economical loss was estimated at over 200
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Ten days later, a 5.8-magnitude earthquake in Northwest China's
Gansu Province killed 12 local residents and injured another 60,
leaving more than 4,000 people homeless.
</P>
<P>
The massive quake on July 12 measuring 7.3 magnitude was the
only one above 7 in the country during the year. Before it
occurred, scientists gave an accurate prediction of its location,
time and magnitude.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1995, the world experienced the most
disastrous earthquakes since the beginning of the century. Quakes
above seven magnitude occurred a record of 33 times.

<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Electoral Court (TSE) of
Ecuador requested the Football International Association (FIFA) to
change the date for the match between Ecuador and Chile scheduled
for July 7, because it will coincide with the country's general
elections.
</P>
<P>
The TSE said the transmission of the match could cause that
electors or the members of the boards in charge of receiving the
votes would rather stay at home to see the encounter that will be
directly transmitted starting at 14:00 hours, local time, instead
of complying with their civic commitment.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Electoral Court asked FIFA to move the time of the
match to 19:00 hours, local time, or to the previous day (July 6,
Saturday), at any time.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean match will be the third eliminatory encounter for
the France '98 World Coup.
</P>
<P>
The Ecuadoran team defeated Peru'S 4-1 and Argentina'S 2-0.

<HEADLINE> Serb Leader Says Florence Meeting Accepts Reality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb Vice-president
Biljana Plavsic said today the Florence meeting had finally
accepted reality on the ground in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Serb radio in Serb administrative center Pale,
Plavsic said the international community had realized that any
dictate could be endured up to a certain point, after which the
outcome of the implementation of the Dayton agreement would be
completely uncertain if pressure against the Serbs continued.
</P>
<P>
At Thursday and Friday's Florence meeting, the international
community has demanded the removal of Serb President Radovan
Karadzic from power. But it did not accept proposal of reimposing
sanctions against Yugoslavia to press for the oust of Serb
President Radovan Karadzic, the twice-indicted war criminal
suspect.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic said it became clear after the Florence meeting that
the Dayton agreement had to be successfully implemented because
the U.S. elections will be held later this year which the "ruling
administration wishes to win on account of political points from
Bosnia."
</P>
<P>
Under strong international pressure, Karadzic decided a month
ago to transfer part of his presidential duties to Plavsic so as
he could "have more time to reorganize his political party and
other important issues."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another Serb Vice-president Nikola Koljevic today
praised the signing of the arms control accord as the most
important result of the ministerial conference in Florence,
Bosnian Serb radio in Pale said.
</P>
<P>
The concerned parties in Balkan region signed the arms control
accord in Florence at the meeting which was aimed to review the
implementation of Bosnia peace accords over the past six months.
The meeting also proposed to hold Bosnian elections on September
14, and a final decision on the date of the election will be made
later this month by the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Dayton accords split Bosnia into two entities with almost
equal territories -- the Republika Srpska and Muslim-Croat
federation.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Presidential Elections Begin in Far East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Residents of the Chukotka region,
in Russia's Far East, today flocked to the polling stations to
cast their ballots in Russia's nationwide presidential election on
June 16, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Starting in Chukotka in Russia's Far East, the "election
marathon" will last 24 hours and wind up in Russia's "far West,"
in the Kaliningrad region on the Baltic Sea.
</P>
<P>
According to the elections law, the doors of over 93,000
polling stations should be open from 08:00 to 22:00 local time
across the country for the total of 106.4 million voters plus over
520,000 Russian citizens, temporarily or permanently living
abroad, who will be able to cast their ballots at 402 polling
stations in 146 countries of the world.
</P>
<P>
The voters will have to choose between 10 candidates competing
for the highest state post in the country. Initially 11 were
registered, but communist candidate Aman Tuleyev quit the race
four days ahead of the polls and called on his supporters to back
communist leader Gennady Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
The top five candidates include incumbent President Boris
Yeltsin, 65; Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, 52;
ultra-nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky, 50; liberal
economist Grigory Yavlinsky, 44;and law and order advocate retired
General Alexander Lebed,46.
</P>
<P>
To win in the first round, a candidate must get an overall
majority of votes. If none succeeds, the two leading candidates
proceed to the second round to be held no later than within 15
days after the first round.
</P>
<P>
Most experts believe that only two candidates, Yeltsin and
Zyuganov, are indisputable leaders of the presidential race, and
say that Yeltsin is too optimistic about winning the elections at
one stroke and the second round is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
The Central Election Commission stated earlier today that
it will count all votes very meticulously and accurately in the
presence of thousands of observers, including 2,000 confidants
of the ten presidential candidates and over 1,000 foreign
observers as well as reporters.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 15 (Xinhua)-- The main targets of Uganda's

private sector promotion.
</P>
<P>
In his budget speech here today to the parliament, Minister of
Finance and Economic Planning Mayanja-Nkangi said that the rual
areas have been lagging behind in economic development,
therefore, an extensive program of road building and maintenance

easy access to markets.
</P>
<P>
Under this program 16 main roads will be tarmacked and 22,000
km of feeder roads built, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the speed to implement the president's contact with the
people to reduce the cost of education, the minister said that
the government has abolished all PTA (parents and teachers
association) fees charged by every school in the country.
</P>
<P>
Furethermore, the budget speech stressed the importance of
security as the most basic foundation for development.
</P>
<P>
The minister pledged that peace in the north will remain a
vital element in the government's strategy to bring about
balanced development throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Nkangi said the government will take measures to stimulate
private sector investment.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, the government will give priority to the
identification and development of suitable industrial sites for
which a special expenditure of 1.5 billion shllings has been
budgeted in this financial year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Furethermore, and most fundamentally, the government will
increase the efficiency of the power sector by liberalising power
generation and commercialising the activities of the Uganda
Electricity Board, he said.
