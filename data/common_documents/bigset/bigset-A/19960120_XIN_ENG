<HEADLINE> Sudan Denounces US Court Verdict in New York Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Sudan today denounced a
verdict passed by the U.S. Federal Court against a group of
Sudanese nationals for an alleged plot on bombing New York-area
landmarks.
</P>
<P>
The verdict was passed in a trial by the Federal Court against
Egyptian Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman and four of his Sudanese
followers on charges of plotting to blow up New York-area
landmarks.
</P>
<P>
The denunciation came in an interview conducted by the Sudan
New Agency (SNA) with Sudanese Justice Minister and Attorney
General Abdul Aziz Sakudou.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese justice minister described the sentence as "unjust
and based on no substantial evidence." He also said that the
trial was not based on facts, but on false charges.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Abdel-Rahman, a spiritual leader of the Egyptian
Jihad group, was sentenced to life in prison by the U.S. Federal
Court. Eight of his followers were also sentenced to prison terms
ranging from 25 to 57 years, including the four Sudanese, Tarig
Elhassan, Fares Khallafalla, Amir Abdelgani and Fadil Abdelgani.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Rahman and his followers were convicted of plotting to
bomb the United Nations, World Trade Center and other
establishments in New York city in an attempt to force a change in
U.S. policy toward the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> African States Urged to Embark on Water Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Director-General of the Food and
Agriculture Organization (fao) Jacques Diouf today urged African
countries to embark on various water control projects so that
they can irrigate crops in times of drought.
</P>
<P>
Diouf made the call at a press briefing here at the end of his
three-day visit to Zambia.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question raised by Xinhua, Diouf said the people in
drought-prone countries should construct river-water control projects
from village up to national levels to improve irrigation of their
crops.
</P>
<P>
Although African countries have many rivers with abundant water,
they have continuously experienced severe food shortage because of
drought and lack of water projects, Diouf said.
</P>
<P>
Unless African countries realize the importance of storing up river
water for irrigation, food production in many African countries will
not be improved, he noted.
</P>
<P>
It is Diouf's first visit to Zambia since he was elected fao
director-general two years ago. During his stay here, he had meetings
with Zambian senior officials and visited some of fao-funded
projects.
</P>
<P>
He left here for Nairobi this afternoon to continue his
three-nation tour.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Continues In Southwestern Somali District Of Huddur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 20 (Xinhua) -- At least 27 people were
killed and more than 32 others wounded when heavy fighting
erupted between General Aidid's militiamen and those of the
Rahanqein Resistance Army (RRA) in Huddur District, west of
Baidoa last night.
</P>
<P>
The clashes began when the defeated RRA militiamen launched a
counter attack in their attempt to regain the control of Huddur
in the Bakol Region, which fell to Aidid's men early this week.
</P>
<P>
After repulsing the attack from the RRA, General Aidid's mili-
tiamen patrolled the villages surrounding Huddur, looking for the
retreating militiamen of Rahanwein.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Nur Jilei, the spokesman for the RRA in Mogadishu said
General Aidid's militiamen are currently in defensive positions
and are likely to loose their power base in Huddor soon. Jilei
denied that his RRA men had suffered heavy casualty during the
day and night long hit and run battle against the occupation
militiamen of General Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Radio North Mogadishu supporting Ali Mahdi Mohamed reported
higher casualty figures about the battle in Huddur. The radio
said 50 of General Aidid's militiamen were killed whilst 73
others were wounded. Five RRA militiamen were also killed and 15
others wounded.
</P>
<P>
A clan militia curfew had been imposed on the neighbouring
Hiran Region, a measure taken by the Hawadle Clan politicians
afraid of a possible attack from General Aidid. Hiran, which was
captured by Aidid's militiamen in July 1994, shares border with
Bakol Region currently occupied by General Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the international expatriates working for the aid
agencies operating in Jowhar had recommenced their duties after
the Medicine Sans Frontier (MSF) of Spain had been attacked by
Somali gunmen on Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the region, the attack was not a
clan or political motiveted one, but a mere banditry activity
action carried out by what they called a few irresponsible
gunmen.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Wins at First Polling Station (By Xie Dongfeng and Wang Yukui) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH, WEST BANK, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian
Central Election Commission (CEC) announced tonight that PLO
Chairman Yasser Arafat won 95.6 percent of the vote at one polling
station in Hebron in the race for Palestinian Council (PC)
President.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Shtayyeh, the CEC general secretary, said that at the
Al Ka'abani polling station in Hebron, Arafat won 197 votes out
of 204 valid votes. Seven votes are in favor of Samiha Khalil, a
social worker from Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Shtayyeh also said that 285 people in Al Ka'abani registered
before the voting, and 206 cast their ballots. Two votes turned
out to be invalid.
</P>
<P>
This was the first election result announced by the CEC.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the voting period has been extended by three hours
to 10 p.m. local time (20:00 GMT) in east Jerusalem proper because
the heavy Israeli security measures during the day kept many
voters away from voting. Those who have not voted were asked to
cast their ballots in Abu Dis on the outskirts of east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Three places extended their voting period by one hour to 8
p.m. (18:00 GMT). They are AL Amari in Ramallah, Darjaser on the
outskirts of east Jerusalem and the town of Jenin.
</P>
<P>
CEC officials said that by the official close at 7 p.m. about
70 percent of eligible voters cast ballots in the West Bank and 80
percent in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Final results were not expected before 1 a.m. Sunday (23:00
GMT) on the presidential voting and late morning Sunday for the
legislative council.

<P>
KAMPALA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- President Yoweri Museveni
today met with former Malian head of state General Amadou Toure
who came here to acquaint himself with the situation in central
Africa.
</P>
<P>
General Toure is one of the eminent person who were selected
to act as facilitator to the regional initiative on Rwanda and
Burundi, and Uganda was the base of the Rwandan Patriotic Front
which swept through Rwanda in the second quarter of 1994 and came
to power.
</P>
<P>
Museveni and Toure had a thorough discussion about the ethnic
problems in Rwanda and Burundi and exchanged views about some of
the possible solutions. Hutu militants are fighting against the
Tutsi-led army in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Toure arrived in Uganda after visiting Tanzania on the same
mission. He is scheduled to go to Rwanda, Burundi and Goma in
neighboring Zaire for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
Some one million Hutu refugees are living in camps around Goma
and over 700,000 refugees are now in Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Palestinian Polling Goes Peacefully with Massive Turnout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Voting for the first
Palestinian elections went on smoothly in most areas without big
problems, while more than 75 percent of 1.04 million eligible
voters have cast their ballots.
</P>
<P>
Ten hours after the polling began at 7 a.m. this morning, the
latest results showed a massive turnout of voters: 85 percent in
Gaza City, 75 percent in Nablus, 65 percent in Ramallah and 40
percent in Hebron where Israeli troops have not withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
The voting will close at 7 p.m. in most of the 1,697 voting
stations in 16 districts throughout the Gaza Strip and West Bank,
including east Jerusalem. The Palestinians are voting for the
88-member Palestinian Council (PC) from 672 candidates and for the
PC president.
</P>
<P>
There was a festive atmosphere in most Palestinian-controlled
areas. Flags fluttered and Arabic music blared. Streets were
bedecked with chains of lights and some squares were criss-crossed
with red, white, black and green Palestinian flags.
</P>
<P>
Numerous copies of pictures of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, his
competitor Samiha Khalil and PC candidates were seen on streets
and voting stations.
</P>
<P>
Most of the voters believed that the elections will serve as
an important step toward an independent Palestinian state and
they hope for a better future.
</P>
<P>
This morning, Arafat, who was poised to become the president of
the Palestinian Council, had his kaffiyeh headdress knocked askew
getting into a packed polling station and cast his ballots at
Gaza's Anas Benmalik Boys' School near his seaside office.
</P>
<P>
"This is the beginning of a new era. It is a foundation of a
new Palestine," he told reporters as well as the cheering crowd
afterwards. It is a very important day, he added. All smiles, he
waved goodbye to the crowd when he left the polling station.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is expected to win overwhelmingly over his only
challenger Samiha Khalil in the race for PC president, and the
result can be announced later this evening. However, the results
for PC elections will not be known until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat's wife Suha voted in the West Bank town of
Ramallah where she was born, and Khalil voted in Al Bireh near
Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Following the vote, Khalil told reporters that the Palestinians
should not listen to Israeli orders but to their own
president. She also demanded that the Israeli troops withdraw to
the 1948 border.
</P>
<P>
However, tensions were high in east Jerusalem where some 5,000
Palestinians voted in five post offices.
</P>
<P>
A heavy presence of Israeli troops and police intimidated many
voters and kept them away from the post offices. Some of them
said that they would rather go home than vote.
</P>
<P>
Independent PC candidate in Jerusalem Ziad Abu Zayyad told
reporters that "it is a shame to Israel which claims itself a
democratic society."
</P>
<P>
All in all, the polling process has been very well organized,
peaceful and successful as many international observers put it.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other rejectionist groups boycotting
the elections did not make their mark by trying to disturb the
balloting. It seemed that there had been an agreement between
these groups and the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jewish settlers did not make their attempt to
disrupt the elections as their leaders promised Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Prime Minister's Office today issued a statement
saying that Prime Minister Shimon Peres was very satisfied with
the elections proceeding so far.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Environment Minister Yossi Sarid has sent a telegram of
congratulations to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Sarid said that it is now possible to speed up the negotiations
with the Palestinians on a permanent agreement within one year
instead of three years as agreed upon earlier.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations will begin in May this year and will be
concluded in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
Before the negotiations can start, Israel will demand the PC
cancel a clause in the Palestinian covenant, which calls for
Israel's destruction, within two months following the elections.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Arafat reaffirmed his promise to revoke the
clause. He told an American delegation that after elections he
would convene the Palestinian National Council in order to change
the covenant.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, there was not always positive voice
concerning the elections.
</P>
<P>
In Lebanon and Syria, Palestinians opposed to the elections
held general strikes and closed schools in protest.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Israeli rightwingers are due to hold a mass rally
in downtown Jerusalem tonight to protest against the Palestinian
elections in east Jerusalem, charging that this was the first
step toward dividing the city.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Agrees to Hold Dialogue with U.N. on Oil Sale Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has agreed to accept the
call from U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for
resuming dialogue with the U.N. on Iraq's limited oil sale to
purchase urgently needed humanitarian requirements.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz sent a letter Friday
night informing Boutros-Ghali of Iraq's decision. The move was a
response to a letter delivered one day before from the
U.N. secretary general.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said in his letter that he was becoming
increasely concerned about the report which was addressed to him
from the U.N. agencies and programs about Iraq's increasing human
suffering.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has previously categorically rejected U.N. Resolution 986
which allows it to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every
six months to pay for food and medicine under strict
U.N. supervision.
</P>
<P>
The resolution has violated Iraq's sovereignty, the Iraqi
government insisted.
</P>
<P>
Despite Iraq's agreement in dialogue with the U.N., it is
difficult to predict whether it will be a success or
failure. However, it indicates Iraq's change of position toward
the U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
The deteriorating situation in the country, which has been
under U.N. trade embargo for more than five years following its
1990 invasion of Kuwait, might be behind the reason for the policy
s, said observers.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Advises Tanzania On Rural Electrification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM January 20 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has
advised Tanzania not to embark on its rural electrification
project until the country's economy is improved.
</P>
<P>
Presenting a World Bank draft report on rural electrification
in Tanzania to a one-day seminar on "power sector restructuring
in Tanzania" here on Friday, a resource official from the bank,
Kieran O'brien said, "the project could not take off now for lack
of capital".
</P>
<P>
He said the rural electrification project in Tanzania could be
reconsidered after the country's economy improved, possibly after
10 years.
</P>
<P>
"As the rate-of-return on rural projects is slow, there is a
shortage of commercial finance which instead gravitates towards
projects with highest returns," O'brien said.
</P>
<P>
He said, both the government and the Tanzania Electricity
Supply Corporation (TANESCO) lasck "subsidy" finance, due to
current economic circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank also advised Tanzania not to allow independent
power producers to dictate terms of investment in the sector.
</P>
<P>
The report proposed that TANESCO itself should generate and
sell about 95 percent of the power consumed in the country
through an interconnected system.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, held at the Agip Hotel in the city, was organised
by the Ministry of Energy and Minerals, and attended by people
from the public and private sectors. enditem

<HEADLINE> UK Urges EU to Keep Door Open on Single Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Britain has appealed to its
European Union (EU) partners not to close the door of the single
European currency as London may join it at a later date.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Lamberto Dini, Italian Prime Minister of the
current EU presidency state, British Chancellor of the Exchequer
Kenneth Clarke expressed concern that founding members of a single
currency should not block others from subsequently entering.
</P>
<P>
Clarke and many other British officials are determined to
retain the option of joining the single currency, in spite of the
government's Eurosceptic drift.
</P>
<P>
They fear that if Britain did not join in the first round and
lost the option to enter later, the country could be permanently
marginalised.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Klarke reiterated in the letter that Britain would
oppose any recreation of an Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) for
countries remain outside of the single currency.
</P>
<P>
A new ERM would be unworkable given the likely currency
turbulence around the EU, he added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that EU finance ministers will hold a
conference in Italy early next week to discuss all the possible
problems if only a small core of EU countries problems goes ahead
with the monetary union in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Warring Parties to Discuss POWs' Freedom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The release of prisoners of
war (POWs) is likely to be discussed at a private meeting between
the Commander of NATO ground troops in Sarajevo and military
representatives of the three warring parties of the Bosnian War.
</P>
<P>
Less than a third of the 900 Bosnian POWs on a Red Cross list
were freed by the Friday deadline, the first big failure of the
U.S.-brokered peace accord, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Pierre Gauthier, head of the International Red Cross
delegation in Sarajevo, called it "a mess" and said there were no
definite plans for any prisoner releases Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He blamed all sides for trying to use POWs to win concessions
in other areas.
</P>
<P>
At the deadline of 23:00 GMT Friday, only 225 prisoners were
freed at Sarajevo airport. Among them were 68 Bosnian government
soldiers and 150 Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
The deal to free the prisoners was made after U.S. envoys waged
a diplomatic power play on the Bosnian government, which had
insisted it would not exchange POWs until the Serbs had accounted
for some 20,000 missing Moslems.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Republican leaders to Resume Budget Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today urged Republican leaders to return to the table and resume
budget negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"The budget talks are suspended now because the Republican
congressional leaders walked away from the table. I wish they
hadn't done that, and I hope they'll come back, and soon," Clinton
said today in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
Clinton put Republican leaders on notice that if a partial
shutdown does take place on January 26 for the third time since
November, he will do all he can to make sure the Republicans gets
the blame.
</P>
<P>
"Two government shutdowns so far have cost taxpayers about a
billion-and-a-half dollars," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said he continues to believe the budget can be
balanced in seven years without the kind of cuts that would
devastate Medicare, Medicaid, the environment, and support for
education.
</P>
<P>
With most lawmakers due to return to the Capitol from a winter
recess next week, House leaders scheduled a leadership meeting for
Monday and a gathering of House Republican lawmakers for Tuesday
to decide what to do.

<HEADLINE> Special Gift for Blind Pupils  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It is really wonderful," said Hilary Wheadon, a British
teacher at the Beijing Sherman Bilingual Boarding School who led
her pupils to sing songs for the blind.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 schools in Beijing organized their students to
pitch in the donation, and Vice-Mayor He Luli also pledged her
full support.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very good chance for educating the children to care
for others," and this is a view shared by many parents who brought
children with calendars to the retaurants.
</P>
<P>
A TV station branch of the Republic of Korea (ROK) stationed in
Beijing urged residing ROK companies to donate, according to Li
Pei, a young public relations woman officer who works at
MacDonold's.
</P>
<P>
The news was soon spread across the country when some national
newpapers covered this event.
</P>
<P>
Many people posted high-quality, exquisite calendars to the
Beijing sponsors from other cities and towns. Residents in
northwest China's Xi'an city also sent calendars to a local school
for the blind.
</P>
<P>
When all the 110,000 calendars are collected and cut into
standardized pieces of paper, they are expected to be sent to
eleven schools for the blind in eight provinces. Some firms will
voluntarily store and transport the paper, said Tim Lai, senior
general manager of the Beijing MacDonold's Company.
</P>
<P>
"Although the donors only cope with some problems facing blind
children, they are contributing to creating a better environment
for their education," said Teng Weimin, vice chairman of the China
Association of the Blinds.
</P>
<P>
As principal of the 121-year-old Beijing School for the Blind,
Hai Yusen held that education is vital to the life of blind
children.
</P>
<P>
"A blind person can be useful to society when he or she masters
whatever skills and expertise," Hai said.
</P>
<P>
"So I hope more people will be concerned about their
education", he said.
</P>
<P>
China now has 7.8 million blind people. Despite the fact that
some of them have been trained as massagers, piano tuners,
athletes and musicians, many are still awaiting aid from society.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A 12-year-old blind girl, Zhen
Chunxia, accepts a special gift, paper recycled from used
calendar, on behalf of her 160 pupils in the Beijing School for
the Blind.
</P>
<P>
The gift paper, which has been cut according to the standard
size of special paper for the blind children to "write" braille
on, is unique because it is made from more than 110,000 calendars
donated by tens of thousands of people, Chinese and foreign, both
in Beijing or other parts of the country in last month.
</P>
<P>
"I thank all of you because you've brought kindness and
affection for us in this cold season," little Chunxia, a fifth
grade girl, said at the ground floor of Wangfujing MacDonold's
Restaurant, a well-decorated site where she and her schoolmates
cannot see.
</P>
<P>
But they could hear and feel how happy and moved people were at
that moment when sponsors announced that the donation activity was
crowned with success.
</P>
<P>
Lots of people have been involved in such a vast activity, the
first of its kind ever held in China with an aim of providing
those students in need with the paper to substitute for costly,
special paper for the blind.
</P>
<P>
It was Xiao Yu, a phone-in program hostess at Beijing
Children's Radio, who was first to got to know blind pupils'
difficulties last year.
</P>
<P>
She learned that there was a shortage of the paper among those
children, who had to spend 250 to 300 yuan annually on purchasing
the paper, which a heavy burden for most of their families.
</P>
<P>
The radio staffs decided to launch a calendar donation activity
in the city, since all these used calendars were often piled up or
discarded. They effort was joined by the Beijing MacDonold's Food
Company, which has opened 17 restaurants citywide.
</P>
<P>
People's enthusiasm, especially that of teenagers, was beyond
of imagination when the activity was started on December 15, and
local media covered it.
</P>
<P>
People from all walks of life in the capital city, old or
young, working or retired, sent calendars to the MacDonold's
restaurants in their vicinities.
</P>
<P>
"We know that we have to stand together to overcome your
difficulties," a group of primary school pupils said in a letter
to the blind children.

<HEADLINE> Liberal Policy Helps Development in Nepal: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The liberal economic policy
adopted by the Nepali government five years ago has been positive
for the economic development of the country, according to a study
released here today.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by the Institute for Integrated
Development Studies last year, found that the number of
industrial establishments had increased in the country and the
share of industry in the economy had been growing since the
liberal policy was introduced in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The average annual growth of export had almost doubled and the
share of trade in the gross domestic product (GDP) had increased
40 percent during the period, it said.
</P>
<P>
By conducting the study, the Kathmandu-based institute tried to
evaluate the potential and actual impact on industry, trade,
agriculture, employment and inflation of various liberal policies
adopted during the last five years.
</P>
<P>
The study concluded that the liberalization policy had given
impetus to national development in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, the privatization of public enterprises
has reduced government participation in the economic sector and
enabled it to invest more in essential sectors like education.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the sustainability of economic
liberalization depended mainly on low inflation and a stable or
depreciating exchange rate for the Nepalese currency.
</P>
<P>
However, the study said liberalization and privatization had
raised unemployment but also mentioned that more investment in the
industrial sector had generated new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Stating that market-oriented policies would not benefit the
poorer sections of the society, the study called for sustainable
welfare programs and an adequate social safety system in Nepal.

<HEADLINE> G-7 Finance Chiefs Discuss Economic Slowdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Finance ministers and central
bank heads of the Group of Seven leading economic powers gathered
here today for a meeting aimed at trying to reverse the economic
slowdowns in Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
French Finance and Economy Minister Jean Arthuis held bilateral
talks with Japan's new Finance Minister Wataru Kubo, German
Finance Minister Theo Waigel and U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin at the start of the day-long caucus.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Friday that the ministers would seek appropriate
monetary policies to ensure that the global recovery stays on
course.
</P>
<P>
A further cut in short term interest rates might be the answer
despite this week's easing of rates announced by Germany, France
and some of their neighbors, he hinted.
</P>
<P>
The fact that inflation has remained under control in the
United States, Germany and Japan "offers some room to respond to
slower growth if that proves necessary," he said.
</P>
<P>
His remarks provoked speculation that ministers might consider
coordinating interest rate policy, a move Germany has always
opposed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, analysts said Japan would get a chance at the
meeting to stress the importance of backing a call for an "orderly
reversal" of the dollar's weakness against the yen.
</P>
<P>
Kubo welcomed the further firming of the dollar and Rubin also
reaffirmed Thursday the U.S. government's belief that a strong
dollar is in the "best interests" of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the meeting are British Chancellor of the
Exchequer Kenneth Clarke, Italian Premier Lamberto Dini and
Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin.
</P>
<P>
Finance leaders of the G-7 nations get together three times a
year to coordinate economic policy and currency exchange
rates. They usually hold separate talks during the spring and
autumn session of the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Seize Nine More Chechen Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian troops seized nine more
Chechen militants who had tried to flee southern Russia after a
hostage crisis, the Interfax news service reported.
</P>
<P>
Russian troops have so far captured 39 of some 300 Chechen
militants who were holed up with 100 hostages in the Dagestani
village of Pervomaiskoye after raiding the nearby city of Kizlyar.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Russian forces in Chechnya told Interfax 10
rebels tried to leave Pervomaiskoye on Friday but one rebel was
killed and nine were seized along with some weapons.
</P>
<P>
Russian forces stormed Pervomaiskoye to wipe out the
hostage-taking Chechen militants. During the four-day operation
that started Monday, more than 150 guerrillas and 26 Russian
soldiers were killed, President Boris Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
While briefing Friday's summit meeting of the Commonwealth of
Independent States, Yeltsin said the Chechen militants tried on
Wednesday and Thursday to break out of the Russian encirclement in
Pervomaiskoye by hiding using hostages, mostly women and local
policemen, as shields.
</P>
<P>
But he did not say whether or not the militants had escaped.
</P>
<P>
According to a well-informed official source, some 100 Chechen
militants including their chief Salman Raduyev managed to break
through the ring of troops.
</P>
<P>
Chechen chief of staff Aslan Maskhadov said on Friday that
Raduyev had escaped and was hiding in the rebel-held Chechen
mountains.

<HEADLINE> Indian Ruling Party Confident of Majority in Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- V.N. Gadgil, spokesman for
the ruling Indian National Congress (Indira) or Congress-I, said
here today that the party would get "comfortable majority" in the
coming general elections.
</P>
<P>
"I am not making any tall claims. It's a realistic analysis,"
he said while replying to questions on the poll prospects of his
party following implication of several congressmen in the
sensational Hawala case.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the Hawala racket case would have any adverse
impact, Gadgil said it "will help the Congress-I."
</P>
<P>
He ruled out imposition of emergency in the country in the
light of the large scale involvement of politicians in the
multi-crore rupee Hawala scandal.
</P>
<P>
In an unprecedented action, the Indian Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI) Tuesday filed charge sheets against seven top
politicians, including major opposition Bharatiya Janata Party
President L.K. Advani and breakaway Congress leader Arjun Singh,
for allegedly receiving huge sums of money from some suspected
Hawala dealers.
</P>
<P>
Hawala trade is an illegal trading system of foreign exchange
in India.
</P>
<P>
The bureau, at the same time, sought the president's permission
to prosecute three sitting cabinet ministers from the Congress-I
for their alleged involvement in the scandal. All the three
ministers resigned Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Jinzhou Becomes Third Largest Port in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Jinzhou, China's first
shareholding port, has grown into the third largest sea port in
northeast China, after Dalian and Yingkou.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the port started in 1986. In 1993, it
became the first shareholding port in China. Its major
shareholders include the Dongfang Group, one of the top 10
non-state-owned enterprises of the country, the Jinzhou Petroleum
Chemicals Ltd. and the Jinzhou Port Administration.
</P>
<P>
The port has abundant cargo sources from the hinterland and a
developed highway and railway network. Its annual business time
is as long as 360 days.
</P>
<P>
The port now has five berths in operation, handling 6.3 million
tons of cargoes a year. By early next century, the number of
berths is expected to rise to 60, with an annual handling capacity
of 30 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The bright future of the port has attracted the attention of
many overseas businesses. The port has signed agreements with
U.S. companies for the construction of oil wharves and other
facilities, involving investment worth of tens of millions of US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The shareholding system of the port guaranteed the most
efficient management of it. As it has no state quota to finish, it
also has to attract clients by providing the best services.
</P>
<P>
Noted economist Ma Hong said that the whole new management of
the port and development of the Bohai-rim economic belt will make
it possible for Jinzhou to grow into a major international port in
north China.

<HEADLINE> Asia-Pacific Commission Meets to Promote Forestry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Asia-Pacific Forestry
Commission has affirmed its commitment to achieving and
implementing sustainable forest management as rapidly as possible.
</P>
<P>
This was contained at a press release issued here today at the
end of the 16th session of the commission.
</P>
<P>
The commission has agreed to establish an ad hoc working group
to strengthen its efforts in developing environmentally sound
forest harvesting techniques and promoting the development of a
regional code of practice for harvesting in Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, the model code would provide
guidance to countries and organizations on methods for minimizing
damage to the region's forests when timber and other forest
products are harvested. The code would complement existing
national codes, and provide a supporting framework for countries
currently without codes.
</P>
<P>
The commission also endorsed a proposal for an Asia-Pacific
forestry sector outlook study to be carried out by members over
the next year, added the press release.
</P>
<P>
The commission was established by the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) of the United Nations in 1949. The purpose of
the commission is to advise on the formulation of forest policy
and to review and coordinate its implementation on the regional
level, to exchange information, to advise on suitable practices
and action related to technical problems, and to make appropriate
related recommendations.
</P>
<P>
The current session of the commission began here on January 15
at the invitation of the government of Myanmar. Delegates from 19
countries and three UN agencies as well as observers from six
intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations attended the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Crashes out of Australian Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- World No.1 Pete Sampras of the
United States was surprisingly topplled by young Australian Mark
Philippoussis in straight sets in the third round at the
Australian Open today.
</P>
<P>
Sampras was defeated by the 19-year-old Australian 4-6, 6-7
(11-9) and 6-7 (3-7) in a 2-hour-19-minute match at the center
court at Flinders Park in Melbourne this evening.
</P>
<P>
It was so close a match that nobody could tell who would win
until the last few points of the tiebreak in the final set.
</P>
<P>
It was a match of ace services and great volleys.
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis had about 40 aces during the match. He
registered a record of 203-km per hour service in the third set.
</P>
<P>
But Sampras made more successful volleys than Philippoussis,
who drove the ball into the net several times.
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis' forehand and backhand strokes were just as a
headache to Sampars as Pistol's to him.
</P>
<P>
Cheered by over 13 thousand Australian fans at the center
court, Philippoussis gave a full play of his all-around,
serve-and-volley game against the world No.1.
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis did not yield a single service game to Sampras
and forced the top player into two tiebreaks in the match.
</P>
<P>
He broke Sampras' service at the tenth game in the first set,
winning at 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Then the two big hitters went into a see-saw match in the
following two sets. They held each of their own services in the
second set.
</P>
<P>
Sampras led by 3-0 in the tiebreak before Philippoussis took
the turn to serve. The Australian rallied and levelled with
Sampras at 6-6. But he squandered two set points before winning
at 11-9.
</P>
<P>
Neither could break each other's service in the third set
before the tiebreak. Then the explosiveness went all out from
Philippoussis, who led at 6-1 in the tiebreak with his aces and
smart volleys. Sampras tried to catch up at 3-6, but failed to
stop the Australian from storming to his win with another ace.
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe it. I still don't believe that I got so many
points on my serve," Philippoussis said after match.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his feeling about beating the world No.1, he
said:"I still can't believe it."
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis, just turning 19 three weeks ago, has been
regarded as the most promising player in Australia.
</P>
<P>
He reached three APT tour finals last year. In the past 12
months, he has improved his world ranking from the 304th to the
32nd.
</P>
<P>
He has an extraordinarily powerful service at his age, which is
already comparable with that of the world top hitter Goran
Ivanisevic of Crotia.
</P>
<P>
He also has an all-around game, featuring a serve-and-volley
style.
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis took part in last year's US Open and was beaten
by Sampras in the first round. That was their first encounter.
</P>
<P>
Brad Gilbert, coach of world No.2 Andre Agassi, said that
Philippoussis was going to make "the top 10 within 18 months."
</P>
<P>
A son of a Greek immigrant in Melbourne, the 1.94-meter-tall
young Australian has been trained by his father Nick Philippoussis
and just shifted to the coaching of Nick Bollettieri, former
American mentor to Boris Becker, Agassi, Jim Courier and Mary
Pierce.
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis is going to play fellow Australian Mark Woodford
in the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, winner of Wimbledon and US Open last year, suffered
his earliest exit in the Australian Open this year. He was
runner-up last year and champion of the 1994 Australian Open.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Companies Listed to Develop Modern Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese securities
official urges companies that have been listed to develop as
required by modern enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the 323 companies listed on Shanghai and Shenzhen
stock exchanges were state-owned enterprises, so that the
requirements President Jiang Zemin recently made on deepening
enterprise reforms and setting up modern enterprise system are
applicable in those companies," explained Zhou Daojiong, chairman
of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).
</P>
<P>
The companies listed are among the first in China to run in
line with market rules, and their senior management should be
filled with the sense of operation according to the Corporate Law
as well as other securities laws and regulations, Zhou said at a
conference held in this capital of south China's Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
"They should increase their market awareness," he said. "Top
managers should not blindly pursue the expansion of their
companies, which should, instead, grow in an intensive way,
focusing on upgrading management and technology, producing more
new products and striving for bigger market shares."
</P>
<P>
He demanded that the companies listed establish a mechanism in
which the board of directors and board of supervisors report to
share-holders and managers and to board of directors, as specified
by the Corporate Law.
</P>
<P>
"Sound decision-making, implementation and supervision systems
should be built to ensure that share-holders, board of directors,
board of supervisors and managers could exercise their rights
fully," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the companies listed to make their operation more
transparent by releasing accurate and time information.
</P>
<P>
"They should make annual and mid-term reports and reports
on major events at times and through procedures as required by
laws, and consciously accept supervision by investors and
general public," Zhou said.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Chechen Hijackers of Ferry Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The four-day hijacking of a
Turkish ferry boat ended peacefully on Friday as the Chechen
militants turned themselves in and released all the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen, who anchored the Avrasia ferry at the northern
entrance of the Bosporus straits, surrendered after six hours of
negotiations by throwing their weapons overboard and were later
picked up by a Turkish coast guard boat.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said there were nine hijackers on board but
Istanbul's Governor Ridvan Yenisen said there were only four.
</P>
<P>
He said there were 242 hostages on board, including 125
Russians and Ukrainians.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Chechen gunmen seized the ferry on Tuesday in the port
city of Trabzon and took it on a 900-kilometer journey that ended
at the northern entrance of the Bosporus straits.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers' leader, Muhammed Tokcan, said before his capture
that the gunmen had no quarrel with Turkey. Their action was aimed
at Russia in protest at the storming of a band of Chechen
separatists in the Dagestani village of Pervomaiskoye in southern
Russia, where they were holding more than 100 people hostage after
a raid on neighboring Kizlyar.
</P>
<P>
Turkish caretaker Prime Minister Tansu Ciller told reporters
she was happy that the hostage drama had ended peacefully.

<HEADLINE> Workers Encouraged to Contribute Skills in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Workers at the Shanghai
Dazhonghua Rubber Plant have developed an outer-die set cleaner to
help their enterprise to save a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
"The cost of this invented device is only one tenth of the
price for the machine of a similar kind sold on the market," said
the 55-year-old Hu Yuqi, one of the chief designers of the plant.
</P>
<P>
"The reason that I voluntarily contributed my skills to the
plant is because the plant take us workers as masters for the
plant development," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is China's largest economic center. During the
transitional period from planning economy to market-oriented
economy, many state-owned enterprises have issued a package of
reform measures to enliven their economy.
</P>
<P>
Many of them have come to recognize that investment in
affections for people, such as respects, understanding and caring
for employees, is as important as the strict enterprise management.
</P>
<P>
"Employees cannot work for the enterprise wholeheartedly if we
do not respect them and follow their words," said Li Nianzheng,
director of the Shanghai Rubber Plant.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the investment in human feeling has paid off
in his plant.
</P>
<P>
When employees learned that their plant would carry out a plan
to tap the potential for increasing production two years ago, 400
out of the 3,000 employees pooled their wisdom and set forth
proposals to the plant director.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the plant generated a sales output value totalling
1.1 billion yuan last year, an increase of 14 percent over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai now ranks first in the country as far as the economic
performance of its enterprises is concerned.

KHARTOUM, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Minister of Finance
Abd-Allah Hassan Ahmed has reiterated his country's commitment to
repay its debts to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

<P>
The Local daily New Sudan today quoted the minister as saying

IMF in accordance with a recently signed letter of intent between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed voiced the hope that his country's relation with the IMF
would not worsen again.

The talks resulted in fruitful conclusions as the IMF rescinded
its resolution in September 1994, and the two sides agreed on a
schedule for the repayment of the Sudanese debts which amount to
some 1.7 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Armenia, Turkmenistan to Expand Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers from Iran,
Armenia and Turkmenistan gathered here today to explore ways to
expand their economic cooperation and trade.
</P>
<P>
The main agenda of the three-day trilateral meeting will focus
on cooperation of the three countries in the field of
transportation of goods from Armenia to Turkmenistan via Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said at the session
that the best way to ensure regional peace and security would be
through expansion of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Armenian Foreign Minister Vagan Papazian and Turkmen Foreign
Minister Boris Shikhmuradov were present at the meeting today.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said, "In order to resolve the existing tensions in
the region, the Islamic Republic of Iran is continuing its
efforts in the region."
</P>
<P>
"We have always stressed good neighborly relations and the
spirit of cooperation in the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Considering the importance of regional cooperation, Iran is
extending, and will continue to extend, its hand for cooperation
with its neighbors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Velayati added that Iran wanted to serve as a link between
Central Asia and the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
According to Velayati, to better serve its northern neighbors,
Iran has taken measures such as establishment of new railway
lines, new customs checkpoints in the north, and free trade zones
and development of the ports both in the south and north.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Turkmenistan enjoy excellent close ties. The
relationship between Iran and Armenia is also friendly because of
the historical support of Iran for the Armenians who were under
Ottoman persecution.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between Iran and Armenia has become much
friendlier since Azerbaijan decided to exclude Iran from an oil
consortium which included American oil companies.
</P>
<P>
Though many Armenians left Iran after the Islamic Revolution
of 1979, a sizable community of Armenian-Iranians still exists
in Tehran, northwestern Iran and Isfahan.

<HEADLINE> Yangpu Promises Rosy Future for Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Executives of dozens of large
enterprises from home and abroad have come to seek investment
opportunities in the Yangpu Economic Development Zone in south
China's Hainan Province, according to Jiang Shangzhou, head of the
administration of the economic zone.
</P>
<P>
Discussion on some large projects, including an oil refinery,
polyethylene plant, paper pulp factory and automobile assembly
plant has entered a substantial stage, Jiang, who has a doctor's
degree, said, adding that some contracts have been signed.
</P>
<P>
The economic zone is also targeted by the state as a first
choice for a ten billion-yuan state-funded chemical fertilizer
plant, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yangpu, located in northwest Hainan, China's youngest province,
and facing the Beibu Gulf, was approved to be an economic
development zone by the State Council in 1992. It covers an area
of 31 sq km, 27.353 sq km of which was set aside for foreign
investment for 70 years in a package.
</P>
<P>
The developers, headed by Kumagai Gumi (Hong Kong) Limited,
have planned to invest 18 billion Hong Kong dollars in basic
construction within 15 years and build the area into an
export-oriented industrial port city with a population of 400,000
and 60 billion yuan worth of industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
Since the overall construction started in March 1993, 3.6
billion Hong Kong dollars have been put into the basic
construction. Among the major facilities which have been completed
are a 315,500-kw power plant, a supporting oil wharf and
electricity grid, infrastructural facilities in the central
district, and a modernized posts and telecommunications project.
</P>
<P>
In addition, construction of an expressway between the capital
city of Haikou and the economic zone started in November last
year. When it is opened to traffic in 1997, it will cut the
drive between Haikou and Yangpu from present three hours to one
hour. The second-phase project of the Yangpu port, involving an
investment of 780 million yuan from the government, will also be
started after the Spring Festival this year, which falls on
February 19.
</P>
<P>
The developers have put large amounts of funds into Yangpu
within less than three years, Dr Jiang said, promising that basic
conditions are ready for Yangpu to accommodate large industrial
projects.

<HEADLINE> Economists Expect EMU to Start on Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- More than half the European
economists quizzed in a private poll believe a single currency
system will go ahead as planned in 1999, in spite of the recent
slowdown in the region's economy.
</P>
<P>
Four fifths believe economic and monetary union (EMU) will
occur before 2003, against eight percent who believe it will never
happen, according to a survey of private sector EU economists by
Consensus Economics, an independent UK research group.
</P>
<P>
But the optimists are divided on the start date of the monetary
system, with 57 percent hopeful it will begin in 1999 and 22
percent thinking it won't happen until 2000.
</P>
<P>
However, most of the 80 experts asked doubt that any member
country will be able to meet the tough standards for monetary
union laid down in the 1991 Maastricht Treaty by the 1999
deadline. The conditions for union include a budget deficit below
3 percent of gross domestic product and a low inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
The economists think a compromise will be made on the criteria
before the introduction of a single currency.
</P>
<P>
Half of the economists come from Germany and Britain, and the
rest from the other 13 EU countries.
</P>
<P>
So far only the smallest member of the 15-nation bloc,
Luxembourg, meets all the criteria for entry into the single
currency system.

</P>
<P>
It added that both areas of narrowing in the artery were
successfully opened up with balloon angioplasty with no
complications.
</P>
<P>
The Senior Minister was transferred to the Cardio-Thoracic
Intensive Care Unit where he will be under observation and close

pains during exercise over the past few days, and he was seen by
his physician and cardiologist at the Singapore Heart Center
Thursday.

possibility of narrowing of the coronary arteries," the Prime
Minister's Office said in a statement earlier today.
</P>
<P>
The Senior Minister was then admitted into the Singapore
General Hospital Friday evening for observation, and for the
angiographic study of the coronary circulation.

rather, seeking freedom of speech and reinstatement of parliament
that was disbanded in 1975.

More than half of Bahrain's 500,000 indigenous population are
Shiites. The ruling al Khalifa family belongs to the mainstream
Sunni sect.

measures against those who are using mosques and religious

</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit, the minister will discuss with the

to the annual report by the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
It is the first visit to Syria by a Jordanian minister this

Jordanian-Syrian relations cooled down since Jordan broke the
joint Arab line in the Arab-Israeli peace talks and signed a

</P>
<P>
The authorities from both sides often exchanged accusations of
their different stands on the peace with Israel and on the issue

<HEADLINE> hke012029--Investment to Pakistan Savings Sachems short of target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Investment to Pakistan's
National Savings Schemes showed a shortfall of 8 billion rupees
(about 0.23 billion US dollars) against the target of 27.37
billion rupees (about 0.78 billion dollars) during the first half
of the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
According to sources of the National Savings Organization here
today, National Savings Schemes registered an investment of 19.27
billion rupees (about 0.55 billion dollars) from July to December
1995.
</P>
<P>
The share of Karachi Stock Exchange which used to be major in
the investment to the National Saving Schemes was not substantial
during this period. Withdrawals by the companies during this
period are another reason for the shortfall in investment.
</P>
<P>
The overall target of investment in savings schemes is 54.73
billion rupees (1.56 billion dollars) for the 1995-96 financial
year starting July 1.
</P>
<P>
But keeping in view the current trend of investment in this
regard, experts said the goal is difficult to be achieved.

<HEADLINE> 200 Indonesians Missing in Vessel Accident in Aceh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A passenger motor vessel
carrying around 200 Indonesians on board sank in a strait in Aceh
province Friday night.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the local administration Natsir Ali disclosed
this today in Banda Aceh, the capital city of Aceh province,
confirming that 29 died, 15 survived and 182 missing.
</P>
<P>
According to an Antara report from Banda Aceh today, the
passenger vessel is carrying 80 tons of cement, 14 tons of daily
necessities, 13 vehicles, 19 motorbikes, 210 passengers and 16
crew members. The vessel left Krueng Raya port in Banda Aceh to
Bahohan port in Sabang.
</P>
<P>
The Japan-made vessel was built in 1970 and began to sail on
the line since 1987.
</P>
<P>
Local sea transportation officials estimated that the vessel
went off course due to torrent and ran up on rocks in the sea.
</P>
<P>
The ship sank six miles before it reached Sabang's Balohan
port. The ship lost contact with the port after about two hours
sailing.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities had yet to find out the cause of the
accident. The captain of the vessel was still missing.
</P>
<P>
A search and rescue team along with the Indonesian Navy Force
and local authorities were currently searching for the missing
passengers.

<HEADLINE> Production of Bohai Oilfield Hits All-Time High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
TIANJIN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The offshore Bohai Oilfield,
near this largest port city in northern China, pumped a record
1.27 million tons of oil and gas in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Of these, crude oil accounted for 1.9 million tons, and gas
370 million cu m which is equivalent to 370,000 tons of oil.
</P>
<P>
Bohai's "Suizhong-1," a major oilfield, produced over one
million tons of crude oil in the year. The production capacity of
the oilfield stands at 1.5 million tons annually, 50 percent
above the designed capacity.
</P>
<P>
Output of Bohai's Chengbei oilfield, however, dropped by
10,000 tons, or three percent, from 1994. The oilfield, which has
been jointly developed by China and Japan for ten years, has seen
a decrease of output since 1994, after maintaining a stable output
of 400,000 tons for six years in a row.
</P>
<P>
The "Bozhong 28-1," which has stopped production but was
discovered to be rich in gas reserves, will be developed again
with many other oilfields in the west of the Bohai Oilfield.

CAIRO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Mohamed Hamed Abul Nasr, leader
of Egypt's outlawed Moslem Brotherhood, died today at the age of
83, the Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The general religious guide of Egypt's largest Islamic
fundamentalist group died after spending several weeks in coma in
a Cairo hospital, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Abul Nasr, regarded as a moderate Islamic activist, had led the
organization since 1986. He supported the imposition of Islamic
law but suggested it could be implemented gradually.
</P>
<P>
The organization has been largely tolerately by the government
since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The group secretly managed to mushroom over decades and recruit
more members under the guise of spreading Islamic doctrine,
according to earlier local media reports.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, however, the government arrested some members
of the group for allegedly associating and supporting numerous
Islamic militant groups which were responsible for a four-year-old
bloody campaign against the government.

KUALA LUMPUR, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said today that
it would provide fire fighting equipment and training assistance
worth 3 million Malaysian Ringgit (1.2 million US dollars) to
Cambodia to help the country set up a skilled fire brigade.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Housing and Local Government Minister Ting Chew Peh

fire brigade would arrive in Malaysia in May this year to attend
the training for five to six weeks at the fire brigade training
center in Kuala Kubu Baru.

Malaysia will also supply Cambodia with shoes, uniforms and
other materials to be used by firemen, he said.
</P>
<P>
"At present, they don't have suitable clothing and are attired
only in singles while fighting fire, which exposes them to
danger," Ting added.
</P>
<P>
According to Malaysia's news agency Bernama, the Malaysian fire
service department has trained officials from Brunei and Sri Lanka
and is ready to share its knowledge and skill with other
countries.

<HEADLINE> Polish Ruling Party Proposes Cabinet Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Polish Peasant Party, one of
Poland's two ruling parties, Friday called for a cabinet reshuffle
to resolve a political crisis touched off by spy allegations
against Prime Minister Jozef Oleksy.
</P>
<P>
Local press said the Peasant Party formally presented the
proposal, on which it decided on Thursday, to its coalition
partner -- the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) early Friday.
</P>
<P>
Friday afternoon, the two parties held a two-hour
behind-the-door talks on the proposal, but made no decision. They
agreed to resume negotiations next week.
</P>
<P>
The Peasant Party said in a statement after the talks that the
current political crisis is threatening democratic order in the
country and Poland's interests on the international stage.
</P>
<P>
Jerzy Szmajdzinski, chairman of the SLD parliament group, noted
after the talks that "anything could happen in Poland, and all
kinds of situation should be taken into account."
</P>
<P>
But he added that no decision will be made in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Poland was thrown into political turmoil after the interior
ministry announced last month that security evidence showed Oleksy
had spied for foreign intelligence between 1983 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
Oleksy said the evidence was fabricated by his political foes.
</P>
<P>
The Polish parliament has set up a special commission to
investigate the case.
</P>
<P>
In the past month, right-wing political parties and
organizations led by former President Lech Walesa, who failed in
last December's presidential elections, mounted pressure for a
cabinet reshuffle as well as the resignation of Oleksy. They
offered to form a new coalition with the Peasant Party to replace
the current one.
</P>
<P>
The coalition between the Peasant Party and the SLD was formed
in October 1993 after the two parties won parliamentary elections
in September.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Casts Vote in Palestinian Elections (By Xie Dongfeng and Wang Yukui) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA CITY, January 20 (Xinhua) -- PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat,
who is expected to be elected President of the Palestinian
Council (PC), cast his vote in the first Palestinian elections in
history this morning.
</P>
<P>
Arafat voted at the Anas Benmalek Boys' School at 11:45 a.m.,
the No. 66 polling station in the Gaza City, which has a total of
183 stations.
</P>
<P>
At first, Arafat chose 12 out of 92 candidates for 12 PC seats
distributed to the Gaza City and cast his ballot into a white
box, and then he cast another vote into a red box for PC
President.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, he told dozens of reporters that "This is the
beginning of a new era. It is a foundation of a new Palestine."
</P>
<P>
Arafat, running for PC President, is expected to win
overwhelmingly over his only challenger Samiha Khalil, a
grandmother and a social worker, who will vote in Al Bireh near
Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived at the school at 11:40, 40 minutes later than
scheduled, to the delight of some 2,000 Gazans waiting outside
the voting station. They chanted "Ra'ees (President)" and "Abu
Amar" continuously.
</P>
<P>
Then, he was escorted by his bodyguards and his aides to inch
into the already crowded polling room. He first kissed a woman
working staff, greeted all those around and then managed to vote.
</P>
<P>
After the vote, he was escorted outside the room, smiled and
waved hands to the jubilated and enthusiastic crowd before
returning to his office.
</P>
<P>
The voting started at 7 a.m. this morning throughout the Gaza
Strip and the West Bank, and will close at 7 p.m. tonight.
</P>
<P>
The results for the 88-member PC election will be announced
Sunday morning, while the winner of the PC president race will be
declared at 10 p.m. tonight by the Central Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
So far, the elections have been going on smoothly. Activists
from Hamas and other rejectionist groups did not disrupt the
voting process.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Official Criticizes Israel over Polls in East Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Head of the Egyptian delegation
charged with monitoring today's Palestinian elections, Taher
Shash, has criticized Israel for insisting that Palestinians in
east Jerusalem cast their votes in post offices.
</P>
<P>
Shash, in an interview with Egypt's Sawt Al-Arab Radio aired
today, said that post offices are small and will not be able to
accommodate all the voters.
</P>
<P>
He said that Egypt has raised the issue and expressed its
reservations in this regard, adding that Israel has promised not
to hinder voting.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian 30-member delegation visited the polling stations
in the constituencies in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and met with
some candidates and voters, Shash said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said that his
country is paying great attention to the first Palestinian
elections, which he described as an important step toward a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian voters will elect today an 88-member legislative
assembly, and in a separate ballot, the president of an executive
branch.
</P>
<P>
PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat urged Palestinians Friday to vote,
especially in disputed east Jerusalem. More than 1 million
Palestinians are entitled to vote.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Security Bothers Palestinian Elections in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Palestinians in
east Jerusalem turned out to cast their ballots in the first
Palestinian elections today, but they were much bothered by tight
Israeli security measures.
</P>
<P>
The voting in east Jerusalem started one hour later than other
Palestinian areas because the polling takes place at five post
offices which open at 8 a.m..
</P>
<P>
On the Salah Ed-Din Street, at the largest post office in east
Jerusalem, eight out of the total of 12 windows are serving for
the voting, while the other four opens for business as usual.
</P>
<P>
There are two boxes for voters to cast their ballots, the
white one for the Palestinian Council (PC) members, and the red
one for PC Chairman.
</P>
<P>
Most of the voters are enthusiastic about the elections,
saying that this is a historical day for all the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"I am so happy today," said shoes shop owner Zakaria
Maraja. He also said that he will vote for PLO Chairman Yasser
Arafat as the Chairman of the 88-member PC.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is expected to win the race over his only challenger
Samiha Khalil, a woman social worker, while 672 candidates are
competing for 88 PC seats.
</P>
<P>
Inside the post office, several observers from the European
Union and a small group of Japanese parliamentarians are
monitoring the voting.
</P>
<P>
However, outside the office, Israeli border policemen and
soldiers are on hand as well as security service agents.
</P>
<P>
Some Palestinians scuffled with Israeli police, and there have
been reports of arrests of Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Israeli army said today it has
arrested a Palestinian woman who tried to stab an Israeli border
policeman near the Rachel Tomb at the entrance of Bethlehem, south
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel considers the whole Jerusalem as its "undivided and
eternal capital" and there have been protests by rightwingers
that Palestinian voting would threaten Israel's "sovereignty"
over the city.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other parts where the elections are taking place, there
are no Palestinian police in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Some Palestinians have already protested against the tight
Israeli security, which they say would keep some voters away from
the post offices because of fear. "It's not security, but
intimidation," said Saeh Jama, a Moslem.
</P>
<P>
EU observer Terezija Stoasits from Austria told reporters that
both the Palestinians and the EU observers' delegation have
protested to Israel over the development, demanding a change in
the situation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, over 40,000 Palestinians in east Jerusalem will
vote outside the city boundaries in polling stations.
</P>
<P>
Fifty two candidates are running for seven PC seats for east
Jerusalem, two reserved for Christian and five for Moslems.
</P>
<P>
The result of the elections for PC Chairman will be announced
tonight, while the results for the PC race will be known Sunday
morning.

<HEADLINE> Youngsters Stage Anti-Drug Parade in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 400 representatives
from 20 voluntary agencies, local groups, primary and secondary
schools as well as popular singers took to the streets in Kowloon
City today to spread the message of "together we can beat drugs"
in a parade.
</P>
<P>
The parade, jointly organized by local police and anti-drug
organizations, was aimed at encouraging the active involvement of
local organizations and arousing residents' awareness of the
ill-effects of taking drugs.
</P>
<P>
Targeted at youngsters, the event was also designed to help
them cultivate their self-esteem and promote a better
understanding and appreciation in leading a healthy drug-free
life.
</P>
<P>
Drug abuse by youngsters in Hong Kong is a serious social
problem. In the past two years the number of reported drug abusers
under the age of 21 has increased by more than two fold.
</P>
<P>
Chief Secretary Anson Chan, who is also Chairman of the Fight
Crime Committee (FCC), said at an FCC meeting last November that
the overall crime rate in Hong Kong is lower than that of other
metropolitan cities in the world, but youth crimes and drug abuse
cases have been increasing.
</P>
<P>
She said the government is concerned and has stepped up its
efforts to arrest the situation.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Kuala Lumpur's tin,
rubber and crude palm oil markets ended this week all lower.
</P>
<P>
The Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) finished the week lower at
15.86 Malaysian Ringgit (6.34 US dollars) per kg compared with
15.92 Ringgit (about 6.36 dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
Weaker sentiment on the London Metal Exchange (LME) dampened
the local market, dealers here said.
</P>
<P>
The tin market was unchanged for two consecutive days on
Tuesday and Wednesday followed by a slight recovery on Thursday
when it went up by three sen and closed five sen higher.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume for this week stood at 374 tons, with interest
mainly from European and local buyers.
</P>
<P>
The KLTM price differential with the LME recorded a premium of
110 US dollars from 50 dollars per ton previously.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian rubber market finished the week slightly lower
amid weaker sentiment.
</P>
<P>
February RSS1 fell 1.5 sen to 395.50 sen (1.582 dollars) per kg
from 397.0 sen (1.588 dollars) per kg last week.
</P>
<P>
The market traded lower with a lackluster opening on Monday due
to technical selling activities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the crude palm oil physicals market closed the week
lower following weaker sentiment on the futures market.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said higher production figures released by the
authorities led to lackluster prices on Tuesday and continued
until the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
The price for January South closed lower by 75 Ringgit to 1,140
Ringgit (456 dollars) per ton from the close of last week.

<HEADLINE> Food Grain Output Up in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Food grain production in
Bangladesh has grown at a rate of 2.6 percent per year over the
past two decades while population has grown at 2.19 percent,
according to a study published here today.
</P>
<P>
Modern agricultural technology together with natural endowment
and a growing network of rural infrastructure have led to a rapid
expansion in dry-season irrigated agriculture, said the study by
the Center on Integrated Rural Development for Asia and the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
In Bangladesh, about one-fourth of household expenditure is
spent on rice. However, the poorest 40 percent of the households
in rural and urban Bangladesh spend about 38 percent and 32
percent respectively on rice.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, rice price is a major determinant of expenditures of
the poor and rice-deficit households in the country.

<HEADLINE> New Greek Government to Be Sworn in on Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- New Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis will swear in his cabinet on Monday which will be formed
after a series of weekend meetings.
</P>
<P>
Reuters news agency today quoted government officials as saying
that major ministries, state companies and banks are expected to
change hands and broad policy shifts are also on the way.
</P>
<P>
The premier-designate today met members of the ruling
Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or Pasok, and was expected to
announce the new cabinet over the weekend. He would present his
cabinet to the president Monday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Old Socialist party faithfuls will be sidelined in favour of
professional technocrats, officials added.
</P>
<P>
At least seven ministers, faithfuls of former Premier Andreas
Papandreou, are poised to be replaced and their successors will be
faced by a number of long-pending issues like privatization.
</P>
<P>
Simitis, 59, received a mandate today to form a government
after the socialist party parliamentary group elected him Thursday
to replace Papandreou, who resigned for poor health earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias may be replaced by Theodoros
Pangalos, the former European Affairs minister.
</P>
<P>
Other ministers likely to leave include the ministers of state
Antonis Livanis, of merchant marine George Katsifaras, of public
order Sifis Valyrakis, press minister Telemachos Hytiris and
justice minister Yannis Pottakis.
</P>
<P>
Simitis, a former economy minister and German-educated lawyer,
is an advocate of more development funds, more privatization, a
realistic foreign policy in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to press ahead with an austerity pregram aimed
at holding down inflation and cutting the government deficit to
meet the convergency standards of the European single currency.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said he may soften the policy next year, ahead of
general elections which are due to be held by November 1997 at the
latest.

<P>
BANGKOK, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Thai police have set up a team
to investigate charges against Thai central bank's former deputy
governor, it is learned today.
</P>
<P>
Ekamol Khiriwat, deputy governor of the Bank of Thailand, was
fired late last month by Finance minister Surakiat Suthirathai
amid suggestions that he had leaked state financial secrets in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Ekamol was also forced to resign as secretary-general of the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
The investigation team will be looking into three counts under
the criminal code, the securities and exchange act and the
commercial bank act, police source said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the finance minister said Friday that he would give
police more documentary evidence against Ekamol if the police team
felt that the report he had given them earlier was not enough.
</P>
<P>
Since Ekamol's sacking from both posts, local press has
suspected that Ekamol was the victim of politics and that the
dismissal was not transparent enough.

<P>
HONG KONG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The through-train service
between Guangzhou and Hong Kong is to be expanded to cope with
passenger increases on the line, according to the Kowloon-Canton
Railway Corporation (KCRC).
</P>
<P>
The KCRC announced on Friday that it had purchased new
high-speed trains and would gradually increase the frequency of
the daily through-train run.
</P>
<P>
Head of operations of KCRC Martin Brown said that passengers
were expected to double or even triple as cross-border business
grew.
</P>
<P>
He said the KCRC's cross-border service had seen five percent
more passengers use the trains each year for the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Later this month one more high-speed train will be added to the
present four through-trains, of which one is high-speed.
</P>
<P>
And a new double-deck train will be added by the end of next
year, which will increase the transport capacity by 8,000
passengers a day.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 6,000 people use the through-train daily,
while 110,000 passengers go through Luohu.
</P>
<P>
The KCRC is now renovating the Kowloon Railway Station to
double its size by mid-1997, and separate the arrival and
departure halls to cope with the increase.

<HEADLINE> hke012017 --Indonesian Military Sets Deadline for Hostage Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian military gave
the OPM (Free Papua Organization) abductors "until the end of the
week" to respond to its demand to free their remaining 14 hostages
they have held captive for 12 days, before it considers other
options to secure their release.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting until the end of the week for a reply from the
kidnappers," said Maj. Gen. A. Dunidja, chief of the Trikora
military command, who is also commanding the operation to secure
the release of the hostages, according to local press reports
here today quoting Dunidja's speech at a Friday evening local
press conference in Jayapura, capital of Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the kidnapers are still considering my offer. If
their response is unsatisfactory, we will look at other options."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) chief information
officer Brig. Gen, Suwarno Adiwiajaya said in Bandung, West Java,
Friday that "the ABRI commander-in-chief has fully entrusted the
hostage freeing operation to the chief of the Trikora military
region command which is comprised of Irian Jaya and Maluku
provinces.
</P>
<P>
According to Adwiajaya, the Trikora military chief was free to
secure the release of the hostages by any way or means he saw fit.
</P>
<P>
The military has set up a command post in Wamena, the town
nearest to Mapunduma where the OPM and the hostages are believed
to have settled in.
</P>
<P>
The OPM had earlier made it clear that their demand is for
recognition of a separate West Papua state in Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
The demand has been rejected by the Indonesian government, who
said that the majority of the Irian Jaya people have already
decided to be part of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers, according to the military, are a faction of a
separatist group called the Free Papua Organization (OPM) which
has been fighting for an independent state since the former Dutch
colony of western Papua became the Indonesian province of Irian
Jaya in 1964.
</P>
<P>
The OPM abducted 26 people including seven foreigners working
on an environmental-linked scientific expedition in Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
On two separate earlier occasions, nine and two local
Indonesians had been set free. And the OPM also conditionally
released one German acting as a mediator.
</P>
<P>
There are still 14 hostages including six foreigners being in
the hands of the OPM kidnappers.

The New Nation of Bangladesh quoted an official as saying that
officials from both sides had a meeting recently on the missing
boundary pillars along the 861 km border between Bangladesh and
Indian state of Tripura.
</P>
<P>
The work of establishing the boundaries will be implemented by
May this year, Bangladeshi officials hoped, but they are not sure
when the two sides will sign the maps to authenticate the work
already completed.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi has consistently been refusing to sign the maps which
have already been completed by a plenipotentiary and such a step

<HEADLINE> Martinez Enters Fourth Round at Australian Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Second seed Conchita Martinez
of Spain defeated newcomer Jana Kandarr in the women's singles
third round of the Australian Open in Melbourne on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Martinez beat the young German in a straight-sets 6-3, 6-0 to
move up to the final 16 of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
The world No. 2 and semifinalist of all four Grand Slam
tournaments last year, ran into stubborn resistance as Kandarr, a
WTA newcomer and world No. 85, rallied from an 0-5 deficit in the
first set to take three games and stave off four set points before
losing at 3-6.
</P>
<P>
The slim, model-like German demonstrated remarkable strength in
her two-handed strokes and serve-and-volley game. But nervousness
and forced errors let her down when Martinez dominated the second
set.
</P>
<P>
It took Martinez just an hour to sail into the fourth round,
where she will clash with 10th seeded American archrival Lindsay
Davenport, who defeated Nanne Dahlman of Finland 6-4, 7-5 this
morning.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday's other action, sixth seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov of
Russia crashed Australian Michael Tebbutt in an arduous five-sets
6-7, 7-5, 5-7, 6-4 and 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Martina Hingis, 15, also blasted into the final 16 after a
47-minute victory over Japan's Mana Endo 6-1, 6-1. The young Swiss
Hingis made the final 16 of the U.S. Open in September.
</P>
<P>
Eighth seed Anke Huber of Germany beat the Czech Republic's
Ludmila Richterova 6-2, 6-1 in just under an hour and next meets
either Richterova's compatriot Helena Sukova or Austria's Barbara
Schett.

<HEADLINE> China to Punish Irregular Listed Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China's securities watchdog has
planned to investigate and punish companies listed that have acted
irregularly or illegally this year, said a senior Chinese
securities official.
</P>
<P>
"The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) will
seriously deal with those companies listed that have practised
frauds and infringed upon share-holders' interests," said Zhou
Daojiong, chairman of CSRC, at a conference held in this capital
of south China's Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
"CSRC, the two stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen, and
local securities regulatory departments should further improve
laws and regulations to standardise the operation of the companies
listed," Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to revise and replenish the regulations on
information disclosure to ensure that the companies listed release
information in a more standard way.
</P>
<P>
Regulations will also be amended so that the companies listed
will issue dividend stocks more standardly and more in line with
the state's industrial policies.
</P>
<P>
"Starting this year, China will train those companies'
directors, supervisors and secretaries so that they will have
clear ideas of their responsibilities and be familiar with the
laws and regulations their companies have to abide by," Zhou
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region is relying on science and technology to boost
animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the region produced 103,000 tons of
meat and 32,600 tons of poultry and eggs last year, all up by at
least 50 percent over 1990.
</P>
<P>
The local farmers' income from animal husbandry averaged more
than 200 yuan, accounting for one fourth of the their annual total
income.
</P>
<P>
One of China's ten major pastoral areas, Ningxia has three
million hectares of natural grassland, and produces three billion
kilograms of crop stalks and over 500 million kilograms of grain
feed a year.
</P>
<P>
To boost the production of animal husbandry, the region has
popularized some 200 scientific findings in recent years to raise
the milk output per cow from 3,609 kilograms to 4,212 kilograms,
ranking first in the country; and the out-of-stock rate of pigs
went up from 40 percent to 93 percent, sheep from 13 percent to 30
percent, and beef cattle from three percent to nine percent.

<HEADLINE> Fatal Arson Raises Fears of Xenophobia in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A fire that killed 10 foreigners
in Luebeck Thursday has added to many Germans' worries over a
series of horrific racist attacks against foreigners since the
country's reunification in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The fire, which occurred around 4 a.m. local time (0300 GMT),
also injured more than 50 people.
</P>
<P>
Although it was still unclear Friday whether the blaze was
arson or an accident, many suspected that it was set
deliberately. All the residents in the house were foreigners
seeking asylum in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Neo-Nazis were widely blamed for the fire, despite the fact
that no evidence has been found. Soon after the fire on Thursday,
police detained four suspects who were released Friday because of
insufficient evidence.
</P>
<P>
"We used to think that Germany was safe...," said many
foreigners when interviewed.
</P>
<P>
Germany has attracted large numbers of refugees from around the
world, with a record high of more than 438,000 in 1992, the year
in which 17 asylum-seekers were killed in racist attacks.
</P>
<P>
At least 35 incidents of arson aimed against foreigners took
place in Germany in 1995. At least 37 people have been killed in
right-wing violence since the country reunited in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Once asylum-seekers, mostly from Eastern Europe and developing
countries, arrive in the country, they are usually put up in
isolated buildings which neo-Nazis can attack and escape easily.
</P>
<P>
"Integration -- that is the answer!" said Luebeck Mayor Michael
Bouteiller when he surveyed the damage at the burnt hostel. "This
isolation makes the foreigners afraid the same thing could happen
again," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Luebeckers, normally known for their coolness and
reserve, went to the scene of the fire in central Luebeck Friday,
carrying candles and laying wreaths.
</P>
<P>
Around 1,500 people rallied in Berlin Friday night, to pay
their condolences to those who died in the fire.
</P>
<P>
"Fight violence and antiforeignism -- Everyone has human
rights," said posters held by demonstrators. More and larger
demonstrations are being planned, and churches in Luebeck will
hold Mass on Sunday to mourn the dead.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, all German newspapers Friday front-paged the fire,
and some of them carried editorials condemning anti-foreigner
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, Luebeck, a popular tourist destination
near the Baltic Sea, has also witnessed two firebombings of its
synagogue.

DHAKA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi opposition
parties are preparing a new round of strikes to press home their
demand for holding the national elections under a non-party
neutral caretaker government instead of the scheduled February 15
polls under the current government.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hasina, former opposition leader in parliament and
president of the largest opposition party -- the Awami (people's)
League (AL), will announce an action program including a series of
strikes at a public meeting tomorrow, sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the mainstream opposition parties
including the AL, the Jatiya (national) Party and the
Jamaat-e-Islami held talks Friday over the country's political
situation.
</P>
<P>
Since the nomination filing date for the national polls expired
on January 17, the Election Commission has stated that "now we
have to go ahead with the elections in the country and the
election rules do not allow us to reverse the proceedings of the
nomination."
</P>
<P>
But the election process was boycotted by the mainstream
opposition parties who termed the EC as a stooge of the government

<HEADLINE> Aid Disbursement at Lowest Level in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Aid disbursement in Bangladesh
has declined to its lowest level in the last three years,
affecting implementation of foreign-aided development projects.
</P>
<P>
According to figures published here today, total disbursement
under project credits in the first five months of the current
fiscal year was only 11.30 million US dollars while 65.25 million
dollars is needed to be disbursed in the remaining seven months to
fulfill the target of 76.55 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The disbursement during the first five months was less than 20
percent of the total expected in the current fiscal year beginning
last July 1, a source said, adding that the slow progress of work
and constraints of local fund were the main reasons for the low
aid disbursement.
</P>
<P>
In a report, the World Bank said that the disbursement level
was unfavorable for the economy, suggesting that the government
should take appropriate corrective measures immediately to speed
up the disbursement during the remaining period of the fiscal
year.

<HEADLINE> Oil Barge Spills on US East Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A barge carrying 3.9 million
gallons of heating oil ran aground on the U.S. East Coast today,
starting to spill its cargo into the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
The 340-foot barge drifted to the southern coast of Rhode
Island and ran aground on Nebraska Shoals, Rhode Island, in stormy
sea after the tugboat pulling it caught fire and got exploded.
</P>
<P>
The crew were forced to abandon the ship and airlifted to
safety.
</P>
<P>
"There appear to be several leaks. The stern and the bow seem
to be breaking up or buckling," a Coast Guard spokeswoman was
quoted by the United Press International as saying.
</P>
<P>
The spill was first spotted by a Coast Guard helicopter crew as
it was airlifting crewman from the deck of the barge --
Scandia. So far, there was no information on exactly how much oil
was escaping.
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard cutters arrived at the scene with containment
equipment and were trying to skim oil off the surface of the
water, said an Associated Press report.
</P>
<P>
The 3.9 million gallons of home heating oil was contained in
several compartments of the ship. Officials doubted that the
entire cargo would spill, said a UPI report.
</P>
<P>
Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Almond already put the state's
National Guard on standby in case it was needed in any cleanup
effort.

<HEADLINE> Asian Soccer Body Warns HK Breakaway Clubs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Football
Confederation (AFC) has warned a group of rebel Hong Kong
professional clubs of a possible worldwide ban if they continue
their breakaway threat.
</P>
<P>
AFC secretary Peter Velapan made the comments at a meeting here
yesterday with Vincent M.C. Yuen, chief executive officer of the
Hong Kong Football Association (HKFA). Velapan has just arrived
from a South Africa trip.
</P>
<P>
It would be "impossible" for the AFC and the sport's world
governing body International Football Federation to give
recognition to any breakaway league, the AFC supremo said.
</P>
<P>
If the nine senior clubs, members of the rebel Association of
Hong Kong Professional Football Clubs (AHKPFC), split with the
HKFA, they would be banned from all Asian competitions, Velapan
said.
</P>
<P>
And, as a result, players belonging to the clubs would also be
ineligible for international matches, Velapan said.
</P>
<P>
"All football in Hong Kong must be the responsibility of the
local football association. That is the system which is used
throughout the world," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If the clubs did cease to come under the HKFA control it would
be impossible for the Asian Football Confederation or FIFA to
recognize them. They would not be able to play anywhere in the
world because in our eyes they would not exist," Velapan said.
</P>
<P>
"If the clubs left the local association's control, then their
players would also leave," he said.
</P>
<P>
The AFC official also said that he felt surprised to see what
had happened recently in Hong Kong concerning the sport. "I
believed a number of club officials were closely involved with the
HKFA," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a rebel statement issued earlier this week, the AHKPFC
slammed the HKFA's management as "archaic" and branded its
officials as "a group of amateurs". The clubs said they were
angered by the way the First Division is run and that the senior
clubs are losing millions of HK dollars due to the poor management
by the HKFA.
</P>
<P>
The group has since taken a defiant stance against the HKFA and
is refusing to provide a coach for the Hong Kong team which is to
compete in this month's crucial Asian Cup qualifying round in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
And the clubs are also refusing to release their players for
the competitions as well as the Carlsberg Cup Lunar New Year
tournament slated for February 19 and 22.
</P>
<P>
There were conflicting reports on possible talks between the
representatives of the two parties. A newspaper report said they
would sit down around the table to discuss the crisis at a HKFA
executive board meeting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But the Hong Kong team has had to put a planned training trip
to Malaysia on hold because of the on-going crisis.

RIO DE JANEIRO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Brazil, the world's
largest coffee producer, plans to import coffee for the first time
in history, Americo Sato, president of the Brazilian Coffee
Roasters Association, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, which banned coffee imports for decades, is importing
about 10,000 bags of coffee this year to make up for declining
output in 1995 caused by frosts and drought in 1994.

<P>
Coffee prices in Brazil rose to more than 140 reals (about 145
U.S. dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is expected to produce about 25.5 million bags of coffee
in 1996, following a drop to 16.8 million bags in 1995. Brazil's
coffee output accounts for one-fourth of the world's total.

WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) - Mexico slammed the United
States Friday for violating the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) by unilaterally postponing opening borders to
Mexican trucks.
</P>
<P>
Mexican delegates at high-level trilateral meetings here, which
include NAFTA's third nation, Canada, asked Washington to "process
immediately" Mexican trucking firms' requests for licenses to
operate in the U.S., the Mexican embassy said in a statement here.
</P>
<P>
The United States was supposed to have begun processing
requests December 18 under the NAFTA stipulations, but has been
under heavy pressure not to do so from the Teamsters Union which
represents US truck drivers.
</P>
<P>
The Teamsters argue that Mexican trucks are in poor condition
and their drivers are badly trained and lack insurance.
</P>
<P>
The statement emphasized that NAFTA stipulations "expressly
oblige" the two nations to grant licenses to trucking firms that
comply with security regulations established by each nation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has received 29 requests to date from
Mexican firms, the statement said, and noted that the Mexican
government "will continue searching for the solution to this
issue through the channels established in NAFTA."

<HEADLINE> Thailand, US Reach Aviation Rights Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Officials of Thailand and the
United States have reached a bilateral aviation agreement after a
prolonged dispute lasting more than five years.
</P>
<P>
Aviation officials of the two countries have agreed to allow
each other 31 passenger and 24 cargo flights per week. The US
side earlier had proposed a maximum of 37 flights a week from the
US to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
For Fifth Freedom flights, under which airlines have the right
to carry passengers from third countries before arriving in the
destination country, it has been agreed that both sides have the
right to make no more than 14 of the flights a week in each point.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on the Fifth Freedom right was the key to the
success in breaking the five-year-old impasse.
</P>
<P>
The US side also agreed to increase the destinations for
Thailand from the current six points to 18 points, which can be
changed depending on seasons.
</P>
<P>
Robert Griffith, first secretary of the US embassy in Thailand,
said the draft agreement, widening access to each other's market,
would be advantageous for both sides.
</P>
<P>
However, the Thai side is concerned about air fare dumping by
US airlines, which would damage Thai Airways International (THAI).
 Both sides have agreed that air fares will be an important aspect
of the aviation relationship.
</P>
<P>
The initial agreement, reached Friday after four days of talks
in Hua Hin, about 200 kilometers southwest of Bangkok, needs to be
submitted to respective governments for approval before being
signed within the next few months.

<P>
Officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC), monitoring the release, said they doubted that the rest of
the 900 POWs registered by the organization in 20 prisons across
Bosnia would be freed before midnight.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 Serbs and 67 Moslems were freed on Friday,
according to Serb media. Most of them were taken to the airport in
trucks in darkness.
</P>
<P>
Christoph Girod of the ICRC criticized the formerly warring
sides for failing to comply with the planned release, as
stipulated in the Dayton peace agreement, and said he hoped the
POW exchange would continue on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights John
Shattuck, who came to the airport for the exchange, said factions
which continued to obstruct the releases could be punished through
the withholding of international financial aid.
</P>
<P>
Still, top NATO officials said the factions had met Friday's
other deadline for withdrawing from their old front line.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Agrees to Hold Talks on Oil-for-Food Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 20 (Xinhua) - Iraq late on Friday
accepted an invitation from U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali to enter into talks on an oil-for-food deal designed
to alleviate the suffering of its people, under sanctions for more
than five years.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali hoped that the talks would begin in New York as
soon as possible, chief U.N. spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said.
</P>
<P>
The offer, under a 1995 U.N. Security Council resolution, is
separate from the sanctions imposed on Iraq after it invaded
Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, adopted by the Security Council in April 1995,
allows Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil over six
months to buy food and medicine. The resolution can be renewed and
possibly renegotiated after six months.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali is now in charge of coming up with a plan to
implement the deal but he cannot re-negotiate the resolution's
terms.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, which has long rejected the resolution as violating its
sovereignty, indicated on Friday in a letter from Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Tareq Aziz to Boutros-Ghali that it is prepared to
hold talks with the U.N..
</P>
<P>
The Security Council offered a similar deal to Iraq in late
1991. They held talks in 1992 and 1993 without reaching any
decision to implement the deal.
</P>
<P>
Iraq to date has demanded that the ban on exports,
particularly oil, be lifted entirely. But this depends largely on
fulfilling the Security Council's demands that Baghdad reveal and
destroy all its weapons of mass destruction and related
materials.

<HEADLINE> Asian Soccer Body Warns HK Breakaway Clubs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Football
Confederation (AFC) has warned a group of rebel Hong Kong
professional clubs of a possible worldwide ban if they continue
their breakaway threat.
</P>
<P>
AFC secretary Peter Velapan told the newspaper that it would be
"impossible" for the AFC and the sport's world governing body
International Football Federation (FIFA) to give recognition to
any breakaway league.
</P>
<P>
If the clubs split with the Hong Kong Football Association
(HKFA), they would be banned from all Asian competitions, the AFC
supremo, who has just arrived from South Africa, told Vincent
M.C. Yuen, chief executive officer during a meeting here yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Players belonging to the nine clubs, members of the Association
of Hong Kong Professional Football Clubs (AHKPFC), would also be
ineligible for international matches, Velapan said.
</P>
<P>
"All football in Hong Kong must be the responsibility of the
local football association. That is the system which is used
throughout the world," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If the clubs did cease to come under the HKFA control it would
be impossible for the Asian Football Confederation or FIFA to
recognize them. They would not be able to play anywhere in the
world because in our eyes they would not exist," Velapan said.
</P>
<P>
"If the clubs left the local association's control, then their
players would also leave," he said.
</P>
<P>
The AFC official also said that he felt surprised to see what
had happened recently in Hong Kong concerning the sport. "I
believed a number of club officials were closely involved with the
HKFA," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a rebel statement issued earlier this week, the AHKPFC
slammed the HKFA's management as "archaic" and branded its
officials as "a group of amateurs". The clubs said they were
angered by the way the First Division is run and that the senior
clubs are losing millions of HK dollars due to the poor management
by the HKFA.
</P>
<P>
The group has since taken a defiant stance against the HKFA and
is refusing to provide a coach for the Hong Kong team which is to
compete in this month's crucial Asian Cup qualifying round in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
And the clubs are also refusing to release their players for
the competitions as well as the Carlsberg Cup Lunar New Year
tournament slated for February 19 and 22.
</P>
<P>
There were conflicting reports on the possible talks between
the representatives of the two parties. A newspaper report said
they would sit down around the table to discuss the crisis at a
HKFA executive board meeting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But the Hong Kong team has had to put a planned training trip
to Malaysia on hold because of the on-going crisis.

<HEADLINE> German President Supports Formation of European Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- German President Roman Herzog said
here today that he fully supports the formation of an alliance
in Europe with Germany and France at the core as a transition
to a greater political alliance in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a symposium on European issues here today, the
president stressed that the economic and monetary integration of
European countries plays an important role in building the
political alliance.
</P>
<P>
However, some member nations of the European Union (EU), such
as Spain, strongly opposed the establishment of an alliance with
Germany and France as the nucleus.
</P>
<P>
Herzog called on other EU member states to make efforts for the
advancement of Europe's integration.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, sponsored by Bertelsmann, an international
publishing group, will end on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 politicians, government leaders and ministers from
around the world are attending the two-day symposium.

<HEADLINE> Herzog Honors Nazi Victims, Urges Germans to Remember Past </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- German President Roman Herzog
today urged the nation to inform young people of its Nazi past and
fend off resurgent neo-Nazism.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to a special parliament session on Germany's first
Memorial Day for the Victims of Nazism, Herzog said that January
27, the anniversary of the 1945 liberation of the infamous
Auschwitz death camp, is a day of reflection to help Germans avoid
repeating the crimes of the Third Reich (1933-1945).
</P>
<P>
He added that Germans should draw lessons from the past, which
were to guide the future generations.
</P>
<P>
Herzog said that though Germany's constitution "contains all
the legal guarantees against totalitarianism and racism," the
country still needs "additional efforts" including memorials for
the victims of Nazism to "immunize" people.
</P>
<P>
"The witnesses are dying, fewer and fewer victims can
personally communicate what they suffered," he told the session.
"History fades quickly when it is not part of one's own
experience."
</P>
<P>
"So we must, again and again, create a living future out of our
memories," he said.
</P>
<P>
Six million Jews died in the Holocaust and historians estimate
all those killed through Nazi oppression and the Second World
War Adolf Hitler unleashed at 50 million.
</P>
<P>
Herzog, who often urged Germans neither to forget their dark
history nor be overwhelmed by it, made his speech today because
the parliament would not be in session on January 27.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed, "The most important thing is to sharpen young
people's perception of how to recognize the beginning of racism
and totalitarianism."
</P>
<P>
The session was overshadowed by the Luebeck asylum hostel fire
on Thursday that killed 10 foreigners. The fire was widely blamed
on neo-Nazis though the police had no evidence for this.
</P>
<P>
The fire increased the number of foreigners killed in flaming
right-wing violence to at least 37 as more and more people from
Eastern Europe and the Third World poured into Germany since its
reunification in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Crashed US Fighter Plane Recovered in Henan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A US fighter plane which
crashed near a small town in central China's Henan Province 50
years ago has been recovered.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai newspaper "Wenhui Daily" said an expert from an
air force museum has identified the plane as a US-made P51 fighter
which belonged to a US air force unit aiding China's Anti-Japanese
War (1937-1945).
</P>
<P>
The well-preserved propeller and engine and some other parts of
the plane were discovered by a farmer digging in a sandbank in the
Zhao River near the town. Chinese air force technicians dug them
up.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told the paper that the aircraft crashed around
February 7, 1945. The remains of the dead American pilot were
buried and later transported back to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The Zhenping County archives say that the plane crashed at 6:00
pm on March 20, 1945. The records make no mention of the reason for
the accident or the identity of the pilot.
</P>
<P>
"It was the only US fighter which crashed in China during World
War II, whose propeller and engine are undamaged," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The remains of the plane will be sent to the China Aviation
Museum in Beijing.

<HEADLINE> China's Domestic Tourism Booming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China's current domestic
tourism boom will continue through the Ninth Five-Year Plan Period
(1996-2000), a senior tourism official said.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by China Daily today, the total number
of home-grown tourists is forecast to reach some 4.04 billion to
4.25 billion, double seen during the 1991-1995 period.
</P>
<P>
The country's income from domestic tourism is expected to reach
about 900 billion to 1,000 billion yuan, an increase of 147 to 175
percent over that of the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Domestic tourism revenue will account for about 65 percent of
total tourism revenue (both domestic and overseas tourism),
predicted He Guangwei, director of the China National Tourism
Administration (CNTA).
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-95 period, domestic tourism income hit 363.8
billion, 70 percent more than the period's target, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
China now has 3,226 grade-C travel agencies handling local
tourists. But grade-A and grade-B agencies, which mainly handle
overseas tourists from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, also began
handling domestic tourist business.
</P>
<P>
Other factors contributing to the domestic tourism boom are
people's savings rise along with the development of
market-oriented economy and the government's decision to cut the
48-hour working week to 40 hours which has given people more spare
time, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The official also estimated that the number of domestic
tourists climbed to 600 million, bringing the industry a revenue
of 130 billion yuan last year, up 33 percent and 36 percent from
1994, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Police Deny Mass Prison Breakout in Colombian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Colombian police have denied
reports of a mass breakout at the prison from which Cali cartel
drug lord Jose Santacruz Londono escaped last week.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports on Colombian radio said at least 25 inmates had
fled La Picota prison on the southern outskirts of the capital
last Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
But according to Bogota police commander General Luis Ernesto
Gilibert, "there was no escape" in the abortive attempt after
prison officials discovered a tunnel dug by prisoners toward one
of the outer walls of the prison.
</P>
<P>
It was the second tunnel found in the prison in the past week
and its discovery triggered a riot that was quickly brought under
control by police and prison guards armed with tear gas, Gilibert
said.
</P>
<P>
Santacruz's escape from the maximum security wing of the
prison in broad daylight last Thursday has been blamed on rampant
corruption within the prison system. At least seven guards have
been arrested in connection with the escape.
</P>
<P>
The tunnel discovered last Friday was not located in the
maximum security wing, where the two top leaders of the Cali
cartel, brothers Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, are still
awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
Santacruz, the number three leader of the cartel, remains at
large more than a week after his escape, despite a two million
U.S. dollar reward offered for any information leading to his
recapture.

<HEADLINE> NATO Calls IFOR Deployment in Bosnia Smooth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Everything goes well as planned," NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
He said the operation in Bosnia is "NATO's concrete
contribution to building a new, safe Europe," and the initial
mandate of the IFOR is to create a safe environment for the
reconstruction of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
He voiced satisfaction at the progress the IFOR has made to
date, adding that he was very optimistic about the IFOR's
prospects in carrying out their mission there.
</P>
<P>
However, Solana said the NATO is worried by the friction
between Bosnian Croats and Muslims in the city of Mostar. "Mostar
is a key for the whole peace process, and we will continue to
apply pressure on the Muslims and the Croats to ensure that they
can live in peace there."
</P>
<P>
Also at the press conference, Supreme Allied Commander in
Europe General George Joulwan said 34 countries have contributed
troops and equipment to the 60,000-strong peace force.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than half of the force has already been in place
in Bosnia with the remaining due within the next 30 days, or by
February 19, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR will "react rapidly" within its mandate, to terrorist
activities and attacks, but will not take over duties of the local
police, he added.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR was sent to Bosnia to implement the Dayton peace
accord signed in Paris in December last year after more than three
years of war in Bosnia, the worst bloodshed in Europe since the
end of World War II.

KIEV, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Ukrainian Coal
Miners' Union today decided to stage an indefinite national strike
to force the government to pay wage arrears, the Ukrainian Press
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The leaders called at a meeting for miners across the country
to stop producing and transporting coal, vital for Ukraine which
is suffering a serious energy crisis, till their back wages are
paid.
</P>
<P>
They said the strike decision was prompted by the government's
failure to keep its promise to pay the miners wages on time.
</P>
<P>
But they did not set a date for the walkout and decided to
leave it to a meeting of the union's regional leaders scheduled
for January 26.
</P>
<P>
The coal miners' union also called on other trade unions to
support its planned action, in particular asking the railway
workers' union not to move coal from abroad.
</P>
<P>
The All Ukrainian Workers' Union has expressed support for the
miners.
</P>
<P>
Plagued by serious financial difficulties, the government has
not paid coal miners' wages for several months while it tries to
restructure the coal-mining industry with assistance from the
World Bank.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) today called for the expansion of the
three-nation CIS tariff union and the establishment of a payment
union.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the Russian Presidential Press Office said
the ongoing CIS summit had also decided to empower an inter-state
economic committee to directly coordinate with international
economic organizations on economic matters.
</P>
<P>
The release said the current tariff union, composed of Belarus,
Kazakhstan and Russia, has apparently brought benefits to the
three economies, citing a remarkable increase in their foreign and
domestic trade.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the good showing of the tariff union, Belarus,
Kazakhstan and Russia believe it is time that a payment union is
set up within the CIS, which groups all the former Soviet
republics except the three Baltic states.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a payment union will help strengthen
economic and trade relations among the CIS states and increase
the efficiency of the tariff union.
</P>
<P>
Kirghizia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Moldova, Azerbaijan and
Ukraine have shown interest in the tariff union, the press release
said.
</P>
<P>
The present CIS tariff union was formed in 1993 as proposed by
Moscow but has not been enlarged because other republics feared
Moscow may control their economies through the union.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Mexico City authorities are
ready to implement anti-smog measures which would take thousands
of cars off the streets and close hundreds of gas stations as
pollution levels in the capital soared today.
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Commission for the Prevention of Environmental
Pollution reported that over the last two weeks, ozone levels
have reached over 240 points on at least three days.
</P>
<P>
If ozone levels reach 250 points, indicating serious air
pollution, City authorities will implement the first stage of an
environmental contingency plan which includes a ban on driving for
two days a week instead of the present one day in the Valley of
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
According to the Metropolitan Index for Air Quality, ozone
levels over 100 points are considered "unsatisfactory," causing
discomfort to people with respiratory problems.
</P>
<P>
Tests by the Metropolitan Commission show that ozone levels
have shot over 100 points and passed the 200-point level eight
times over the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The environmental contingency plan would ban 20 percent of the
city's 3.5 million cars from driving in order to reduce car
exhaust fumes by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 20 percent of gasoline stations would be closed
and work would be suspended related to filling potholes, asphalt
paving, gardening and at natural gas distribution terminals.
</P>
<P>
Schools' outdoor activities would also be suspended under the
plan.

BUCHAREST, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Romania's tennis federation
on Friday rejected a life ban on Irina Spirlea demanded by the
sports minister in a letter.
</P>
<P>
Sports minister Alexandru Mironov asked for the suspension
after Spirlea refused to compete for her country last year, saying
she made "very grave misbehavior".
</P>
<P>
Mironov also wanted her banned from training.
</P>
<P>
Spirlea, ranked 21 on the WTA circuit last year, has already
been disqualified from competing domestically because she refused
to represent Romania in the 1995 Federation Cup and the European
championship.
</P>
<P>
She quit because authorities would not let her personal
trainer be part of the team and because she said she would lose
money on the circuit.

<HEADLINE> Kidnappers Still at Large in Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican authorities have
suspended patrols of northern mountains to allow gunmen who
kidnapped two European women in the area to contact a mediator
again, sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
There has been no further word from the kidnappers since they
presented their demands to priest Eduardo Bolanos on January 5.
</P>
<P>
German tourist Nicola Fleuchaus, 24, and Swiss tourist guide
Susana Sigfried, 50, were abducted on January 1 in a secluded
mountain hotel in the north of the country near the Nicaraguan
border.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers have demanded a ransom of one million U.S. dollars,
in addition to one million colons (about 5,000 dollars), as well
as an end to the government policy of layoffs and raising of
taxes.
</P>
<P>
The authorities, however, reject the idea that the kidnapping
was carried out for political motives, suggesting that the only
purpose is extortion.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, police suspended their intensive patrols in the
area of the kidnapping to allow the gunmen to try to contact
Father Bolanos again.
</P>
<P>
However, 19 days after the abduction, no reliable information
on the whereabouts of the kidnappers or the situation of the
victims is available.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, the kidnappers are former "Contras,"
members of the armed groups which fought the Sandinista government
in Nicaragua in the 1980s, operating from this border zone.
</P>
<P>
If so, their familiarity with the terrain and military training
will make it more difficult for police to find them.
</P>
<P>
Desperate relatives of the European women have come to Costa
Rica to follow the case, as well as the German Foreign Ministry's
director of foreign policy Wilfried Richter, who met with
President Jose Maria Figueres and Foreign Minister Fernando
Naranjo in the past two days.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican government and
the Zapatista National Liberation Army (ZNLA) have carried out the
first agreements to grant autonomy and rights to the nation's
indigenous peoples.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to establish a new relationship among the
society, the state and the Indians, at the end of the plenary
meeting on indigenous rights and culture Thursday night, according
to a communique released by the Ministry of the Interior.
</P>
<P>
The agreements, which include a recommendation to establish a
number of rights for the country's various ethnic groups in the
Mexican Constitution, will be signed on February 13.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting in San Andres Larrainzar in the south of
Chiapas, the poorest and most backward state in Mexico, it was
agreed to promote the inclusion of autonomy or free
self-determination for the Indian peoples in the constitution and
state legislature, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique which stressed the recognition of
the Indians' traditional forms of organization and government
without the intervention of political parties, the indigenous
peoples may define the form of government and political, social
and economic organizations most suitable for them.
</P>
<P>
Certain reforms are also deemed necessary to guarantee that the
indigenous peoples are represented in the legislature and other
federal institutions.
</P>
<P>
With respect to the concrete commitments and actions for
Chiapas, the government and ZNLA agreed to define in the state
constitution that indigenous peoples are individuals entitled to
rights.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela has decided to export
580,000 quintals of coffee this year due to a production surplus
in 1995-1996, Ramon Hernandez, managing director of the Venezuelan
National Coffee Fund, said today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government would encourage coffee exports as
producers have no storage space for record coffee output of an
estimated 1.5 million quintals by September this year.
</P>
<P>
The domestic coffee-roasting industry can only process 900,000
quintals a year.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela has already exported some 100,000 quintals of coffee
to the United States, the European Union and Japan, Hernandez
said.

<HEADLINE> Portugal Rejects Third Doping Test for Modahl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Portugal's Sports Ministry said
here Friday it had decided not to carry a third test of British
runner Diane Modahl's urine samples as requested by the
International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF).
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for Minister Julio Miranda Calha,
Calha had told the IAAF that the government supported rejection of
a third test on technical, scientific and judicial grounds.
</P>
<P>
International Olympic Committee (IOC) regulations also
stipulate that only two tests should be made to determine doping,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Modahl, a women's 800-meter runner, was thrown into disgrace
since she was recalled from the Commonwealth Games in 1994 after
testing positive at a Lisbon meeting two months earlier.
</P>
<P>
Modahl's two previous urine samples were all positive for
testosterone and accordingly she was banned for four years.
</P>
<P>
But the British Athletic Federation (BAF) upheld her appeal
last July, saying possible degradation of samples could affect the
accuracy of the tests.
</P>
<P>
An IAAF arbitration panel is due to give a final ruling soon.

<HEADLINE> 100 Kilograms of Cocaine Seized in Panama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Police in Panama today
reported the seizure of 100-kilogram cocaine in the paste form
hidden in an abandoned van in downtown Panama.
</P>
<P>
The seizure, which was made on Thursday, is part of the
achievements in the wake of the "Safe Summer" operation to fight
against organized crimes. A kilogram of cocaine is worth 35,000
U.S. dollars on the international market.
</P>
<P>
The drug was placed in 10 metal cylinders inside two scuba
diving oxygen tanks in the van, which had been abandoned for two
days, said the national police spokesman, Jose Zamora.
</P>
<P>
The vehicle had been abandoned by its occupants apparently to
avoid many police checkpoints set up in the area during the week,
the police spokesman said, adding that they might go back for it
later at a "convenient" time.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Hopes for Early Talks with Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Friday expressed the hope that talks
between the U.N. secretariat with Iraq on an oil-for-food formula
would begin as soon as possible in New York.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general delivered the message through his
spokeswoman after he received a letter from Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tareq Aziz, confirming Iraq's acception of the invitation
by the U.N. chief to have such a dialogue.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Iraq Thursday, Boutros-Ghali said that he was
prepared to hold talks on carrying out the U.N. council Resolution
986, which allowed Iraq to sell up to 2 billion U.S. dollars of
oil over six months in order to buy badly needed food, medicine
and other necessities.
</P>
<P>
But he added that the talks should be held on the understanding
that its terms cannot be changed.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Iraq has refused to accept Resolution 986, citing
strict U.N. monitoring over the sale and consequent violation of
its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been the target of U.N. sanctions, including an oil
sales ban, since its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Sanctions has done a great deal of damage to its economy and
led to severe humanitarian crisis.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Calls for Assistance on Women Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Ethiopian
official today called on the world community to provide necessary
assistance to her country in addressing women issues.
</P>
<P>
The Minister for Women's Affairs of Ethiopia, Tedelech
Haile-Michael, made the appeal as the U.N. Committee on
Elimination of Discrimination against Women began consideration of
an Ethiopia's periodic report on women.
</P>
<P>
She told the committee that Ethiopia had accepted the Beijing
Platform for Action adopted at the Fourth World Conference on
Women last September without reservation and was focusing on
poverty reduction and human development to improve the standard of
living of women and children.
</P>
<P>
But she said that a massive outlay of financial resources was
required for Ethiopia to attain its goals for women and that a lot
was expected from the donor community.
</P>
<P>
Women issues in Ethiopia are of great concern to the U.N.
committee. In the country, the traditional practice of genital
mutilation still affects 90 per cent of the women.
</P>
<P>
The civil code of Ethiopia provided that the husband was the
head of the family, and the wife had to be obedient to him. Though
officially the legislation does not discriminate against women in
the ownership of property, in practice women exercised very little
control over property.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher and Japanese Foreign Affairs Minister Yukihiko
Ikeda held a meeting at the State Department today, focusing their
discussions on the military relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"They discussed the Special Action Committee concerning
Okinawa, U.S.-Japan military relations, and the issues concerning
the presence of the U.S. military on Japan itself," State
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting with Ikeda, Christopher told reporters that
security issues remain the cornerstone of the relationship between
the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
"From the standpoint of the United States, Japan is the key to
our engagement in the Asia Pacific region," the secretary said,
"We, of course, are committed to very close and deep security
cooperation with Japan."
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers also discussed bilateral economic
matters and a number of global issues.
</P>
<P>
They had "a very long conversation" of the situation in Russia,
of Japan's relations with Russia and of United States' relations
with Russia, Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Both of them agreed that the Russian reform is in a critical
time and they would encourage continued economic and political
reform in that country.
</P>
<P>
"One of our strategic objectives with Russia is to encourage
Russia's integration with Western institutions, economic,
political and security," Burns quoted Christopher as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda thanked the United States for its ongoing support for
Japan on the issue of the northern territories.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East, Ikeda said that Japan would play a very
significant role in trying to assist the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
Christopher thought it was consistent with Japan's greater role
on global issues, Burns noted.

NEW YORK, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Strong company earnings
reports sent stock prices high for the second day today, with the
Dow Jones industrial shooting more than 60 points to 5,184.68.
</P>
<P>
Despite the strength in the Dow average, advancing issues
barely led decliners on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Broad market indexes also rose.
</P>
<P>
The Dow industrials were led higher by IBM, up more than 6
points near the close. The computer giant on Thursday posted a 41
percent gain in fourth quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
Other blue chip stars included Dow components Philip Morris,
General Electric, United Technologies, Alcoa and Union Carbide.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said businesses added 52,000 jobs in
December, mostly in manufacturing. That was the biggest increase
since February 1990. The nation's unemployment rate remained at
5.6 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
The market was also influenced by the report of the Commerce
Department which said the nation's gross domestic product grew at
an annualized rate of 3.2 percent in the July-September quarter
after nearly stalling out in the spring.
</P>
<P>
Bonds initially fell on the report. But the 30 year Treasury
bond was up 1.32 point, its yield just below 6 percent.

<HEADLINE> More Than 200 Bosnian POWs Released Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, January 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 Bosnian
prisoners of war were finally exchanged but it still falls short
of a full compliance of the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
An IFOR spokesman told reporters that a total of 224 were set
free tonight, just hours before the deadline of midnight expires,
and these prisoners include 157 Serbs and 67 Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace agreement, all 900 prisoners of war must be
released by the three warring factions by midnight tonight. But
the Muslim-led government rejected the release early this week by
insisting on finding thousands of missing Muslims.
</P>
<P>
U.S. peace envoy Richard Holbrooke said Thursday in Sarajevo
that the exchange of POWs and the search for missing persons are
not linked issues and urged the three parties to stick to the full
compliance of the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Today's prisoners exchange took place at the Sarajevo airport
at about 8:30 in the evening with U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State for Human Rights John Shattuck present.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another deadline, the withdrawal of local armies
from the frontline in the whole nation, also expires midnight
tonight. According to IFOR spokesman, things have been going on
well so far and the compliance in this regard is expected. An
assessment on the withdrawal will be announced.

<HEADLINE> G-7 Financial Miniters To Discuss Economic Slowdowns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) --The upcoming G-7 top
financial officials meeting will be focused on economic slowdowns
in the United States and Europe and the unusually long economic
recession in Japan when they meet in Paris Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said that the United
States and its allies would be looking for the appropriate mix of
policies to ensure that the global recovery stays on course.
</P>
<P>
Rubin and the U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan are
expected to meet with their counterparts from other six most
industrial nations including Japan, Germany, France, Britain,
Canada and Italy.
</P>
<P>
Finance ministers and central bank presidents from the G-7
countries get together three times a year to coordinate their
economic policies and currency exchange rates. They usually hold
separate meetings during the spring and autumn sessions of the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
On the positive side of economic development, Rubin noted that
inflation has remained under control in the United States, Europe
and Japan, and said that "offers some room to respond to slower
growth if that proves necessary."
</P>
<P>
"In the United States, we are in good shape and appear to be on
track for continued solid growth," Rubin said, adding "We lead the
G-7 in the critical areas of reducing government deficits and
improving economic and employment growth."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said other topics of discussion at the meeting would be
ways the G-7 nations can provide financial assistance for the
Bosnia's reconstruction and Russia's continued efforts to reform
its economy.
</P>
<P>
About the current situation in Russia, Rubin said that the G-7
ministers would "emphasize how critical it is for Russia to stick
firmly to the reform path followed in 1995 and continue its
constructive relationship with the International Monetary Fund."
</P>
<P>
Officials noted there would be no joint communique at the end
of the closed-door meetings, indicating that the countries are
generally satisfied with the exchange rate levels of the major
currencies.
</P>
<P>
Last April, with the dollar under considerable downward
pressure, the group issued a joint statement saying the U.S.
currency had fallen too far in value and that the group was
prepared to intervene in currency markets to push its value back
up.

<HEADLINE> US Economy Up 3.2% in Third Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy grew at an
annual rate of 3.2 percent in the third quarter as measured by a
new, more accurate formula, compared with 3 percent in the
previous estimate, the Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The economy advanced 0.5 percent rate in the second quarter and
0.6 percent rate in the first quarter of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the third quarter was led by a 2.9 percent rate
increase in consumer spending, which represents about two-thirds
of the country's economic activity. The increase accounted for
about half the 3.2 percent rate in the overall gross domestic
product (GDP) advance.
</P>
<P>
Business fixed investment was up 5.3 percent rate and housing
rose 8.4 percent rate in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Overall GDP growth was held back by a 5.5 percent rate drop in
federal government spending.
</P>
<P>
With today's report, the Commerce Department began focusing on
a new way to measure the GDP. The new gauge, known as the
chain-weighted measure, reflects yearly changes in the prices of
the GDP's various components.
</P>
<P>
It results in about a 1 percentage point difference from the
previous measure, which was based on fixed 1987 prices.
</P>
<P>
Department officials said it is designed to provide a more
nearly accurate picture of economic activity, but does not alter
the economy's general direction.
</P>
<P>
Despite the faster growth in the third quarter, one measure of
inflation tied to the GDP rose at a modest 2 percent annual rate,
compared to 2.9 percent during both the first and second quarters.

JOHANNESBURG, January 19 (Xinhua)-- Ghana defeated Tunisia 2-1
in the 20th African Nations Cup group D first-round soccer match
at Boet Erasmus Stadium in Port Elizabeth today.
</P>
<P>
All the three goals were scored in the second half of the
game.
</P>
<P>
Ghana's two goals were scored by Captain Abedi Pele Ayew in
the 50th minute and Charles Akonnor in the 77th minute.
</P>
<P>
Tunisia's goal was scored by Imed Ben Younes in the 72nd
minute.
</P>
<P>
The first half was fairly even, with the Ghanaians dominating
the early exchanges with their slick passing, and the Tunisians
taking charge later in the period with long balls pumped down the
middle.
</P>
<P>
However, the second half produced some fine football from both
sides, although Tunisia was far less adventurous on the ball than
Ghana. The Tunisians stuck manfully to their game-plan of the
high ball fired over the Ghanaian defence, while the black stars
were always dangerous when in possession.
</P>
<P>
Ghana's black stars proved their value for today's 2-1 victory
over hard-working Tunisia, although they were made to fight all
the way. In the opening match of the group D, Ghana destroyed
their west African neighbour Ivory Coast 2-0 on January 14.
</P>
<P>
With four points from two games in the first round, Ghana
became the first team who booked their place in the
quarter-finals of the 1996 African Nations Cup soccer finals.
</P>
<P>
Ghana is now leading the group, followed by Mozambique with
one point from one game, Tunisia with one point from two games
and Ivory Coast zero point after one game. enditem
