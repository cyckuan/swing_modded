<HEADLINE> Britain Assures Unions on EC Working Hours Limit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain moved to avoid a
damaging row with unions Sunday by pledging that millions of
white-collar workers would not be hit by proposals to relax
European rules limiting the workweek to a maximum 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers, due to address the
Trades Union Congress (TUC) conference in Brighton Monday, said
the government's proposed changes to the European Commission's
Working Time Directive would not affect the bulk of British
workers -- as feared by unions, Reuters reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Faced with TUC threats to take the issue to the EC for
investigation, Byers said on national television that the
amendments to EC rules would only affect senior managers who
choose to work longer hours and opt out of the EC framework.
</P>
<P>
"We will be issuing guidance to make crystal clear that all we
are concerned about is a very small group," Byers told the GMTV
breakfast television show.
</P>
<P>
"The point Mr Byers wanted to make is that it is not the
government's intention to include white-collar workers (in the
amendments). Guidance will be issued to make this clear," Reuters
quoted a government spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under the EC rules, the working week is capped at 48 hours. But
just before the summer parliamentary recess, Byers slipped in
proposed amendments which would allow for an opt-out for those
wanting to work longer hours.
</P>
<P>
The move had followed howls of protest from the business lobby
and was seen by angry unions as a capitulation to corporate
pressure.
</P>
<P>
But the Department of Trade and Industry said Byers never
intended this change to cover around 9 million white-collar
workers, rather only senior management.
</P>
<P>
"The guidance will be published at the same time the new
regulations come into force. It is not a change in policy," said
the government spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions welcomed the assurance, which had been seen by TUC
chief John Monks as the sharpest area of disagreement and
threatened to mushroom into the most serious union row yet with
the ruling Labor party.
</P>
<P>
Monks welcomed Byers' latest remarks as a positive sign.
</P>
<P>
"With a bit of luck there will be some further changes to the
proposed amendments," he said.
</P>
<P>
Union officials hope to have the assurance on white-collar
workers incorporated into law, rather than issued as a guidance
note.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Guerrillas Preparing Attacks, Says Police Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's police
chief warned Sunday that splinter groups of both pro-British and
republican guerrillas were preparing for fresh violence.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that the threat from dissident
republicans is growing almost daily. They pose a very significant
threat especially in the border areas," Royal Ulster Constabulary
(RUC) Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan said.
</P>
<P>
"There remains a very persistent ongoing threat, not only from
republicans but dissident loyalists as well," he told Sky
Television.
</P>
<P>
Flanagan said several republican splinter groups -- the
Continuity IRA, some members of the Irish National Liberation Army
and the Real IRA -- posed a threat.
</P>
<P>
The Real IRA were blamed for a car bomb in Omagh last year
which killed 29 people and injured hundreds. It was the bloodiest
attack in 30 years of conflict in the province.
</P>
<P>
But Flanagan denied reports that members of the splinter groups
outnumbered the Irish Republican Army (IRA).
</P>
<P>
Flanagan's comments came as the province's divided Roman
Catholic and Protestant politicians prepared for yet another round
of talks led by U.S. mediator George Mitchell Monday.
</P>
<P>
The talks are designed to break the logjam over guerrilla
disarmament and the creation of a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionist Party will meet Monday to discuss Chris
Patten's report on policing reform and whether to take part in the
Mitchell talks.
</P>
<P>
Ken Maginnnis, the UUP's security spokesman, said he will be
recommending that his party take part in the review and criticized
Taylor's decision to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness flew to Washington Sunday, where
he will brief U.S. President Bill Clinton and other officials on
the state of the peace process and discuss the policing reforms.

Museveni returned home on Sunday after attending the two-day
special summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in Libya

<HEADLINE> Aziz: Iraq not Concerned With Forthcoming London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz said on Sunday that Iraq is not concerned with the
forthcoming London meeting on the Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
Aziz made the remarks at an ideological and political
symposium currently being held in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Aziz insisted that Iraq had fulfilled all its obligations under
relevant U.N. resolutions, and that the nine-year-old U.N. sanctions
should be lifted "unconditionally."
</P>
<P>
At the request of the United States, representatives of the
five permanent member states of the United Nations Security
Council, namely Britain, China, France, Russia and the U.S., will
hold a meeting in London next Wednesday on the Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's U.S.-British airstrikes against Iraq,
deliberations inside the Security Council on the Iraqi issue have
reached an impasse.
</P>
<P>
Under relevant U.N. resolutions, the U.N. economic sanctions
imposed on Iraq following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait should be
lifted after U.N. weapons inspectors verify that Iraq is free of
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
However, weapons inspections have not been resumed after the
withdrawal of U.N. weapons inspectors from Iraq last December
before the U.S-British bombardment of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly announced that the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) on disarming Iraq is "dead" and accused the commission of
spying for the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming London meeting will supposedly discuss the
British-Dutch proposal on the Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
The British-Dutch proposal recommends a temporary suspension of
restrictions on Iraq's oil sales if Baghdad fully cooperates with
an enlarged body of weapons inspections which will replace UNSCOM
and agrees to the creation of strict financial controls of its oil
proceeds.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has rejected the plan outright, insisting that it
would accept no less than a total lifting of the embargo.

<HEADLINE> Unionist Official Defends Party's Participation of Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior Ulster Unionist
Sunday defended his party's continued participation in the review
of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement following a
series of attacks from dissident colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Ulster Unionists Party (UUP) security spokesman Ken Maginnis
criticized the decision by the party's deputy leader John Taylor
to withdraw from the review, which is being facilitated by former
U.S. senator George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
Maginnis said on Sky News that Taylor's stance did not reflect
the attitude of the party's ruling executive.
</P>
<P>
"With no disrespect to my colleague, he is just one member of
the Ulster Unionist executive," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The executive is a 100-strong body, it is the governing body
and it has displayed a degree of consistency," he added.
</P>
<P>
Maginnis is the first senior unionist to come to the defense of
party policy on the Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
His comments follow a number of attacks from leading party
members who have expressed dissatisfaction with the direction of
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Anti-Agreement Ulster Unionist Jeffrey Donaldson said Saturday
that the party should distance itself from the Good Friday
Agreement in the light of continuing violence of the Irish
Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
The Unionists were furious at the conclusions of the Chris
Patten report into the future of policing in Northern Ireland,
especially the recommendation that the name of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary should be changed.
</P>
<P>
This was regarded as an insult to the reputation of the force,
which the Protestant community believes defended the community
during many years of IRA violence.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair is set to appoint an "e-envoy" to prepare British business
for the electronic age.
</P>
<P>
Blair will announce the appointment during a visit to Cambridge
University Monday, BBC reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Widely tipped to take the post is Alex Allan, high commissioner
to Australia and former private secretary to John Major.
</P>
<P>
The role was announced late last year by Peter Mandelson during
his tenure as trade secretary.
</P>
<P>
Blair is also expected to issue a stern warning to UK
businesses during his Cambridge visit, urging them to adapt to the
world of e-commerce and the Internet before their rivals do.
</P>
<P>
A report by the Cabinet Office's Performance and Innovation
Unit, also due to be released Monday, will warn that Britain is in
danger of lagging behind North American and European competitors
in the race to win custom on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 9 million Britons will be using the Internet by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
But unless something is done quickly, British industry will be
overtaken by international competitors using the Internet to sell
direct, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers announced
an investigation into competitive barriers in e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
Britain must ensure it remained a source of new and innovative
products on the Internet, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some regions, such as the southwest and the northeast of
England, showed signs of falling behind in their adoption of
online technologies in business.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Further Reform Insurance Sector: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime
Minister Frederick Sumaye has promised to carry out reforms in the
insurance sector.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a cocktail party over the weekend, Sumaye said the
 Tanzanian government is working for a liberalized and stable
insurance market.
</P>
<P>
The party was hosted by the Toplis and Harding East Africa, a
British loss adjusters and surveyors firm, which has been
operating in the country for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
In east Africa, the company has branches in Mombasa and Nairobi
in Kenya; Kampala in Uganda; and Tanga, Zanzibar and Mtwara in
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye said he hoped the entrance of Toplis and Harding will
lead to more and fair competition among the insurance firms in
Tanzania, which in turn will benefit customers and the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the firm's group Director Raphael Kubaga said the
liberalization of the insurance market in the whole of the east
Africa sub- region has created a favorable atmosphere and bright
future for loss adjusters and surveyors.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's insurance industry witnessed transition from a
multi-company to a one-company market in late 1960s and now
returned to a multi-company market again.
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, the Commissioner of Insurance has licensed 11
insurance companies, 26 insurance brokers, 157 insurance agents
and 15 loss adjusters.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said Sunday he welcomes Indonesia's decision to accept
international assistance in restoring security in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
He said he looks forward to the imminent arrival of Indonesian
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas in New York to urgently finalize the
details of the arrangements so that the Security Council can take
rapid action.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he is confident that through this cooperation
between Indonesia and the U.N. the desire of the East Timorese to
become independent will be realized.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie announced Sunday that his
government accepted a U.N.-sponsored international peace-keeping
force in cooperation with the country's military to restore order
and security in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Violence has taken place since the announcement of the August
30 ballot result in East Timor, in which over 78 percent of the
voters showed their support for independence instead of special
autonomy within Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and a number of countries have prepared to form a
force to help Indonesia quell the violence.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976, but the move has never been recognized by the
United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Former British Policeman Revealed as KGB Spy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- A former British policeman has
been named as a Russian spy who had carried out undercover
missions between 1972 and 1980, BBC reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
John Symonds, 63, a former Scotland Yard policeman who now
lives abroad, is the second Briton to have been named as a former
KGB spy, just 24 hours after Melita Norwood, an 87-year-old
great-grandmother, was exposed as the Soviet Union's
longest-serving agent in Britain.
</P>
<P>
John Symonds has admitted that he was a "Romeo agent." seducing
women who were attached to Western embassies in order to get
information.
</P>
<P>
"I was taught how to be a better lover.... I was taught by two
extremely beautiful girls. That was quite an interesting part."
Symonds told BBC.
</P>
<P>
Code-named Scot, Symonds was allegedly recruited by the KGB
after fleeing Britain in 1969 under suspicion of corruption.
</P>
<P>
After carrying out undercover missions between 1972 and 1980,
he returned to Britain in 1980, gave himself up and served a
two-year sentence on corruption charges. Symonds now lives abroad
again.
</P>
<P>
Symonds was revealed as a spy in the same documents which
exposed great-grandmother Melita Norwood as the most important
British female spy ever recruited by the KGB.
</P>
<P>
The "Mitrokhin archive," smuggled to the UK by Russian
dissident Vasili Mitrokhin in 1992, consists of several years'
worth of KGB files.
</P>
<P>
The documents, which were handed over to the British
authorities in 1992, are expected to lead to many more revelations
in the coming weeks.

Modado said the average life expectancy in Africa had reduced

<HEADLINE> Iraq Calls for Solutions to Inter-Arab Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraq urged the Arab countries
on Sunday to hold a meeting, whether a summit or on any other
level, to settle inter-Arab problems and disputes in a "direct and
objective" manner.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the 112th Arab League Foreign
Ministers Council meeting in the capacity of a chairman, Iraqi
Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said the Arab dialog
must be based on facts and realities and look to the future rather
than the past.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Arabs must not ignore the lessons of the past
in an effort to reach a unified Arab stance that will provide a
framework for solidarity and merge all potentials to the best
interest of the the Arab nation, its security and the protection
of its joint interests, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait is widely believed to have led
to the deep rifts among Arab countries. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia
have not forgiven Iraq due to its failure to publicly apologize
its invasion of Kuwait and opposed its return to the Arab fold.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf's remarks showed flexibility following Arab League
Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid's call that Iraq use the
chairmanship to seek reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf expressed Iraq's support for the Palestinians in
their efforts to establish an independent state on their own soil
with Jerusalem as the capital.
</P>
<P>
Iraq also fully backs Syria in the restoration of the Golan
Heights captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War and Lebanon in
its struggle to liberate its southern areas occupied by Israel in
1985, he said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf called on Iran to "end its occupation of the three
islands of the United Arab Emirates," namely the Greater Tunb, the
Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa in the Gulf, and respond to the repeated
UAE call for a peaceful settlement of the dispute.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, Arab officials are expected to
discuss Iraq's problems with the United Nations, which imposed
economic sanctions on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait, and a
call for an Arab summit to forge a common stand on the peace talks
between Arab countries and Israel.

<P>
CAIRO, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian former Army Chief
of Staff and Commander of the Air Defense Forces during the 1973
Arab-Israeli war, Field Marshall Mohammed Ali Fahmy, died on
Sunday at 77.
</P>
<P>
Fahmy, dubbed the "Father of the Egyptian air defenses," died
at a London hospital where he was sent by President Hosni Mubarak
for treatment, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Family members said he died from kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
Fahmy, a graduate of Soviet military academies, served as a
close advisor to former Egyptian Presidents Gamal Abdel-Nasser and
Anwar Sadat.
</P>
<P>
Fahmy's command of the Air Defense Forces during the 1973
Middle East War brought him fame after he set up what came to be
known as an "impenetrable wall" against Israeli warplanes.
</P>
<P>
During the war, Fahmy developed close friendship with Mubarak
who was commander of Egypt's Air Force at the time. Mubarak made
Fahmy army chief of staff and later his military advisor after
taking office following Sadat's assassination in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Fahmy wrote several books on military affairs and history of
Middle East wars.
</P>
<P>
He was survived by his wife, son and daughter.

<HEADLINE> UAE, Algeria Optimistic About Oil Market Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) and Algeria Sunday expressed optimism about the current oil
market situation, expecting world crude stockpiles to be
eliminated by March 2000.
</P>
<P>
"We do think that by March 2000, the volume of stored crude will
be more or less eliminated," said Youcef Yousfi, Algerian energy
and mines minister and current preident of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), after holding talks with UAE
Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Obeid Bin Saif Al
Nasir.
</P>
<P>
The talks focused on ways to absorb the crude stockpiles in the
market and other topics to be discussed at OPEC's next ministerial
conference to be held in Vienna on September 22.
</P>
<P>
The two officials attributed the current oil market situation
to the output curb measures implemented by OPEC members and other
major oil producers since last March.
</P>
<P>
They expected that the OPEC meeting in Vienna would decide to
keep the output curbs intact until the end of March 2000.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the talks, Yousfi, who arrived
here Saturday on a two-day visit, said his current tour in the
Gulf came within the context of preparations for the Vienna
conference.
</P>
<P>
He added that a proposed committee within the organization was
to be formed to study the situation in the medium term to maintain
equilibrium between oil supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC chief noted that the priority in the Vienna meeting
was to be given to market stability.
</P>
<P>
He declined to comment on his candidacy for the post of the
OPEC secretary-general, over which he is expected to compete with
candidates from Saudi Arabia and Iran.
</P>
<P>
He is due to leave here Sunday for Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Expresses Concern Over Issue of Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Parliament President
Spyros Kyprianou Sunday expressed concern over the issue of
Turkish settlers in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Kyprianou said these settlers
are committing a crime by altering the demographic structure of
northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou said if the settlers remain on the island after a
solution to the Cyprus issue, it would lead to the impression that
"we have established a federation with Turkey and not Turkish
Cypriots."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Following the invasion, which resulted in the displacement of
20,000 Greek Cypriots from their homes in the north, the Turkish
government embarked on a policy of bringing in large numbers of
Turkish settlers into the occupied areas.
</P>
<P>
Reports said there are now less than 60,000 Turkish Cypriots
and more than 80,000 Turkish settlers in northern Cyprus, in
addition to 35,000 Turkish soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the impending invitation of the United Nations to
the Greek Cypriot side for direct talks with Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash, Kyprianou said that if the
U.N. secretary-general calls for direct talks, "then we should not
hesitate."
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that if the invitation contains elements
which might create negative developments, then the Greek Cypriot
side should not attend these talks.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has insisted that he would not sit down at the
negotiation table with Greek Cypriots unless the international
community recognize his breakaway Turkish Cypriot state.

<HEADLINE> UAE Invests Heavily on Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) has invested a total of 100 billion U.S. dollars on
development projects during the past 10 years, which has
effectively accelerated the country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The investments accounted for 20-30 percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP), which is the highest rate worldwide, said
a report published Sunday in the Public Affairs magazine issued by
the Abu Dhabi Crown Prince's Court.
</P>
<P>
The report added that government and private fixed capital had
risen to 108 billion dollars during the last decade, including
both the oil sector and non-oil sectors.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, investment had risen from 6.5 billion
dollars in 1990 to 13.4 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Economic sources predicted that investment would reach 13.9
billion dollars in 1999, following the upswing in oil prices and
the increase in government expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The report said the UAE's GDP had grown from 34.1 billion
dollars in 1990 to 46.3 billion dollars last year and may reach 49
billion dollars in 1999 due to high oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The oil sector had absorbed most of the investments during
1990-1999, followed by the manufacturing sector, the construction
sector, the water and electricity sector and the agriculture and
fisheries, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Leader Calls for Arab Solidarity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 12 (Xinhua) -- President of the Palestinian
National Authority Yasser Arafat called Sunday on the Arab
countries to "close the painful chapter of the past and turn a new
page of solidarity."
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the call in his speech to the 112th session of the
Arab League Foreign Ministers' Council which opened earlier in the
day in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Arabs should learn the lessons from division and conflicts
which prevailed the Arab world in the recent years and make
efforts to forge solidarity and fraternity, Arafat told foreign
ministers and officials from 22 Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that only through unity and solidarity can the
Arabs achieve national interests in view of current major
international changes.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that genuine efforts will be exerted to clear
Arab atmosphere in a bid to coordinate political stances and boost
common Arab action.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, Arab officials are expected to
discuss a call for an Arab summit to reach a united position of
the peace talks between Arab countries and Israel and the United
Nations sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said he hoped the revised Wye accord signed between the
Palestinians and Israel on September 5 would be a new beginning
for peace negotiations between Syria, Lebanon, the Palestinians
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the importance of East Jerusalem. "There can
be no peace without Jerusalem, free (of Israeli occupation) and as
the capital of a Palestinian state," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat emphasized that the 3 million Palestinian refugees have
the right to return to the Palestinian territories. He dismissed
reports that the large number of Palestinians in Lebanon might
become permanent residents.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel will discuss the issue of the
refugees in their final status talks beginning on Monday.

<HEADLINE> German Ruling Party Loses Two More State Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Germany's governing Social
Democrats (SPD) led by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder were heavily
defeated Sunday in two more elections, the state election of
Thuringia in eastern Germany and the municipal election in
North Rhine-Westphalia state.
</P>
<P>
The continuous defeats at state level will further endanger
Schroeder's much-criticized fiscal reform. The SPD lost control of
Saarland State and Brandenburg State just a week ago.
</P>
<P>
In Thuringia, the SPD pulled barely 19.6 percent of the vote,
while its conservative opposite, the Christian Democrats (CDU),
won an absolute majority of about 50.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
And the Democratic Socialism Party (PDS), the successor to
former East Germany's communists, became the second largest party
in the Thuringia state parliament with more than 21 percent of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
The SPD has co-ruled the state during the past eight years in a
"grand coalition" together with the CDU, but the latter is sure to
take sole control after its overwhelming victory Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Three tiny parties, the Greens party, the Free Democrats (FDP),
and the rightwing extremist German People Union (DVU), were not
able to win more than 5 percent of the vote to enter the state
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Greens party, junior partner in Schroeder's Berlin cabinet,
scored no more than 2 percent of the vote, even less than the DVU
that won 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Many have feared the DVU would have entered the Thuringia state
parliament, just like it did last Sunday in Brandenburg. Rightwing
extremist parties have attracted more voters recently in Germany's
eastern states.
</P>
<P>
The SPD also saw heavy defeats in municipal elections in North
Rhine-Westphalia, the most populous and wealthy state in Germany.
The state had been a traditional power base of the SPD.
</P>
<P>
According to projections by German television, two important
cities, Cologne and Duesseldorf, will be controlled by the CDU.
The latter is the capital of the state.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's elections were featured with a low voter turnout. In
Thuringia, only 60 percent of the voters went to the polling
stations. High jobless rate and slow economy recovery have haunted
the state in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Two more state elections are scheduled in following weeks, one
in the German capital of Berlin and another in Saxony. The two
elections have been seen as further tests to Schroeder's reform
plan.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's Arusha
Region and Canada's Alberta Province will strengthen cooperation
in tourism, mining and other sectors, reports reaching here said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached when Zakia Meghji, Tanzanian minister
of Natural Resources and Tourism, held talks with the provincial
officials of Alberta over the weekend in Edmonton, Canada.
</P>
<P>
Rockford Lang, an official from Alberta Ministry of
International and Inter-governmental Relations, said his province
and the Arusha Region in northern Tanzania have been trying to
look into possible areas of cooperation since 1996.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Meghji emphasized the need for the two
countries to develop the existing good relations.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian minister said the purpose of her visit to Canada
is not only to promote Tanzania's tourism potentials but also to
brief the Canadian people on what Tanzania can offer in terms of
investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"We have almost everything one would like to invest in.
Opportunities for investment range from the field of tourism,
minerals, agriculture to communications," she said.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who is on a three-week "Selling Tanzania
Mission" to North America, left Canada Sunday for Los Angeles to
start a 10-day tour of the United States.

AUCKLAND, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The 7th informal meeting of

strengthening markets and broadening support for APEC.
</P>
<P>
Before the start of the meeting, New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley greeted other APEC leaders at the entrance of the
Auckland Museum in downtown Auckland amid drizzle and mild wind.

</P>
<P>
At the informal meeting, the leaders are expected to sum up the
experience of APEC over the past 10 years and define its future
direction.

<HEADLINE> China Culture Week Achieves Success in Paris: Organizers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The '99 Paris China Culture
Week which ended here Sunday has achieved greater success than
expected by drawing more than 100,000 visitors, said the
organizers.
</P>
<P>
The cultural week, jointly organized by the Information Office
of the State Council of China and the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), was the biggest
cultural exchange program given by China abroad.
</P>
<P>
The organizers said that the cultural week, held from September
1 to 12, not only displayed the long and deep tradition of China,
but also reflected the modernization drive made by China over the
past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
During the cultural week, Chinese artists gave various
performances ranging from a Chime Bell concert to national and
modern dances.
</P>
<P>
Several Chinese officials and scholars gave lectures on China's
social and economic development, ancient bronzes, architecture,
and Beijing Opera.
</P>
<P>
The exhibitions included a set of 2,400-year-old chime bells,
ceramics, paintings, costumes and many items reflecting the social
and economic development of China.
</P>
<P>
The China Central Television and the French television channel
TF1 jointly organized an inter-city popular game between two teams
from Paris and Beijing during the cultural week.
</P>
<P>
A fashion show was organized in the last two days of the
cultural week to show the Chinese costume culture since ancient
times till the present time.

<HEADLINE> China on Way to World Steel Power (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 50 years, China has established a complete steel production
system and 10 key steel enterprises that account for 50 percent of
the country's steel.
</P>
<P>
From 1949 to 1998, fixed assets investment in the steel
industry totaled 478.7 billion yuan and during that period, the
sector had 553 billion yuan in pre-tax profits.
</P>
<P>
Pu said that the goal of the industry is to build China into a
world steel power and to do this, it decided to cut production by
10 percent this year. This decision has been seen as a turning
point and it will help China shift from top steel producer to a
real steel power.
</P>
<P>
Steel output is expected to cut to 103 million tons this year.
The country will impose stricter controls on steel imports and
will no longer import anything that it can produce and it will
make an effort to export 4 million tons of steel products.
</P>
<P>
The year's target is to pull 46 large and medium-sized State-
owned enterprises out of the red and to get them to have total
profits of 5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Pu said that China's iron and steel industry has enormous
market prospects. Apart from the low per-capita steel consumption,
about 80 kg. a year, there are other factors that could increase
demand for steel, like increasing infrastructure and housing
construction. China will push the renovation of its older
enterprises, develop hi-tech value-added products, and improve the
proportion of quality steel to make China an true iron and steel
power, Pu concluded.

<HEADLINE> Trimble Faces Increased Pressure on Peace Process Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Ulster Unionist Party leader
David Trimble is expected to come under increased pressure from
party hardliners to withdraw from Northern Ireland's peace process
review.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the 110-member UUP ruling executive was called for
Monday afternoon to discuss the party's response to Chris Patten's
report on the future of policing in the province, BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
The executive body was also expected to consider the
implications of the decision by Trimble's deputy, John Taylor, to
take no further part in the review being chaired by former U.S.
senator George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
UUP security spokesman Ken Maginnis said Sunday that Taylor's
stance did not reflect the attitude of the UUP ruling executive.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell returned to Belfast Monday to prepare for a resumption
of his review of how the Good Friday Agreement was being
implemented.
</P>
<P>
The talks were adjourned last Wednesday after three days, to
allow time for the publication of the Patten report on the future
of policing in the province.
</P>
<P>
Its recommendations and the Mitchell review are expected to be
on the agenda when Sinn Fein negotiator Martin McGuinness meets
U.S. President Bill Clinton and his advisors in Washington
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Before flying to the United States, McGuinness said the Ulster
Unionists were "running scared of the equality agenda, and
power-sharing."
</P>
<P>
Senior Ulster Unionist negotiator Dermot Nesbitt told BBC that
the review could not go on much longer.
</P>
<P>
Speaking ahead of the UUP executive meeting, Nesbitt rejected
suggestions that his party should withdraw from the process now.
</P>
<P>
He said, "It is now time for those who have used violence to
jump ship and jump to the democratic process. I want to see peace
as does David Trimble, and I believe the overwhelming majority
within unionism."
</P>
<P>
The Patten report, which made 175 recommendations, has
infuriated many unionists, particularly in its suggestion that the
name of the Royal Ulster Constabulary should be changed to the
Northern Ireland Police Service.
</P>
<P>
Many of them see this as an insult to the force, which they
believe has protected the community from many years of republican
violence.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the Ulster Unionist executive coincides with the
publication of an opinion poll in Northern Ireland, showing that
general unionist support for the peace process has slumped.
</P>
<P>
The poll suggested that only 39 percent of the unionist
majority of the population now supports the peace process begun
under last year's Good Friday Agreement, compared with 59 percent
in April.
</P>
<P>
The poll, carried out by Ulster Marketing Surveys (UMS), also
indicated that most unionists, or 65 percent, were against Chris
Patten's proposals.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-five percent of republicans, however, backed the Patten
recommendations. Most also still backed the Good Friday accord.

Chinese top legislator Li Peng, in a meeting today with
visiting French Senate President Christian Poncelet, said that
China is willing to promote a long-term and stable relationship
with France based on mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit, and
mutual non-interference in each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing
Committee, said that France is the first among western powers to
establish diplomatic relations with China at ambassadorial level,
and China speaks highly of Charles Gaulle's wise decision to do
that.
</P>
<P>
China values Sino-French friendship, Li said, adding that
bilateral ties have been developing smoothly through joint efforts,
and there have been constant high-level exchanges between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
China and France should make joint efforts to help the growth
of bilateral relations that will benefit both sides, said Li
Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People'
s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), at a meeting with a
Senate of France delegation headed by its president Christian
Poncelet.
</P>
<P>
Li told Poncelet, who arrived here Monday for a six-day
official visit to China, that the two countries have every reason
to increase exchanges, learn from each other, and push forward the
long-cherished friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
Poncelet said that the French government pays great attention
to cultural exchanges and economic cooperation with China, and the
two sides should increase cooperation in the areas of economy,
industry and trade.

 NPC Chairman Meets Japanese Delegation
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the Chinese National People's Congress
Standing Committee, said here today that further friendly
cooperation between China and Japan will benefit the two countries
and Asia as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks at a meeting with a delegation of the Japan-
China Economic Relations and Trade Center (JCERTC), headed by
Honorary Chairman Kimura Ichizo and Chairman Miyoshi Toshio of the
center.
</P>
<P>
On China's domestic situation, Li said that the State sector
plays a dominant role in China's national economy, especially in
key fields such as banking, power, railways, shipping, and
telecommunications. So it is important that State-owned
enterprises should operate in line with the rule of the market.
</P>
<P>
Ichizo and Toshio said China reaffirmed its policy to encourage
foreign investment last week and this will heighten the confidence
of Japanese business people in further cooperation with their
Chinese counterparts. The JCERTC would make greater efforts to
promote bilateral economic and trade relations.

<HEADLINE> EU to Provide Further Aid for Quake-Affected Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the
European Union member countries met their Turkish counterpart
Ismail Cem here Monday to discuss EU-Turkish relations and aid for
reconstruction in earthquake-stricken Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The EU will provide a further emergency humanitarian aid of 30
million euros (31 million U.S. dollars) to Turkey, in addition to
the 4 million euros (4.16 million dollars) already granted to
Turkey after the quake, a statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added the European Investment Bank, one of the EU's
financial institutions, will provide Turkey with a loan totaling
60 million euros (62.4 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The EU ministers called for continuous European efforts to help
Turkey overcome hard times.
</P>
<P>
EU sources said the meeting between Ismail Cem and the EU
foreign ministers is their first official talks after the EU
Luxembourg Summit in December 1997, when the EU decided "to leave
Turkey off the list of would-be EU members considered to be ripe
to start accession talks."
</P>
<P>
Since the summit, "Ankara has remained aloof from any political
dialogue with the EU, and this applies in particular to the
Cypriot question, good relations with Greece, human rights and the
rule of law," said the latest issue of the European Report.
</P>
<P>
Some EU observers believe these issues are expected to be taken
into account by the EU with the recent thaw in relations between
Turkey on one side and the EU and Greece on the other.
</P>
<P>
Before meeting Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, the EU
foreign ministers decided to break a deadlock over two financial
packages, one worth 135 million euros (140 million dollars) and
the other 15 million euros (15.6 million dollars), proposed by the
European Commission in November 1997. But the decision needs to be
approved by the European Parliament.

<HEADLINE> Donors Urge Bangladesh to Accelerate Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's donors urged the
government to accelerate reforms at a two-day mid-term meeting on
the country's economic progress which started here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In their introductory speeches, World Bank country director
Frederick T. Temple and International Monetary Fund resident
mission chief Ronald P. Hicks expressed their "concern for (the
government's) not being able to make much headway with the
structural reform."
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria, in a 14-page statement,
outlined the different reforms and the fiscal and monetary
measures the government has taken so far to put the country's
flood-ravaged economy on the right track. He also explained the
welfare steps being implemented to ensure social services to the
common people.
</P>
<P>
Despite two major external shocks -- the flooding and the
contagious effect of the Asian economic crisis, the country's
economic recovery was remarkable in the 1998-99 fiscal year thanks
to the efforts of the government and the help from the development
partners, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's gross domestic product grew by 5.2
percent last fiscal year, with the growth rate of the agriculture
sector at 5.0 percent, the manufacturing sector at 2.5 percent and
the service sector at 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Kibria also explained to the donors' representatives the
government's monetary and budgetary polices, reforms in the
financial, power, administrative and judicial sectors.
</P>
<P>
Issues regarding human rights, terrorism and governance were
likely to dominate the meeting, and the political situation in the
country, which has turned turbulent following Sunday's violence
and a subsequent three-day countrywide strike, may also come up
for discussion, a report in The Daily Star newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
A donors' report issued prior to the meeting said insecurity
and extortion were among the most serious problems faced by the
poor, which threatened to undermine efforts to promote investment
and economic development in the country.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of 23 development partners of Bangladesh,
including 15 countries and eight donor agencies, are attending the
meeting, which is being held amid the opposition-sponsored
three-day strike.

<HEADLINE> Three Americans Sentenced to 27 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Three Americans who were found
guilty of possessing arms of war and trying to board an aircraft
were sentenced to a total 27 months imprisonment on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Gary Blanchard (35), Joseph Pettijohn (34) and John Dixon (35)
were convicted by Justice Mohamed Adam of the High Court in
Harare.
</P>
<P>
Adam sentenced them to 21 months imprisonment for breaching the
Law and Order (Maintenance) Act, and to six months imprisonment
for breaching the Aircraft Offences Act. The two sentences were
ordered to run concurrently, and nine months of the 21 months
sentence were conditionally suspended.
</P>
<P>
He said the remaining 12 months should be effective from the
time when they were arrested on March 7, this year. Since then
they had been remanded in custody.
</P>
<P>
Effectively they were sentenced to six months imprisonment,
which will be reduced when remission is taken into account
depending on their good behavior during their stay in prison.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Counsel for Defense, Chris Anderson, said he would appeal
against both conviction and sentence.
</P>
<P>
Adams said that in arriving at the sentences he had taken into
account the six months the three had spend in custody and the
medical reports submitted by three doctors indicating that they
were tortured.
</P>
<P>
"This is a strong mitigatory factor in favor of the three,"
Adams said.
</P>
<P>
The three were arrested at Harare International Airport when
they were about to depart aboard a Swiss aircraft destined for
Zurich.
</P>
<P>
The three, who pleaded not guilty, were found in possession of
39 weapons which included 10 rifles, nine short guns, 13 pistols,
eight revolvers.
</P>
<P>
Adams said there was a lot of suspicion that people who claimed
to be doing missionary work would need to defend themselves with
such an array of military equipment.
</P>
<P>
"The state was given opportunity to dispute this and it has not
done so to date," said Adams, adding investigations had taken too
long. He attributed this to some degree of incompetence.

wealth of experience which Chinese businesses have acquired over
the years in various sectors, especially in the machinery and

ISLAMABAD, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan opposition said
Monday they had captured a Taliban provincial governor and other
officials in an ambush in northern Afghanistan.

<P>
Sayed Hussain Anwari, an opposition commander, said they
captured Mawlawi Mohammad Wali, Taliban's governor of Jawzjan
province on Sunday in the adjacent Sar-e-Pul province, according

</P>
<P>
About 40 Taliban troops were killed in the attack, Anwari said.

A Taliban spokesman, Abdul Hai Mutmaen, confirmed the incident,

</P>
<P>
He said an opposition group headed by Abdul Chirik had
contacted the local Taliban authorities, saying they would defect
to the Taliban side.
</P>
<P>
"Our officials went to welcome them, but were taken prisoners
instead," Mutmaen said.
</P>
<P>
Quite a few anti-Taliban groups, which hold some pockets in the
mountainous northern Afghanistan, are waging a guerrilla war
against the Taliban which control more than 80 percent of the

XI'AN, China, September 13 (Xinhua) -- World record-holder Chen
Yan triumphed in her discipline of 400m individual medley as the
swimming competitions started here on Monday at the fourth Chinese
City Games.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yan, who broke the world records in both the 200m and 400m
medleys in the Chinese National Games in 1997, clocked a poor
winning result of 4:43.76, far short of her world mark of 4:34.79.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Chen Yan was also crowned twice in both the 400m
freestyle and 400m individual medley at the World Swimming
Championships in Perth, Australia.
</P>
<P>
Neither coaches nor swimmers appeared at a scheduled post-
competition press conference.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 4x100 freestyle relay, the Dalian squad
spearheaded by Chen Yan, only finished fourth as Chen herself was
overtaken in the third leg, which was eventually won by Wuhan,
headed by national team members Han Xue and Zhao Na, in 3:48.35.
</P>
<P>
National record-holder Jin Hao took the men's 400 freestyle
title in 3:55.79, still shy of his personal best of 3:54.78.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong swimmers only made into one of the five finals this
evening, and finished fifth in the men's 4x100m freestyle relay
which was won by hosts Xi'an.

A total of 318 athletes from 32 delegations are vying for the
38 gold medals at stake in the week-long swimming competitions.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Legislator Meets British Lord High Chancellor </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, met with Lord
Irvine of Lairg, lord high chancellor of the Great Britain, and
his party.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said that the expansion of bilateral ties were in the
fundamental interests of the two peoples. Also, the frequent high-
level visits were also important for Sino-British relationship.
</P>
<P>
On China's legal building, Li said that China is fully aware of
the importance of the rule of law amidst the massive economic
construction. The NPC in its annual session last March passed a
constitutional revision, in which "ruling the country by law and
build a socialist state ruled by law" has been added into China's
Constitution, he said, adding the revision gives the principle the
highest legal status.
</P>
<P>
NPC and its Standing Committee is the highest organ of power in
China which have the power to make laws, Li said. Moreover, China
demands its judiciary departments and law enforcement departments
in the executive branch to "observe the laws, strictly enforce the
laws and correct any behavior against laws" in a bid to ensure and
promote social justice, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
On inter-parliament exchanges, he said that NPC is willing to
develop friendly contacts with both the British House of Lords and
House of Commons on issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
In Britain, lord chancellor is both the speaker of the House of
Lords and the head in charge of the legal system of the cabinet.
As an official in such a post, Irvine was interested in the
process of China's legal construction. He considered China's
constitutional revision will have deep impact on the country's
future development.
</P>
<P>
Irvine also spoke highly of his meetings with China's Ministry
of Justice and other departments during his visit.
</P>
<P>
In another development, China's Ministry of Justice and Lord
Chancellor's Department signed a memorandum of understanding on
legal cooperation between the two organs here today.

JOHANNESBURG, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Double Olympic silver

<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese top legislator Li
Peng, in a meeting today with visiting French Senate President
Christian Poncelet, said that China is willing to promote a long-
term and stable relationship with France based on mutual respect,
equality, mutual benefit, and mutual non-interference in each
other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing
Committee, said that France is the first among western powers to
establish diplomatic relations with China at ambassadorial level,
and China speaks highly of Charles Gaulle's wise decision to do
that.
</P>
<P>
China values Sino-French friendship, Li said, adding that
bilateral ties have been developing smoothly through joint efforts,
and there have been constant high-level exchanges between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Thus, exchanges and direct dialogues between the two countries'
leaders helped promote mutual understanding and friendship, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Li went on to say that China and France, both as permanent
members of the Security Council of the United Nations, stand for
pushing forward multi-polar world, and they share many
similarities in maintaining world peace and promoting the common
development of the mankind.

and accords with the aspiration and basic interests of the people
of both countries, Li said.

<HEADLINE> German Ruling Party Defeated in Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Social Democratic
Party (SPD), which has been in power for less than one year, was
defeated by the opposition Sunday in local elections held in
Turingia and North Rhine-Westphalia states, according to final
official election results released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party completely lost control of Turingia with the
opposition Christian Democratic Party (CDU) gaining a 50.9 percent
absolute majority in the parliamentary elections, the first since
the country's reunification.
</P>
<P>
The Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) rose as the state's
second largest party in parliament, with its vote up 4.9
percentage points from the 1994 polls to 21.2 percent. The SPD,
which formerly shared power with the CDU, came in third place with
18.6 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Both the Green Party, SPD's single partner in the current
ruling coalition, and the Liberal Democratic Party were routed in
the polls. None of them won enough votes to overcome the 5-percent
barrier for representation in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The SPD also suffered major setbacks Sunday in the municipal
ballots in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most industrial and
populous state, where it had triumphed in most post-World War II
local elections.
</P>
<P>
Official results showed that the CDU gained absolute majority
in Cologne city and emerged as the largest party in many other
cities. The SPD shed an average of some 10 percent of votes
compared with its victory in the 1994 local polls, losing many of
its traditional strongholds in the state.
</P>
<P>
The SPD, which came in power after beating the CDU in the
parliamentary polls held in September 1998, has suffered defeats
in the European parliamentary elections and polls in Hessen state
since the start of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Political observers said SPD's traditional supporters have been
disappointed at infighting among the SPD-Greens coalition
government, its poor government record and particularly, its
failure to realize election platforms.
</P>
<P>
Newly-appointed SPD National Secretary General Franz
Muentefering said the party's latest loss is a "warning" sent to
it by the voters.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Says Lee Teng-hui Pushing Taiwan Towards Calamity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily, China's
leading newspaper, will carry an article tomorrow condemning Lee
Teng-hui for pushing Taiwan towards a calamity.
</P>
<P>
Lee's "two states" statement has been severely criticized but
he hasn't repented and has gone even further by putting his "
special state-to-state relations" into Kuomintang documents.
</P>
<P>
The article says that Lee's stubborn attempts to divide China
have to be closely monitored. With his support, "Taiwan
independence" forces have run rampant in recent years and the "
special state-to-state relations" adoption indicates the direction
of the Taiwan authorities' policies in the future.
</P>
<P>
The common goal of the Chinese, including the Taiwanese, is to
reunify China and Lee's attempt to divide China is doomed to fail,
says the article. Lee has tried to see to it that his policies
continue after he steps down off the political stage and his
measures have put obstacles in the path of reunification and
seriously damaged the interests of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lee has betrayed Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Kuomintang,
and members of the party. Today, Lee is pushing Taiwan onto a
battleground, which is to endanger the economic development of
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The people of Taiwan expect a stable and peaceful life, which
depends on the healthy development of cross-Straits relations, the
article says, expressing the hope that insightful Taiwanese can
see through the danger of Lee's splittist policy and prevent the
danger.

<HEADLINE> China on Way to World Steel Power (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Editor's note: This year
marks the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's
Republic of China. China's economic successes in the past five
decades have attracted the attention of the world. Xinhua began
issuing stories on the country's economy starting August 17. This
is the 21st.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-years of expansion and growth have made China the world's
top steel producer, but China is cutting its steel production to
increase quality and efficiency in the sector.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government recently announced that it would issue
an additional 60 billion yuan worth of treasury bonds to help
economic growth, with 15.3 billion yuan worth earmarked for
technological renovation efforts of the country's old industries,
including the key metallurgical industry.
</P>
<P>
Pu Haiqing, the new director of the State Administration of
Metallurgical Industry, said that the government's support helps
the industry's shift in focus from quantity to quality.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1950s, China could only produce 100 types of low
quality rolled steel and the annual steel output was 158,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast, more than 1,000 types of rolled steel are
produced today, and, from 1996 to 1998, annual steel output
exceeded 100 million tons, making it first in the world.
</P>
<P>
In 1953, the country's demand for rolled steel was 2.4 million
tons and it imported 930,000 tons. In 1997, the country's demand
for rolled steel was 110 million tons, 92 percent of which was
produced domestically.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Study New Zealand's Economic Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Some Philippine officials, who
are with President Joseph Estrada in New Zealand, will stay behind
to conduct a study of the experiences in that nation's economy,
Philippine News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Diokno, secretary of the Department of Budget and
Management, said he and some other officials will stay for a few
days to study New Zealand's economic reforms after Estrada leaves
for Latin America.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the hope that the result of the study will help boost
the Philippines' economic reform through the planned Charter
change.
</P>
<P>
The endeavor is believed to be in line with Estrada's wish to
narrow the gap at home between the rich and the poor while
strengthening the middle class.
</P>
<P>
"In New Zealand, the middle class is strong. You don't see a
wide gap between rich and poor. I hope the same would happen in
the Philippines," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
Diokno said he will see what reforms are needed to reengineer
the bureaucracy and make it better equipped to narrow the gap
between rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
He added that he will coordinate with the Philippine Congress
to institute the needed reforms once he returns from New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, accompanied by Philippine officials and business
leaders, is in Auckland, New Zealand, for the annual informal
leadership conference of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum.

<HEADLINE> More HK Small Enterprises Urged to Use E-Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Productivity
Council (HKPC) Monday urged more small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) in Hong Kong to use e-business in the drive to
turn the city into an innovation and technology center in Asia.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey on the adoption of e-business in Hong Kong
showed that 65 percent of local companies have not used any form
of e-business, and 93 percent of them have less than 10 staff,
reflecting that local SMEs as a whole are slow in e-business
adoption.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted jointly by the Institute of
Information and Media Industries of the HKPC and IBM China/Hong
Kong Ltd. A total of 3,702 local companies were interviewed and
the result of the survey has been grossed up to the whole
population of around 280,000 companies in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"In the 21st century, the readiness of a company to adopt e-
business will become a major determinant of its market
competitiveness," said Thomas Tang, executive director of the HKPC.
</P>
<P>
Since over 98 percent of Hong Kong companies are small and
medium-sized enterprises, how they perform in this area will
directly effect the future of Hong Kong's economic development, he
added.
</P>
<P>
To encourage a wider adoption of e-business, the HKPC will
organize over 60 seminars and training workshops on e-business for
the SMEs in the next six months, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the e-business adoption survey result is
the first event under HKPC's campaign of "World of Innovation -- E-
Commerce Week", and other events include the launch of the China
PPNet, a Hong Kong-based information network to facilitate
information exchange between companies in the Chinese mainland and
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to the International Data Corporation, e-commerce
will be the dominant form of business transaction in the future.
The number of Internet users worldwide is estimated at 112 million
with a total online trade volume worldwide in 1998 topping 43
billion U.S. dollars, while Hong Kong has to date over one million
Internet users.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin on Monday called on Russians to show vigilance and to work
together to fight terrorism following a series of explosions in
Moscow and other cities.
</P>
<P>
"Terrorism has declared war on us, the people of Russia,"
Yeltsin said in a television address hours after a powerful
explosion demolished an eight-story building in southeast Moscow
early Monday. The death toll, of 35 now, is expected to rise.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said we "must unite to combat the internal enemy. That
enemy does not know conscience, pity or honor. It has no face, no
ethnic origin or faith, I repeat, no ethnic origin or faith."
</P>
<P>
He also ordered more stringent security measures in the next
few hours throughout Russia, especially around nuclear power
plants, oil reservoirs and other key installations, the Interfax
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Moscow Mayor Luzhkov, after visiting the Monday blast scene,
told reporters the toughest possible steps will be taken to
prevent infiltration of itinerant criminals into the city.
</P>
<P>
The latest blast was the third one in the capital since August
31, when a bomb went off in an underground shopping mall near the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, just seconds to midnight, a nine-story
apartment building also located in southeast Moscow was ripped
apart in a powerful explosion.
</P>
<P>
Although the police are still investigating the causes of the
blasts, many believe they were staged by terrorists with links to
Chechen rebels who are fighting federal troops in Daghestan.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Military Reports CF-18 Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Canada's CF-18 fighter jets
have had a series of mishaps in training, with toxic missiles
reported twice accidentally dropping off the wing tips in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
In the most recent incident on May 8 last year, a CF-18 taking
off from Bagotvill, Quebec, lost a cigar-shaped dummy missile
which was built to mimic a Sidewinder air-to-air missile, the
local press reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The device had no warhead or rocket propellant, but its
guidance system contained a highly toxic mercury-thalium compound,
which has never been recovered since falling off by accident onto
a remote wooded area.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the latest written statement from the
military as saying, "There were only two missile losses in 15
years of CF-18 usage, over 460,000 flying hours."
</P>
<P>
In other accidents, a vertical rudder dropped off a CF-18 on
March 23 this year at Cold Lake after getting rotted from inside
the fighter plane.
</P>
<P>
A hatch on the wing has blown off the aircraft at least nine
times with the most recent case taking place at Cold Lake on June
25 this year.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian air force released the accident report while
planning a upgrade of the CF-18s.
</P>
<P>
Canada spent 5.2 billion dollars (about 3.5 billion U.S.
dollars) buying 138 CF-18s between 1982 and 1988. The fleet has
since reduced to 122, with fewer than 100 in operation, according
to the press.

<HEADLINE> UPU Adjusts Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The world posts has adjusted
its strategy for providing modernized and efficient services to
more people in the next century than ever before.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in the 125-year history of the Universal
Postal Union (UPU), the ongoing 22nd Universal Postal Congress (
UPC) here put the principle of "universal postal service" into the
Acts of the UPU.
</P>
<P>
In the Beijing Postal Strategy that the UPC developed here, one
mission of universal service and six related objectives were
formulated, as well as a number of strategies and tactics.
</P>
<P>
"The Beijing Congress is a Congress of the Future," Thomas
Leavey, director general of the UPU's International Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the challenges and possibilities of the new
millennium forced the postal services to undergo major changes.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Postal Strategy calls for governments and postal
administrations around the world to adopt advanced technology to
develop new postal products and markets, encourage posts to shift
from government agencies to successful businesses, and enhance
cooperation with related industries.
</P>
<P>
Professor Lu Tingjie from the Beijing Postal University said
that in order to better implement the principle of universal
service, many countries in the world are diminishing the scope of
postal monopoly and introducing competition to wider fields.
</P>
<P>
They are reforming postal management and turning part of postal
services into independent businesses, while encouraging the
cooperation between the posts and related industries and
introducing information technology into postal services, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the 22nd UPC Wang Zhanning said that the
application of information technology will greatly change the
outlook of the posts in the next century. A number of traditional
postal services such as mail and telegraph will lose market, while
other high-tech, high value-added postal services will shoot up.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Emphasizes Science And Technology In Northwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Science, technology and
education should play a major role in developing China's
northwestern provinces, Vice-premier Li Lanqing said here today.
</P>
<P>
He was visiting a new technology pilot zone in Shaanxi Province
while attending the founding ceremony of Northwest Science and
Technology University of Agriculture and Forestry.
</P>
<P>
He said that developing the western part of China is an
important strategy of the Party and State and that the West can
never be developed at the expense of natural resources and a
destroyed environment as happened in the past. The western
provinces can develop their economies only by making full use of
their knowledge and talent, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new university was formed by combining Northwest
Agriculture University, Northwest Forestry University, the
Institute of Soil and Water Conservation of the Ministry of Water
Resources under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Shaanxi
Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Northwest Hydrotechnical
Research Institute, Northwestern Institute of Botany of Shaanxi
Province, and the Shaanxi Academy of Forestry.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese media and
publications have focused more on the law in recent years, and
there are more than 200 newspapers and publications dealing with
the law.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Legal Daily, news reports on the law have
broken away from the sex crimes and murders that they followed 10
years ago and are focusing on judicial affairs, corruption, and
public participation in state affairs.
</P>
<P>
The report says that more social problems have to be solved
through the law, increasing the importance of news. Most
newspapers have columns on the law and some TV stations have
programs on the law with live broadcasts of court proceedings and
hotlines to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
The Legal Daily also says that the print media are covering
economic aspects like stocks and bonds, labor policy, patents,
environmental protection, tax laws, and so on.
</P>
<P>
These news reports have become important means for Chinese to
acquaint themselves with the law and how to protect their
interests. This indicates they are turning the country with
thousands of years of rule by man into a country where the law
rules.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Exports Growing Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- China's exports for August
were up 17.8 percent from the same month last year to 18.33
billion U.S. dollars, the Customs said today.
</P>
<P>
Imports for the month grew 24 percent to 13.4 billion U.S.
dollars, with a surplus of 4.88 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
August was the second month of export growth. Exports for July
were up 7.5 percent to 17.34 billion U.S. dollars worth.
</P>
<P>
The General Administration of Customs reports total exports for
the first eight months were worth 118.4 billion U.S. dollars, down
only 0.2 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Total import and export volume for the eight-month period was
220.8 billion U.S. dollars, up 7.3 percent year on year, with
imports growing 17.5 percent to 102.4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus added up to 16 billion U.S. dollars for the
January-August period.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say that the export growth was mainly in general
trade. The increase in the export of state-owned enterprise and
foreign-invested enterprise products also contributed to the
growth momentum.
</P>
<P>
With the recovery of economies in Southeast Asia that were hit
hard by the Asian financial crisis, China's exports have also
rebounded.
</P>
<P>
Exports to the United States, Japan, the European Union,
Southeast Asia, and the Republic of Korea have all shown positive
growth. Exports to Hong Kong showed this year's first growth in
August, at a rate of 21.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Machinery, electronics and garments are the major export
products that enjoyed rapid growth in the eight months under

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Stresses Forest Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 13 (Xinhua) -- China will try to initially
rehabilitate the forest areas on the upper and middle reaches of
the Yangtze and Yellow rivers and restore the ecological system in
the areas in five to ten years, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
stressed recently.
</P>
<P>
During an inspection tour of southwest China's Sichuan Province
from September 6 to 12, Zhu Rongji traveled more than 1,200
kilometers and investigated the forest protection project in the
province.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan took the lead to ban the felling of natural forest
beginning last September, and those engaged in timber industry are
engaged in tree planting.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that forest and ecological protection is an pressing
issue in China. The natural forests on the upper and middle
reaches of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers are forbidden to cut, and
the timber markets in the areas must be shut down.
</P>
<P>
In view of the difficulties brought by the forest cutting ban,
China will offer preferential policies to the affected areas, said
Zhu.
</P>
<P>
The regions with less financial revenue as a result of the ban
will enjoy compensation from the central and provincial
governments. The reform of the timber enterprises will continue
and employees of the enterprises will be assigned new jobs. China
will compensate and support the farmers who return their farmlands
to forests.
</P>
<P>
The burning of firewood as fuel will be replaced by use of coal
or electricity, and more research is needed to develop substitutes
of wood, said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
He added that economic structure in the forest areas must be
changed to developing tourism, forestry and animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier also showed great concern about the
development of the areas of the ethnic groups, saying that
speeding the economic development in these areas has a vital
bearing on the common development and prosperity of all the
nationalities in China and the country's modernization drive as a
whole. Now the central authorities have made the development of
the western region a priority, he added.

<HEADLINE> Athens Quake Death Toll Rises to 122 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from last
Tuesday's devastating earthquake in northwestern Athens has
climbed to 122 Monday as the rescue work has been nearing its
completion on all sites of the collapsed buildings and foreign
rescue teams are preparing to leave Greece.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake measuring 5.9 on the Richter scale occurred last
Tuesday in the Mount Parnitha region, some 20 kilometers
northwestern of Athens.
</P>
<P>
Following the earthquake, Greek rescue teams, along with their
foreign counterparts from France, Turkey, Russia, Germany, Israel,
Switzerland and Cyprus, have worked day and night to extricate
persons trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings in the
quake-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 people were injured and as many as 60,000
Athenians have been left homeless by the earthquake, which is
estimated to cost the country 100 billion drachmas (about 333
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis Monday urged all Greeks to
contribute in any way they could to help the country deal with the
problems caused by the earthquake.
</P>
<P>
He said that a bill has been tabled in the Greek Parliament
introducing a system of insurance against the destructive mania of
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
Simitis also announced that a joint initiative would be
launched by the Greek government, political parties and local
government on measures needed to better organize the country in
handling disasters.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Greece's Environment, Town Planning and Public Works
Minister Costas Latiotis announced two measures for more stringent
checks on building plans.
</P>
<P>
Registration of private building constructors would be
introduced, a move which has long been sought by the Technical
Chamber of Greece, he said, adding that an institution would be
established to inspect the building plans designed by private
engineers.
</P>
<P>
The minister warned that the Greek government is determined to
seek out the responsibilities of building contractors for the
collapse of home and other buildings.

SHANGHAI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- "It's beyond our imagination
that China successfully developed a market economy while sticking
to a socialist route," Nicolae Taracila, head of the Moldavian
delegation to the 22nd Universal Postal Congress (UPC), said after
visiting this east China city today.
</P>
<P>
Taracila visited Shanghai and Hangzhou with other
representatives from more than 170 countries and over 30
international organizations during a break of the UPC held in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, they visited several places in
Shanghai, the largest economic and financial center of China. The
Doyen of the congress Andre Darrigrand said that they have seen
both skyscrapers of the modern metropolis and well-preserved
historical relics. The brief trip will leave life-time impression
on the visitors, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Leavey, director general of the International Bureau of
the Universal Postal Union (UPU), said that the congress used to
consider of leading the international delegates to a sightseeing
tour to ancient city Xi'an in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
However, seeing most of the delegates are in their first trip
to China, the congress decided that they should have the
opportunity to see the newest face of China. Therefore they
finally chose relatively developed coastal cities of Shanghai and
Hangzhou as destinies of the trip.
</P>
<P>
During their trip to Pudong new area in east Shanghai, the
delegates visited several overseas-funded companies, including the
Sino-US joint venture Shanghai Bell.
</P>
<P>
Taracila said that seeing so many well-known international
companies set up their presence in Shanghai, they began to
understand the great vigor of the Chinese economy.
</P>
<P>
"We used to think that China was a relatively under developed
country with a planned economy. But our experience in China proved
that our thinking of China was quite outdated," he said.

"This could include such contributions as a detachment of
medical personnel, logistics support and military observers," Tony
Tan said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Targets Congo Border Security Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Long-lasting peace in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) would not be possible
unless the border security concerns of Angola, Rwanda and Uganda
are also dealt with, Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Aziz Pahad
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee on
peace efforts in the DRC, he said lasting peace in the region also
has to be linked to the reconstruction and development of Rwanda
itself.
</P>
<P>
This would assist in lowering the tensions in the area, he was
quoted by South African Press Association as saying.
</P>
<P>
It would involve the repatriation of many Rwandan refugees in
the DRC -- who are not part of the genocidal forces but genuine
refugees who left Rwanda following the genocide, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pahad said the international community has to help repatriate
them so that the process of reconciliation can start in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the situation in the DRC could not be
understood " outside the context of its neighbors", adding that
one of the key aspects of the DRC problem is its regional,
continental and local dimensions.
</P>
<P>
"So it's a broader issue that we are going to have to tackle.
it cannot be done by us alone -- on some aspects we'll do it
bilaterally, but in general, we'll have to do it through our
interaction in the multilateral institutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia have been backing DRC President
Laurent Kabila in the year-long civil war, while Rwanda and Uganda
have been allied to the rival factions of the rebel movement, the
Congolese Rally for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
On how best to enforce the DRC peace accord signed in Lusaka,
Pahad said he believed the belligerent forces "can even be their
own enforcers".
</P>
<P>
"There is no need at this stage for any of those forces to
advance more militarily and they can begin to monitor themselves,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Pahad attempted to assure MPS that the government would come to
 Parliament for approval should it decide to send South Africans
as part of any observer mission in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no movement without going through the
constitutional procedures," he said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Indonesian President B.J.Habibie said Sunday night that his
country will allow armed foreign peacekeepers into East Timor to
quell a wave of killing and devastation.
</P>
<P>
-- Republican presidential candidate Patrick J. Buchanan
strongly suggested on Sunday that he would drop out of the party

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The day after Athens was struck by its most serious
earthquake in decades, millions of television viewers watched in
awe as Turkish rescue workers pulled a Greek child from under a

</P>
<P>

Moscow, killing at least 11 people, leveling the building and
leaving dozens of other residents missing.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Motorola is in talks to acquire General Instrument, a cable-
TV-equipment maker, in a stock deal valued at about 10 billion U.S.
dollars. The deal would unite electronics power Motorola with a
leading provider of TV set-top boxes, positioning the firms in the
"broadband" market for interactive voice, data and video services.
</P>
<P>

"The rapid development of the Pudong new area in Shanghai shows
us the promising future of China," he said.
</P>
<P>
During an evening sightseeing tour at the Bund, where the
Huangpu River flows through Shanghai city, head of the Egyptian
Delegation Ahmad El Sayed El Soly said that the skyline at the
Huangpu River is prettier and more modernized than at the Nile.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt should take China as an example and build its own '
Shanghai' at the Nile," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has always been the engine of China economy. Since
China began reform and opening-up to the outside world 20 years
ago, the metropolis has been leading the country in terms of
growth rate, scale of the economy and in-take of overseas funds.
By 1998, the annual per capita income of Shanghai residents exceed
1,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sylvain Vahiako, head of the delegation from Madagascar in
Africa, said that Shanghai has so many business opportunities that
he will encourage business persons of his own country to invest
here.
</P>
<P>
The UPC delegates have visited many postal facilities in
Beijing and Shanghai during their stay in China. Leavey said that
the infrastructure in these large cities are very well developed
and can rival those anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the rapid growth of postal services in China is
based on the health of the overall economy. Over the past few
years, China's postal services grew by 8-9 percent every year in
terms of business volume, compared to the world average of three
percent.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that in the first 25 years of the next century,
China will grow into a major economic power in the world," he
said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, U.S. to Sign Extradition Treaties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Justice Minister Penuell
Maduna and National Director of Public Prosecutions Bulelani
Ngcuka Sunday left for Washington to sign treaties on extradition
and mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, the Justice
Ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Although South Africa and the United States concluded an
agreement on extradition in 1947, but it fails to meet the current
needs of the two countries, Maduna's spokesman Paul Setsetse said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, a much more effective and comprehensive treaty to
ensure the prompt extradition of criminals between the two
countries has been negotiated over the last few months," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry, he said, is confident that the treaties to be
signed would enhance the government's efforts to deal with crime
in general, and particularly with organized crime and
international syndicates.
</P>
<P>
Maduna and U.S. Attorney-General Ms Genet Rino will sign the
treaties in Washington Thursday before the South African
delegation return home on Friday, Setsetse said.

WELLINGTON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin arrived in Wellington by special plane Monday to start his 4-
day state visit to New Zealand at the invitation of New Zealand
Governor-General Sir Michael Hardie Boys.

In a written statement upon arrival, Jiang said, "New Zealand
is an important country in South Pacific, with a well-developed
economy and richly-endowed natural resources. It is the homeland
of Rewi Alley, who was an ambassador of friendship of the people
of New Zealand to China and a great friend of the Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
In recent years, he added, China-New Zealand relations have
maintained a good momentum of development, thanks to the concerted
efforts of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"The upcoming new century will bring new historical
opportunities for the further development of relations between
China and New Zealand," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"This is my first visit, and also the first visit by a Chinese
head of state to your country. I have come with a purpose and
desire to enhance friendship, deepen cooperation, and build a
better future with the interests of the Asia-Pacific region in
mind," the Chinese President said.
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to an exchange of views with leaders of your
country on our bilateral relations and international as well as
regional issues of common interests, and joining hands with them
in building a cross-century China-New Zealand relationship of all-
round cooperation featuring long-term stability and healthy
development," he said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Completes First-Stage Land Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIT EL, WEST BANK, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel formally
transferred the civil administration power over 7 percent of the
West Bank to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) here on
Monday, completing the first-stage handover under a new peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The transfer ceremony was held at a meeting held at the
headquarters of Israel's Civil Administration and attended by
Israeli and PNA officials.
</P>
<P>
The PNA will exercise civil power on 16 aspects, such as
tourism, tax levying and transportation, over the land in
question.
</P>
<P>
Just before the meeting, Brigadier General Dov Sedaka, head of
Israel's Civil Administration and Zohar Khalaf, head of the
regional Sub-Committee of Civil Affairs of the PNA, showed to the
reporters the redeployment maps and explained what civil
administration powers will be transfered.
</P>
<P>
Dov said the transfer ceremony was simple, but the two sides
will go through the procedures carefully and the meeting could
last for one day.
</P>
<P>
After weeks of agonizing talks, the Palestinians and Israel
signed a revised agreement for the long-overdue Wye Accord last
weekend in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm El Sheikh,
bringing the stalled Mideast peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
Under the new accord, Israel should withdraw its troops from
another 11 percent of the West Bank in three stages by January 20
next year, release 350 Palestinian political prisoners by
October 8 and start final status talks on September 13.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of Palestinian prisoners of 200 were freed last
Thursday, a day ahead of time, and the first-stage land transfer
also took place three days ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
The first-stage handover does not require troops
redeployment. The land in question has no Israeli military bases.
</P>
<P>
The ensuing two phases on November 15 and January 20 will
involve troops redeployment from areas mainly lying between Nablus
and Ramallah, the two cities in the West Bank under the PNA
control.
</P>
<P>
During the second phase, 2 percent of the West Bank land will
come under full Palestinian control. In other words, it will
become Area A, from Area B, over which the Palestinians exercise
civil power and Israel has security rule. In the same phase, 3
percent will be turned from fully-Israeli-controlled Area C to
Area B.
</P>
<P>
During the third stage, 1 percent land will be turned from Area
C to Area A and 5.1 percent from Area B to Area A.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Pays Landmark Visit to Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein arrived here Monday on an official visit to Lebanon, the
first by a Hashemite monarch in almost 35 years.
</P>
<P>
The visit came following an invitation by Lebanese President
Emile Lahoud during his visit to Jordan in May.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit, the king will hold talks with
Lahoud, House Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Salim Hoss on
bilateral ties and regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said the king's visit will open new horizon
for Lebanese-Jordanian relations, which cooled after the late
Jordanian King Hussein signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its main power broker Syria have territorial
disputes with Israel which is occupying Syria's Golan Heights and
a border strip in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Jordan and Lebanon has been improving, especially
after Syrian President Haffez Assad attended the late King
Hussein's funeral in February and Abdullah visited Damascus in
April.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has been following the foreign policy of Syria, which
is ostensibly stationing 35,000 troops in Lebanon to help maintain
its post-civil-war stability.

<HEADLINE> Australia Wants More Powers for Peacekeepers in E.Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer said Monday he would push for an Australian-led
peacekeeping force in East Timor to have greater powers than U.N.
soldiers had in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Downer said he wanted a strongly-worded United Nations Security
Council resolution which would provide guidelines for troop
operations on the strife-torn territory.
</P>
<P>
But he would not specify what powers Australian soldiers should
have on the ground in East Timor before Tuesday's U.N. Security
Council meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Given the situation in East Timor, given the high level of
risk to our soldiers and to the peacekeeping force in general...we
would obviously want a fairly robust security resolution...we
would want a strong resolution," Downer told reporters before
boarding a flight to New York.
</P>
<P>
"The last thing we would want would be a peacekeeping force
that ended up like the U.N. peacekeeping force in Bosnia, where
you had the really appalling scenes...of peacekeepers being
chained up and not able to move," he added.
</P>
<P>
Downer said he hoped to receive the undertaking on Tuesday to
speed up the deployment of Australian troops to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"We have got to get the Security Council resolution...we hope
to do that on Tuesday and once that has been done then we can move
fairly quickly to deployment," Downer told reporters.

<HEADLINE> China Breeding Super Hybrid Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Yuan Longping, who is known
as the "father of hybrid rice", announced here today that his
hybrid rice research center has developed a super high-yield
hybrid rice.
</P>
<P>
Yuan, whose hybrid rice has added some 300 billion kg of grain
in China over the past 20 years, made the announcement after 12,
000 kg of grain per hectare was produced on a dozen experimental
fields in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Yunnan, and Guangdong
provinces in three executive years.
</P>
<P>
The record yield of 17,055 kg per hectare was registered in
Yongsheng County in Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
The results have been confirmed by the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Super rice yields are 30 percent higher than those of common
rice, according to Xin Naiquan, of the Academy of Agricultural
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Agronomists have been trying to increase rice yields to prepare
for the population explosion that is expected next century. The
first super rice breeding program began in Japan in 1981 but has
not proven successful. The International Rice Research Institute
then started the super rice program in 1989 to develop 12,000 kg
of rice per hectare by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Yuan's center began the Ministry of Agriculture's super rice
program in 1996 to increase per hectare yield to 10,500 kg by 2000,
and the goal has been reached before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Hybrid rice has been planted on some 200 million hectares in
China and has been introduced into some 20 countries and regions.

ample stocks of currency notes to meet that demand," the report
added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: OPEC Firm on Output Cut Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Still facing a high
global crude inventory, members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), have vowed to maintain their March
output reduction agreement in a bid to stabilize the world oil
market.
</P>
<P>
OPEC Chairman and Algerian Energy and Mining Minister Yousuf
Al-Yousfi, who is now on a Gulf tour, on Sunday ruled out an
OPEC emergency meeting to discuss the rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival for a two-day visit to Kuwait, Yousfi said that
based on the experts' views at OPEC and other indicators, the
11-member cartel has no plan to hold any emergency session before
March 2000 to reconsider the present output cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
OPEC members and non-OPEC producers agreed last March to slash
their daily output by 2.1 million barrels, in an effort to shore
up the flagging oil prices, which hit a decade-low at the start
of this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kuwaiti Oil Minister Saud Nasser Al-Sabah also
said OPEC would not act on future production policy until
the next ministerial meeting due in March 2000.
</P>
<P>
Saud, whose country is also an OPEC member, said the March
accord was signed by all members and there was no intention to
hold any meeting to reconsider the agreement before next March.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and
non-OPEC Mexico also pledged to maintain their production
cutbacks until next year.
</P>
<P>
At present, Iran's Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zangheneh is in
Saudi Arabia on a visit over OPEC's policy ahead of the
organization's meeting in Vienna later this month.
</P>
<P>
Iran is OPEC's second biggest producer after Saudi Arabia,
with current production of about 3.7 million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Since oil producers began to implement the March agreement on
April 1, oil prices have posted significant gains. Oil prices in
London hit a 32-month high last week, with the benchmark Brent
crude reaching over 23 U.S. dollars per barrel at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
However, OPEC members have so far not been overwhelmed by
the surging oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Oil officials and experts have said that oil producers are
standing firm mainly because of the building-up stockpiles in
major oil markets.
</P>
<P>
Yousfi said during his visit in the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) that he had "agreed with oil officials that world oil
storage is still very high," which is a leading concern for
OPEC member states.
</P>
<P>
He said the high stockpiles are not expected to disappear
before March next year.
</P>
<P>
According to OPEC's latest monthly report, oil stocks in the
world's main markets are still picking up in May and June.
</P>
<P>
Statistics in the report showed that the U.S. commercial
oil stocks were 1,072.0 million barrels in May, up 18.4
million barrels compared to April.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. storage has reached 1,090.0 million barrels on
June 4, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The commercial oil stocks in Western Europe, the report said,
witnessed an increase of 8.9 million barrels, to 1,151.0 million
barrels in May.
</P>
<P>
Oil inventories in Japan also recorded a rise of 800,000
barrels in May, the OPEC report added.
</P>
<P>
Oil producers, especially the oil-rich Gulf states, whose
national revenues were drastically reduced following the plunging
of oil prices, also worry that a retreat from the current
quota policy will result in a quick dive of oil prices.
</P>
<P>
OPEC members, who often have difficulty in reaching a
happy-to-all oil policy, are also believed to be reluctant to
give up the hard-struck consensus.

<HEADLINE> City Games to Produce Some Budding Stars Eligible for Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, China, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The track and field
competitions to be started tomorrow, are expected to produce some
budding stars eligible for the Olympics, said a top sports
official here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Women middle and long-distance runners and some players in the
track events may produce satisfactory results to be ranked in the
top ten of the year in the world," said Shang Xiutang, secretary
general of the Chinese Athletics Association.
</P>
<P>
"And those young athletes with good results thus become
eligible for the 2000 Olympic Games," Shang said at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Shang explained that his prediction was based on the different
competitive atmosphere at home and the performances of Chinese
athletes in the World Athletics Championships in Spain last August.
</P>
<P>
"Due to full preparation, good results are expected from the
javelin, discus, long jump and the women's 1,500m, 5,000m and 10,
000m races, and some results may even rank among the top three of
the year in the world," the Chinese athletics chief said.
</P>
<P>
However, the overall level of comptition is not expected to be
high enough as the City Games was conceived as a cradle for
budding stars with potentials as only athletes under 20 are
eligible, he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 607 athletes from 45 delegations including Hong Kong
Speacial Administrative Region, will vie for the 43 gold medals at
stake in the five-day athletics competitions.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Political Confrontation Escalates in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A three-day countrywide hartal
(destructive strike) staged by Bangladesh's opposition alliance
started Monday following a sit-in program on Sunday around the
Secretariat in central Dhaka which houses the country's
government.
</P>
<P>
The shutdown, the 10th of its kind this year, was organized to
protest against what the opposition said "police excesses and
attack" on opposition leaders, activists and supporters during
their sit-in program, during some 400 people were reportedly
injured and over 100 arrested.
</P>
<P>
"We planned to hold a peaceful demonstration despite all sorts
of provocation," Vice-chairman of the major opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) and Deputy Leader of the Opposition in
Parliament A.Q.M. Badruddoza Chowdhury said.
</P>
<P>
While the opposition said the sit-in was meant to be "peaceful"
to press home their demand for cancellation of a government
decision to grant "transit" to India, Home Minister Mohammad Nasim
accused the opposition parties of "hiring terrorists and
miscreants for creating anarchy and unrest in the capital."
</P>
<P>
The government "is determined to act tough on those unleashing
anarchy and terrorism in the name of hartal and siege," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a joint declaration after the sit-in, the four-party
alliance comprising the BNP, the Jatiya Party, the Jamaat-e-Islam
and the Islami Oikya Jote demanded immediate resignation of the
government and immediate general elections.
</P>
<P>
To justify their plea for snap polls, they blamed the Awami
League government for pushing the country toward a catastrophe by
signing agreements one after another against national interest.
"The government has lost the right to stay in power after today's
(Sunday's) act of cruelty and barbarism," Chowdhury said.
</P>
<P>
"The government has totally destroyed the atmosphere for all
democratic means of protest, which has forced us to go for a
three-day hartal," BNP Secretary General Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan
said.
</P>
<P>
In late July, the opposition alliance led by the BNP announced
that they would organize more road marches to muster support
against what they called the government's "misrule."
</P>
<P>
And after completing the proposed road marches in August and
September, the alliance also planned to announce the "Dhaka Siege"
program on November 7 to dislodge the Awami League government.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here are of the view that the political
atmosphere in the country has become hot gradually and will reach
its climax in November if the opposition's "Dhaka siege" program
is observed as planned.
</P>
<P>
They fear that more stoppages will follow in the coming months
and a showdown between the opposition and ruling parties is
inevitable.

<HEADLINE> Integration in Africa Helps Resolve Conflicts: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has said that political integration could give a
fillip to sort out many persistent conflicts in the African
continent.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to journalists at an airport in Kenyan capital, Mkapa
said he supported the notion of African Unity as he believes that
if visible steps of greater political integration in Africa are
taken, many conflicts facing the continent will be resolved.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa who made a stopover Sunday in Nairobi en route
to Boston at the start of a 12-day working visit to the United
States, was commenting on the recent Organization of African Unity
(OAU) special summit held in Sirte, Libya whose agenda centered on
the United States of Africa.
</P>
<P>
!0The meeting in Sirte represented an important landmark
towards the formation of the United States of Africa,!1 Mkapa said
at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued Monday by Geoffrey Nkurlu,
the press secretary to the president from Boston, Mkapa said at
the airport that when countries unite, the likelihood of their
going to war is reduced and that is one of the rationale of
establishing the union.
</P>
<P>
!0I think we have taken cognizance of the reality that there is
a lot of activities in the field of economic integration but we
have somewhat been slow in the movement towards political
integration,!1 the statement quoted the president as saying.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa who is accompanied by the First Lady, Anna
Mkapa, said the decision to get the ministers to study what can be
done to realize a political integration on African continent
during the next few months or so is a very important decision
indeed.
</P>
<P>
He added that it would be unlikely for one country to take
unilateral actions that could raise animosities or create
misunderstanding among states. He said, as the fruits of
co-operation become more and more evident there will be a greater
will for states to surrender more and more sovereignty
subsequently reaching a situation of complete union in the end.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether this movement is too ambitious, President Mkapa
responded in affirmative but said, !0 We all want to attain higher
and higher heights of co-operation!- and what you require is the
will to surrender some amount of sovereignty to have collective
decisions rather than individual ones.!1
</P>
<P>
The President and his entourage were met at the Airport by
Kenya!/s Minister for Lands and Settlement, Joseph Nyagha.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa also met and held brief talks with President Yoweri
Museveni of Uganda who was on his way home after attending the
Sirte Summit in Libya.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam hopes for stabilization
of the situation in East Timor and will not send any forces to
take part in the international peacekeeping force in East Timor,
said a spokesperson of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The spokesperson made the remarks here Monday in answer to a

closely following the current development of the situation in East
Timor and hopes that the situation in East Timor would soon be
stabilized, thus creating a favorable atmosphere for a lasting
solution acceptable to all concerned parties and contributing to
consolidating peace, stability, cooperation and development in
Southeast Asia and the world.
</P>
<P>
As for whether or not Vietnam takes part in the international
peacekeeping force in East Timor, the spokesperson said that
attending the peacekeeping force is a too new problem to Vietnam
which has never sent its forces to take part in peacekeeping
forces and has no experience in such activities.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Meets President of French Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- China and France should make
joint efforts to help the growth of bilateral relations that will
benefit both sides, said Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), at a meeting with a Senate of France
delegation headed by its president Christian Poncelet.
</P>
<P>
Li told Poncelet, who arrived here Monday for a six-day
official visit, that the two countries have every reason to
increase exchanges, learn from each other, and push forward the
long-cherished friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several centuries, French civilization has had
great influence upon the world. A large number of Chinese youths,
including late revolutionary leaders Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping,
went to France for study in the past, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Li said, China is preparing to celebrate its 50th
founding anniversary with an aim to sum up the past experience and
to inspire the enthusiasm of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Poncelet expressed congratulations on the 50th anniversary on
behalf of the French president and government.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC chairman said that although China has achieved great
success since it adopted the policy of reform and opening to the
outside world, it remains relatively backward and still needs to
make long-term efforts to catch up with developed nations like
France.
</P>
<P>
It is the sinere hope of both the Chinese government and the
Chinese people that there will be a stable domestic environment
and a peaceful and tranquil international environment so that they
can concentrate on economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Poncelet said that the French government pays great attention
to cultural exchanges and economic cooperation with China, and the
two sides should increase cooperation in the areas of economy,
industry and trade.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.S., Britain of Blocking Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Trade Ministry on
Monday accused the U.S. and British representatives at the U.N.
Sanctions Committee of suspending seven of its contracts at the
committee's latest sessions.
</P>
<P>
An authorized source in the ministry told the Iraqi News
Agency that during the Sanctions Committee's sessions held on
September 9-10, the U.S. and British envoys suspended seven Iraqi
contracts to purchase spare parts for the electricity and oil
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the U.S. envoy at the Sanctions Committee
suspended six contracts for the purchase of spare parts for the
electricity sector that Iraq signed with French, Swiss, Italian,
Austrian and Indian companies.
</P>
<P>
He added that the British envoy at the committee suspended a
contract that Iraq signed with a Russian company for the purchase
of spare parts for its oil sector.
</P>
<P>
These contracts were signed under the U.N.-Iraq oil-for-food
program, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, now in its sixth phase, Iraq
is allowed to export limited amount of oil in every six
months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies for
its 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
Since the fourth phase of the deal, the ceiling of the
amount of oil Iraq is allowed to sell has been raised to
5.2 billion dollars from 2 billion dollars for the first three
phases.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long accused the U.S. and British envoys at
the Sanctions Committee of hampering the endorsement of its
contracts, arguing that the oil-for-food deal has failed to
alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Promote Renewable Biomass Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is encouraging
use of renewable biomass for power generation because of its high
potentials.
</P>
<P>
The wood processing industry and agro-industries, primarily the
palm oil sector, will be instrumental in realizing the largely
untapped biomass in the country and co-generation potential, said
Energy, Communications and Multimedia Minister Leo Moggie at a
seminar here Monday.
</P>
<P>
A private study estimated that empty fruit branches of the palm
oil industry in the country alone has an annual potential of two
million ton oil equivalent (MTOE), which could be translated to an
electricity generation capacity of about 2,000 megawatts, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wood in the form of sawmill residues and rice husks have
another annual potential of 0.38 MTOE and 0.144 MTOE, Moggie said,
adding however the weakness of biomass as fuel in energy
production was its low heat value, making its collection and
transport costs high even in the most promising areas.

<HEADLINE> Fund Managers, Financial Analysts Positive on Malaysia's Recovery: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Fund managers and
financial analysts are positive on the status of the Malaysian
economy, clearing the doubts over the country's economic recovery,
a recent survey by Malaysia's National Economic Action Council
(NEAC) revealed.
</P>
<P>
The NEAC survey, participated by 40 of the 50 local and foreign
fund managers and financial analysts, showed that 65 percent of
the respondents had positive sentiments, with 15 percent being
very positive, over the status of the Malaysian economy, NEAC said
in a statement released Monday.
</P>
<P>
On Malaysia's gross domestic product (GDP) forecast, all
respondents predicted positive growth with 75 percent registering
2 to 3 percent growth and above, NEAC said.
</P>
<P>
It said 92 percent of respondents believed Malaysia's economic
recovery was sustainable and rated its progress in dealing with
bank recapitalization and non-performing loans as the most
successful compared to other crisis-hit countries such as South
Korea, Thailand and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
NEAC said that to achieve sustainable long-term growth, the
respondents outlined three main challenges that Malaysia faces,
that is, to improve productivity and competitiveness, improve
efforts towards corporate restructuring and be resilient to the
influence of external factors, namely, the economic performance of
Japan, the United States and China.
</P>
<P>
On the Malaysian government's push to consolidate the financial
sector, 68 percent of the respondents viewed the bank merger
exercise as positive, saying that it is consistent with the
worldwide consolidation trend.
</P>
<P>
They believed that it is necessary to prepare for future market
liberalization and that Malaysia is currently over-banked and
should take steps to achieve cost and resource savings arising
from the economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
However, respondents felt that Malaysia needs to improve in the
areas of corporate governance and corporate restructuring which
would serve to attract more foreign portfolio investments into the
country, NEAC said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Revises Down Power Output Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has
decided to revise down the country's power output target of this
year because of slackening consumption.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Ministry of Planning and Investment has agreed to a
proposal by Electricity of Vietnam (EVN) to revise down the year's
power output target, according to a report of Vietnam's English
newspaper The Saigon Times Daily on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the EVN set a target of producing and buying a
total power of 24.38 billion kilowatt hours, but now wants to
adjust it down to 23.47 billion kilowatt hours and reduce the
year's sales target to 19.18 billion kilowatt hours from 19.88
billion.
</P>
<P>
The regional financial and economic crisis has resulted in a
business slowdown in the country, which has in turn affected power
consumption, and that early rain has eased electricity demand,
said EVN.
</P>
<P>
The EVN is expected to cut annual power production from 27
billion kilowatt hours to less than 26 billion next year.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the current consumption level, the domestic
demand for power should be met by 2005 when the power plants now
under construction are commissioned.
</P>
<P>
In this period, new power projects will not be encouraged to
avoid oversupply.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia to Fight Against Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A five-day anti-corruption
seminar began here Monday, aimed at adopting an action plan to
reduce and prevent all form of corruption as well as to raise the
confidence of the investors.
</P>
<P>
"Corruption is a virulent disease that destroys society and
obliterates structures of the current and future economy of a
country," Prince Norodom Ranariddh, president of the National
Assembly, said in his opening speech.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that bribery among government officials is a
serious issue which will defame and weaken not only the national
economy, but also the whole country.
</P>
<P>
Prince Ranariddh said that the royal government will take up
some measures to reduce and eliminate the corruption as promised
in its political platform.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey by the Center for Social Development
(CSD), although corruption is widely accepted as customary
Cambodians are, almost unanimously, in agreement that corruption
should be ended, and a large majority believe that high level
corruption is more important to stop.
</P>
<P>
Corruption, Ranariddh said, "is also a great obstacle to the
development of Cambodia."
</P>
<P>
He also warned that Cambodia is not a very interesting place to
invest any more, citing that the labor is not as cheap as before,
energy is very high as well as the cost of telecommunication, and
there are a lot of red tapes which mean corruption.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts maintained that the corruption is becoming a main
hurdle to the future development and success of Cambodia.
"Corruption is a worldwide phenomenon," acknowledged a CSD
official, "but in Cambodia corruption is institutionalized from
bottom to top, top to bottom."
</P>
<P>
"The Royal Government of Cambodia regarded the anti-corruption
campaign as one of the main priorities... We must take strict
measures to control and penalize the people who commit
corruption," Khun Kaing, minister of the Ministry of National
Assembly - Senate and Inspection, said at his welcoming speech.
</P>
<P>
The prince also said that he believed that after the seminar, a
resolution will be adopted and will be translated into concrete
measures to tackle the corruption. But at the same time, he
stressed that "only having a law is not enough, the law has to be
implemented and in the most efficient manner. Otherwise, it will
be useless and more dangerous for the country."

<HEADLINE> EU Formally Lifts Sanctions off Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) foreign
ministers agreed to lift sanctions imposed on Libya when they met
here for a regular general affairs meeting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The minister from 15 EU member states made the decision without
further debate to revoke the restrictions of free travel of Libyan
diplomatic and consular staff, personnel scale in EU diplomatic
missions and the policy on issuing visas to Libyan citizens.
</P>
<P>
The EU said the decision reflects "a report the UN secretary-
general issued on June 30, referring to various factors to suggest
that recent actions by the Libyan authorities indicate a
renunciation of terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Libya agreed with the United States and
Britain to hand over to the Dutch authorities two Libyans
suspected of involvement in the bombing of a Pan Am passenger
plane over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988. The Libyan
government has also agreed to cooperate with the French legal
authorities investigating a bomb attack against a UTA plane, EU
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The EU is going to urge its Mediterranean partners to accept
Libya's participation in the Barcelona process, a EU-launched
cooperation agreement between EU members and Mediterranean
countries.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Entrusts U.N. to Organize Peacekeeping Force: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Monday said the government entrusts the U.N. Security
Council to organize a peacekeeping force to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"All of these will be discussed in New York. Today, Foreign
Minister (Ali Alatas) is expected to arrive (there) to discuss
with U.N. Secretary-General (Kofi Annan) the criteria and whoever
(will join the peacekeeping force)," Habibie told reporters after
a consultation meeting with House of Representatives (DPR) leaders
here.
</P>
<P>
The head of state said he fully entrusts the U.N. Security
Council to decide which countries could join the U.N. peacekeeping
force after consulting with Alatas.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Australia and Portugal will joint the force,
Habibie said: "I entrust the assessment of this to the U.N. I will
not mention which countries (could join the force)."
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that Indonesia is not embroiled in war with
any country.
</P>
<P>
"All are our friends. I must explain that based on reality,
Indonesia is not at war with any nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Habibie's meeting with the DPR leaders came the day after he
announced that he would allow U.N. peacekeeping force to restore
order in East Timor which fell into chaos soon after the
announcement of a landslide victory of the pro-independence choice
in the August 30 direct ballot.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, leaders of the DPR and its factions
endorsed the government policy to accept a U.N. peacekeeping force
to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"After listening to the president's explanation, the leadership
of the House and House factions expressed understanding of the
government policy," House Speaker Harmoko said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Antara News Agency, most personnel of the U.N.
Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) will return to their respective
countries on Tuesday but ten will continue the mission's work in
the troubled territory.
</P>
<P>
The UNAMET staff members will depart in face of the proposed
deployment of an international peacekeeping force in the
territory, Antara said.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976, but the move has never been recognized by the
U.N.

<HEADLINE> Ma Junren Shy of Media in Chinese City Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, China, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Well-known track coach
Ma Junren caved in an unknown lodging place to keep away from the
media as the athletics competitions will start on Tuesday at the
fourth Chinese City Games.
</P>
<P>
Ma Junren, known for his Ma's Army who broke a series of world
records in 1993 at home and abroad, only made a brief appearance
at the Shaanxi Sports Complex after his arrival here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm neither a coach nor an official, I'm only a visitor here
without any official function for the Dalian delegation," said Ma
in a T-shirt at the stands, whose show-up attracted a flock of
reporters awaiting at the place.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know whether athletes from Dalian can triumph
eventually in the City Games, but it's still meaningful for them
to compete in the Games even if they fail to win golds," said Ma,
vice director of the Liaoning Provincial Physical Culture and
Sports Commission, and also head of the Liaoning Women's Middle
and Long-Distance Training Center.
</P>
<P>
Officials from Dalian declined to reveal the whereabouts of Ma
Junren, and kept a low key in predicting the prospect for their
athletes in the Games.
</P>
<P>
However, Ma's top two women runners of Jiang Bo and Dong Yanmei
were left at home, leaving Lan Lixin, the 1,500-meter world junior
champion, as the biggest star in the track squad of Dalian, who
clocked 4:10.05 in France in July, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Bo, who missed the July trials, broke the 5,000-meter
world junior record in the previous City Games in 1995 and Dong
Yanmei who had a poor show in the trials, clocked a new world
record of 14:29.82 in the women's 5,000-meters in the 1997 Chinese
National Games.
</P>
<P>
Yet, officials from Dalian still pin their hope for the gold
medals from the women's 5,000m and 10,000m while Ma's string of
disciples will also battle in the field events of men's high jump,
both the men's and women's hurdles.
</P>
<P>
Ma Junren stole the limelight in the world track arena in 1993
when his women runners took titles in the 1993 world championships
in Stuttgart, Germany with two games records.
</P>
<P>
In September, 1993, three world records were created by his
disciples, including Wang Junxia and Qu Yunxia, in the 1,500m, 3,
000m and 10,000m races at the seventh Chinese National Games in
Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Increase Aid for Poverty Relief in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain would increase its
humanitarian aid for poverty eradication in India, British High
Commissioner to India Sir Rob Young announced here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Young said that his country would increase its aid for poverty
relief projects in India by 30 percent to 130 million pounds (215
million U.S. dollars) by the year 2001-2002 from the current 99.5
million pounds (162 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He told the press that development assistance from his country
would be focused on the internationally agreed target of reducing
by half the proportion of people living in extreme poverty by the
year 2015.
</P>
<P>
One of every three people in India of nearly one billion is
officially poor and two of three are under-nourished or
malnourished.
</P>
<P>
The poverty relief aid will be provided by the British
Department for International Development (DFID), which has already
committed 66.21 million pounds (107.7 million U.S. dollars) for
2000-2001 and 50.06 million pounds (81.5 million U.S. dollars) for
2001-2002.
</P>
<P>
According to DFID's India Country Strategy paper released by
Young, DFID has planned to disburse 108.70 million pounds (177
million U.S. dollars) in 2000-2001 and 127.75 million pounds (208
million U.S. dollars) in 2001-2002.
</P>
<P>
DFID's director general Barrie Ireton said that a key part of
DFID's new approach "is a focus on developing partnerships with
selected state governments to tackle poverty more effectively".

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Meets Japanese Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Chinese National People's Congress Standing Committee, said here
today that further friendly cooperation between China and Japan
will benefit the two countries and Asia as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks at a meeting with a delegation of the Japan-
China Economic Relations and Trade Center (JCERTC), headed by
Honorary Chairman Kimura Ichizo and Chairman Miyoshi Toshio of the
center.
</P>
<P>
Li said the JCERTC has made great contribution to the
normalization of bilateral relations, the promotion of economic
and trade cooperation, and the deepening of mutual understanding
since it was founded 45 years ago.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan are close neighbors, and it is in the interest
of the two countries and Asia as a whole to expand bilateral
economic and trade cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit, Li said. He expressed the hope the JCERTC would increase
its cooperation with China in investment, science, technology,

<HEADLINE> Ten Parks in Beijing Preparing for National Day Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's ten major parks are
busy preparing for a five-day tour program as part of the mass
activities to celebrate the 50th founding anniversary of New China,
an official said today.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands banners, a million of flowers and 80 big
flower terraces will redecorate the 10 selected parks, where two
million local residents are expected to go to spend their National
Day holidays during October 1-5, according to Feng Shouren,
executive deputy chief director of the National Day park tour
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The ten parks, which are in the easy reach of urban residents,
are the Summer Palace, Zhongshan Park, Working People's Palace of
Culture, Beihai Park, Jingshan Park, Yuyuantan Park, Tiantan Park,
Grand View Garden, Chinese Ethnic Group Theme Park and World Park,
Feng told at a press conference organized by All-China Journalists
Association.
</P>
<P>
"People are free to buy tickets and join the park tour this
year," he said. Such kind of activities used to be organized and
require special invitation cards.
</P>
<P>
The theme of this year's park tour differs from one park from
another, he said. For example, dragon boat race and colorful boats
will come in the limelight in the water-surrounded Summer Palace.
</P>
<P>
According to him, 20 stage shows and 120 spots for mass
cultural activities will be available in the ten parks.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Countries to Invest Heavily in Oil Fields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Four Gulf oil producers are
expected to spend 125 billion U.S. dollars on developing their oil
fields in the next 10 years, according to a report by a bank of the
United Arab Emirate (UAE).
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by the National Bank of Dubai, the second
largest emirate of the UAE, said the four oil producers, namely,
the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar, will produce 129 million
barrels per day to meet 32 percent of the world oil demand by the
year 2010.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2020, the four Gulf countries will be able to
supply 45 percent of the world oil needs, the report said.
</P>
<P>
As the Gulf countries depend on oil as the main source of their
revenues, investment in oil is expected to compete with that in
education, health, services and social programs in government
spending, the study said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that other financing options may be considered,
including borrowing from international markets or allowing foreign
ownership of the oil industry.

<HEADLINE> China Satisfied With Results of APEC Meeting: Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, New Zealand, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan said here Monday that China is satisfied
with the results of the seventh informal meeting of leaders of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.
</P>
<P>
Tang made the statement at a press conference two hours after
the two-day APEC leaders meeting concluded here with the adoption
of a leaders' declaration focusing on major tasks and the role of
APEC in future.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that the APEC leaders who participated in the meeting
expressed their optimism about the status quo and outlook of
economic recovery in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
They saw the need for APEC members to strengthen cooperation
and accelerate economic restructuring, reinforce the momentum of
economic recovery, and lay the foundation for the long-term
development of the region's economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the leaders reviewed and summed up the
experience of APEC in the past decade, and emphasized that in
future, APEC trade and investment liberalism and economic-
technological cooperation (ECOTEC) should develop in a balanced
fashion.
</P>
<P>
The leaders emphasized the importance of fully implementing the
existing agreements of the Uruguay Round of WTO trade negotiations,
held that the WTO negotiations should fully reflect and
accommodate the interests and demands of the developing members,
and expressed their support for accelerating the accession of non-
WTO members of APEC.
</P>
<P>
In the declaration adopted at the meeting Monday, the APEC
leaders committed themselves to giving the "strongest possible
support" in Seattle to the launch of a new round of multilateral
negotiations within the WTO in November.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also agreed to seek early progress in the accession
negotiations to the WTO, including for those APEC member economies
that are not yet WTO members.
</P>
<P>
The leaders issued a strong call for these accession
negotiations to be concluded at the earliest opportunity, if
possible, prior to the start of the new round of WTO negotiations.
Of the 21 APEC members, only China, Russia, Vietnam and Chinese
Taipei are not WTO members.
</P>
<P>
At the leaders' meeting, it was emphasized that ECOTEC is of
great significance to economic recovery and growth in the region.
"APEC should take concrete actions to implement the relevant
initiatives adopted by the leaders," Tang said. "Cooperation
should be strengthened in such fields as human resource
development and the building of infrastructures," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Assistance should be given to developing members to improve
their level and capacity of economic development, so as to fulfill
the APEC goal of reducing economic disparity among its members,
and achieving common prosperity," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that the keynote speech delivered at the meeting by
Chinese President Jiang Zemin was well received.
</P>
<P>
In the keynote speech, Jiang pointed out that it is imperative
that APEC actively deepen regional, economic and technological
cooperation, positively and prudently press for trade and
investment liberalization, work for a healthy development of a
multilateral trading system, vigorously strengthen international
cooperation in the
financial field and contribute to economic recovery and
development in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on the future direction and role of APEC,
Tang said that APEC should continue to maintain its nature as an
economic forum, its diversity and flexibility should be maintained,
and trade and investment liberalism and economic-technological
cooperation should be balanced.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Tang also answered questions raised by
reporters on Sino-U.S. relations, the issue of Taiwan and that of

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Labor Market Improves in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's labor market
improved in tandem with the strong pickup in economic activities
with total employment rising for the first time in the second
quarter of 1999 after declining for four consecutive quarters,
says a report published Monday by the Manpower Research and
Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that total employment rose by 15,532 in the
second quarter of 1999 after four consecutive quarters of decline
with strong employment gains registered in services and
manufacturing sectors and continued contraction in the
construction sector.
</P>
<P>
The document says with the recovery in the economy in recent
months, the underlying unemployment continued to trend downwards
with retrenchments remaining moderate at 3,350 workers, close to
the 3,402 laid off in the earlier quarter but significantly lower
than the average of 7,300 per quarter in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In line with the improved labor market, there was an increase
in the re-employment rate of retrenched workers, it adds.
</P>
<P>
It notes that the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate eased
further to 3.3 percent in June 1999 from 3.9 percent in March 1999
and 4.4 percent in December 1998 but it was still off the
pre-crisis level of around 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report says as employers try to recruit additional workers
to cope with increased demand, the number of job vacancies rose to
19,299 as at June 1999 from 16.744 three months ago and vacancy
rate (i.e. vacancies expressed as a percentage of the total staff
demand) also edged up correspondingly to 2 percent in June 1999
from 1.8 percent in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
On employment outlook, it says the employment outlook for the
third quarter of 1999 will be more favorable than in earlier few
quarters and more companies in services and manufacturing sectors
are expected to hire workers.
</P>
<P>
However it expects outlook in the disk drive industry is
cautious as companies anticipate corporate restructuring amidst
intensive price and cost pressures, and there would still be
retrenchments as businesses upgrade, restructure or relocate to
remain competitive in response to the rapid pace of globalization
and technological advances.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Party Daily Slams U.S. Report on Religion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese Communist
Party's daily Nhan Dan (The People) Monday carried a commentary on
the U.S. report on world religious situation, saying that no one
should use religion to interfere in other country's internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
The daily made the comment following the release on September
10 of an annual report by the U.S. State Department on the
religious situation in 196 countries, which groundlessly condemned
a number of countries, including Vietnam, for violating the
freedom of religion.
</P>
<P>
Nhan Dan noted that Vietnamese religious believers have always
been free to practice their beliefs. This has always been the
stance of the party and state of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The state of Vietnam respects the freedom of religion as well
as the freedom of non-religion of the citizens, the paper
affirmed.
</P>
<P>
"Any attempt to use religion to cause public disorder and
social instability, undermine the national independence and
national unity of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, will be
punished in accordance with the law," Nhan Dan said, adding that
this is the responsibility of each state towards its own people
and there is no room for outside interference.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese daily stressed that "no one has the right to
preach down or preach up to the world about human rights and
religious freedom. This is an unacceptable action running counter
to the basic principles of international law."

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Parliament Rejects Participation of Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, U.S. in Peacekeeping Force to E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian House of
Representatives (DPR) Commission I for security, law and foreign
affairs Monday urged the government to reject Australia, New
Zealand, Portugal and the United States in participating in the
U.N.-sponsored peacekeeping force contingent members for the
troubled territory of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Those countries have shown their unneutrality on East Timor
case, Chairman of the House commission I Aisyah told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
She said Indonesia should prefer Asian and ASEAN (Association
of South East Asian Nations) such as Malaysia, the Philippines and
Japan to be members of the U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
President B.J. Habibie announced here Sunday evening that his
government accepted the presence of U.N.-sponsored international
peacekeeping force in cooperation with the country's military to
restore order and security in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
After the announcement, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas
left here Sunday night for New York to discuss the arrangement for
the sending of the U.N. peacekeeping force to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The discussion will include which countries will join the
peacekeeping force and who will finance the U.N. actions in East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday morning, Indonesian Home Affairs Minister
Syarwan Hamid said the Indonesian government would leave the
composition of the U.N. peacekeeping contingent members up to the
U.N. decision and if they decide to have Australia in the
peacekeepers, Indonesia will welcome.
</P>
<P>
Violence has taken place since the announcement of the August
30 ballot result in East Timor by the United Nations on September
4. The result showed over 78 percent of the total East Timorese
voters favored independence.
</P>
<P>
Although the Indonesian military declared a status of emergency
in East Timor on September 7, the violence has not been stopped
completely. Reports said more than 100 people have been killed and
tens of thousands of houses have been burned down.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976, but the move has never been recognized by the
United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Good Prospect for China's Textile Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- China's textile industry,
which reported a decline in exports in the first six months of
this year, will have a good chance to recover with adjustment of
its product structure and the globalization of world trade,
experts said today.
</P>
<P>
Figures from a recent national conference organized by the
China Chamber of Commerce for Textile Products show that China's
exports of textiles were 82.94 billion U.S. dollars during the
January-June period this year, down 4.6 percent on an annual basis,
and garment exports sustained a 20 percent drop to 16.2 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Inside sources attributed the decrease to the unfavorable
economic environment at home and abroad and the anti-dumping and
other restrictive policies adopted by some countries.
</P>
<P>
China has become the world's largest textile producer, and its
textile exports increased from 6.44 billion dollars in 1985 to 45.
6 billion dollars in 1997, representing an average annual growth
rate of 17.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the country's textile export will grow by
50 million dollars a year if its entry to the World Trade
Organization is approved.
</P>
<P>
Experts have called for further reform of state-owned textile
enterprises and the development of non-state enterprises to
enhance their competitive strength in the world market.

for cooperation in three aspects: rural infrastructure
development, dissemination of technological advances (food-related
technology transfer) and the promotion of trade in food products.
</P>
<P>
In supporting the proposal, Estrada also stressed the
importance of undertaking capacity-building measures to enable
developing economies to meet the challenges posed by the APEC Food
System.
</P>
<P>
"Unless developing economies are able to build on their
production, processing and marketing capabilities, they will not
be able to contribute to the envisioned APEC Food System," Estrada
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that opportunities should also be provided to the
farmers, "to supplement their income from non-farm sources so they
can rise above poverty."
</P>
<P>
He warned that "without these opportunities, their (farmers')
option is to migrate to our already strained big cities," as has
been the case in many countries that have squatting problems.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also explained that the proposal for rural
infrastructure development under the APEC Food System "determines
how much one can rely on rural non-farm activity."
</P>
<P>
"The basic infrastructure that forms the base of a sustainable
food system also supports a far wider range of economic
activities. Information technology infrastructure, in particular,
allows rural communities to reach the global marketplace," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from this, the president said information technology
infrastructure also leads to expanded job creation in rural
communities by providing the technological backbone that permits
business to operate outside of major urban centers.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, he said "the challenge ahead is to create an
environment that is conducive to private sector investment and
innovation. Otherwise, business will continue to remain in the big
 cities."

<HEADLINE> Zambia Calls for Extension of Lome Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Export Board of Zambia
(EBZ) has called for the extension of duty preferences set by the
Lome Convention for another 10 years to enable the developing
countries to adjust to the new economic order.
</P>
<P>
The Post newspaper Monday quoted EBZ marketing officer Glyn
Michelo as saying that the European Union should in the interim
make resources available to the companies of developing countries
for investment, plant refurbishment and replacement of outdated
technology so as to strengthen their supply capability.
</P>
<P>
The Lome Convention on trade and economic cooperation was
signed in February 1975 by 46 countries from the
African-Caribbean-Pacific (ACP) region and nine from the European
Union (EU). It now groups some 86 countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Zambia Association of Chambers of Commerce and
Industry (ZACCI) Lome 2000 workshop held here last week, Michelo
said Zambia has benefited from the Lome Convention through
technical and financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
It has also benefited through development of non-traditional
exports including textiles, flowers, vegetables, tobacco and
paprika, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that "Zambia is a signatory to the Lome Convention
enabling her export products to enter the EU market under
preferential duty treatment or nil duty."
</P>
<P>
However, when the Lome IV Convention expires in 2000, the ACP
states will witness the disappearance of special and differential
treatment by the EU in the sectors of Official Development
Assistance (ODA) and trade, he said.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Updates with latest figure Moscow Blast Toll Reaches 40, Yeltsin Orders Stringent Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in the latest
explosion that hit Moscow early Monday has reached 40 as President
Boris Yeltsin ordered more stringent security measures around key
installations throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Clean-up operations are continuing despite findings of more
explosives in two buildings and a school nearby, the Itar-Tass
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The buildings and the school were evacuated and reporters were
kept away from the site, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
The toll is expected to rise to as many as 100, Tass said,
quoting experts. A total of 126 people were registered to be
residents of the demolished eight-story building in southeast
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin convened an emergency meeting and
ordered more stringent security measures in the next few hours
throughout Russia, especially around nuclear power plants, oil
reservoirs and other key installations, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The blast came as Russia was preparing to mark Monday as an
official day of mourning for some 150 people killed in two similar
explosions -- one in Moscow last Thursday and another earlier in
the month in the south of the country -- in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Five people were pulled alive from the wrecked building soon
after the blast at 5:00 local time (0100 GMT) Monday but since
then only corpses had been found, Emergency Ministry officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Although authorities are still investigating the causes of the
blasts, many officials believe they were staged by terrorists with
links to Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
Monday's explosion was the third in Moscow since August 31,
when a bomb went off in an underground shopping mall near the
Kremlin. One was killed and dozens were injured in that blast.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, attending a meeting of the Asia-
Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Auckland, New Zealand, has
cut his visit there and headed back home, Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
"This fact (the latest blast) cannot be called an accident
anymore. This is a crime, and nefarious at that," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
"Those who have done it cannot be called humans. They cannot be
even called beasts, and if they be called beasts, then rabid ones,
" Tass quoted Putin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Zdanovich, spokesman of the Federal Security Service,
the main successor to the Soviet KGB, described the blasts as "a
real terrorist war."

PARIS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Monday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie announced on Sunday that
his country would accept the sending of a U.N. peacekeeping force
to East Timor. The international community received the
announcement with prudence and is waiting for confirmation.
</P>
<P>
-- Neither one African head of state, nor a representative from
Western countries attended the opening ceremony of the 11th
International Conference on AIDS in Africa on Sunday in Lusaka,
Zambia, even though the disease is killing 2 million people each
year.
</P>
<P>
-- Britain unveiled the oldest spy of the former Soviet Union
in the country. Aged 87, Melita Norwood read an announcement from
her garden south of London last Saturday justifying her action "
aimed at preventing the defeat of a new system which has paid
dearly for giving education, nourishment and health care to all."
Working in the British Non-Ferrous Metals Research Association in
the 50s and 60s, she delivered many documents of nuclear secrets
to the KGB.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Indonesian President Habibie said on Sunday that Indonesia
is ready to accept an international peacekeeping force to "put an
end to the suffering of the people of East Timor immediately."
Some 15,000 peacekeepers are necessary to ensure the re-
establishment of order in the territory.
</P>
<P>
-- Two hundred years after his birth, Balzac will be reborn
Monday evening in the film of two episodes to be shown by the

writer Stefan Zweig, the film is starred by Gerard Depardieu.
</P>
<P>
-- A police operation against organized crimes in Nicaragua has
drawn attention to the presence in Latin America of several former
nationalist militants of Corsica. Among the "figures" of exiled
Corsican nationalists is Alain Orsoni, the leader of MPA, who went
to Nicaragua and opened a gambling shop before going underground
to escape police arrest.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Reshuffles Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has reshuffled top military commanders and posted
another senior officer to the troubled Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Museveni, the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, sent
First Division Commander Edson Muzoora to Kisangani to help James
Kazini, the overall commander of Ugandan's military operations in
the DRC, the New Vision paper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the reshuffle, former director of Military Intelligence
Fred Tolit was appointed as the new Second Division Commander.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the reshuffle was made soon after
President Museveni returned home from Libya and Germany Sunday
afternoon, but it failed to establish whether the reshuffle was
connected with the probe report of the August 14-17 clashes in
Kisangani between Ugandan and Rwandan troops.
</P>
<P>
There are some loopholes in the chain of command in the DRC.
That is the problem the president is trying to solve, a senior
officer was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In another report, Monitor, the most popular independent daily
in the land-locked country, said that the Military High Command
will start debating the probe report and the latest changes in
the army Monday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also review the DRC operations, and the
Uganda army's future relations with Rwanda, the newspaper report
added.
</P>
<P>
The report, compiled by a committee that worked from the Nile
Hotel here, reportedly said that the relations between Ugandan
and Rwandan military commanders in Kisangani were not cordial and
recommended the removal from Kisangani of both Kazini and his
Rwandan rivals.
</P>
<P>
In the Kisangani clashes, 38 Ugandan soldiers and more Rwandan
troops were killed. Leaders of both countries met in an urgent
meeting to stop the escalation of the fighting in the third
largest city of DRC.

<P>
LAGOS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- About 50 young Egbesu cult
members were feared executed by angry soldiers on their route to
prison in Nigeria's eastern Bayelsa State.
</P>
<P>
The cult members were killed near a creek on the border of
Bayelsa and Rivers state by soldiers intercepting them in
retaliation for the death of four of their colleagues ambushed by
the young cult members called "Egbesu boys" last Thursday,
reported the Daily Times, a Nigerian government owned newspaper
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The killing has thrown the nearby towns into confusion with
most hotels empty following the hurried exit of all guests, while
most residents have fled their homes for fear of further killings
by the "Egbesu boys".
</P>
<P>
A contingent of Nigerian Air Force has been urgently deployed
into the area to beef up security.
</P>
<P>
The four soldiers were reportedly killed by the "Egbesu boys"
in Yenagoa,
</P>
<P>
a city in Bayelsa State during a fight between them and the
security operatives.

<TEXT>
<P>
After a spin on the 30th lap, Hakkinen lost the race to Germany
's Heinz-Harald Frentzen, a three-time winner this season.
</P>
<P>
Frentzen won the 53-lap race in one hour, 17 minutes and 2.923
seconds at an average speed of 237.938 kph. Germany's Ralf
Schumacher, the younger brother of injured Ferrari star Michael
Schumacher, finished second, 3.2 seconds behind Frentzen, in a
Winfield Williams.
</P>
<P>
Ferrari's Mika Salo of Finland was third, followed by Rubens
Barrichello, the Brazilian who will take Irvine's spot with
Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
"I made a mistake. I'll make sure this is the last error I
make this year," said Hakkinen, who, while leading by a wide
margin, also crashed in the San Marino GP in May.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen, who started from the pole after a record lap in
qualifying, spun while leading Frentzen by eight seconds. The
defending world champion lost control of the rear traction at a
chicane, sending the car into the grass with a stalled engine.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Lay Off 60,000 Civil Servants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is
preparing to retrench some 60,000 state employees as part of its
civil service cutback program, the East African weekly newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The retrenchments, which follow a cabinet reshuffle last Monday
when the number of ministries were trimmed from 27 to 15 in an
effort to cut expenditure and raise work efficiency of the
government, will start in the second quarter of the financial year
beginning next month, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, instructions have been given to all
ministries to identify employees whose departure will lead to a 30
percent reduction in the salary bill of a government currently
staffed by a work force of 225, 916.
</P>
<P>
The exact number and the amount of money required for the
lay-offs is being worked out, the newspaper said, adding that the
retirement package is estimated to be 13.72 billion shillings
(185.4 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Britain and the World Bank have offered to meet the cost of the
lay-offs, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It is also reported that other administrative reforms in the
program launched by President Daniel arap Moi to streamline
government and increase the country's economic growth will be
announced in the next few weeks.

<HEADLINE> Bhutanese Delegation Arrives in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A Bhutanese delegation led
by Foreign Minister Jigme Y. Thinley arrived here Monday for the
8th Nepal-Bhutan Joint Ministerial Level Committee (JMLC) meeting
over the Bhutanese refugee crisis.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be held on September 14 and 15.
</P>
<P>
"We will take back all those who are Bhutanese," said the
Bhutan foreign minister on arrival at the Thibhuvan International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation of the 100,000 Bhutanese refugees living in
eastern Nepal after they were evicted from Bhutan around 1990 is
the outstanding issue between Nepal and Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
Seven rounds of ministerial talks between the two Himalayan
kingdoms failed to reach any solution. The 7th JMLC meeting held
in Kathmandu in 1996 ended in impasse as Nepal insisted on the
repatriation of all refugees, while Bhutan wanted to take back
only those who were forcibly evicted.
</P>
<P>
Thinley said there will be no third party involved in the
meeting between Nepal and Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has been seeking cooperation from India in resolving the
refugee crisis, as India handles Bhutan's foreign affairs and the
Bhutanese refugees came to Nepal through India. Nepal wishes India
to give the refugees free passage when they go back to Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
India, however, insisted that the Bhutanese refugee crisis is
the bilateral issue between Nepal and Bhutan and would not been
involved.
</P>
<P>
The 8th round of JMLC talks was scheduled in January 1999, but
was postponed because of Nepalese election in May this year.

BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Minister of the State

Also attending the workshop were Swedish Minister of
Environment Kjell Larsson and his delegation, consisting of dozens
of entrepreneurs in the field.
</P>
<P>
Larsson hoped that Swedish companies, which have the technology
needed to reduce the negative impact on the environment, can work

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Criticizes Denmark For Interfering With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu (PF)
demanded the Danish Trade Union Council for International
Development and Cooperation not to involve itself in the national
politics of Zimbabwe, the daily Herald reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, the party will recommend the deportation of Georg
Lemke, an official of the Danish trade union council, for his
participation in the formation of the opposition Movement for
Democratic Change (MDC) of Zimbabwe, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview on Sunday, the party's deputy secretary for
information and publicity Chen Chimutengwende, who is also
Minister of Information and Posts and Telecommunications, said
although the launching of MDC was politically a non-event, Lemke
"must be severely dealt with" for interfering in Zimbabwe's
domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
He said it was morally wrong and socially unjust for a
registered non- governmental organization to change its
development agenda and start causing division by meddling in
Zimbabwe's internal politics.
</P>
<P>
"That man must be deported for interfering with the internal
affairs of the State, and his organization must be banned from
operating here. They came here as a non-governmental organization
but are now implementing the destructive foreign policies of their
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Their wings must be clipped because they want to control us,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Documents available show that Lemke and his organization
contributed much to the formation of the MDC being led by leaders
of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) Morgan Tsvangirai
and Gibson Sibanda, the Herald reported.

<HEADLINE> Explosive Found Near Site of Moscow Building Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Two boxes with hexagon were
found near the site of a powerful explosion early Monday that
demolished an eight-story building and killed at least 22 people
in southeast Moscow, the Itar-Tass news agency said, quoting
unconfirmed reports.
</P>
<P>
Hexagon, an explosive widely used in the Second World War, was
said to be used in another building explosion last Thursday that
killed over 90 people in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Although authorities are still investigating the causes of the
blasts, many officials believe they were staged by terrorists with
links to Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
Monday's explosion was the third in Moscow since August 31,
when a bomb went off in an underground shopping mall near the
Kremlin. One was killed and dozens were injured in that blast.
</P>
<P>
Last week, President Boris Yeltsin declared Monday a national
day of mourning for the Thursday blast in Moscow and an earlier
explosion in Daghestan that killed more than 60 people when a
five-story residential building in a military compound was
destroyed by a car bomb.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, attending a meeting of the Asia-
Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Auckland, New Zealand, has
cut his visit there and headed back home, Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
"This fact (the latest blast) cannot be called an accident
anymore. This is a crime, and nefarious at that," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
"Those who have done it cannot be called humans. They cannot be
even called beasts, and if they be called beasts, then rabid ones,
" Tass quoted Putin as saying.
</P>
<P>
So far, 22 bodies have been pulled out from under the rubble of
the apartment block in Building No. 3 at 6 Kashiroskoye Shosse in
southeast Moscow. A total of 126 people were registered to reside
in the demolished building.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Zdanovich, spokesman of the Federal Security Service,
the main successor to the Soviet KGB, described the blasts as "a
real terrorist war."

<HEADLINE> China's TV Giant Aims to Enter Top-500 Company List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Sichuan Changhong Electronic
Company, China's largest TV manufacturer, has an ambition to be
among the world's top 500 industries before 2010.
</P>
<P>
Changhong will take in 100 billion yuan (12.048 billion US
dollars) in sales income annually by then, said Ni Runfeng, the
company's president and general manager.
</P>
<P>
The company, located in China's important industrial and
scientific research center Mianyang, a city in Sichuan Province,
southwest China, produces and sells televisions and related
consumer electronics.
</P>
<P>
The company, which was listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in
1994, reported annual sales of 11.6 billion yuan last year, with
total assets exceeding 18 billion yuan. It now leads the 50 most
competitive companies in the Shanghai bourse.
</P>
<P>
Ni believes that as Europe and the U.S. are restructuring their
industries, the processing industry will gradually emerge in a
large scale in China, providing opportunities for Changhong.
</P>
<P>
In two or three years there will be intense competition among
Chinese electronic giants, as was the case in Japan in the 1980s,
and survivors of the game will get a much bigger market share,
according to him.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, Changhong has been trying to convert
from solely a color TV manufacturer into a large-scale producer of
electronic information products for ordinary families.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China
provided a credit of 4.149 billion yuan and 70 million U.S.
dollars to Changhong to support its cable TV HFC Net's digital
project.
</P>
<P>
Ni said Changhong's next step is to develop the international
market. Many countries like India, Russia and some in South
America have shown interest in technological cooperation with his
company.
</P>
<P>
Some of world's top-500 companies like Toshiba, NEC, Philips
and Sanyo have already established joint research centers with
Changhong to develop new technology.

BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A total of 860 primary and
middle school teachers from rural China recently received the "
Candle Award" for their contribution to the country's education
system.
</P>
<P>
Initiated by the China Charity Federation last April, the
Candle Project was designed to assist low-salary teachers who
devote themselves to education in remote areas.
</P>
<P>
The project provides financial aid for poorly-paid rural
teachers, rewards those teachers who show evidence of improved
performance, and provides one-on-one assistance to rural schools
and teachers.
</P>
<P>
"The ongoing fund-raising activities for the 'Candle Project'
will benefit more than 200,000 low-salary teachers and nearly 10,
000 schools in rural China," said an official with the Ministry of
Education.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The proposal for a United
States of Africa proposed in the just-concluded Organization of
African Unity (OAU) summit was monumental, Kenyan Foreign Affairs
and International Co- operation Minister Bonaya Godana has said.
</P>
<P>
Godana said that a task force had been mandated to study the
proposal and provide suggestions, according to Monday's East
African Standard daily.
</P>
<P>
On his arrival here from OAU summit from Libya, however, Godana
said Sunday that the target date of 2001 was too ambitious and
not feasible given the circumstances facing most African
countries.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the special summit did not reach any
legally binding agreement and did not commit individual countries
to give away their sovereignty to join the union.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa and Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni also expressed their cautious welcome
in their Sunday separate stopovers here.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said that although a federal African Union would help
resolve conflicts in most African countries, the idea may not be
warmly received since part of sovereignty would be surrendered.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that the proposal was ambitious, Museveni said that
there was no formal study to show the benefits of the proposal.

HARARE, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The long awaited labour party,
the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), was officially launched
Saturday at Harare's Rufaro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural speech, MDC Interim President Gibson Sibanda,
who is also President of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions
(ZCTU), said time had come when people of Zimbabwe should take
charge of their lives and future through political change.
</P>
<P>
He said the ruling Zanu (PF) party and its government had taken
people for granted for so long while turning a deaf ear to
suggestions put to them by the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions
and other groups representing the workers.
</P>
<P>
"We live in an economy that is not able to satisfy even the
basic needs of most Zimbabweans, where most people face a
continuous downward slide in job opportunities, income, food
security and well being. Business has collapsed and poverty has
grown," he said.
</P>
<P>
Among the 15,000 people attending the launch were worker
representatives from all over the country supporting the efforts
to remove the ruling Zanu (PF) led by President Robert Mugabe from
power, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The MDC's immediate priorities included the restoration of
economic stability, growth and job creation, a people driven land
reform, building an accountable, transparent and open government,
giving life to the people' s constitution and guaranteeing health,
education and shelter, MDC leader and ZCTU Secretary-General
Morgan Tsvangirai said.

youth delegation headed by Kou Hoi In, president of the Youth
Committee of Macao Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Luo said the Chinese people are happily making preparations for
the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic and
the return of Macao to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that young people of all circles in
Macao had made great contributions to the development of their
local economy, as well as to the smooth return of Macao, adding
that he hoped local youth could contribute more to the stability
and prosperity of Macao.

He noted that Hong Kong's successful experiences in the past
two years had proved the correctness of the "one country, two
systems" principle, saying that the principle is also the best
option for solving the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui's "two states" statement, which betrayed the "one
China" principle and attempted to separate Taiwan from China, has
been strongly condemned by Chinese worldwide, and is doomed to
failure, he said.

<P>
According to Luo, all Chinese should make concerted efforts for
the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the unification of the
motherland.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Reiterates Stand on Cyprus Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides Sunday night reiterated that a solution to the Cyprus
issue should safeguard permanent peace and security, human rights
and welfare of both communities on the island.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to negotiate a solution within the framework of
the U.N. Security Council, " he said in a televised interview
before his departure Monday for Athens en route to New York, where
he will attend the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He said the international interest on Cyprus is more upgraded
than ever.
</P>
<P>
At the Cologne summit in June, the G-8, which groups the U.S.,
Britain, France, German, Italy, Japan, Canada and Russia, proposed
that U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan invite the leaders of
Cyprus' two rival sides to unconditional negotiations in the
autumn of 1999 for a settlement to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
But the leader of Turkish Cypriot Rauf Denktash refused to
accept the proposal, saying his breakaway republic in northern
Cyprus must be recognized before the resumption of talks that have
been stalled since 1997.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
In New York, Clerides will have meetings with Annan and other
officials concerned. He also expressed hope that Annan will invite
the two sides for direct talks before the end of September.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to the talks to submit our positions on all
aspects of the Cyprus problem," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Clerides clarified that he will not discuss Denktash's
conditions for direct talks on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The president further said he "rejects a new procedure of
proximity talks," noting that it has been tried before.

<P>
TIANJIN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Exports and imports at the
port of Tianjin in north China surged to 2.446 billion U.S.
dollars in August, up 39 percent compared with the same period of
last year.

This was a record high increase in the past eight months this
year, according to Tianjin Customs.

percent and 54 percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> General Motors Says China Could Be Biggest Auto Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- China could be the largest
market for automobiles in 20 to 25 years if the country's economy
continues to grow at the current rate, said G. Richard Wagoner, Jr,
president and chief operating officer of General Motors
Corporation (GM).
</P>
<P>
Wagoner, who spoke to a group of Chinese reporters in Detroit
in a recent interview, said, "The fact is that today China is
already in production and sales a large market with over a million
and half units sold last year."
</P>
<P>
"There's no country in the world that has the combination of an
existing large market today with the opportunity to grow so much
over the next decade or two decades," Wagoner said.
</P>
<P>
He quoted some data as suggesting that "within 20 to 25 years,
China could be the largest automobile market in the world."
</P>
<P>
GM's appearance in China dated back to 1922 with its Manila
branch moved to Shanghai. In September 1924, a GM Buick four-door
sedan and limousine were sold to Pu Yi, the last emperor of China.
</P>
<P>
However, it was not until 1990s that GM, realizing China is a
big potential automobile market, started to establish joint
ventures with Chinese enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been aggressive and successful historically in the
Asia-Pacific region. If we are not successful in China, that will
continue. If we are, it provides an opportunity that would be
effective not just in China, but throughout the region," Wagoner
noted.
</P>
<P>
"We need to be successful in China," he said, expressing
satisfaction at the cooperation with the Chinese partners.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, GM has participated in investment of over two
billion U.S. dollars in three active joint ventures -- Shanghai GM,
the Pan Asia Technical Automotive Center and Jinbei GM located in
Shanghai and Shenyang, employing over 2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
In October 1998, the first four-speed automatic transmission
Buick produced in China came off the assembly line in Shanghai GM,
a 50-50 percent joint venture between GM and Shanghai Automobile
Industry Corporation (SAIC). Regular production began in April
1999.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the challenges facing the automotive industry,
Wagoner said that globalization is the major challenge and his
company is "well-positioned" to address it.
</P>
<P>
"The auto business is undergoing a rapid change as many
industries as a matter of fact, and it relates very much to the
fact that the trend towards globalization of industry is
accelerating. And that provides great opportunities ... and also
provides challenges."
</P>
<P>
"We, GM, are relatively uniquely well positioned to address
these opportunities because we have a tradition of operating in
many countries around the world in many cases for 70 to 75 years,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"But I think it requires us to use our technology and
capability effectively around the world in variety of markets and
use the skills and capabilities of all our people around the world
effectively," Wagoner said.
</P>
<P>
Wagoner, who is expected to attend the Fortune Global Forum in
Shanghai later this month, told reporters he viewed the forum as a
chance to learn from others.
</P>
<P>
"I view it as an opportunity to dialogue with the senior
leadership of China and Shanghai as well as other executives in a
broad range of industries to talk about opportunities in China,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
GM sold 8.165 million units of cars and trucks last year and
its sales volume is 161.3 billion U.S. dollars. It remained number
one among Fortune's top 500 firms in the world.

<HEADLINE> Ranariddh Welcomes Indonesian Decision to Accept U.N. Peacekeepers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian National
Assembly President Prince Norodom Ranariddh said Monday that he
welcomed the decision of Indonesian President Habibie to invite
U.N. peacekeepers to the troubled territory of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Prince Ranariddh made remarks after he delivered an opening
speech at a five-day seminar on the draft of a national plan for
anti-corruption held in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
When asked about whether Cambodia will join in an international
peacekeeping force in East Timor, Ranariddh said that "I am not
aware whether Cambodia has a willing to send Cambodian force or
our representatives to join in the U.N. force. But if the
government makes a decision to send them, as the president of the
legislative body, I will welcome that decision."
</P>
<P>
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie announced Sunday his
readiness to accept a U.N. peacekeeping force to restore peace and
security in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Prince Ranariddh stressed that "the sending of the U.N.
peacekeepers will not be efficient if there is no goodwill from
the people and leaders of the country to settle the crisis,"
citing the example of Cambodia in 1991 till 1993 when the U.N.
peacekeeping force was very successful because of the real will of
people.
</P>
<P>
The prince also appealed to respect the choice and will of the
people in East Timor who voted for independence from Indonesia.

MOSCOW, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in the
explosion early Monday in south Moscow has so far risen to at

</P>
<P>
According to rescuers at the site of the blast, the hope of
finding anybody alive under the rubble of the demolished building
was little, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The blast, which hit the brick-structured building at 05:03

when a powerful explosion ripped through a residential building in
southeast Moscow. A total of 92 people were confirmed killed and
more than 100 wounded in that blast.

<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency quoted a duty officer at the
Emergencies Ministry as saying that the blast was "in all
probability, a terrorist act."
</P>
<P>
The explosion shattered window glasses in four nearby apartment
houses and a school. Rescue efforts were hampered by the country
terrain. Trees are being cut and a road is cleared up to the
explosion site, Tass said.

A total of 126 people were registered to reside in the
demolished building in Kashirskoye Shosse.

CANBERRA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Environmental watchdog
Greenpeace on Monday gave its approval to Sydney 2000 Olympic
organisers despite "a few disappointing failures over the last
year".
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace gave the Games a "seven out of ten" in a report card
issued on Sunday for their environmental efforts in planning the
Olympic site at Homebush.
</P>
<P>
In its second report on the Games, Greenpeace praised the
Olympic Coordination Authority (OCA) for its bid in cleaning up
400 metric tons of dioxin-containing waste found at the Olympic
site.
</P>
<P>
"Our report card -- one year out from the opening ceremony --
recognizes some remarkable successes and a few disappointing
failures over the last year," Greenpeace's campaign manager
Benedict Southworth said.
</P>
<P>
The report also applauded the use of solar hot water systems
and a waste management strategy during construction of the venues.
</P>
<P>
Southworth noted, however, that the use of ozone-depleting
chemicals in air-conditioning systems at Olympic venues is a clear
failure to meet environmental guidelines.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' police have arrested
the crew of the Honduran flagged ship "Marivan" and are looking
for its captian for their suspected receiving of stolen goods from
another sunk ship.
</P>
<P>
Police said an insurance company received a claim from the
shipowners of the sunk ship, also a Honduran-flagged one for its
cargo of sesame seed worth 700,000 Cyprus pounds (1,296,000
U.S. dollars), the Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported on Monday.
</P>

After investigations, the insurance company found out that the
cargo was unloaded at the Suez before the ship arrived in Cyprus
and sank. The cargo was allegedly unloaded to the "Marivan"
which is now in Cyprus' Limassol port under police guard.
</P>
<P>
Two crew members of "Rofayda" are still missing while the
remaining six were rescued.
</P>

sank on July 28, 22 nautical miles off Cyprus' southeastern coast
of Larnaca.

<HEADLINE> Blast Destroys Building in Moscow, 16 Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 13 (Xinhua) -- At least 16 people were killed
in south Moscow in an explosion early Monday, with a nine-story
building on Kashira Highway demolished.
</P>
<P>
The blast, which hit the brick-structured building at 05:03
local time (0103 GMT), was the second one since last Thursday,
when another powerful explosion ripped through a residential
building in southeast Moscow. A total of 92 people were confirmed
killed and more than 100 wounded in that blast.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers have rushed to the site of the Monday explosion.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency quoted a duty officer at the
Emergencies Ministry as saying that the blast was "in all
probability, a terrorist act."
</P>
<P>
The explosion shattered window glasses in four nearby
apartment houses and a school. Rescue efforts were hampered by the
country terrain. Trees are being cut and a road is cleared up to
the explosion site, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 126 people were registered to reside in the
demolished building in Kashirskoye Shosse.

<HEADLINE> Human Rights Are Not Only Rights of Political Dissents: Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Monday expressed his view on human rights, saying
"ideas about human rights are getting more and more peculiar."
</P>
<P>
"Impoverishing millions of people, depriving them of medicine,
even killing large numbers of them directly or indirectly are not
considered violation of human rights. But for the arresting of a
political dissident, the whole world condemns the government for
violations of human rights," he said when opening the four-day
12th Commonwealth Law Conference at Supang Jaya near here.
</P>
<P>
Even legal minds, concerned as they were about justice and
fairplay, seem to be quite unconcerned about what was clearly
massive and systematic violations of human rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the government of a country was considered as
having violated human rights because it denied a few people the
right of dissent while currency traders who deprived millions of
their jobs and income, of their lives even, were not considered as
having violated human rights.
</P>
<P>
"It would seem that violation of human rights can only be done
by governments while everyone else may oppress millions of people
with impunity. Since oppression by people of other people is not
considered as violation of human rights, we will not do anything
to stop it. Indeed we are seeing the rights of currency traders
upheld while the rights of their suffering victims are ignored,"
Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
To force the leader of a country considered to be an oppressive
dictator to surrender, the people of this country were deprived of
food and medicine through sanctions, Mahathir said, adding as if
this was not enough the country was being bombed continuously in
an attempt to force the dictator to submit to international
scrutiny of his country resulting in more innocent people being
killed.
</P>
<P>
Apparently starving these people and killing them did not
constitute violation of their rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said "the death of others, possibly innocent people, is of
less importance than a person's freedom to dissent."
</P>
<P>
He said the world is rightfully concerned about human rights
abuses but human rights are presently interpreted only as the
rights of political dissents.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Defends Stand for Global Financial System Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Monday defended Malaysia's consistent stand for
the global financial system to be reformed.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's call for a new international financial architecture
has received wider acceptance as more and more people realized
that unregulated currency trading is damaging to the world trade,
he told reporters after opening the Commonwealth Law Conference in
Supang Jaya near here while Commenting on U.S. President Bill
Clinton's remark on the international financial architecture.
</P>
<P>
Clinton reportedly said in Auckland Sunday for the first time
that "it would be a mistake not to reform the financial
architecture."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said "people are beginning to see that currency
trading is very damaging to (the) world trade."
</P>
<P>
He said if the global financial system was not reformed,
developing economies would continue to be at the mercy of
unscrupulous currency speculators.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia lost purchasing power of 50 billion U.S. dollars in
one year when the ringgit depreciated by 50 percent while the East
Asian region lost hundreds billions of dollars due to the currency
turmoil, Mahathir said, adding amidst this scenario, the world
trade must also contract.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir was of the view that currency cannot possibly devalue
itself and the act of short-selling had resulted in its
depreciation during the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"It should be obvious that it is the currency traders and their
short-selling activities which devalued the currency. But if
anyone accuses the currency traders of causing the devaluation,
they would punish the accuser by devaluing the currency further,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The currency traders were blameless even though the currencies
were devalued only after they started attacking these currencies,
Mahathir said.

<HEADLINE> Booming Processing Trade of Shanghai Bonded Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Exports from processing at
the Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone in Shanghai's Pudong New Area totaled
809 million U.S. dollars in the first seven months of this year,
up 105 percent over last year's same period.
</P>
<P>
The sum accounts for 87 percent of the total exports of the
bonded zone.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics provided by a local official,
about 127 enterprises engaging in the processing trade have been
established in the zone, mainly by investors from the United
States, Japan, Germany and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
They generated 4.4 billion yuan in gross domestic product in
the first seven months, an increase of 26 percent compared with
the figure a year ago. The zone's industrial output value surged
28 percent to 6.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the zone's rapid development to a
series of favorable government polices, simplified procedures, and
the government's crackdown on smuggling.

<HEADLINE> APEC Leaders Issue Declaration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, New Zealand, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The seventh
informal meeting of leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum ended here Monday after adopting a
leaders' declaration focusing on major tasks and the future role
of the 21-member economic bloc.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also endorsed the APEC Principles to Enhance
Competition and Regulatory Reform, attached to the declaration.
</P>
<P>
The key points of declaration was summarized at the closing
ceremony by New Zealand Prime Minister Jenney Shipley, chair of
the seventh informal meeting of APEC leaders.
</P>
<P>
The declaration, entitled "The Auckland Challenge," covers a
package of plans to support growth through strong and open markets,
strengthen the role of APEC, support the development of the World
Trade Organization (WTO), strengthen domestic financial markets,
counter the challenge of the Y2K problem, and accelerate the
development of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
The Principles to Enhance Competition and Regulatory Reform are:
non-discrimination, comprehensiveness, transparency,
accountability and implementation.
</P>
<P>
The principles provide a core part of the framework for
strengthening APEC markets which will better integrate individual
and collective actions by APEC member economies to achieve the
goals set by APEC in its 1994 leaders' meeting in Bogor, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
On supporting growth by strengthening the function of markets,
the declaration said that improved competitiveness through ongoing
reform is the road to recovery and sustainable growth.
</P>
<P>
"Through APEC, we seek to expand opportunities for business and
employment growth, build strong and open markets and ensure that
our communities and economies can participate successfully in the
international economy," it said.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, APEC will strengthen markets by:
</P>
<P>
-- Providing greater transparency and predictability in
corporate and public sector governance, enhancing the role of
competition to improve efficiency and broaden participation by
enterprises;
</P>
<P>
-- Improving the quality of regulation and the capacity of
regulators to design and implement policies for sustainable growth;
</P>
<P>
-- Reducing compliance costs and facilitating business growth;
</P>
<P>
-- And building a favorable regional and international
environment for free and fair competition.
</P>
<P>
In the declaration, the leaders said that they approve the work
of APEC finance ministers, and encourage their efforts to
strengthen domestic financial markets and secure the foundation
for the return of capital to the region by several means,
including the enhancement of supervision of financial markets.
</P>
<P>
The declaration said that APEC leaders recognize the key role
that electronic commerce will play in linking economies in the
region. APEC must continue its efforts to create a favorable
environment for electronic commerce in cooperation with the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
On the problem of Y2K, or the computer millennium bug problem,
the declaration said, "In a little over 110 days, APEC economies
will face the challenges and risks of the century date change."
</P>
<P>
"We (APEC leaders) adopt the APEC Y2K 100 Days Cooperation
Initiative to intensify cooperation for responding to potential
Y2K events. We agree to share information and expertise about Y2K
impacts on critical infrastructures during and after the date
change," the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
It said that APEC will continue to play a leading role in
strengthening the global economy, especially the multilateral
trading system.
</P>
<P>
"We commit to ensuring that APEC takes a leading role in
enabling developing economies to participate successfully in the
global economy, through enhancing human and institutional
capacities and progressively opening markets," it said.
</P>
<P>
On the development of the WTO, the declaration said that APEC
has a unique opportunity to give impetus to deliberations in the
WTO, and that APEC leaders will give the strongest possible
support at Seattle to the launch of a new round of multilateral
negotiations within the WTO in November.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve universality of membership, APEC leaders
also seek early progress in the accession negotiations to the WTO,
including for those APEC member economies that are not yet WTO
members.
</P>
<P>
The leaders issue a strong call for these accession
negotiations to be concluded at the earliest opportunity, if
possible, prior to the start of the new WTO negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Of the 21 APEC members, only China, Russia, Vietnam and Chinese
Taipei are not WTO members.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, APEC leaders particularly welcome the more
active participation of women and business in APEC's work this
year, according to the declaration.
</P>
<P>
It said that APEC leaders welcome the Framework for the
Integration of Women in APEC, which is a significant step to
enhance the ability of women to contribute to and benefit from
prosperity of the region.
</P>
<P>
APEC was established in 1989 in response to the growing
interdependence among Asia-Pacific economies. It is a grouping of
21 regional economies set up to improve the stability, security
and prosperity of its peoples.
</P>
<P>
It now groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, China's
Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea,
Chinese Taipei, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Current Account Surplus Drops in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus
fell to 1,318.1 billion yen (10.9 billion U.S. dollars) in July, 2.
7 percent down from a year earlier, mainly due to decreasing
exports, the Finance Ministry said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the surplus before adjustment for seasonal
factors followed a 0.7 percent increase in June.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in goods and services trade totaled 838.9 billion
yen (6.9 billion dollars), down 5.5 percent, the ministry said in
a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in merchandise trade dropped 4.9 percent to 1,400.1
billion yen (11.7 billion dollars), with exports down 7.5 percent
to 4,072.3 billion yen (33.9 billion dollars) and imports down 8.9
percent to 2,672.2 billion yen (22.2 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The services deficit contracted to 561.3 billion yen (4.6
billion dollars) from 584.4 (4.8 billion dollars) billion yen on
account of a drop in the deficit in payments for transportation,
the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The current account balance is the difference between a country
's income from foreign sources against payments on foreign
obligations. It excludes net capital investment.
</P>
<P>
A ministry official attributed the latest shrinkage in the
surplus to falling exports to the U.S. and Europe. The export
slump appears to be a result of the yen's steep appreciation from
year-earlier levels.
</P>
<P>
In July, the yen averaged 119.86 to the U.S. dollar, compared
with 140.73 a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> China's Poorest County Battles Adversity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, September 13 (Xinhua) -- After struggling for years to
overcome water shortages, China's most impoverished county has
taken productive measures to cultivate water resources and improve
its harsh environment.
</P>
<P>
Dingxi County in northwest China's Gansu Province has solved
the problem of limited drinking water and irrigation by collecting
rainwater. And local farmers are reporting profits from their
sales of mineral water discovered in a mountain stream in the
southern part of the county.
</P>
<P>
With 250,000 indigent, the county's poor rural population now
makes up 3.2 percent of the total, compared with 70 percent in
1982.
</P>
<P>
In addition to developing water resources, the Dingxi people
have also planted trees and grass and built terraces to combat
water loss and soil erosion, which has improved conditions for
farming.
</P>
<P>
Dingxi and Hexi in Gansu Province and Xihaigu in Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region -- known as the "Three West" -- were the
earliest poor regions in China to carry out the State's poverty-
relief programs.
</P>
<P>
For the past 16 years, the government has allocated more than
200 million yuan (about 24 million U.S. dollars) to Dingxi County
for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
With this money, local residents have developed crop farming,
livestock raising, labor service export, farm products processing
and other industries. As a result, they are now able to develop
their economy independently.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that the county also will accelerate its
move to open to the outside world, introduce foreign capital and
cooperate with foreign businessmen.

<HEADLINE> Anwar Admitted to Hospital for Suspected Arsenic Poisoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's former deputy
prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, who was admitted to a local hospital
on Friday for suspected arsenic poisoning, is in good condition,
a hospital official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
A panel of specialists from Hospital Universiti Kebangsaan
(National University) Malaysia where Anwar was admitted was
conducting comprehensive tests on Anwar, Hospital Director Khalid
Abdul Kadir said in a brief statement.
</P>
<P>
"His condition is good," he said without giving further
details.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was taken to the accident and emergency department of the
hospital on a High Court order issued by Justice Arifin Jaka, and
has been warded for further examination.
</P>
<P>
The judge postponed the sodomy trial of Anwar after his counsel
Karpal Singh told the court that the test result of the urine
sample sent to Gribbles Pathology Laboratory in Melbourne,
Australia, showed that Anwar was suffering from arsenic poisoning.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who is serving a six-year jail sentence for corruption
charges, is being tried on a charge of sodomizing the former
driver of his family, Azizan Abu Bakar.
</P>
<P>
Anwar's arsenic poisoning issue triggered off a demonstration
by his supporters last weekend when more than a dozen were
detained by police.
</P>
<P>
Police announced the setting up of a special group to
investigate the event of alleged arsenic poisoning suffered by
Anwar.
</P>
<P>
The government officials including Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad questioned the delay in making public of Anwar's urine
sample test result.
</P>
<P>
Anwar's wife Wan Azizah Ismail explained in a statement Sunday
why it took Anwar's side 14 days to inform the court of the
arsenic poisoning suffered by her husband.
</P>
<P>
She said that the urine sample was sent to Gribbles Pathology
Malaysia Berhad in Petaling Jaya near here last August 18, and the
test was only done by the company's laboratory in Melbourne on
August 26 and a report on the result of the test in Melbourne was
received by her on September 9 from the company's representative
in Petaling Jaya and was brought to the court's attention the
following day.

if the troops pull back from the Golan, and the examination of
moving military bases and training areas.

</P>
<P>
-- Support among Palestinians for attacks against Israel is

<P>
The survey showed that support for attacks against Israel
dropped to 36 percent in September, down from 39 percent in July

<HEADLINE> More Ningxia Girls Have Access to School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The school attendance rate
for girls in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has
risen from 20 percent in 1958, the year the region was founded, to
the present 98 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia has 1.79 million people of ethnic Hui group, 250,000 of
which are female students. The dropout rate among girls has long
been a major problem as most of them live in mountainous areas of
southern Ningxia and most parents are influenced by a traditional
patriarchal belief that women shouldn't go to school.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous regional government has spent over three million
yuan since the beginning of the 1990s to build 300 schools and
teaching centers in southern Ningxia. Associations for promoting
education for girls have been formed to help those girls who have
to do household chores and study at home or in their neighborhood,
and to cut the costs of tuition and books for pupils who have
financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Apart from regular courses, many schools teach the girls
handiwork, sewing, embroidery and cooking techniques.
</P>
<P>
To create a better study environment at home, the regional
government launched a regional literacy drive which has helped 400,
000 local farmers learn to read and write. In Jingyuan County
where 98 percent residents are of Hui nationality, over 85 percent
of women between ages 14 and 45 have graduated from literacy
courses.
</P>
<P>
The success of the girls' education reform in Ningxia has been
highly praised by the All-China Federation of Women, the State
Education Commission and the UN Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization.
</P>
<P>
However, more than 13,000 girls in poor areas of Ningxia, 73
percent of whom are of ethnic Hui minorities, are still out of
school.
</P>
<P>
Much still needs to be done to improve education of ethnic
girls, a regional educational official said.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Russian Border Trade Rebounds (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Chinese government has always attached great importance to
border trade, and the resumed growth in the trade is not difficult
to predict with the preferential policies it has unveiled last
year and the gradual standardization of the border trade," Ling Ji
said.
</P>
<P>
With the launching of a special trade zone designed for
resident-to-resident trade in Suifenhe, Russian people are coming
back by over one thousand a day for sightseeing and shopping in
Suifenhe," said Zhang Jinhe, vice-mayor of Suifenhe city.
</P>
<P>
Similar scene were reported in other border cities along the
Sino-Russian border. In Manzhouli, for instance, trade rose a year-
on-year 30 percent during the January-June period. To facilitate
the trade settlement, some banks in Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia and
Heilongjiang also adopted some easy and convenient measures in
foreign exchange remittance which allows foreign exchange
settlement to be done in just one day instead of over one week in
the past.
</P>
<P>
Cui Longji has been engaged in the border trade for years. Last
year, Cui built a lumber processing plant in the border city of
Dongning, which has an annual processing capacity of 30,000 cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
"I have made profits in the processing business thanks to the
advantages of resources in Russia and cheap labor in China," said
the shrewd businessman.
</P>
<P>
Ling Ji shared Cui's optimistic view in Sino-Russian trade. "
Given the complementary nature of the two economies, China and
Russia will have good prospectus in border trade as long as Russia
can maintain political stability and a stable rouble," Ling said.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Russian Border Trade Rebounds (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Sino-Russian border trade
began to rebound this year after years of decline and fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume surged by 45 percent during the first half-
year period on a yearly basis to more than 6.2 million US dollars,
which trade experts say is hailing as a sign that Sino-Russian
border trade has entered the second cycle for high growth.
</P>
<P>
China's growing demand for lumber and rolled steel in Russia in
the wake of its increased efforts in infrastructures construction,
and active resident-to-resident trade in Heilongjiang, Xinjiang
and Inner Mongolia as a result of the State policy incentives are
two major reasons behind the strong rebound, said Ling Ji, an
official in charge of the Sino-Russian border trade from the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, who added that
improved quality of Chinese commodities also helped boost the
border trade.
</P>
<P>
Sharing a border line extending more than 4,300 kilometers,
China and Russia did one third of their bilateral trade on border.
</P>
<P>
Suifenhe city is the biggest border city in northernmost China'
s Heilongjiang province. In sharp contrast to the sluggish scene
last year, the city is starting to bustle again with lines of
heavy-duty trucks shuttling to and fro carrying Russian lumber,
chemical products, and rolled steel and Chinese garments, light
industrial goods, as well as vegetables and fruits.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing cargo rose 14.9 percent to a record 980,000 tons
during the first six months this year, and the custom offices has
to extend work hours to handle the increasing volume, according
the customs officials in Suifenhe.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Russian border trade started from barter trade in mid
1980s, which began to grow fast as of 1993. The trade volume
started to slide in 1996, however, to a little over 900 million US
dollars worth in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Says A Week Needed to Bring Peacekeepers to East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Minister of Home
Affairs Syarwan Hamid said Monday that it will take a week at
least to bring the U.N. peacekeeping force into East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"I asked (Foreign Minister) Ali Alatas and he said it would
take at least a week to bring U.N. peacekeeping force into East
Timor, since the Security Council should organize that and decide
which country would participate," Hamid told reporters at the
parliament here.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government would leave the issue of U.N.
peacekeeping contingent members to the United Nations, he said,
adding that Indonesia would not give any conditions to those who
would take a part.
</P>
<P>
"We will leave it up to the United Nations. We are ready to
accept any countries that would be contingent members. I think the
United Nations has its procedures in assembling peacekeeping
force, which is the best for East Timor," he said, adding that
it's all right if Australian government will also take a part.
</P>
<P>
"Well, if the United Nations decides Australia be a member of
the U.N. peace-keeping force, we will accept that. It's up to the
United Nations," Hamid added.
</P>
<P>
The minister also reiterated that the government had no
pressure from any party or outside in making its decision of
allowing U.N. peacekeepers' dispatch, but was out of consideration
to save the lives of East Timorese.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie announced Sunday that his
government would accept a U.N.-sponsored international
peacekeeping force in cooperation with the country's military to
restore order and security in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Habibie has sent Alatas to New York to discuss details of the
deployment of U.N. peacekeeping forces in East Timor and
Indonesia's position on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Violence has broken out after the announcement of the August 30
ballot result in East Timor, in which over 78 percent of the
voters showed their support for independence instead of special
autonomy within Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and a number of countries have prepared to
form a force to help Indonesia quell the violence.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976, but the move has never been recognized by the
United Nations.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan investors have
maintained a zeal for investing in the mainland, as this year's
China fair for international investment and trade shows.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the fair show that more than 600 Taiwan investors
in 57 groups attended the annual event held in Xiamen, across the
Taiwan Straits, from September 8-12.
</P>
<P>
Booths in the hall designated for Taiwan businessmen were all
booked, forcing quite a number of Taiwan businessmen to other
halls at the fair, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Manager George Yeh with Grand Information International Co. Ltd.
explained that they settled on the Chinese mainland's rich labor
and land resources, huge market and substantial profits.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, the Chinese mainland has been the area of
choice for Taiwan investors seeking to start up new businesses. By
June this year, Taiwan investors had pumped 22.6 billion U.S.
dollars into 42,600 projects in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, Taiwan leader Lee Teng-hui made his "two states
" remark which has created tension and had a negative impact on
the once well-developed economic and trade exchanges across the
Straits.
</P>
<P>
But relevant departments of the Chinese mainland have
reiterated that Taiwan investors' legitimate rights would be
safeguarded in all circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Details regarding the rules protecting Taiwan investment in the
mainland will soon come out, and well over 20 favorable policies
to encourage more investment from Taiwan will also be released.
</P>
<P>
The delegation of Xiamen Special Economic Zone (SEZ), Fujian
Province, put forward more than 1,000 projects for business
negotiations at the five-day fair.
</P>
<P>
Contracts were signed with overseas investors for 77 projects
which will require an investment of 860.76 million U.S. dollars,
including 749.56 million U.S. dollars from overseas investors.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Tourists to Northwest China Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, September 13 (Xinhua)-- The number of overseas
tourists to Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in northwest China from
January to July this year has increased by about 50 percent,
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia received 2,000 overseas tourists in the seven months,

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar Makes Progress in Wiping Out Illiteracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has been making
relentless efforts to wipe out illiteracy in the country and has
made marked progress in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, which enjoyed a significantly high literacy rate of 35
percent in 1948 when it became independent, has targeted to
achieve full literacy by the year 2000 in the country.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has carried out its literacy campaign mainly in three
periods -- from 1948 to 1964, from 1964 to 1988 and from 1988 to
1999.
</P>
<P>
After the country became independent in 1948, the government
first enacted the Public Education Act and formed the Public
Education Council to conduct education courses for illiterates.
</P>
<P>
Under a monastic education plan, the government also provided
necessary assistance to enable children in regions without public
primary schools and those who could not afford school expenses to
attend schools.
</P>
<P>
Efforts were also made for literacy of school-age children and
over-school-age youths and adults until 1964.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics in 1963 showed that the illiteracy rate in
Myanmar dropped to 43 percent from 65 percent in 1948, indicating
that the number of literates increased by 22 percent in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Starting from 1964, the beginning of the second period,
literacy programs were expanded with summer literacy courses for
adult illiterates conducted in the country's Meiktila district as
a pilot project participated by volunteers.
</P>
<P>
In 1971, it was reported that the Meiktila district became an
area with 100 percent literacy.
</P>
<P>
The success was then extended to other districts with Yangon,
Mandalay, Magway, Bago and Ayeyawaddy divisions and the Mon state
emerging as areas without illiterates.
</P>
<P>
In view of the success of Myanmar's literacy programs, the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) awarded Myanmar the Mohammed Reza Pahlavi Literacy Prize
in 1971 and the Noma Prize in 1983.
</P>
<P>
In the 24-year second period, over 2.4 million of people above
15 became literate.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1983 census, the illiteracy rate had fallen to
21.4 percent in Myanmar and 78.6 percent of the population were
literate.
</P>
<P>
Efforts were continued for achieving literacy in the country
during the third period from 1988 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
After the World Conference on Education for All was held in
Thailand in 1990, Myanmar, along with other countries throughout
the world, formulated its national program of action and drew up
its own plan of Education for All (EFA) by the Year 2000 which
covers formal and non-formal education.
</P>
<P>
According to the Education Committee of Myanmar, of the 660,000
 illiterates in 145 out of 324 EFA townships registered in the
country in 1990, over 100,000 have become literate now.
</P>
<P>
However, the authorities have not issued the latest figure of
illiterates in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country has been striving to provide those who
have obtained basic literacy with continuing education through
literacy promotion, income-generation and better life programs in
reading circles, libraries and community learning centers.
</P>
<P>
The country plans to set up a Myanmar Literacy Resource Center
with the technical and financial assistance of the Asia-Pacific
Culture Center for the UNESCO to extend and expand its literacy
programs.

<HEADLINE> China's Qinghai-Tibet Highway Upgraded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Upgrading of the Qinghai-Tibet
(Xining-Lhasa) highway, the main highway passage leading to
southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, has been completed.
</P>
<P>
The roadbase of the highway has been deepened, 13 bridges have
been added, and road surfaces on dangerous parts have been widened,
a local official said.
</P>
<P>
Cars can now run at speeds of up to 80 kilometers per hour on
the highway, double the original figure.
</P>
<P>
Work on the highway started in 1991. The total cost reached 1.3
billion yuan (156.6 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Qinghai-Tibet highway is one of the four roads that go to Tibet
from inland China, but it receives more than 85 percent of the
total transport volume. The highway went into operation in 1954.
</P>
<P>
A 500 km section of the 1,937-km highway is built on the frozen
soil, which makes the highway vulnerable to damages.
</P>
<P>
Tibet currently has no railways because of its adverse climate
and mountainous conditions.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Welcomes Jakarta's Acceptance of U.N. Peacekeeping Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has welcomed Indonesia's decision to approve the entry of
an international peacekeeping force to help maintain peace and
security in East Timor, reports from Auckland, New Zealand said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said Estrada, who is
attending the 7th informal meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) leaders in Auckland, also assured that Manila
will send its own men as a contribution to the U.N. peacekeeping
force, the Philippine News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie agreed to allow U.N.
peacekeepers into East Timor late Sunday night, after a talk with
U.N. General-Secretary Kofi Annan on the situation in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Estrada expressed the hope that the entry of a U.N.
peacekeeping force into East Timor will help stabilize the
situation in the area and bring an era of normalcy to the former
Portuguese colony, Barican said.

<P>
Violence in East Timor broke out after the results of the
direct ballot on autonomy on August 30 were known, which showed an
overwhelming vote in favor of independence from Indonesia.
Indonesia had placed East Timor under martial law on September 7,
reportedly to quell violence.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Chairman Against KLA Becoming Civil Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 12 (Xinhua) - Zoran Andjelkovich, chairman
of Kosovo's Provisional Executive Committee, said Sunday that he
is strongly against the participation in civil bodies by any
member of the illegal ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Belgrade radio, Andjelkovich noted that
the KLA cannot become local guard or Kosovo Corps, because that
would violate the related United Nations resolutions and do no
good to the peace, stability and multi-ethnic reconciliation in
this region.
</P>
<P>
As is mandated in the UN resolution 1244, the KLA must be
disarmed before September 19.
</P>
<P>
But till now, a great many uniformed KLA members still openly
act around.
</P>
<P>
He said that the UN special mission did not fulfill its role of
protecting all residents in Kosovo, as 240,000 people there have
been driven out of their homes.
</P>
<P>
He urged the UN mission and peacekeeping force to adopt
feasible measures to stop the scale-up of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Last week, UN Kosovo administrator Bernard Kouchner presented a
proposal to transform the KLA into a civilian organization, the so-
called Kosovo Corps. Russia was strongly opposed to the idea.
</P>
<P>
The Provisional Executive Committee, created in September 1998
to oversee the work of the then local government in Kosovo, is
composed of 18 representatives from all ethic groups in the
southeastern province of Yugoslavia's Serbian Republic.

<HEADLINE> Gas Utilization up in China's Energy Consumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua)-- China's proven natural gas
reserve will increase by an annual average 120 billion cu m
between 2001 and 2020, with gas utilization accounting for eight
percent of China's energy use, over the present two percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC), the
country's annual gas output will hit 110 billion cu m to 130 cu m
at most in the next century, and in 2020, China will produce 100
billion cubic meters of gas, equivalent to 100 million tons of
crude oil.
</P>
<P>
The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Basin in northwest China, the site of
China's largest gas field, has so far verified gas reserves of 309.
7 billion cu m, ranking among the world's 80 largest gas fields.
</P>
<P>
About 100 billion cubic meters of gas reserve has been proven
in the eastern part of southwest China's Sichuan Province, which
shows the enormous potential for further gas exploration.
</P>
<P>
The Tarim Basin has become a new hot spot for gas exploration.
And a large-sized gas production base is taking shape in the
basins of Turpan-Hami and Junggar in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The fast-growing gas exploration has boosted the development of
gas pipelines, said a CNPC official.
</P>
<P>
The gas pipeline network in Sichuan Province has successfully
carried gas to the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou as
well as the Chongqing Municipality for industrial and civilian use.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the Shaanix-Beijing gas pipeline, it is
possible for the gas production bases in the west China to provide
gas for the developed cities in the east China. The country is
still giving priority to developing gas markets in north China
centering on Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The country plans to set up a gas pipeline network spanning all
of eastern China, linking gas production bases with economically-
developed areas such as north China, northeast China and the
Yangtze River Delta areas.
</P>
<P>
Experts from CNPC said that the country will use more than 100
billion cubic meters of gas annually simply by gas-fueling 80
percent of the oil-fueled large enterprises, half of the country's
newly-built thermal power generators during the next decade, and
80 percent of its medium-sized cities.

<HEADLINE> England Cricketers 'Offered One Million Bribe' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Scotland Yard is investigating
allegations that members of the England cricket team were offered
almost one million pounds to throw a recent Test match.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on Sunday, the inquiry follows
reports in the News of the World that former England player Chris
Lewis was approached by an Indian-based betting syndicate about
the third Test match against New Zealand at Old Trafford last
month.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said: "An allegation of attempted corruption
was reported by a player to the England and Wales Cricket Board on
August 3.
</P>
<P>
"The England and Wales Cricket Board passed the information on
to the police and an investigation by the organized crime group is
under way.
</P>
<P>
"We are not prepared to discuss this any further," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The News of the World reported that Lewis was approached by a
representative of the syndicate in a newsagent's near his family
home in Harlesden, north London, a few days before the match.
</P>
<P>
Lewis was allegedly asked to persuade wicket-keeper Alec
Stewart to miss catches, and bowler Alan Mullally to bowl wide and
drop as many balls as possible.
</P>
<P>
All the three players would have earned 300,000 pounds, it was
reported.
</P>
<P>
However, veteran Leicestershire player Lewis, who was dropped
from the England side last year after turning up late for a Test,
was shocked by the proposals and alerted the authorities.
</P>
<P>
Neither Stewart nor Mullally is said to have been aware of the
bribe attempt. In the event, Stewart did not keep wicket in the
match and Mullally was not picked to play.
</P>
<P>
England eventually drew the game, but lost the fourth Test and
therefore the series, becoming the lowest-ranked of all the Test-
playing countries.

<HEADLINE> Spurs Held to Draw Against Bradford City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
McCall, 35-year-old former Scottish international, sneaked in
front of the Spurs defense who seemed rooted to the spot from a
corner from the left and nodded home a David Weatherall header
from a meter out.
</P>
<P>
It was an unlikely point for the promoted side which looked
short of class against the Londoners who dominated much of the
game and deservedly took the lead after 75 minutes through
defender Chris Perry.
</P>
<P>
The former Wimbledon player, who joined Spurs for four million
pounds during the summer, scored his first goal for Spurs when he
leaped high at the far post to power a long David Ginola corner
into the opposite corner after 75 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Frenchman Ginola, who is still hoping to resurrect his
international career with the help of an impressive run in the
UEFA Cup this season, had gone closest to breaking the first half
deadlock after 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The result gives the home side only their second point in five
games since their opening day victory at Middlesbrough but they
remain third from bottom on goal difference.
</P>
<P>
Spurs have to settle for 10th place in the table instead of
seventh. They return to European competition for the first time in
seven years on Thursday against Zimbru Chisinau of Moldova in the
UEFA Cup at White Hart Lane.

<HEADLINE> EDS-rpt Jiang Outlines Six Development Directions for APEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, New Zealand, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese
President Jiang Zemin outlined here Monday six development
directions of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) when
speaking at the 7th APEC Informal Leadership Meeting.
</P>
<P>
Noting the two tasks before APEC, which include maintaining
peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and further
promoting the economic growth of that region, Jiang raised six
suggestions for APEC's future development to "maintain its
vitality and to make greater contributions to the regional and
world economic prosperity."
</P>
<P>
Stressing the enormous losses suffered by some members from the
Asian financial crisis, Jiang said "the most pressing common task"
of APEC is to "actively promote common economic prosperity in the
Asia-Pacific."
</P>
<P>
APEC should play its part in strengthening coordination and
dialogues on macro-economic policies among its members, especially
between developed and developing members, and in minimizing any
possible negative impact of economic globalization, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that APEC should also "actively deepen
regional economic and technical cooperation so as to lay a solid
foundation for medium- and long-term development of the Asia-
Pacific."
</P>
<P>
The third point, Jiang said, was to "actively and steadily push
forward the process of trade and investment liberalization and
promote a sound development of the multilateral trading system."
</P>
<P>
"As an organization that carries considerable weight in the
international economic affairs, APEC should contribute to the
protection of interests of all its members and the improvement of
the multilateral trading system." he added, while calling on all
APEC members to "actively strengthen the cooperation in the
international financial field and promote the establishment of a
new, fair and rational international financial order."
</P>
<P>
By quoting the unique "APEC approach" which is "different from
any other organization", Jiang also urged the members to "firmly
adhere to the right development direction of APEC and maintain the
vigor and vitality of the organization."
</P>
<P>
After raising his last point of "actively pressing ahead with
the mutually beneficial cooperation among APEC members," Jiang
wished the Asia-Pacific region a more prosperous future.

<P>

<HEADLINE> South African Swimmers Dominate All Africa Games Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heyns eased to victory in the women's 200 meters breaststroke
as South Africa again took all the gold medals on offer.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old local crowd favorite set a Games record of two
minutes 28.00 seconds, well outside her 2:23.64 world record.
</P>
<P>
On an evening when South Africa took five golds, four silvers
and posted three Games marks, Heyns was followed home in the event
by compatriot Sarah Poewe in 2:32.80. Lauren Harvey of Zimbabwe
finished third in 2:53.17.
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy with the time, especially since it was cold. We're
all pretty tired and the cold doesn't help," said Heyns, who along
with most of the South African squad members, peaked at the Pan
Pacific Championships in Sydney last month.
</P>
<P>
Heyns, who has stunned the world with nine world records in the
past eight weeks, said it was fun competing in front of local
spectators. "The atmosphere with the crowd was great... This is
going to be a highlight of the season for me. I wanted to swim
well in front of a home crowd."
</P>
<P>
In the most exciting race of the evening, Kim van Selm and
Kirsten van Heerden trailed Egyptian star Rania Elwani for nearly
150m before surging past her to give South Africa a gold-silver
finish in the women's 200m freestyle.
</P>
<P>
Van Selm clocked 2:05.50 and Van Heerden 2:06.15. Elwani, the
fastest woman in the 50m and 100m freestyle on the continent and
the defending title holder in 50m, 100m and 200m, took bronze in 2:
08.08.
</P>
<P>
This was the second consecutive disappointment for Elwani after
being upset by blonde dynamo Charlene Wittstock in the 100m
freestyle race on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's Ryna Kelly, Terence Parkin and the men's 4x200m
freestyle relay team claimed the other medals on the day.
</P>
<P>
After two days of swimming, South Africa has won 16 out of a
possible 17 medals, including all 10 golds.
</P>
<P>
In the boxing ring, two South Africans advanced to the quarter-
finals on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Flyweight Zolani Marali, South Africa's national champion for
three consecutive years, won through without having to trade a
single blow after the officials ruled a walkover because his
opponent was over the weight limit.
</P>
<P>
Welterweight Joseph Cordiero beat Joshua Okine of Ghana on
points with the judges awarding him 16-6.
</P>
<P>
The victory by two South African boxers means that hosts South
Africa now have three boxers in the quarter-finals, with
bantamweight boxer Silence Mabuza having won his bout earlier.
</P>
<P>
In soccer, the Cameroon under-23 team beat Zambia 2-0 in a
hotly-contested Group Two match at the Orlando Stadium. The win
virtually assured Cameroon of a semi-final place in the event.
</P>
<P>
In a game of fluctuating fortunes, Cote d' Ivoire beat
Mauritius 3-2 in another match in the same group at the Rand
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
The Ivorians were beaten 4-0 by Zambia in their first group
match on Friday and needed to beat the Mauritians to keep alive
their hopes.
</P>
<P>
They almost lost the script when they lost a 2-0 lead, but
bounced back to win through.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptians caused a major upset claiming four gold medals in
the rhythmic gymnastics individual finals on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Yasmin Lotfi swept three gold medals in the ropes, hoops and
ribbon while her compatriot, Sherin Taama, won the ball exercise.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's Michelle Cameron, who entered as favorite for
the gold medal haul, was totally out of synch, claiming only one
bronze in the ball.
</P>
<P>
She finished fourth in the other four disciplines, behind
teammate Jo-Anne Nelson who proved to be the surprise of the
evening with bronze in the ropes, hoops and ribbon.
</P>
<P>
South African Willem Phillips set a Games weightlifting record
with a snatch of 95.01 kg, easily bettering the previous record of
90.5 kg.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, the crowd was delighted with both Egyptian
Nagwan Elzawawe and Nigerian favorite Elizabeth Jeremiah setting
Games records in women's events.
</P>
<P>
In the snatch category the seventeen-year-old Nigerian applied
the pressure with a Games record of 100kg, but the Egyptian
matched her in the clean and jerk when both lifted 115kgs for
another Games mark.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Elzawawe, Jeremiah was again too good as she
went on to extend the record to 117kg, bringing her total up to
210kg.
</P>
<P>
Undeterred by the harsh weather, South Africa's netball Proteas
got off to a sizzling start on Sunday with a 80-23 win over a
gallant Tanzania. It also beat Kenya 63-26.
</P>
<P>
Other games of the day included a close contest between Malawi
and Botswana. The sturdy Malawians demonstrated good teamwork and
strong defense and went on to win 46-38.

<HEADLINE> Cause for Fatal Crash yet Unavailable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The officials are still in
search of the cause for the fatal crash which killed the rookie
driver Gonzalo Rodriguez of Uruguay at Laguna Seca Raceway.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Indy-car driver, who was driving a Mercedes-
powered Lola chassis for Team Penske, died of massive head and
neck injuries after his car hit a concrete wall at about 225 kph
during a practice for the Shell 300.
</P>
<P>
In a news release issued Sunday, Tim Mayer, CART senior vice
president for racing operations, said: "Initial data from the on-
board data recorders indicate a large and sustained frontal impact
in a manner never before seen in an accident on this corner.
</P>
<P>
"Other than frontal damage, the car was largely intact. There
was no intrusion into the driver compartment. There were no
observable impact marks on the helmet."
</P>
<P>
Speculation on the cause immediately focused on a stuck
throttle, but Mayer's report said, "While no conclusion may be
drawn, the mechanical function of the accelerator was intact upon
initial inspection following the accident."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Mercedes said Saturday that telemetry records
from the car proved the accident was not caused by a stuck
throttle as initially speculated.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was the first driver fatality in the CART series
since Jeff Krosnoff was killed in a crash during a race in Toronto
in July 1996.

<HEADLINE> Agassi Wins U.S. Open Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Andre Agassi fought from one
set down to beat never-say-die fellow American Todd Martin to win
the U.S. Open men's singles title here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Becoming one of the greatest players in tennis history, Agassi
captured his second U.S. Open title with a 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-7(2-7)
, 6-3, 6-2 win.
</P>
<P>
It is Agassi's fifth Grand Slam title and he ended the summer
by winning the French Open and was runner-up to Pete Sampras at
Wimbledon. No man since Ivan Lendl in 1986 had gone to three
straight Grand Slam finals in the same year.
</P>
<P>
No man had fought back to win the U.S. Open from a 2-1 deficit
in sets since John Newcombe in 1973, but Agassi did it
impressively well.
</P>
<P>
After losing the first set, the 29-year-old Martin fought even
with Agassi for the next two sets. But Agassi, who guaranteed
himself the No. 1 ranking after beating Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the
semi-finals, fought back strongly in the following two rubbers.
</P>
<P>
Agassi bore down Martin's big serve early in the fourth set and
broke him to change the tenor of the match.
</P>
<P>
Martin had 23 aces, 16 more than Agassi. "Andre, you played
great. You deserve it," Martin said after the match. "I couldn't
think of a better way to go out than play a great match against a
great champion," he added.
</P>
<P>
After receiving the winner's check for 750,000 U.S. dollars,
Agassi said: "I'll tell you what, how can you ask for anything
more than two Americans in the final of the U.S. Open playing a
great five-set match?"

XI'AN, September 13 (Xinhua)-- An injured golden eagle, which
is high on the state endangered species list, was rescued by a
farmer in northwest China's Shaanxi Province recently.
</P>
<P>
Ding Yijun, who lives in Longtan village of a mountain area in
southern Shaanxi, was working in his field when he found the
unusual bird, which had a badly injured right wing.
</P>
<P>
Ding took the bird home and contacted local wild-animal
protection workers, who examined it and confirmed it was the rare
apuila chrysaetos (golden eagle), a bird of prey found scattered
throughout China's northeast and northwest mountain.

Animal experts supervised the eagle's recovery, which lasted
about ten days.

<HEADLINE> Making Northeastern Chinese Desert Greener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, September 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 8,300 square
kilometers of desert near the Horqin Grassland in northeastern
China have been turned into pasture or forested areas in recent
years causing it to shrink 11 percent in a decade, according to
the Lanzhou Desert Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
The 150,000-sq. km. Horqin Grassland is on the western part of
the Northeast China Plain. It used to be grassland but because of
excessive exploitation, herding, and soil erosion in the past
century, nearly half the grassland had turned into desert by the
1980s, according to the Institute's Wang Tao.
</P>
<P>
In explaining the desert's encroachment in the past 30 years,
Wang says that the 1980s were the period of greatest expansion, by
which time the desert covered 71,000 sq. km., a 23 percent
increase from the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
He says that there needs to be a greater effort at improving
the ecology of the Horqin Grassland.

<HEADLINE> Full Text of Jiang's Speech at APEC Informal Leadership Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, New Zealand, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The following
is the full text of the speech delivered Monday by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin at the 7th Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) Informal Leadership Meeting.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jenny Shipley, Fellow Colleagues,
</P>
<P>
It gives me great pleasure to come to the picturesque city of
Auckland and attend this meeting. May I begin by expressing my
heart-felt thanks to Prime Minister Shipley for her kind
invitation and to the Government of New Zealand for its thoughtful
arrangements for the meetings.
</P>
<P>
This year marks the tenth anniversary of APEC. Over the decade,
thanks to the joint efforts of all its members, our organization,
adhering to its purposes of promoting economic cooperation and
achieving common prosperity, has grown in strength and become one
of the most important economic cooperation organizations in the
Asia-Pacific and even in the entire world. Taking a review of APEC
's course of development, I think there are five points that lead
to its success and that we could draw on.
</P>
<P>
First, APEC should keep to its nature as an economic forum and
focus on promoting the regional economic cooperation. This is
essential for APEC to play a positive role and maintain a full
vitality.
</P>
<P>
Second, APEC has gradually developed a unique cooperation
approach of its own, i.e., the universally recognized "APEC
approach". This approach recognizes diversity and stresses on
voluntarism, consensus, flexibility and gradual progress. Practice
proves that these principles are important factors ensuring
development of economic cooperation among APEC members in the
right direction.
</P>
<P>
Third, given the diversity of APEC members, APEC, instead of
imposing uniformity, has worked out two timetables for the
implementation of the trade and investment liberalization, taking
into account the disparity of economic development level of its
members and their different capacities to withstand the impact
that the liberalization process may produce.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, APEC should attach importance to ECOTEC and take
measures to promote scientific and technical exchanges and
cooperation and technology transfer and boost cooperation in other
areas such as the development of infrastructure and human
resources so that APEC's two wheels -- ECOTEC and the trade and
investment liberalization -- can move side by side and jointly
bring APEC forward.
</P>
<P>
Fifth, APEC members should conduct more studies and discussions
on financial issues in the light of changing circumstances and
take relevant measures to maintain normal financial order and
jointly prevent financial risks.
</P>
<P>
The twentieth century is coming to an end and the new century
is dawning upon the world. Where should APEC go in the new era?
This is a question that we leaders of APEC members are pondering
over now. The Asia-Pacific cannot develop in isolation of the rest
of the world. At present, the international situation is, on the
whole, still developing towards relaxation. But the world is not
yet tranquil. Neither of the two major tasks of the world, namely
peace and development, has been accomplished. Moreover, they are
faced with new challenges. Destabilizing and uncertain factors
have visibly increased. It is widely felt that the world we live
in is far from peaceful. Under such complex circumstances, we the
leaders are all the more required to work unswervingly to promote
the lofty cause of peace and development in the fundamental
interests of the people of our own nations and of the world, and
in keeping with the historical trend. We should build our homeland
of the Asia-Pacific into a region of peace, stability, development
and prosperity in the 21st century. There are now two tasks before
APEC: one is to firmly maintain peace and stability in the Asia-
Pacific; the other is to further promote the economic growth of
the region. APEC can and should play its due role in these two
aspects. I think that in order for APEC to maintain its vitality
and make greater contributions to the regional and world economic
prosperity, we should do a good job in the following six areas:
</P>
<P>
First, actively promote common economic prosperity in the Asia-
Pacific. All members of APEC have been affected by the Asian
financial crisis to a varying extent, and some members have
suffered enormous losses.
</P>
<P>
It is therefore a most pressing common task to overcome these
adverse impacts and promote common progress of all member
economies. APEC members, developing members in particular, should
continue to strengthen the readjustment and reform of their
respective economic structures. In the meantime, the developed
members on their part should make a vigorous effort to provide
favorable conditions, such as implementing a positive and
responsible fiscal and monetary policy and maintaining the
stability of major currencies, so as to help create a good
environment for an all-round development and prosperity of the
Asia-Pacific economy. APEC should play its part in strengthening
coordination and dialogues on macro-economic policies among its
members, especially between developed and developing members, and
in minimizing any possible negative impact of economic
globalization.
</P>
<P>
Second, actively deepen regional economic and technical
cooperation so as to lay a solid foundation for medium-and long-
term development of the Asia-Pacific. APEC members should always
bear in mind their long-term interests in their pursuit of
economic growth. They should place more emphasis on strengthening
their own capacity and pay greater attention to addressing the
deep-rooted problems that hinder the long-term regional economic
development. APEC should seek substantial progress in ECOTEC. To
be more specific, it should strengthen cooperation in areas such
as scientific and technical exchanges, human resources and
infrastructure development, improve the investment and trade
environment so as to ensure a stable and sustained development of
the Asia-Pacific economy.
</P>
<P>
Third, actively and steadily push forward the process of trade
and investment liberalization and promote a sound development of
the multilateral trading system. Considerable progress has been
made in the process of the APEC trade and investment
liberalization. To participate in the process, developing members
have made a great effort to overcome their many difficulties. It
is regrettable, however, in the aftermath of the Asian financial
crisis, trade protectionism of various sorts targeted at
developing countries has made a comeback. This is detrimental not
only to the economic recovery of the crisis-stricken members, but
also to the development of the multilateral trading system. And it
will do no good to the developed members either. APEC members,
especially the developed ones, should proceed from the overall
interest of the regional economic cooperation and take effective
measures to curb the trade protectionism, further open their
markets to developing members, and expand regional trade. The
World Trade Organization (WTO) has played an important role in the
growth of global trade, but it is still not as complete and
broadly representative as it should be. As an organization that
carries considerable weight in the international economic affairs,
APEC should contribute to the protection of interests of all its
members and the improvement of the multilateral trading system.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, actively strengthen the cooperation in the
international financial field and promote the establishment of a
new, fair and rational international financial order. Finance is
the core of modern economy. The stability of the international
finance bears on the immediate interests of all APEC members and
the stability and development of the regional economy. To ward off
financial risks and prevent the recurrence of financial crisis is
an important task for all members. In view of this, the financial
order should be reformed and improved, and efforts should be made
to ensure a safe and orderly operation of the international
financial market. In this connection, the developed members should
make greater efforts to strengthen the monitoring and regulation
of international capital flow, check any excessive speculation of
international hot money, and help developing members enhance their
ability to forecast and fend off such speculation. In the mean
time, the choice independently made by countries of regions
concerned on how to overcome the impact of financial crisis should
be well respected and no country should seek to impose its own
system and modality on others.
</P>
<P>
Fifth, firmly adhere to the right development direction of APEC
and maintain the vigor and vitality of the organization. APEC has
developed its unique "APEC approach" which is different from any
other organization. Adherence to this approach will lead APEC to
growth; any attempt to change or abandon it will inevitably result
in difficulties and setbacks for the development of APEC. Whatever
happens, we should stick to the basic principles of APEC, for only
by so doing can we make greater contribution to the stability and
prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Sixth, actively press ahead with the mutually beneficial
cooperation among APEC members. The decades following the end of
World War II witnessed a rapid rise of Third World countries. The
developing countries and regions in East Asia, in particular, have
created world-impressive economic miracles. Although developing
countries are still faced with many difficulties, they are and
have always been an important force on the international arena.
With vast territories, abundant resources and a large population,
developing countries have enormous potentials for development. To
strength South-South cooperation is the common aspiration of all
developing nations. And it is also an important issue in today's
international relations and represents the direction of historical
development and a symbol of world progress. The developing members
of APEC should all give full play to their respective strong
points and complement each other with their advantages. And they
should also develop and conduct a wide-ranging South-South
economic cooperation and promote common development and common
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
We are pleased to note that thanks to their hard efforts in the
past two years, the crisis-hit economies of some of the Asia-
Pacific countries have bottomed out, and are gradually recovering
and developing in a good direction. This is an encouraging
development. Let us join hands and seize this opportunity. Let us
strengthen mutual coordination and cooperation in the light of our
actual conditions and make unremitting efforts to promote all-
round economic development and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Thank you.

<HEADLINE> Unique Cooperation Approach Helps APEC Succeed: Chinese President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, New Zealand, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese
President Jiang Zemin on Monday listed the unique cooperation
approach and other four points that have led to APEC's success and
appealed to APEC members to adhere to them for the group's future
development.
</P>
<P>
"Taking a review of APEC's course of development, I think there
are five points that lead to its success and that we could draw on,
" Jiang said in a speech delivered at the 7th Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) Informal Leadership Meeting being held
here.
</P>
<P>
First, Jiang noted, APEC should keep to its nature as an
economic forum and focus on promoting the regional economic
cooperation. "This is essential for APEC to play a positive role
and maintain a full vitality," he said.
</P>
<P>
The second point is the unique cooperation approach APEC has
gradually developed during the past years, he stated.
</P>
<P>
"This approach recognizes diversity and stresses on voluntarism,
consensus, flexibility and gradual progress. Practice proves that
these principles are important factors ensuring development of
economic cooperation among APEC members in the right direction,"
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president also called on APEC members to adhere to
the two timetables for APEC members to implement trade and
investment liberalization, attach importance to ECOTEC and
cooperate in dealing with financial issues.
</P>
<P>
Given the diversity of APEC members, Jiang went on to say, APEC,
instead of imposing uniformity, has worked out two timetables for
the implementation of the trade and investment liberalization,
taking into account the disparity of economic development level of
its members and their different capacities to withstand the impact
that the liberalization process may produce.
</P>
<P>
Describing ECOTEC and the trade and investment liberalization
as "APEC's two wheels," Jiang urged APEC members to attach
importance to ECOTEC and take measures to promote scientific and
technical exchanges and cooperation and technology transfer and
boost cooperation in other areas such as the development of
infrastructure and human resources so that the two wheels can move
side by side and jointly bring APEC forward.
</P>
<P>
APEC members should conduct more studies and discussions on
financial issues in the light of changing circumstances and take
relevant measures to maintain normal financial order and jointly
prevent financial risks, he added.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Outlines Six Development Directions for APEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, New Zealand, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese
President Jiang Zemin outlined here Monday six development
directions of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) when
speaking at the 7th APEC Informal Leadership Meeting.
</P>
<P>
Noting the two tasks before the APEC, which include maintaining
peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific and further promoting the
economic growth of that region, Jiang raised six suggestions for
the APEC's future development to "maintain its vitality and to
make greater contributions to the regional and world economic
prosperity."
</P>
<P>
Stressing the enormous losses suffered by some member states
from the Asian financial crisis, Jiang said "the most pressing
common task" of the APEC is to "actively promote common economic
prosperity in the Asia-Pacific."
</P>
<P>
APEC should play its part in strengthening coordination and
dialogues on macro-economic policies among its members, especially
between developed and developing members, and in minimizing any
possible negative impact of economic globalization, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
And as trying to solve the most impending problem, Jiang
pointed out that the APEC should also "actively deepen regional
economic and technical cooperation so as to lay a solid foundation
for medium- and long-term development of the Asia-Pacific."
</P>
<P>
The third point, Jiang said, was to "actively and steadily push
forward the process of trade and investment liberalization and
promote a sound development of the multilateral trading system."
</P>
<P>
"As an organization that carries considerable weight in the
international economic affairs, APEC should contribute to the
protection of interests of all its members and the improvement of
the multilateral trading system." he added, while calling on all
APEC countries to "actively strengthen the cooperation in the
international financial field and promote the establishment of a
new, fair and rational international financial order."
</P>
<P>
By quoting the unique "APEC approach" which is "different from
any other organization", Jiang also urged the members to "firmly
adhere to the right development direction of APEC and maintain the
vigor and vitality of the organization."
</P>
<P>
After raising his last point of "actively pressing ahead with
the mutually beneficial cooperation among APEC members", Jiang
wished the Asia-Pacific region a more prosperous future.
