Boston pounds Chicago, 15-2
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Nomar Garciaparra had three of Boston's 17 hits to
extend his hitting streak to 24 games and Billy Ashley hit his
first career grand slam as the Red Sox beat the Chicago White Sox
15-2 Friday night.
	   One night after supporting Pedro Martinez with 15 runs on 20
hits, the Boston bats helped Tim Wakefield (10-3) become the third
10-game winner on the staff. Wakefield allowed two runs and five
hits, struck out seven and walked three to win his fourth
consecutive decision.
	   Mike Sirotka (8-8) gave up six runs _ four of them earned _ on
10 hits over four innings and Jason Bere gave up eight runs, three
earned, in two innings. The Red Sox scored in each of the first
seven innings before Scott Eyre retired the side in order in the
eighth _ only the second time Boston has gone down 1-2-3 in the
past 32 innings.
 &UR; Blue Jays 3, Devil Rays 2, 10 innings
	   In Toronto, Shannon Stewart had a two-out single in the 10th
inning to give Toronto a victory over Tampa Bay.
	   Stewart, who was 4-for-6, lined a 1-1 pitch from Esteban Yan
(4-2) into center field to score pinch-runner Juan Samuel from
third.
	   Randy Myers (3-2) pitched a hitless 10th for the victory.
	   Rookie Randy Winn went 4-for-4 for the Devil Rays, who tied it
at 2 in the eighth on Fred McGriff's bases-loaded sacrifice fly.
 &UR; Indians 2, Royals 1
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Manny Ramirez, named to the AL
All-Star team earlier in the day, hit two solo homers to spoil a
superb pitching performance by Jose Rosado.
	   Ramirez broke up Rosado's no-hit bid with a two-out homer in the
sixth and hit another homer in the ninth to break a 1-1 tie. They
were the only hits off Rosado (3-6), who struck out seven, walked
four and gave up the fewest hits of his career in a complete game.
	   Ramirez, a right fielder, was named as an All-Star replacement
for Bernie Williams of the New York Yankees, who has a strained
right knee.
 &UR; Yankees 3, Orioles 2
	   In New York, Chad Curtis stole third and scored on Scott
Brosius' one-out single in the ninth inning, leading Andy Pettitte
and the New York Yankees over the Baltimore Orioles.
	   In improving to 59-20, the Yankees set a record for the most
wins in the first half of the season since the inception of the
162-game schedule in 1961. The 1970 Cincinnati Reds went 58-23 in
their first 81 games.
	   Pettitte (10-5) limited the Orioles to four hits and improved to
9-1 in 13 career starts against Baltimore. The left-hander, forced
to pitch deep into the game because of a depleted Yankees bullpen,
walked six and struck out four in his third complete game.
	   Pettitte and Mike Mussina were locked in a pitcher's duel for
the first seven-plus innings. Mussina gave up seven hits in 7 1-3
innings, walking one and striking out nine.
 &UR; Tigers 5, Twins 4
	   In Minneapolis, Luis Gonzalez and Trey Beamon had two-out RBI
singles in the 10th inning to give the Detroit Tigers a victory
over the Minnesota Twins.
	   Gonzalez singled off Eddie Guardado to score Damion Easley, who
doubled off Dan Naulty (0-2). Beamon followed with a pinch-hit
single to score Tony Clark, who was intentionally walked before
Gonzalez's hit.
	   Doug Brocail (4-1) got three outs in the ninth, and Todd Jones
pitched the 10th for his 13th save, allowing a run on Matt Lawton's
RBI single.
 &UR; Mariners 8, Rangers 2
	   In Arlington, Texas, Jeff Fassero pitched 7 1-3 shutout innings,
and Edgar Martinez and Alex Rodriguez each drove in three runs as
Seattle extended Texas' losing streak to a season-long six games.
	   Fassero (7-5), who had won only one of his previous eight
starts, gave up only six hits as the Mariners won their third
straight. Bothered by leg cramps, he was pulled with one out in the
eighth and a runner on first.
	   The Rangers didn't score until the ninth, when Fernando Tatis
completed a 4-for-4 night with an RBI single off Heathcliff Slocumb
and Mark McLemore drew a bases-loaded walk from Bobby Ayala.

Strong aftershock causes panic in Turkey after fatal quake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADANA, Turkey (AP) _ A moderate earthquake panicked thousands of
people in southern Turkey early Saturday, just one week after a
stronger quake killed 144 people in the same region. There were no
immediate reports of injuries or damage.
	   The temblor, which struck at 05:15 a.m. (0215 GMT), had a
preliminary magnitude of 5.1, making it the strongest of more than
70 aftershocks that have followed last Saturday's magnitude-6.3
quake, Istanbul's Kandilli observatory said.
	   Most residents of this southern city and the nearby town of
Ceyhan _ the areas hit hardest last week _ have been sleeping
outdoors for fear of re-entering their damaged homes. But
Saturday's quake shook many residents from their beds in the nearby
province of Mersin.
	   The new quake affected a bigger section of Adana, with a
population of one million, than last week's temblor, according to
private TGRT television.
	   The magnitude-6.3 quake destroyed about 450 houses in Adana and
Ceyhan, injuring about 1,500 people.
	   Turkey's Aegean and Mediterranean coastal areas and the entire
eastern region sit atop the Anatolian fault.

Shoving match erupts in Mexico state congress
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's effort to stop election
irregularities degenerated into a melee on the floor of the
congress in the southern state of Yucatan.
	   Legislators shouted and shoved each other, and two reporters
were slightly injured in confrontations with security personnel,
the government news agency Notimex reported on Friday.
	   The quarrel erupted after members of the congress, which is
dominated by the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party,
refused to abide by an electoral tribunal's decision to give one of
the body's 25 seats to an opposition-party candidate. The tribunal
made its ruling due to irregularities in May 24 elections.
	   Congressional leaders also refused to overturn the results of
several mayoral elections in the state on the same grounds, arguing
that the mayors had already taken office.
	   The opposition National Action Party blamed the fight on the
ruling party's refusal to allow one of its congressmen to speak
about the election tribunal's ruling during the session.
	   ``The PRI not only buys votes and engages in election fraud in
Yucatan, but its congressmen also stage arbitrary acts of vandalism
acts in Congress,'' the National Action Party said in a press
statement.

Henderson hit solo homers as the Oakland Athletics continued their
success against first-place teams.
	   After finishing their interleague schedule by taking two of
three from the NL West-leading San Diego Padres, the Athletics beat
the AL West-leading Angels for only the second time in their last
17 meetings with help from Matt Stairs' three RBIs.
	   Anaheim is 0-3 this month after setting a club record with 22
victories in June, but the Angels still leads Texas by 3 1/2 games.
	   Tom Candiotti (5-10) earned his first victory in eight starts
since May 22. He allowed six runs and 10 hits in five-plus
innings.

Rail contract awarded to Japanese-Singapore joint venture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore on Saturday awarded a contract to
build a dlrs 386 million light rail project to a joint venture of
Japanese and local companies.
	   A consortium comprising Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.,
Mitsubishi Corporation and Singapore Technologies Industrial Corp.
will design and construct two Light Rapid Transit systems in
Singapore, the first by 2002 and the other by 2004.
	   The light rail lines will accommodate more than 150,000
passengers daily as feeder services to Singapore's main Mass Rapid
Transit rail system, which is also expanding throughout the island
republic.
	   The newly-awarded lines will run through the township
developments of Sengkang and Punggol, located in the western and
northern part of Singapore respectively.
	   The new lines will complement existing and future mass transport
in Singapore, said Communications Minister Mah Bow Tan before
awarding the contract.
	   Singapore has managed to avoid the congestion that plagues many
Asian capitals by limiting the number of privately owned cars and
operating an efficient network of trains, buses and taxis.

Thai caddies end railway blockade after new jobs promised
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A two-day blockade of a key railway
station by hundreds of caddies facing unemployment if the
government shuts their golf course has ended with pledges to find
them new jobs.
	   A spokesman for the State Railway of Thailand, which owns the
course, said the 428 caddies agreed Friday night to end their
blockade after the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration offered to
hire them all as city employees.
	   The caddies, supported by some railway workers, had blocked
northbound train lines for two days to protest the transformation
of the course into a park by the city, which is due to take it
over. Tens of thousands of passengers were stranded or
inconvenienced.
	   Since a change of administrations two years ago, Bangkok has
been trying to increase public parks. The capital has little green
space, and much of what exists is privately owned.
	   The caddies, faced with losing relatively well-paying jobs amid
Thailand's worst economic crisis in decades, launched a protest
late Thursday, sleeping on the tracks and seizing a train engine.
	   The Transport and Communications Ministry refused to meet their
demands that the railway either keep the course or to develop the
area. Bangkok already has a glut of commercial property.
	   The railway spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the transfer of the golf course to the city will be delayed by four
months to give the municipality time to find the caddies new work.
	   The caddies' demand that no legal action be taken against them
for blocking the railways was accepted.
	   Thailand's unemployment is expected to double to 2 million
workers this year, or about 6 percent of the work force.

Saudi man beheaded for murdering fellow tribesman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi Arabia has beheaded a man for
murdering a fellow tribesman, the al-Riyadh newspaper reported
Saturday.
	   Mohammed Marzouq al-Otaibi was convicted of fatally shooting
Eissa Ibrahim al-Otaibi after a dispute and executed Friday, the
paper said.
	   Al-Otaibi was beheaded in the province of Afeef, 400 kilometers
(248 miles) west of the capital Riyadh, the paper said.
	   His death brings to 13 the number of people beheaded in the
kingdom this year. Last year, 124 people were executed.
	   Saudi Arabia's Islamic courts impose the death sentence for
murder, rape, drug trafficking and armed robbery. Executions are
carried out with a sword and in public.
	   Human rights groups have criticized the executions, saying that
suspects do not receive fair trials, are denied lawyers and do not
have the right to appeal.

Bungling officials to be sacked as Vietnam lures investors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL ALEXANDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam will fire officials who create red
tape, open its insurance and services sectors to outside
competition and offer incentives to foreign investors, a top
official said Saturday.
	   The government also will ease restrictions on the percentage
that foreign companies can take in joint ventures, issue a decree
easing requirements for entry and exit visas and create a special
task force to tackle complaints immediately.
	   ``We need to bring down all obstacles and bring down the costs
of doing business in Vietnam to make it an attractive destination
for foreign investment,'' Vice Minister of Planning and Investment
Nguyen Nhac told a news conference.
	   Vietnam has not been hit as hard by the Asian economic crisis as
many of its neighbors, but the pain is increasing as the country
tries to resist deep devaluation.
	   ``The pace of growth in our countries is reducing,'' Nhac said
of the fallout from the economic crisis. ``It gets clearer and
clearer it has future implications on foreign investment in the
region.''
	   Foreign investment is down from last year; unemployment is
rising. Exports are shrinking. Billions of dollars in projects have
been put on hold. A loose legal system and a sagging banking system
constrain the decade-long Doi Moi economic reform program.
	   Nhac admitted Saturday to serious shortcomings, saying
devaluations elsewhere have taken away Vietnam's competitive
advantage and the country has to tackle corruption, become more
competitive and write clear, concise laws.
	   He agreed that investing here involves ``a number of risks and
difficulties,'' although the overall thrust of his comments was a
sales pitch.
	   ``We understand the need to make a profit,'' he said. ``We will
try to do our best to bring down the costs in both money and
time.''
	   One of the country's main problems is that different, often
opposing regulations can be applied to just about any major
business decision.
	   The goverment is trying to tackle the ambiguities, but the
system, which is conducive to bribery, has been slow to reform.
	   One or two 100 percent foreign-owned insurance companies will be
allowed to operate in Vietnam on a trial basis soon, Nhac said. The
country also will open up the services sector, including
entertainment services.
	   That could have the most visible impact because Nhac
specifically mentioned horse racing and betting may be allowed.
Currently, there's only a single dog track outside Ho Chi Minh
City.

Estrada government gears for resumption of peace talks with
</HEADLINE>
communist rebels

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The government of new President
Joseph Estrada wants to resume peace talks with communist rebels by
the end of the month, a senior official said Saturday.
	   The talks to end nearly three decades of communist insurgency
were initiated by former President Fidel Ramos in 1992.
	   The first major agreement on respect for human rights and
international humanitarian law was reached early this year, but was
not approved before Ramos stepped down on June 30 and Estrada took
over.
	   ``We want to resume this before the end of the month,''
presidential Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said.
	   Zamora said he plans to meet soon Luis Jalandoni, the chief of
the negotiating panel of the left-wing umbrella, National
Democratic Front.
	   Speaking in a radio talk show, Zamora said he met earlier with
Ramos' peace adviser, Manuel Yan, to discuss the composition of the
new government panel.
	   Estrada has said he wants to conclude the peace talks in one and
a half years.
	   The human rights accord was to be the first of four major
agreements leading to the final settlement. The others cover

South Korean government agrees to lower auto taxes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The government agreed Saturday to
lower taxes on cars and electronic goods to help boost domestic
sales of South Korea's battered conglomerates, presidential aides
said.
	   In return, the bloated business groups agreed to speed up their
plans to shed or swap subsidiaries to become leaner and more
focused operations, the aides said.
	   A severe financial crisis has driven up fuel and other consumer
prices. As a result, sharp drops in domestic sales have left
Hyundai, Daewoo, Samsung and other conglomerates with huge
inventories of cars and other unsold products.
	   That in turn is forcing those companies to lay off surplus
workers. This week, labor unions threatened to call a nationwide
strike later this month.
	   Meeting with heads of South Korea's major conglomerates,
President Kim Dae-jung agreed to lower taxes and expand government
spending to stimulate domestic consumption even if that would widen
this year's fiscal deficit to 4 percent of the country's gross
domestic product.
	   The government had earlier planned to limit its budget shortfall
this year to 1.7 percent of the GDP.
	   In exchange for a record dlrs 58 billion financial bailout
package from the International Monetary Fund, South Korea promised
to restructure its inefficient industries, especially its
conglomerates.
	   The conglomerates, known as chaebol, have been accused of
overexpanding and overdiversifying during the country's boom years
on bad loans won through collusion with government and bankers.
	   A typical South Korean conglomerate is controlled by a single
family and has 40 to 50 cross-funded subsidiaries.
	   On Saturday, President Kim chastised the conglomerates for
dragging their feet on slimming down, his chief spokesman, Park
Ji-won, said.
	   This week, South Korea's carmakers, all owned by conglomerates,
said they would cut production by 20 percent to 2.25 million cars
this year, the first decline since the country began producing cars
in the 1970s.
	   Nearly 70 percent of the people polled in recent surveys said
they have cancelled plans to buy new cars or other household goods.
	   Domestic car sales will drop by 45 percent to 820,000 cars this
year, according to forecasts by the government and industry
experts.
	   South Korea is the world's fifth largest auto producer.

 &UR; Army engineers build barricades to stop disputed Protestant march

	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ British army engineers
erected barbed-wire fencing and dug a moat through farm fields
Saturday in hopes of deterring thousands of Protestant Orangemen
from outflanking them and marching through a hostile Catholic area
nearby.
	   The handiwork of about 700 soldiers, using bulldozers and
diggers, underlined British authorities' apparent determination to
block Portadown's Orangemen when they try to march Sunday from the
rural Drumcree Anglican church back into the staunchly Protestant
town through its main Catholic area.
	   Soldiers and police also blocked every other road leading into
the Catholic area with armored cars and steel barricades. The scale
of the army operation was bigger than 1996, when the government
last ordered the town's 2,000 Orangemen not to raise sectarian
tensions with their annual march.
	   Two years ago, soldiers erected similiar fortifications through
the fields surrounding the high-steepled church. But determined
then as now to get their way, Northern Ireland's 80,000-strong
Protestant brotherhood massed in their tens of thousands at
Drumcree and blocked roads across Northern Ireland. After five days
of escalating mayhem the police caved in, forcing Catholic
protesters off the disputed Garvaghy Road.
	   In 1997, army engineers began erecting barricades at midnight
outside the church _ an effective ruse. When riot police and army
armored cars swamped Garvaghy Road three hours later they caught
most of the Catholic protesters sleeping. Four nights of furious
Catholic rioting followed across Northern Ireland.
	   This time the government passed responsibility to a new Parades
Commission of three Protestants and three Catholics led by an
Englishman, which again ordered Orangemen to avoid Garvaghy Road.
As part of its ruling, the commissioners said the Orangemen would
be breaking the law if they formed another round-the-clock mob at
the church.
	   Since 1807, the march each first Sunday of July has provided a
rallying point for Portadown Protestants. In recent years the
Orangemen have marched from their downtown hall to worship at the
rural church using a longer, noncontroversial route, then return by
the more direct Garvaghy Road. Their leaders insist they have
already been forced to concede too much and that the protesters'
real goal is to shame them.
	   For the first time, the sectarian hatred that this showdown
encourages has begun even before the march. Arsonists attacked 10
Catholic churches starting Wednesday night, followed by retaliation
on a Protestant church, an Orange hall and other properties. Two
Orange halls in Belfast 30 miles (50 kms) to the northeast and
Cookstown, 15 miles (25 kms) north, suffered minor damage from
gasoline bombs early Saturday.
	   The protesters, led by a former Irish Republican Army prisoner,
don't trust the predominantly Protestant police force or the army
to defend their interests. They plan to start their own human
blockade of Garvaghy Road at midday.
	   Earlier Saturday, details emerged of intensive but unsuccessful
shuttle diplomacy between protest leader Breandan MacCionnaith and
the Portadown Orangemen, involving a chain of intermediaries and
senior politicians.
	   Orangemen have refused to negotiate directly with MacCionnaith's
Garvaghy Road Residents Coalition since he started organizing
opposition to their parade in 1995.
	   The newly elected first minister of Northern Ireland's
cross-community Assembly, Ulster Unionist Party leader David
Trimble, said he tried negotiating ``at long distance'' with
MacCionnaith, who ``has proved to be totally intransigent, saying
no to every reasonable suggestion that was made.''
	   Trimble, an Orangeman himself who was elected Ulster Unionist
leader after championing the right of Protestants to march down
Garvaghy Road in 1995, offered no detail of what offers the
Orangemen made.
	   MacCionnaith said he told Trimble's confidential emissary that
Garvaghy Road residents would consider allowing Orangemen to march
in 1999 if the they backed off now and got into direct
negotiations. But this suggestion was rejected, he said.
	   ``If the Orange Order had responded and had rerouted voluntarily
on Sunday ... it would have transformed the situation,''
MacCionnaith said. ``And I think there could have been steps taken
to ensure some form of Orange presence on the Garvaghy Road at some
time in the future.''

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore on Saturday awarded a contract for a
dlrs 386 million light rail project to a joint venture of Japanese
and local companies.
	   A consortium comprising Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.,
Mitsubishi Corporation and Singapore Technologies Industrial Corp.
will design and construct two Light Rapid Transit systems in
Singapore, the first by 2002 and the other by 2004.
	   The light rail lines will accommodate more than 150,000
passengers daily as feeder services to Singapore's main Mass Rapid
Transit rail system, which is also expanding throughout the island
republic.
	   The newly-awarded lines will run through the township
developments of Sengkang and Punggol, both located in northern part
of Singapore.
	   The new lines will complement existing and future mass transport
in Singapore, said Communications Minister Mah Bow Tan before
awarding the contract.
	   Singapore has managed to avoid the congestion that plagues many
Asian capitals by limiting the number of privately owned cars and
operating an efficient network of trains, buses and taxis.

Newspapers call Clinton visit a success

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton had a little praise
for nearly everyone on his brief stopover in struggling Hong Kong,
and left behind encouragement for business as well as the
pro-democracy movement.
	   Clinton did not offer concrete help to Hong Kong, which along
with much of the rest of Asia has slipped into recession. However,
the positive words were a welcome contrast to the gloom pervading
the territory.
	   ``The first visit by a U.S. president in office has provided a
helpful tonic at a time when Hong Kong is suffering unprecedented
economic pain,'' said the South China Morning Post in an editorial
Saturday.
	   During his 24-hour stopover, which ended late Friday, Clinton
told business leaders that Hong Kong served as a ``force of
stability ... that can help to lead Asia'' out of its economic
crisis.
	   The Hong Kong government recently unveiled a 32-billion Hong
Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 4.1 billion) economic program that included
tax rebates and a freeze on land sales.
	   Despite complaints that the government may have buckled to
pressure from big property developers, who don't want to see sales
going through when prices are in a downward spiral, analysts say
the halt to land sales may stabilize prices.
	   ``No one could have predicted what you would have to endure
today in the form of this crisis,'' Clinton told the business
leaders. ``I am confident Hong Kong will get through this.''
	   Clinton declared that political rights and economic prosperity
are intertwined, comments that will be taken here as a caution to
preserve Hong Kong's autonomy and rule of law after last year's
handover to China.
	   Most observers agree that China largely has kept hands off.
Advocates of more democracy still are cautious about the future,
and are pressing for a faster transition to a more representative
government. Only a third of the legislature elected in May was
chosen by direct, popular vote.
	   ``That he made these remarks ... was intended to show the world
that Hong Kong is still an open, free society, that the basic
freedoms and the rule of law, which President Clinton observed were
crucial to guarantee stability, exist here,'' said the Hong Kong
Standard.
	   In a show of support for democratic reformers, Clinton met with
Martin Lee, leader of the Hong Kong government's main opposition,
the Democratic Party.
	   After the 20-minute, one-on-one session, Clinton met with other
Hong Kong political leaders, including Democrats and other
pro-democracy politicians who were winners in the first elections
since the territory returned to Chinese rule.
	   Despite a lack of specifics in the meeting, the Post hailed it
as reassurance for the pro-democracy camp that U.S. support ``will
not be sacrificed for the sake of better relations with China.''
	   None of those who met Clinton on Friday was among the two-thirds
in the legislature elected by means other than direct, popular vote
_ voting by professions and an 800-member electoral commission.

Trade fair opens in Indonesian capital amid economic gloom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ In a nation where jobs and money are
growing harder to find, the annual Jakarta trade fair is unlikely
to bustle this year.
	   The fair opens this weekend in the capital of 10 million with
just 235 registered participants, down 85 percent from last year.
	   The idea is to promote Indonesian products to consumers from
around the world, but a throng of Chinese, Japanese and other
companies here last year are missing this time.
	   Shoes, garments and other items will be on display at the fair,
which runs until Aug. 2 and is being held on the grounds of an old
airport.
	   Indonesia's currency turmoil has erased many of the gains made
during three decades of economic growth. It also helped oust
authoritarian President Suharto, who quit in May following student
protests and riots over price increases.
	   Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, has pledged
political reform but the economy remains hobbled. Habibie was
scheduled to open the fair in a ceremony later Saturday.

Memories of coup turns some voters against Hun Sen
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Than Ritha wipes away tears as she
talks about her niece, killed by shrapnel that pierced her kidney
during a bloody coup launched a year ago Sunday.
	   She and others in a Phnom Penh suburb _ the terror of last
year's fighting still fresh in their minds _ say that when
elections come July 26, few will be voting for the man they blame
for the violence: Hun Sen.
	   A year after Hun Sen overthrew his co-premier Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, resentment against his troops still runs deep in some
parts of the capital, and could cost him support in upcoming
elections.
	   Than Ritha said soldiers loyal to the Cambodian strongman
refused to let her family retrieve her niece's body from the garden
where it lay until they had finished looting nearby homes _ three
days after she was killed.
	   ``I'm very angry,'' says Than Ritha, 46, who has a metal splint
on her leg, a result of her own shrapnel wound. ``Even if someone
has to carry me to the polling station on election day, I will
go.''
	   Though she has little faith the elections will be free or fair,
Than Ritha and many others in their suburb, Psar Daemkor, where the
fighting was heaviest, want to vote for a new leader.
	   Some want Ranariddh to lead the country. Others prefer outspoken
government critic Sam Rainsy. Few want Hun Sen _ but many fear
there will be renewed fighting if he loses, complicating their
choice.
	   On July 5, 1997, Hun Sen launched his stronger military forces
against Ranariddh's supporters in the capital after weeks of
tension between their factions.
	   In two days of fighting, Hun Sen succeeded in deposing Ranariddh
as his co-prime minister, shattering an arrangement set up after
the United Nations sponsored elections in 1993.
	   Since last year's takeover, Hun Sen has claimed he was trying to
prevent Ranariddh from staging his own coup in alleged league with
former Khmer Rouge guerrillas.
	   The allegations were never proven, though Ranariddh was
convicted in a show trial in March as a precondition to letting him
return from exile to contest the new elections.
	   Hun Sen hopes new polls will restore legitimacy and foreign aid
lost after his takeover. But the electoral bodies are packed with
Hun Sen's supporters and he is accused of using violence to
terrorize his opponents and voters.
	   In the past week, the prince has crisscrossed the country vying
for votes, often drawing huge, enthusiastic crowds.
	   Saturday, hundreds of boisterous supporters in trucks and on
motorcycles drove through Phnom Penh waving flags with the prince's
portrait and cheering, ``FUNCINPEC,'' name of his royalist party.
	   Such rallies do not make the regular broadcast news, controlled
by Hun Sen. The opposition parties are limited to five-minute daily
slots on radio and television.
	   Amnesty International human rights group issued a statement that
it was ``a disgrace'' that none of the killings of about 100
Ranariddh supporters in the months after the coup has resulted in
an arrest or prosecution.

Police general linked to illegal killings sues boss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai police general who oversaw an
operation in which six alleged drug dealers were killed in custody
has sued his superior after being suspended.
	   Police Gen. Salang Bunnag, deputy chief of the national police,
sued Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart on Friday on charges of
harassment, defamation and abusing his power.
	   The lawsuit came immediately after Sanan relieved Salang of his
duties following a probe into the general's criticism of a ministry
investigation into the November 1996 killings.
	   The investigation concluded that the suspects were illegally
executed and recommended punishing the officers involved, though
Salang, who was in charge of the operation, was not targeted.
	   However, Salang's criticism of the probe as a politically
motivated grudge by Sanan was the subject of a new inquiry that led
to Friday's suspension and an upcoming disciplinary hearing.
	   The six suspects surrendered after a violent daylong standoff
with police in which an officer was wounded.
	   They were led in handcuffs out of a house where they had been
holed up then, as TV news cameras recorded the event, inexplicably
turned around and marched back into the house.
	   Shots rang out and the six were again eventually taken out of
the house _ wrapped in sheets, with bloodstains indicating they had
been shot in the head.
	   Salang, who has been a prominent right-wing figure for decades,
brushed off criticism at the time by saying of the suspects:
``Their cases have been closed.''
	   He claimed that the suspects were taken back into the house to
show where weapons where hidden but when the handcuffs were
removed, they grabbed the guns and the police were forced to kill
them.
	   The case was criticized internationally as a human-rights abuse.
Salang was spared disciplinary action at the time, but the
government of Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai that took power in
November is not close to him and reopened the case.
	   Sanan, probably the second most powerful figure in the
government, launched the probe and relieved the general of his
duties Friday.
	   Salang told reporters that he was not surprised will continue to
remain with the police force until his planned retirement in
October.
	   Salang announced he was setting up a foundation to help officers
harassed by politicians and said the prosecutions would demoralize
police in their fight against drugs.

Strong aftershock injures hundreds in Turkey after fatal quake

<TEXT>
	   ADANA, Turkey (AP) _ An earthquake injured 527 people in
southern Turkey on Saturday, just one week after a deadly quake
rocked the same region, a news report said.
	   Most of those injured by the 5.1-magnitude temblor were hurt
jumping in a panic from windows or off balconies. No fatalities
were immediately reported, and the extent of any physical damage
was not available, the semi-official Anatolia news agency said.
	   The quake, which struck at 05:15 a.m. (0215 GMT), was the
strongest of more than 70 aftershocks that have followed last
Saturday's magnitude-6.3 quake, Istanbul's Kandilli observatory
said. The earlier quake killed 144 people.
	   Most residents of this southern city and the nearby town of
Ceyhan _ the areas hit hardest last week _ have been sleeping
outdoors for fear of re-entering their damaged homes. But
Saturday's quake shook many residents from their beds in the nearby
province of Mersin.
	   The quake affected a bigger section of Adana, which has a
population of one million, than last week's temblor, according to
private TGRT television. Adana is 490 kilometers (300 miles) south
of the capital, Ankara.
	   Last week's quake destroyed about 450 houses in Adana and Ceyhan
and injured about 1,500 people.

Pro-independence protesters rally in remote Indonesian province
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Pro-independence activists in a town
in the Indonesian province of Irian Jaya rallied around a rebel
flag Saturday despite a military order to take it down.
	   The protest in Biak was the latest in a string of rallies in
Irian Jaya in the last few days. Demonstrators have clashed with
security forces in Jayapura, the provincial capital, and other
towns, and officers have shot and killed a student.
	   The independence movement in Irian Jaya is not as widespread as
in the former Portuguese colony of East Timor, where soldiers shot
two protesters last week.
	   However, seizing on a new climate of political reform in the
wake of the May resignation of President Suharto, activists in
remote, copper-rich Irian Jaya are becoming more vocal.
	   On Saturday, they gathered around a flagpole in Biak, 3,200
kilometers (2,000 miles) northeast of the capital, Jakarta. For
three days, the flag of a small pro-independence rebel group called
the Free West Papua Movement has flown from the pole.
	   There were no reports that the Indonesian military had acted on
a warning to the protesters to pull down the flag, which is blue
and white with a big star.
	   Indonesia sent troops into Irian Jaya, a former Dutch colony, in
1963. Six years later, in a U.N.-sponsored vote, people in the
territory formally chose integration with Indonesia.

China and Kazakstan reach border settlement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) _ China and Kazakstan Saturday signed an
agreement that brings a long-standing border dispute to an end.
	   ``We have completely and finally solved all questions about the
border,'' Chinese President Jiang Zemin said at a joint news
conference with Kazak President Nursultan Nazerbayev.
	   China and Kazakstan share a 1,700-kilometer (1,200 miles) border
and have disagreed over sovereignty of two areas in the
southeastern east and northeastern regions of Kazakstan.
	   ``Border disagreements are always delicate,'' Nazarbayev said.
``They are the roots of all conflicts.''
	   Kazak Foreign Minister Kasymzhomart Tokayev said earlier that
the agreement gave both sides about equal portions of the disputed
territory. ``If you look at the total territory in dispute as 100
percent, then you can say it was divided 50-50,'' he said.
	   The two presidents, winding up a five-nation summit meeting,
agreed to work out a 15-year program of economic cooperation and
discussed the possibility of building a gas pipeline from
Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakstan to China.

Ruling coalition gets reprieve with ally deciding to continue
</HEADLINE>
support

<TEXT>
	   MADRAS, India (AP) _ Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's shaky
coalition government won a temporary reprieve Saturday when a
crucial ally that had considered withdrawing its support decided,
for now, to preserve the status quo.
	   Leaders of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazagham, which
controls 30 lawmakers in the 545-member parliament, met briefly in
this southern city and announced they would continue backing the
3-month-old government. The party's votes are crucial for the
survival of Vajpayee's coalition, which holds a narrow majority in
parliament.
	   The party's president, Jayaram Jayalalitha, is trying to
pressure Vajpayee into dismissing the government in her southern
home state of Tamil Nadu. The state government is controlled by
Jayalalitha's rivals.
	   ``There is no question of going back on that demand,'' said
party leader V.R. Nedunchezhiyan.
	   Soon after Saturday's meeting, Jayalalitha met with an emissary
of powerful northern Indian leaders who oppose Vajpayee's Bharatiya
Janata Party and are talking to the main opposition Congress party
about forming an alternative government.
	   Buta Singh, a former cabinet minister in Vajpayee's government
who was forced to resign over charges of corruption, said he would
welcome Jayalalitha into an anti-BJP group.
	   The BJP and its allies control 249 of 545 seats in India's
parliament. The once dominant Congress party and its partners
control 191 seats, and the centrist United Front, 75.
	   Congress has said it will not try to pull down the BJP-led
government through a no-confidence vote. It will step in, Congress
President Sonia Gandhi has said, only if the Vajpayee government
collapses from ``inner contradictions.''

Newspapers call Clinton's China visit a success

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton had a little praise
for nearly everyone on his brief stopover in struggling Hong Kong,
and left behind encouragement for business as well as the
pro-democracy movement.
	   Clinton did not offer concrete help to Hong Kong, which has
slipped into recession with much of the rest of Asia. However, the
positive words were a welcome contrast to the gloom pervading the
territory.
	   ``The first visit by a U.S. president in office has provided a
helpful tonic at a time when Hong Kong is suffering unprecedented
economic pain,'' the South China Morning Post said in an editorial
on Saturday.
	   The president and his family arrived at Andrews Air Force Base,
Maryland, outside Washington, early Saturday following a refueling
stop in Alaska. The 24-hour stopover in Hong Kong ended the
president's nine-day visit to China, which the People's Daily _
official newspaper of China's Communist Party _ said was ``a firm
step in building a constructive, strategic China-U.S.
partnership.''
	   ``The improvement and development of China-U.S. relations
conforms to the trend of the times and cannot be hampered by any
force,'' ran the People's Daily commentary on Saturday.
	   Before leaving Hong Kong on Friday, Clinton told business
leaders that it served as a ``force of stability ... that can help
to lead Asia'' out of its economic crisis.
	   The Hong Kong government recently unveiled a 32-billion Hong
Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 4.1 billion) economic program that included
tax rebates and a freeze on land sales.
	   Despite complaints that the government may have buckled under
pressure from big property developers, who don't want to see sales
going through when prices are in a downward spiral, analysts say
the halt to land sales may stabilize prices.
	   ``No one could have predicted what you would have to endure
today in the form of this crisis,'' Clinton told the business
leaders. ``I am confident Hong Kong will get through this.''
	   Clinton declared that political rights and economic prosperity
are intertwined, comments that will be taken here as a caution to
preserve Hong Kong's autonomy and rule of law after last year's
handover to China.
	   Most observers agree that China largely has kept hands off Hong
Kong. Advocates of more democracy still are cautious about the
future and are pressing for a faster transition to a more
representative government. Only a third of the legislature elected
in May was chosen by direct, popular vote.
	   ``That he made these remarks ... was intended to show the world
that Hong Kong is still an open, free society, that the basic
freedoms and the rule of law, which President Clinton observed were
crucial to guarantee stability, exist here,'' the Hong Kong
Standard said in an editorial today.
	   In a show of support for democratic reformers, Clinton met with
Martin Lee, leader of the Hong Kong government's main opposition,
the Democratic Party. Lee said the president's trip was a ``very
good opening for dialogue.''

Singapore and Malaysia's latest dispute is over traffic fines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Forget territorial conflicts, water supplies
and other weighty diplomatic disputes. Asian neighbors Singapore
and Malaysia are squabbling over unpaid traffic fines.
	   Malaysians owe millions of dollars in fines to Singapore,
according to a newspaper report Saturday.
	   More than 260,000 traffic and parking tickets totaling 8.1
million Singapore dollars (dlrs 4.76 million) issued to drivers of
foreign-registered cars between 1995 and 1997 have not been paid,
The Straits Times reported.
	   Malaysian motorists driving in neighboring Singapore are
responsible for most of the fines, said Minister of Foreign Affairs
Wong Kan Seng.
	   Trucks, buses, cars and motorcycles flow heavily in both
directions between the two Southeast Asian countries, which are
linked by a causeway and a bridge.
	   Wong disclosed the figures Friday in response to a question
posed in Parliament earlier this week, elevating foreigners' unpaid
fines into a bilateral issue.
	   News reports in the southern Malaysian state of Johor have in
past months criticized Singaporeans for not settling their traffic
fines, saying more than 7,000 summonses were outstanding.
	   State politicians in Malaysia had proposed a ban on Singapore
drivers who do not pay the penalties.
	   Speaking in Parliament on Monday, Wong said Singapore motorists
should settle the fines, though he emphasized that foreigners
committing infractions in Singapore are equally obliged to pay up.
	   Singapore and Malaysia suffer occasionally testy relations. Both
claim an island near their shores, and have been unable to resolve
a number of issues ranging from the supply of water to the island
republic to the future of some land in Singapore still owned by
Malaysia.

Dispute ends over Taiwan's first high-speed railway project
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A Taiwanese consortium backed by German
and French technology settled a dispute Saturday with the
government over the construction of a 430 billion Taiwan dollar
(U.S. dlrs 12.6 billion) high-speed railroad.
	   Vice Transport Minister Chen Shih-yi said the ministry expects
to sign a formal contract with the Taiwan HSR Consortium later this
month after both sides agreed to let an independent agency
arbitrate any future disputes.
	   Under an initial agreement signed last September, the consortium
will build the 330-kilometer (205-mile) line on land provided by
the government and will have the right to operate it for 30 years.
The line runs north-south between Taipei and Kaohsiung.
	   Ying Chi, chairman of the consortium, told a news conference the
introduction of an arbitrary agency has reduced its uncertainties
over the project.
	   The group has accused authorities for failing to make land
available for building the train stations as agreed earlier. It
wanted to have the right to unilaterally terminate the contract if
the government makes further delays.
	   Because of the dispute, the Transport Ministry failed to sign
the contract with the joint venture between five local
conglomerates, German Siemens AG and French GEC Alsthom on
Wednesday as was originally scheduled.
	   The dispute triggered speculations that the government was under
pressure to award the contract to a rival bidder, Chunghwa HSR
Consortium, which has proposed to build the project after Japan's
Shinkansen bullet train.
	   Newspapers have also said Taiwan HSR might pull out because it
might not receive loans from banks, which have expressed concern
that the weakened Taiwan dollar would significantly increase the
project's costs.
	   The Taiwan dollar has dropped about 20 percent in value because
of the regional financial crisis.
	   Ying said the consortium has set aside a fund to cover foreign
exchange losses and will be capable of completing the project.
	   Construction of the project is scheduled to begin later this
year, with service starting in 2003.

Policeman killed in land mine blast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ One policeman was killed and another was
critically wounded when their patrol car drove over a camouflaged
land mine in North Ossetia, a news agency said Saturday.
	   The two officers were on patrol in the disputed Prigorodny
district when the mine exploded, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
The force of the blast sent wreckage flying 50 meters (yards), the
report said.
	   The Prigorodny region is near the border with Ingushetia, with
whom North Ossetia fought a short by bloody territorial and ethnic
war in 1992. Each republic claims the Prigorodny region as their
own.

Weapon sales earning Russia cash, plus protests, maybe sanctions

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Undeterred by protests and possible sanctions,
Russia is barreling ahead with arms sales and nuclear projects in
some of the world's most volatile regions, earning badly needed
cash but straining relations with the United States.
	   Russia has been accused recently of providing missile technology
to India, Iran and Iraq. It's selling an anti-aircraft missile
system to Cyprus and fighter planes to China and is building a
nuclear power plant in Iran.
	   The United States and Israel, the most vocal critics of Russia's
increasingly aggressive sales, fear the arms will fuel tensions in
already jittery regions _ even though Washington supplies weapons
to other nations in some of the same areas.
	   One big worry is that Iran may use Russian nuclear power plant
technology to advance its suspected atomic weapons program. Those
fears took on new urgency when Pakistan and India, longtime rivals
in the same region, joined the nuclear arms club.
	   Russia also has spoken out against arms and nuclear
proliferation. But at the same time, Moscow is attracted to the
money and the opportunity to regain some of the influence the
Soviet Union wielded as a superpower.
	   ``First of all, it's money,'' said military analyst Pavel
Felgenhauer, who writes for the respected newspaper Segodnya.
``Second of all, it's money, and third of all, also money.''
	   Weapons bring big dollars into Russia's empty coffers and jobs
to depressed regions that are just as dependent on the military
industry today as they were in the Soviet era.
	   ``This creates a lot of political pressure to sell to anyone,''
Felgenhauer said.
	   This year Russia expects to export dlrs 3.5 billion worth of
weapons to 58 countries, an increase of dlrs 1 billion over 1997,
according to the state arms trading company, Rosvooruzheniye.
	   It hopes to export at least dlrs 5 billion annually by 2000, and
possibly more.
	   Russia says it is doing nothing wrong. And many Russians see a
double-standard in Washington's protests. The Russians note the
United States sells weapons to countries in potential hotspots,
including Israel, Taiwan, Greece and Turkey.
	   ``If America can sell to everyone, why can't we sell to
everyone?'' asked Felgenhauer.
	   Russia has denied some of the recent reported arms deals,
including U.S. claims it was helping India build a sea-launched
ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead deep into
Pakistan.
	   It said other arms sold were for defensive purposes, such as the
dlrs 200 million anti-aircraft missile system for the Greek portion
of the divided island of Cyprus.
	   Nuclear projects like the power plant under construction in Iran
are said to be for purely peaceful purposes.
	   However, Russia acknowledges Iran has tried to obtain technology
for long-range missiles. Moscow says all the efforts were rebuffed,
but the U.S. Senate recently voted to impose sanctions on Russia
for allegedly sharing missile technology with Iran.
	   A Russian think tank, PIR-Center for Policy Studies, said
recently that 800 Russian gyroscopes used to guide missiles to
their targets were intercepted in 1995 en route to Iraq, in
violation of U.N. sanctions.
	   Russia initially denied involvement but later said the equipment
was exported without government permission, raising questions about
how much control the Kremlin has over the arms and nuclear
stockpile inherited from the Soviet Union.
	   Protests from Washington have had some effect.
	   President Boris Yeltsin said he has cracked down on the export
of ``dual-use'' technology that can be used for both military and
civilian purposes. The Russian security service has distributed a
list of foreign companies that may be trying to help other nations
develop nuclear arms.
	   ``It's good to hear these intentions being articulated,'' said
Alistair Millar at the British American Information Council, a
Washington think tank that concentrates on arms issues.
	   ``However, one has to look at this realistically and question
whether he really has effective control to actually make the
changes he recommends, so one should always take this with an
optimistic pinch of salt.''
	   Millar said the West would have more clout if it weren't
creeping toward Russia's borders by expanding NATO.
	   ``They don't feel as constrained as they perhaps would have done
if they weren't facing the prospect of a military alliance moving
on to their borders,'' he said.

Iraq says U.S. holding up contracts for oil spare parts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq accused the United States Saturday of
blocking U.N. approval for 40 contracts it signed with
international firms to supply spare parts for its oil industry.
	   The U.N. Security Council agreed last month to allow Iraq to
purchase dlrs 300 million in spare parts and equipment to boost oil
production.
	   Oil Minister Lt. Gen. Amer Mohammed Rashid said that despite the
council's approval, the U.N. sanctions committee has not reached
agreement yet on how to process the contracts. He blamed Washington
for the delay.
	   ``The U.S. administration hinders anything positive that will be
of benefit to the Iraqi people,'' Rashid told a news conference.
	   Rashid made the remarks following a meeting with his Jordanian
counterpart, Mohammed Saleh al-Hourani, who arrived in Baghdad
Thursday to discuss Iraq's supply of oil to Jordan.
	   ``We have almost no spare parts now,'' Rashid said. ``We are
running at a very critical level in terms of production.''
	   U.N. trade sanctions imposed against Iraq after its 1991
invasion of Kuwait bar Iraqi oil exports except for limited sales
whose proceeds must be used to purchase food, medicine and other
humanitarian goods.
	   The council decided in February to allow Iraq to boost the value
of those sales from dlrs 2 billion each six months to dlrs 5.2
billion.
	   Restrictions on Iraqi oil exports will only be lifted when U.N.
weapons inspectors certify that Baghdad has eliminated all its
illegal weapons.

World Cup: Another shootout disappointment for Italy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy on Saturday was suffering the World Cup
shootout blues for the third straight time.
	   But while disappointment was rife in this soccer-mad nation, so
was the sense that the beloved Azzurri got what they deserved in
Friday's quarterfinal loss to cup host France.
	   ``Penalty kicks are an invention of the devil,'' Gazzetta dello
Sport editor Candido Cannavo wrote in a front-page column, ``but
this time our right to detest them is very questionable.''
	   In a reference to the Azzurri's defense-first tactics, the
newspaper's front page had the banner headline: ``France is better
... Adieu `Fort Italy.'''
	   Unlike most countries, where thoughts of a world title are
harbored but not necessarily believed, Italians truly expect a
championship each and every four years. They have been right three
times, but not since 1982.
	   Another of the sports dailies, Corriere dello Sport, blared on
its front page, ``Cursed penalties. But it also is our fault.''
	   Editor Mario Sconcerti summed up the feelings of most Italians
with one line. ``We were very unlucky,'' he wrote, ``but not
good.''
	   This time, Italy's World Cup hopes went awry with a Luigi Di
Biagio penalty smacking the crossbar, handing France a 4-3 win in
the shootout after 120 minutes of scoreless play. Four years ago,
Italy lost the title match to Brazil when Roberto Baggio sent the
final penalty high. And, as hosts in 1990, Italy suffered a similar
fate, losing on penalties to Argentina after their semifinal match
ended 1-1.
	   No sooner had Di Biagio slumped to the ground after his errant
shot than talk in Italy turned to tactics and coach Cesare
Maldini's job status.
	   While the team's return home might not be met with tossed
tomatoes _ as infamously occurred at Milan's Linate airport after
Italy was shockingly defeated by North Korea during the 1966 World
Cup _ the ever-fragile relationship with the fans suffered a blow.
	   ``The red thread that was slowly tying the Italians to Italy's
team has been broken,'' Sconcerti wrote.
	   ``To only defend and look for the long pass or the counterattack
are solutions that are too fragile for the final phase of the World
Cup,'' he added. ``And they have value only if the team wins in the
end.''
	   It didn't, and the fans' bitterness was tangible.
	   ``There's just no luck. When it comes to penalties, Italy has no
luck,'' said Nicola Ambrosini, owner of La Tavernelle, a restaurant
within sight of the Colosseum that the late film director Federico
Fellini used to frequent. ``Somebody has to miss. It's so random,
it's painful. Maybe if they had tried to win before the penalties.
... No one is happy now.''
	   The painful wait until 2002 has begun.

Arabs demonstrate against Greek Orthodox Church land deals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IMAD MUSA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ About 300 Greek Orthdox Christians from the
West Bank and Israel protested Saturday against the church's land
deals with Israeli and western companies.
	   The Arab demonstrators issued a statement condemning the recent
sale of church-owned land in Jaffa ``without our approval or
knowledge.''
	   ``This is an issue of land and existence. For Palestinians, land
is a symbol of our lasting presence here,'' said Marwan Toubasi,
head of the Arab Orthodox Conference, which was set up to protest
the church's policies.
	   The Greek Orthodox patriarch of Jerusalem, Diodoros, was out of
the country for medical treatment. Officials at the patriarchate
declined comment.
	   The demonstrators, who came to Jerusalem from as far as the
northern Israeli towns of Nazareth and Acre, held up placards
reading, ``Hands off Orthodox Church property.''
	   The Palestinian Authority director of Christian Affairs, Ibrahim
Qandalaft, said the church was ``investing its real estate, not
selling it away.'' Toubasi said it didn't matter whether the land
was sold or rented. ``The end result is Jewish settlement of our
land,'' he said.
	   The Christian population in Israel, reduced by years of
migration, is estimated at 120,000, compared to 800,000 Muslims and
4.1 million Jews. About 30,000 Christians live among the 2.8
million Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.

World Cup fans compete with French vacation departures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ World Cup fans heading for quarterfinal matches
Saturday squeezed into packed trains and onto highways clogged with
hundreds of thousands of French people leaving on summer vacation.
	   About 830,000 French people were expected to take the train
Saturday to start their summer holidays. They will be joined by
about 100,000 soccer fans trying to get to Marseille and Lyon.
	   Germany plays Croatia in Lyon on Saturday night, while in
Marseille, the Netherlands meets Argentina in quarterfinal World
Cup play.
	   The state SNCF train company said 1,500 trains will be in
service Saturday, including about 960 high-speed TGV trains.
	   On highways, many of the cars loaded with families, bikes, and
beach gear headed south for the Mediterranean on the country's main
north-south highway that passes Lyon and leads to Marseille.
	   This is the third busiest travel weekend in the year, and extra
police have been deployed in airports, train stations and on the
highways.

UBS chairman: pressured banks must carefully consider options
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's banks are being
``blackmailed'' in the controversy over Holocaust-era assets but
must carefully consider all their options, the chairman of the
biggest bank said Saturday.
	   Mathis Cabiallavetta, chairman of the United Bank of
Switzerland, confirmed on Swiss radio that the banks' offer last
month of dlrs 600 million for a settlement of claims by Holocaust
victims is still on the table.
	   Jewish leaders claimed that was far less than the more than dlrs
1 billion the banks should be paying.
	   New York City and state on Thursday turned up the pressure over
the deadlocked talks between the banks, Jewish groups and lawyers
for class-action claimants by announcing plans to withhold business
from the Swiss banks.
	   Other states also have announced plans for sanctions.
	   Cabiallavetta said he was extremely disappointed with the
development, but added that there was no sense in taking steps that
would lead to tensions escalating.
	   ``We are being absolutely blackmailed,'' Cabiallavetta said. He
accused the other side of ignoring the banks' own efforts to
investigate their Holocaust-era archives, which he said involved a
huge investment and some 300 to 500 staff.
	   The banks should work out how to proceed over the next few weeks
taking into account all sanctions threats, the UBS chairman
continued.
	   UBS, which started trading Monday, is the product of the merger
of Union Bank of Switzerland with Swiss Bank Corp. The merger
cleared its final hurdle of approval by the U.S. Federal Reserve in
June.
	   The other bank involved in the Holocaust negotiations is Credit
Suisse.
	   On Friday, a group of Credit Suisse shareholders said they would
file a class-action lawsuit against New York City and state over
the authorities' boycott plans against Swiss banks.

Exulted by defeat, media salute Laudrup's departure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAN M. OLSEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Danish newspapers on Saturday bid
farewell to playmaker Michael Laudrup and lauded the
red-and-whites' valiant effort against Brazil in the soccer World
Cup quarterfinals.
	   Denmark's 3-2 loss to the world champions, was ``the world's
most beautiful defeat,'' said Berlingske Tidenede.
	   Jyllands-Posten said it was ``an elegant good-bye to the World
Cup.''
	   Newspapers splashed superlatives across their frontpages.
	   ``Thanks and good-bye,'' the tabloid Ekstra Bladet splashed
across its front page, next to a photo of Laudrup, considered one
of Denmark's best players ever. The 34-year-old had earlier
announced he would retire after 17 years on the Danish side.
	   ``Oh Gods, Michael Laudrup would have deserved to lift the World
Cup trophy in Paris on July 12. But that's how soccer is. The match
should have been a final, with a different winner,'' Ekstra Bladet
said.
	   It added that the Danes who reached the quarterfinals after a
convincing 4-1 win against favorites Nigeria, gave the Brazilians
``a lesson in modern soccer but we lost because of stupid defense
errors.''
	   Laudrup left the team ``with a great and dashing contribution as
the team captain,'' Politiken said under the headline ``Thanks for
the dance.''
	   More than 120,000 fans watched the game on giant television
screens in Copenhagen's main square and Aarhus, Denmark's second
largest town. The Danish fans lived up to their affable reputation
of being cheerful, nonviolent fans. No incidents were reported _
despite high consumption of beer and other alcoholic beverages
through the night.
	   Newspapers in neighboring Sweden, which failed to reach the
finals in France, were also full of praise for Denmark's effort.
	   ``Denmark, thank-you for daring,'' wrote sports columnist
Torbjorn Peterson in Sweden's largest morning paper, Dagens
Nyheter. ``And thanks for the soccer party.''
	   The tabloid Aftonbladet, Sweden's largest paper, printed several
pages about the Danish team. The main story's headline was ``The
beaten heroes'' and ``Denmark _ you are the best losers of all
time.''
	   Aftonbladet's rival, Expressen, was also gushing in its
accolades. ``So close Denmark _ Thanks for the party...''

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   ADANA, Turkey (AP) _ An earthquake injured 527 people in
southern Turkey on Saturday, just one week after a deadly quake
rocked the same region, a news report said. Most victims of the
5.1-magnitude temblor were injured jumping in a panic from windows
or off balconies. No fatalities were immediately reported, and the
extent of any physical damage was not available, the semi-official
Anatolia news agency said. The quake was the strongest of more than
70 aftershocks that have followed last Saturday's magnitude-6.3
quake, Istanbul's Kandilli observatory said. The earlier quake
killed 144 people. (TURKEY-QUAKE)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fresh from talks with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, U.S. mediator Richard Holbrooke met
with Kosovo Albanian leaders Saturday in an attempt to secure a
cease-fire in the aftermath of renewed fighting. Holbrooke held
talks with moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova and his more
radical rival, Adem Demaci, in the provincial capital, Pristina. He
arrived hours after Serb forces broke the Albanian siege of Kijevo.
Russia, the Serbs most powerful ally, launched its own diplomatic
foray, sending Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky to
Belgrade. He was expected to arrive about the time Holbrooke
returned to the city, capital both of Serbia and Yugoslavia.
(YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam will fire officials who create red
tape, open its insurance and services sectors to outside
competition and offer incentives to foreign investors, a top
official said Saturday. The government also will ease restrictions
on the percentage that foreign companies can take in joint
ventures, issue a decree easing requirements for entry and exit
visas and create a special task force to tackle complaints
immediately. ``We need to bring down all obstacles and bring down
the costs of doing business in Vietnam to make it an attractive
destination for foreign investment,'' Vice Minister of Planning and
Investment Nguyen Nhac said. (VIETNAM-ECONOMY)
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Condemning the military mutiny in
Guinea-Bissau, ministers of foreign affairs and defense from across
West Africa vowed Saturday to reassert the authority of that
country's embattled president through a combination of
negotiations, sanctions and the use of force. But the ministers
from the 16-member Economic Community of West African States, or
ECOWAS, gave no details on what kind of of sanctions or force would
be used. A communique issued at the end of the meeting said that
the mandate of ECOMOG, the economic community's military wing,
would be extended to cover Guinea-Bissau, calling on member states
to contribute additional soldiers to the force. (GUINEA-BISSAU)
	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ British army engineers
erected barbed-wire fencing and dug a moat through farm fields
Saturday in hopes of deterring thousands of Protestant Orangemen
from overpowering them and marching through a hostile Catholic area
nearby. The handiwork of about 700 soldiers, using bulldozers and
backhoes, underlined British authorities' apparent determination to
block Portadown's Orangemen when they try to march Sunday from the
rural Drumcree Anglican church back into the staunchly Protestant
town through its main Catholic area. Soldiers and police also
blocked every other road leading into the Catholic area with
armored cars and steel barricades. (NORTHERN IRELAND)

World Cup: Brazil's road to cup title turns uphill in semifinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   LESIGNY, France (AP) _ Through five games, Brazil has looked
down on adversaries from its status as World Cup favorite, a king
among commoners. The idea of losing to them was always associated
with the word ``upset.''
	   No more.
	   The Brazilians now head to the semifinals, where they will face
Argentina or the Netherlands. And whatever the outcome, it won't be
an upset.
	   Both have knocked Brazil out of a World Cup before. And neither
is likely to be as forgiving with the lapses the team showed in its
quarterfinal thriller against Denmark.
	   The underdog Danes were valiant, bold and smart, but the
Brazilian defense collaborated on both Danish goals before the
world champions finally prevailed 3-2.
	   With defender Cafu sitting out the next game with two yellow
cards, the Brazilian back line could be more vulnerable than ever.
	   The first falldown came with the game barely two minutes old.
The Brazilians were slow setting up for a Danish free kick, and
Brian Laudrup raced through a confused defense and passed to Martin
Jorgensen for an easy tap-in.
	   After Ronaldo set up Bebeto and Rivaldo to give Brazil a 2-1
lead, the defense helped the Danes again.
	   Roberto Carlos tried to clear a ball from his penalty area with
a spectacular over-the-head kick and came up empty. The ball landed
at the feet of a surprised Brian Laudrup, who promptly fired it
into the upper corner to tie it 2-2.
	   A Rivaldo solo run made it 3-2, and coach Mario Zagallo
reinforced his defense in the midfield. But it didn't help much.
Jorgensen and Laudrup had near-misses, and Marc Rieper put a header
on the crossbar that goalie Taffarel was slow to reach.
	   Zagallo, drained and tense, called the game ``beautiful, frank
and open,'' but admitted the defense had nearly blown it.
	   ``The three goals erased our foolish mistakes,'' he said, before
cutting short post-game interviews and being helped from the room.
	   Erased, but not forgotten. If Brazil has shown flashes of
offensive brilliance at the feet of Ronaldo, Bebeto and Rivaldo,
defense _ the strong point of the 1994 Cup champions _ remains its
biggest worry.
	   In Brazil's 2-1 loss to Norway, fullback Junior Baiano was badly
beaten by striker Andre Tore Flo on one goal and committed an
infantile penalty to set up the second.
	   While Zagallo has demanded more offense from thunder-footed
Roberto Carlos, his upfield charges have left big holes on the left
side of the defensive line that 32-year-old fullback Aldair has
been slow to cover.
	   With Cafu out, his logical replacement is Ze Carlos, an obscure
defender from Sao Paulo who was a last-minute replacement for
Flavio Conceicao, dropped from the team with a leg injury.
	   Still, Zagallo said Ze Carlos ``theoretically'' would play but
that he still hasn't figured out how to set up the team for its
toughest match of the Cup. He has until Tuesday to come up with the
answer.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fresh from talks with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, U.S. mediator Richard Holbrooke met
with Kosovo ethnic Albanian leaders Saturday in an attempt to
secure a cease-fire in the aftermath of renewed fighting.
	   Holbrooke held talks with moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova and his more radical rival, Adem Demaci, in the provincial
capital, Pristina. He arrived hours after Serb forces broke the
ethnic Albanian siege of Kijevo.
	   Kijevo figured prominently during a Holbrooke visit last month,
when he tried to persuade the militant Kosovo Liberation Army to
end the siege of the strategic town, fearing Serb forces would use
massive force against it and spark a wider war in the region.
	   Russia, the Serbs most powerful ally, launched its own
diplomatic foray, sending Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai
Afanasyevsky to Belgrade. He was expected to arrive about the time
Holbrooke returned to that city, capital of both Serbia and
Yugoslavia.
	   The Serb retaking of Kijevo on Friday, which freed 100 Serb
villagers and 50 policemen surrounded by the rebels, could signal a
turning point, allowing stalled negotiations to go forward.
	   Ethnic Albanian separatists want independence for Kosovo, a
province in southern Serbia where they outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
Serbia is the largest of the two republics remaining in Yugoslavia.
Hundreds of people have died in Kosovo since Serb forces stepped up
efforts to crush militant resistance in February. Serbs consider
Kosovo the cradle of their culture.
	   Milosevic says the crackdown is aimed at ethnic Albanian
terrorists who have targeted Serb police in their fight for
independence.
	   Sitting astride the main east-west road in Kosovo, Kijevo has
been a flash-point since the KLA surrounded it in mid-June and cut
off its Serb inhabitants. Serb police then surrounded the KLA
fighters.
	   In Pristina, Holbrooke said Saturday he was focusing on ways to
help the ethnic Albanian leaders organize themselves. He shuttled
between two different venues just 300 meters (yards) apart to meet
separately with the Rugova and Demaci camps.
	   Earlier, Holbrooke described Rugova as ``the main leader'' of
the province's ethnic Albanian majority, but Demaci also has
considerable popular support.
	   Among the issues to be addressed was the role of the KLA, which
the Serbs consider a terrorist organization but which has been
gaining support in Kosovo at the expense of Rugova, who opposes
violence.
	   The United States has urged the KLA to recognize Rugova as the
head of a joint delegation if negotiations can be started.
	   Asked Saturday if the KLA should be included in talks, Holbrooke
said Washington wanted ``everybody who has a legitimate role in the
destiny of Kosovo'' to have a place in the negotiations. ``But how
that works out remains to be seen,'' he said.
	   Serb police entered Kijevo shortly after dawn, breaking the
ethnic Albanian rebels' hold and fulfilling what was believed to be
Milosevic's remaining goal in his latest crackdown on Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke, who arrived Friday in Belgrade, talked with Milosevic
until early Saturday. He refused to say whether they made progress.
Holbrooke was expected to shuttle back to Belgrade after his
meetings in Kosovo.
	   On the eve of Holbrooke's visit, Milosevic denied any government
repression in Kosovo and offered to restore the autonomy he yanked
from the province in 1989 on grounds of protecting its Serb
minority.
	   Holbrooke is pressing for a cease-fire before trying to get
Milosevic to withdraw his forces. But he and other Western
officials are insistent that Kosovo should not be allowed
independence.
	   That may not satisfy even the moderate ethnic Albanian leaders
on whom Washington had pinned hopes for a negotiated settlement.
	   On Friday, Rugova said autonomy ``is not a solution'' for the
province.
	   ``Our aim is an independent, neutral Kosovo with equal rights
for all,'' Rugova said. Noting that other parts of Yugoslavia had
broken away, Rugova said, ``It is our right to demand
independence.''

Jordan court sentences two Palestinians to jail for espionage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A military court has sentenced two
Palestinians to prison for attempting to recruit Jordanian soldiers
to spy for Israel, a court official said Saturday.
	   The two Palestinians were residents of the West Bank and were
sentenced in January. The verdict was first made public on
Saturday.
	   One of the Palestinians, who was arrested on Sept. 28, was
sentenced to 15 years in prison, said the official, who was part of
the three-man tribunal that issued the verdict.
	   The other Palestinian remains at large and was sentenced in
absentia to life in prison. The verdicts are being reviewed by an
appeals court.
	   The names of the men were withheld by the military court.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Israeli Embassy, which
was closed for the Jewish Sabbath.
	   The court official said in June 1994, four months before Jordan
and Israel signed their peace accord, the two Palestinians
recruited a sergeant in the military intelligence to work for
Israel's Mossad spy agency.
	   The soldier quickly informed the authorities.
	   The Palestinians later tried to recruit another soldier in the
military intelligence.
	   Last September, two Mossad agents were arrested following a
botched assassination attempt against a militant Palestinian leader
in Jordan.
	   The two agents were freed and sent home under an agreement
between Israel and the Jordanian government.

Israel, Palestinians trade accusations after Gaza standoff

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat accused Israel
of violating the peace agreements in a confrontation in the Gaza
Strip and said the Palestinians ``will not hesitate to confront any
attempted aggression on our land.''
	   In a Cabinet statement published Saturday, Arafat said ``We will
not accept anyone harming the lives or jobs of our people in the
Gaza Strip. The Israeli side must respect the agreement.''
	   Israel and the Palestinians heaped blame on each other after
troops from the two sides confronted the other with cocked assault
rifles and armored personnel carriers Thursday night and early
Friday in what began as an argument over control of a Gaza Strip
road.
	   The incident came at a time when the United States appears to be
making little headway in winning Israeli agreement on a troop
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested that the
12-hour showdown in Gaza, during which Palestinian truckers
blockaded Jewish settlements, could make Israel even more hesitant
to hand over land to the Palestinians. Israeli hard-liners claim
that a troop pullback would leave more than a dozen settlements
isolated and at the mercy of the Palestinians.
	   ``You could also understand how sensitive we are to the issue of
redeployment, which could place tens of thousands of Israelis ...
at great peril any time the Palestinians decide to violate the
agreement, as they did last night,'' Netanyahu said Friday.
	   Netanyahu accused the Palestinians of staging a deliberate
provocation and said Israel would not succumb to threats of
violence.
	   The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, dismissed
Netanyahu's accusation, saying the Palestinian Authority had made
every possible effort to defuse the situation.
	   Netanyahu ``is the one to be blamed for the tense situation on
the ground'' because he has refused to live up to Israel's
promises, including a troop pullback, Erekat said.
	   The Gaza confrontation began with a routine argument over the
use of a road. About two-thirds of the Gaza Strip is controlled by
the Palestinian Authority, but Israeli troops patrol near Jewish
settlements and control several access roads.
	   On Thursday afternoon, Palestinian Supplies Minister Abdel Azziz
Shaheen demanded that Israel allow a convoy of 22 Palestinian cars
to use a coastal route it controls. Israeli soldiers said they
would let Shaheen pass because as a Cabinet minister he has special
privileges, but told the others to turn back.
	   The dispute quickly escalated into scuffles and shouting matches
between Israeli and Palestinian troops. Israeli troops stationed
three armored personnel carriers on a road linking two major Gaza
Strip cities and created a huge traffic jam. In retaliation,
Palestinian police ordered dozens of trucks to block access roads
to Jewish settlements. Israel, in turn, sealed off the Gaza Strip.
	   As night fell, both sides dug roadside trenches and took up
positions just a few dozen yards from one another _ with rifles
pointed.
	   Under a compromise reached early Friday with the help of U.S.
Mideast envoy Dennis Ross, the Palestinians agreed to move the
trucks from the settlement roads while Israel allowed Shaheen and
his convoy to drive along the coastal road.
	   Nabil Shaath, Palestinian planning minister, blamed Israel for
causing the incident by blocking Palestinian traffic.
	   ``We were lucky,'' he said after Friday night's Cabinet meeting
in the West Bank city of Hebron. ``We escaped a confrontation that
we do not want. But the Israelis must understand we will not accept
that they enforce their rule by military power against the
agreements they signed and the world witnessed.''
	   Shaath said Israel's policies would lead to ``nothing but an
explosion.''
	   ``We are doing our best not to get to that situation, but the
Israelis are pushing our patience beyond the limits,'' he said.

Chirac signs law that allows hunters to kill nesting birds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac has signed a law
that runs counter to European Union rules and would allow hunters
to kill migratory birds during their nesting period.
	   The French parliament had passed the law June 19, and Chirac had
15 days to sign the bill, send it back to parliament or ask the
Constitutional Council to rule on its validity.
	   Chirac signed the bill into law Friday but expressed hope the
government would try to ensure French hunting laws confirm with EU
rules, the daily Le Figaro reported Saturday.
	   France's 1.7 registered game shooters form a powerful political
lobby that neither the left nor the right wants to antagonize.
	   European Union regulations forbid the hunting of migratory birds
during their nesting period. But the French law would let hunters
an 10 extra weeks to shoot.
	   As a result of the law, France's hunting season will run from
July 14 to Feb. 28, beyond a 1979 EU regulation limiting the season
to a period from Sept. 1 to Jan. 31.
	   France faces a hefty fine for every day the EU rule is violated.

Turkish premier reaffirms commitment to fight Islamic radicalism
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SELCAN HACAOGLU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on Saturday
reaffirmed his government's commitment to crack down on radical
Islam but took the military to task for its pressure to get
tougher.
	   The government is uneasy over methods preferred by the military
in their common struggle to curb the rise of radical Islam in
traditionally secular Turkey.
	   ``We are determined not to give respite to those (Islamic
extremists),'' Yilmaz told a news conference.
	   ``But it is impossible to leave the whole struggle to the armed
forces,'' he said. ``We are not facing armed Islamic extremist
groups but people who exploit the religion in a bid to change the
regime.''
	   ``The power and final word on drawing up a policy belong to the
government,'' Yilmaz added.
	   Yilmaz also criticized a call by Gen. Cevik Bir, deputy chief of
general staff, to speed up the approval of a series of laws
designed to curb Islam's influence by Parliament.
	   ``This struggle requires patience,'' Yilmaz said. ``This
struggle will be waged within the framework of democracy.''
	   On Thursday, a parliamentary commission approved a draft law
Thursday to discharge anti-secular civil servants.
	   In a speech on Monday, Bir also said that the pro-Islamic Virtue
Party enjoys too much popular support and reiterated that
fundamentalism is Turkey's No. 1 threat.
	   When asked to comment on Bir's statement, Yilmaz said, ``It
would not be proper to comment over a wrong statement by a public
servant.''
	   Yilmaz was publicly embarrassed by a curt rebuke from the
generals when he opposed a military-backed ban on Islamic-style
head scarves in high schools and universities in March. The
military regards head scarves as political as well as religious
statements.
	   Yilmaz came to power after the military, which has staged three
coups since the 1960s, forced an Islamic-led government to resign
last year.
	   Turkish law empowers the army to defend the country's secular
principles as well as fight domestic and foreign threats.

UBS chairman: pressured banks must carefully consider options
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's banks are being
``blackmailed'' in the controversy over Holocaust-era assets and
must carefully consider all their options, the chairman of the
biggest bank said Saturday.
	   Mathis Cabiallavetta, chairman of the United Bank of
Switzerland, confirmed on Swiss radio that the banks' offer last
month of dlrs 600 million for a settlement of claims by Holocaust
victims is still on the table.
	   Jewish leaders claimed that was far less than the more than dlrs
1 billion the banks should be paying.
	   New York City and state on Thursday turned up the pressure over
the deadlocked talks between the banks, Jewish groups and lawyers
for class-action claimants by announcing plans to withhold business
from the Swiss banks. Other U.S. states also have announced plans
for sanctions.
	   Cabiallavetta said he was extremely disappointed with the
development, but added that there was no sense in taking steps that
would lead to tensions escalating.
	   ``We are being absolutely blackmailed,'' Cabiallavetta said. He
accused the other side of ignoring the banks' own efforts to
investigate their Holocaust-era archives, which he said involved a
huge investment and about 300 to 500 staff.
	   The banks should work out how to proceed over the next few weeks
taking into account all sanctions threats, the UBS chairman
continued.
	   UBS, which started trading Monday, is the product of the merger
of Union Bank of Switzerland with Swiss Bank Corp. The merger
cleared its final approval hurdle in June.
	   The other bank involved in the Holocaust negotiations is Credit
Suisse.
	   On Friday, a group of Credit Suisse shareholders said they would
file a class-action lawsuit against New York City and state over
the authorities' plans to boycott Swiss banks.

Iraq says U.S. holding up contracts for oil spare parts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq accused the United States on Saturday
of blocking U.N. approval for 40 contracts it signed with
international firms to supply spare parts for its oil industry.
	   The U.N. Security Council agreed last month to allow Iraq to
purchase dlrs 300 million in spare parts and equipment to boost oil
production.
	   Oil Minister Lt. Gen. Amer Mohammed Rashid said that despite the
council's approval, the U.N. sanctions committee has not reached
agreement yet on how to process the contracts. He blamed Washington
for the delay.
	   ``The U.S. administration hinders anything positive that will be
of benefit to the Iraqi people,'' Rashid said.
	   ``We have almost no spare parts now,'' Rashid said. ``We are
running at a very critical level in terms of production.''
	   Rashid spoke following a meeting with his Jordanian counterpart,
Mohammed Saleh al-Hourani, who arrived in Baghdad on Thursday to
discuss Iraq's supply of oil to Jordan.
	   U.N. trade sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait bar Iraqi oil exports, except for limited sales whose
proceeds must be used to purchase food, medicine and other
humanitarian goods.
	   Restrictions on Iraqi oil exports will only be lifted when U.N.
weapons inspectors certify that Baghdad has eliminated its programs
to manufacture weapons of mass destruction.

<TEXT>
	   ADANA, Turkey (AP) _ An earthquake injured 698 people in
southern Turkey on Saturday, just one week after a deadly quake
rocked the same region, the Anatolia news agency said.
	   Most of those injured by the 5.1-magnitude temblor were hurt
jumping in panic from windows or off balconies, Deputy Gov. Ardahan
Totuk told private NTV television.
	   Totuk said there were no fatalities and only one building,
already damaged by the previous quake, collapsed without hurting
anyone.
	   But the authorities were evacuating some buildings, still
occupied by residents, in fear of more aftershocks, the
semi-official Anatolia agency said.

Holbrooke presses ahead with peace efforts

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fresh from talks with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, U.S. mediator Richard Holbrooke met
with Kosovo ethnic Albanian leaders Saturday in an attempt to
secure a cease-fire in the aftermath of renewed fighting.
	   Holbrooke held talks with moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova and his more radical rival, Adem Demaci, in the provincial
capital, Pristina. He arrived hours after Serb forces broke the
ethnic Albanian siege of Kijevo.
	   Kijevo figured prominently during a Holbrooke visit last month,
when he tried to persuade the militant Kosovo Liberation Army to
end the siege of the strategic town, fearing Serb forces would use
massive force against it and spark a wider war in the region.
	   Russia, the Serbs most powerful ally, launched its own
diplomatic foray, sending Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai
Afanasyevsky to Belgrade. He was expected to arrive about the time
Holbrooke returned to that city, capital of both Serbia and
Yugoslavia.
	   The Serb retaking of Kijevo on Friday, which freed 100 Serb
villagers and 50 policemen surrounded by the rebels, could signal a
turning point, allowing stalled negotiations to go forward.
	   Ethnic Albanian separatists want independence for Kosovo, a
province in southern Serbia where they outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
Serbia is the largest of the two republics remaining in Yugoslavia.
Hundreds of people have died in Kosovo since Serb forces stepped up
efforts to crush militant resistance in February. Serbs consider
Kosovo the cradle of their culture.
	   Milosevic says the crackdown is aimed at ethnic Albanian
terrorists who have targeted Serb police in their fight for
independence.
	   Sitting astride the main east-west road in Kosovo, Kijevo has
been a flash-point since the KLA surrounded it in mid-June and cut
off its Serb inhabitants. Serb police then surrounded the KLA
fighters.
	   In Pristina, Holbrooke said Saturday he was focusing on ways to
help the ethnic Albanian leaders organize themselves. He shuttled
between two different venues just 300 meters (yards) apart to meet
separately with the Rugova and Demaci camps.
	   Earlier, Holbrooke described Rugova as ``the main leader'' of
the province's ethnic Albanian majority, but Demaci also has
considerable popular support.
	   Among the issues to be addressed was the role of the KLA, which
the Serbs consider a terrorist organization but which has been
gaining support in Kosovo at the expense of Rugova, who opposes
violence.
	   The United States has urged the KLA to recognize Rugova as the
head of a joint delegation if negotiations can be started.
	   Asked Saturday if the KLA should be included in talks, Holbrooke
said Washington wanted ``everybody who has a legitimate role in the
destiny of Kosovo'' to have a place in the negotiations. ``But how
that works out remains to be seen,'' he said.
	   Serb police entered Kijevo shortly after dawn, breaking the
ethnic Albanian rebels' hold and fulfilling what was believed to be
Milosevic's remaining goal in his latest crackdown on Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke, who arrived Friday in Belgrade, talked with Milosevic
until early Saturday. He refused to say whether they made progress.
Holbrooke was expected to shuttle back to Belgrade after his
meetings in Kosovo.
	   On the eve of Holbrooke's visit, Milosevic denied any government
repression in Kosovo and offered to restore the autonomy he yanked
from the province in 1989 on grounds of protecting its Serb
minority.
	   Holbrooke is pressing for a cease-fire before trying to get
Milosevic to withdraw his forces. But he and other Western
officials are insistent that Kosovo should not be allowed
independence.
	   That may not satisfy even the moderate ethnic Albanian leaders
on whom Washington had pinned hopes for a negotiated settlement.
	   On Friday, Rugova said autonomy ``is not a solution'' for the
province.
	   ``Our aim is an independent, neutral Kosovo with equal rights
for all,'' Rugova said. Noting that other parts of Yugoslavia had
broken away, Rugova said, ``It is our right to demand
independence.''

Security officials find cache of explosives
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Security officials found seventy
three explosive devices, including 7 grenades, in a cache in the
coastal region of eastern Tanzania, government-run radio said
Saturday.
	   The cache was located in the village of Mkongwe Msungura in the
Bagamoyo district, just 50 kilometers (35 miles) north of Dar Es
Salaam. The area had served as a base for South African freedom
fighters during the apartheid years.
	   The movement returned to South Africa when apartheid ended in
1994, but apparently left behind caches of weapons and ammunition.
	   Residents of the area have been warned not to touch unusual
objects. One villager was killed last month while making charcoal
when a bomb exploded. (ar/dmc)

Eight gunned down in South African soccer bar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Gunmen burst into a bar in
South Africa's troubled KwaZulu-Natal province and shot dead eight
people gathered to watch World Cup soccer on television, police
said Saturday.
	   Six other people were wounded in the attack late Friday in
Richmond, 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the district capital of
Pietermaritzburg, said police Superintendent Henry Budhram.
	   Witnesses said up to eight attackers wearing balaclava masks
opened fire in the Shepstone Street Tavern. Richmond deputy mayor
Percy Thompsom was believed to be among the dead.
	   ``People were watching TV and playing darts when armed men
opened fire indiscriminately,'' Budhram said.
	   Budhram said the six wounded were in stable condition in the
main Pietermaritzburg hospital.
	   He said police were investigating whether the attack was linked
to violent conflict between supporters of the governing African
National Congress and the opposition United Democratic Movement
party.
	   Richmond Mayor Andrew Ragavaloo blamed the killings on the
political violence that has left 17 people dead in the town since
May, the independent South African Press Association reported.
	   ``We've been devastated by this,'' he said.
	   Political violence in KwaZulu-Natal has claimed the lives of
more than 10,000 people in the last decade.
	   Supporters of another group, the Zulu nationalist Inkatha
Freedom Party, have also been involved in attacks.
	   Inkatha spokesman Philip Powell condemned Friday's killings and
called for rival parties ``to swallow their pride and hold talks as
a matter of urgency'' to end violence ahead of national elections
next year.
	   Last month, the killing of five ANC officials forced the party
to cancel a youth day rally in KwaZulu-Natal. Two of the officials
died when their house was stormed by armed men.
	   Richmond ANC chairman Siphiwe Ntinga accused the United
Democratic Movement, a rival party started last year by a former
ANC official and a member of the former apartheid government's
National Party, of mounting that attack.
	   In a controversial decision last week, the UDM chose Sifiso
Nkabinde, an alleged KwaZulu-Natal ``warlord'' expelled from the
ANC, as its national secretary.
	   He was released from jail in April after being acquitted on lack
of evidence on charges of involvement in 16 political killings in
the Midlands district of KwaZulu Natal, around Richmond.
	   Police at Nkabinde's trial reported a lull in political violence
in the Midlands after his arrest last year.

Japan's heat wave continues into second day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan languished in oppressive heat and humidity
Saturday as temperatures topped 38 degrees Celsius (100 degrees
Fahrenheit) for the second straight day.
	   Two people died Friday because of the heat _ a 58-year-old man
and a 90-year old woman _ and about 160 people have been treated
for sunstroke over the two days of high temperatures, national
broadcaster NHK reported.
	   Four people, including a 10-year-old schoolboy in Ota, about 90
kilometers (57 miles) north of Tokyo, were hospitalized Saturday
for heat exhaustion, Kyodo News reported.
	   Television broadcasts showed people hosing down driveways to
prevent heat from rising from the asphalt and wearing handkerchiefs
around their heads to protect themselves from the sun.
	   Haruna, about 100 kilometers (63 miles) north of Tokyo,
registered 40.3 degrees Celsius (104.54 degrees), the highest ever
in the city since the Meteorological Agency began recording
temperatures there in 1972.
	   In Tokyo, the temperature rose to 36.1 degrees Celsius (97
degrees Farenheit) from a high of 34.4 degrees Celsius (94 degrees

	   The average high temperature for Japan at this time of the year
is about 26.5 degrees Celsius (80 degrees Fahrenheit).
	   Early July is usually the height of Japan's rainy season, but
sunny weather has prevailed in recent days and near windless air
has contributed to the stifling heat.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Nine militants were killed in a two-day
gun battle with government troops while trying to enter India
across its border with Pakistan in the northern state of Kashmir,
the military said Saturday
	   Of the nine, five were foreign mercenaries, their nationalities
not immediately available; three were Kashmiris; and one was yet to
be identified, Brig. A.K. Chopra, head of operations in Kashmir,
said on the phone from the state capital, Srinagar.
	   The operation began Thursday after intelligence reports
indicated that militants from Pakistan-governed Kashmir would enter
carrying arms, Chopra said. The fighting took place in Kupwara, 200
kilometers (120 miles) northwest of Srinagar, and ended Friday
afternoon.
	   Indian troops recovered several guns, sophisticated radio sets,
detonators and ammunition, he said.
	   New Delhi accuses officially Islamic Pakistan of backing a
Muslim-led insurgency in Kashmir, the only Muslim majority state in
predominantly Hindu India. Pakistan denies it, saying it lends only
moral support to the militants.
	   The Himalayan territory of Kashmir is divided between India and
Pakistan but both lay claim to the whole territory.

Sao Tome P.M. dismisses ultimatum from retired coup officers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Sao Tome and Principe's Prime Minister
Raul Braganca Neto has rejected an ultimatum from a group of former
army coup leaders who demanded the government comply with a deal on
retirement conditions by July 11, according to Portuguese news
reports Saturday.
	   The some 40 retired officers, who were involved in a failed 1995
military coup, issued the deadline last month, saying the
government had not kept its promise to give them financial
compensation and farmland agreed on following the coup attempt.
	   The officers have not said what they might do if their demands
are not met.
	   Speaking Friday, Braganca Neto said he condemned the method used
by the officers and dismissed the July 11 deadline, according to
the Portuguese news agency Lusa.
	   Elections are scheduled for October in the two-island African
nation of Sao Tome and Principe, located about 200 kilometers (125
miles) off the West coast of Gabon. A former Portuguese colony, it
gained independence in 1975.
	   The 1995 coup saw President Miguel Trovoada arrested, held
prisoner in his own offices for a week and parliament disbanded.
The rebels surrendered a week later after the United States and the
European Union threatened to cut off vital aid.
	   Never charged for the mutiny, the officers are regarded as
influential figures in the top ranks of an army which in recent
months has been unsettled by disputes over low pay.
	   Since Trovoada was elected president in the nation's first
democratic elections in 1991, Sao Tome's economy has slumped. About
65 percent of the population of 130,000 live in abject poverty and
45 percent are unemployed.

Pakistani gunmen kill prominent politician, Rangers given sweeping
</HEADLINE>
powers &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Gunmen killed a prominent politician
Saturday and the Pakistani government announced that it was giving
sweeping powers to its paramilitary troops to quell the relentless
violence that has terrorized the city of Karachi in recent weeks.
	   Zuhair Akram Nadeem, a former provincial and federal legislator,
was alone in his vehicle when two men on a motorcycle rode up
beside him and opened fire with automatic rifles, police said.
	   No one claimed responsibility for the killing, but police blamed
members of the Mohajir Qami Movement, a militant ethnic group that
split into three different factions whose members often clash.
	   Nadeem was a strong supporter of a year-long police operation in
1996 to clamp down on the movement and its more militant members.
Hundreds of movement members were arrested or killed.
	   Despite objections from the provincial Sindh government, of
which Karachi is the capital, the federal government announced
sweeping powers for the paramilitary Rangers, an arm of the
military.
	   Until now the Rangers have been assisting police, who had the
power of arrest and search. Now the government has given the same
powers to the Rangers. They also will be able to search the homes
of suspected militants.
	   Since June 1 more than 200 people have been killed in Karachi.
In the hardest-hit areas of central and eastern Karachi, militants
with machine-guns have taken up positions on rooftops. Policemen
and Rangers have been targeted and dozens of civilians have been
caught in the crossfire.

Amnesty International seeks mercy for soldiers convicted of rape,
</HEADLINE>
murder &QL; 
 &UR; By NIRESH ELIATAMBY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ International rights group Amnesty
International welcomed the conviction of five Sri Lankan soldiers
and a policeman for the rape and murder of a Tamil family, but
pleaded Saturday that they be spared execution.
	   ``We call upon President Chandrika Kumaratunga to commute the
death sentences,'' the organization said in a statement faxed from
London.
	   No one has been hanged since 1977 in Sri Lanka, a mostly
Buddhist country. Death sentences are usually commuted to life in
prison, but the president may hesitate to do so in this case.
	   The case was seen as a test of the government's commitment to
protect the minority Tamils in a country torn by ethnic war.
Government forces are fighting Tamil guerrillas who want to carve
out a separate homeland for their community in the island nation.
	   A special court on Friday sentenced the six to death for the
1996 gang rape and murder of Krishanthy Kumaraswamy, an 18-year-old
high school student, in the northern Jaffna Peninsula. The soldiers
then killed her mother, brother and a neighbor who were searching
for her.
	   Amnesty urged that hundreds of other similar cases be brought
before courts.
	   ``For too long the security forces have been literally allowed
to get away with murder,'' the statement said. ``The landmark
judgment could reinforce the message to the army and police that
human rights violations will no longer be tolerated.''
	   The government admits as many as 500 Tamil civilians have
disappeared in the peninsula since the military drove out Tamil
rebels and took control of the Tamil heartland in May 1996.
	   Tamil politicians and human rights groups say many vanished
after being arrested by government troops hunting guerrillas.
	   Urging a lenient verdict, the soldiers in Friday's case said
they would show authorities mass graves of up to 400 missing
Tamils, but the three judges were unmoved and also sentenced them
to 30 years hard labor for kidnapping and gang-raping the girl.
	   The soldiers denied the charges and said they only buried bodies
of Tamils killed by other soldiers.
	   The judges are likely to refer the statements on hidden bodies
to local magistrates, who can then search for the graves.
	   The verdicts and sentences can be appealed in two higher courts
before Kumaratunga decides whether to carry out the hangings.
	   In the past, Tamils have cited abuse and arrogance by government
soldiers, almost all of whom are from the Sinhalese community, as
one of the causes of Tamil discontent. Militant Tamils have been
fighting a war for an independent Tamil homeland since 1983. More
than 52,000 people have died.

De facto U.S. ambassador to brief Taiwan on Clinton trip
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Bush's remarks in 3-4 grafs

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The head of the U.S. mission in Taiwan,
Richard Bush, arrived in Taipei Saturday to brief President Lee
Teng-hui on U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to China.
	   Richard Bush, chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan, will
also meet with other officials and business leaders during his
four-day visit.
	   Bush told reporters upon his arrival at Taipei airport that
Clinton's summit with Chinese President Jiang Zemin ``did not hurt
Taiwan or its people's interests.''
	   American policy toward Taiwan has not changed and Washington
will continue to ensure Taiwan's stability, he said.
	   The American Institue, based in Washington, handles U.S.
interests in Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic ties.
	   The state-run Central News Agency said Bush is expected to fly
to Guam Thursday to meet with Taiwanese Premier Vincent Siew, who
will transit through the American territory on his way back from a
visit to three South Pacific islands.
	   While in Shanghai early this week, Clinton reiterated the U.S.
policy of not supporting Taiwan's independence, not recognizing a
separate Taiwanese government and not backing Taiwan's membership
in international organizations such as the United Nations.
	   Taiwan considered Clinton's open pledge of the policy a
concession to China, and is worry the U.S. position will reduce the
island's bargaining power.
	   Taiwan's seat in the United Nations was turned over to China in
1971, and the island has launched a campaign to rejoin the
organization.
	   China and Taiwan split in 1949 when the Nationalists fled the
Communist takeover of the mainland. The Nationalists officially
advocate eventual reunification with China, but not on Beijing's
terms.

Israel, Palestinians trade accusations after Gaza standoff
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to ADD Arafat quotes, Shaath quotes, minor
edits. No pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat accused Israel
of violating the peace agreements in a confrontation in the Gaza
Strip and said the Palestinians ``will not hesitate to confront any
attempted aggression on our land.''
	   In a Cabinet statement published Saturday, Arafat said ``We will
not accept anyone harming the lives or jobs of our people in the
Gaza Strip. The Israeli side must respect the agreement.''
	   Israel and the Palestinians heaped blame on each other after
troops from the two sides confronted the other with cocked assault
rifles and armored personnel carriers Thursday night and early
Friday in what began as an argument over control of a Gaza Strip
road.
	   The incident came at a time when the United States appears to be
making little headway in winning Israeli agreement on a troop
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested that the
12-hour showdown in Gaza, during which Palestinian truckers
blockaded Jewish settlements, could make Israel even more hesitant
to hand over land to the Palestinians. Israeli hard-liners claim
that a troop pullback would leave more than a dozen settlements
isolated and at the mercy of the Palestinians.
	   ``You could also understand how sensitive we are to the issue of
redeployment, which could place tens of thousands of Israelis ...
at great peril any time the Palestinians decide to violate the
agreement, as they did last night,'' Netanyahu said Friday.
	   Netanyahu accused the Palestinians of provocation and said
Israel would not succumb to threats.
	   The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, dismissed
Netanyahu's accusation, saying the Palestinian Authority had made
every possible effort to defuse the situation.
	   Netanyahu ``is the one to be blamed for the tense situation on
the ground'' because he has refused to live up to Israel's
promises, including a troop pullback, Erekat said.
	   The Gaza confrontation began with a routine argument over the
use of a road. About two-thirds of the Gaza Strip is controlled by
the Palestinian Authority, but Israeli troops patrol near Jewish
settlements and control several access roads.
	   On Thursday afternoon, Palestinian Supplies Minister Abdel Azziz
Shaheen demanded that Israel allow a convoy of 22 Palestinian cars
to use a coastal route it controls. Israeli soldiers said they
would let Shaheen pass because as a Cabinet minister he has special
privileges, but told the others to turn back.
	   The dispute quickly escalated into scuffles and shouting matches
between Israeli and Palestinian troops. Israeli troops stationed
three armored personnel carriers on a road linking two major Gaza
Strip cities and created a huge traffic jam. In retaliation,
Palestinian police ordered dozens of trucks to block access roads
to Jewish settlements. Israel, in turn, sealed off the Gaza Strip.
	   As night fell, both sides dug roadside trenches and took up
positions just a few dozen yards from one another _ with rifles
pointed.
	   Under a compromise reached early Friday with the help of U.S.
Mideast envoy Dennis Ross, the Palestinians agreed to move the
trucks from the settlement roads while Israel allowed Shaheen and
his convoy to drive along the coastal road.
	   Nabil Shaath, Palestinian planning minister, blamed Israel for
causing the incident by blocking Palestinian traffic.
	   ``We were lucky,'' he said after Friday night's Cabinet meeting
in the West Bank city of Hebron. ``We escaped a confrontation that
we do not want. But the Israelis must understand we will not accept
that they enforce their rule by military power against the
agreements they signed and the world witnessed.''
	   Shaath said Israel's policies would lead to ``nothing but an
explosion.''
	   ``We are doing our best not to get to that situation, but the
Israelis are pushing our patience beyond the limits,'' he said.

vessels for Kuwait that are more powerful, the Defense Ministry
said Saturday.
	   Kuwait has agreed to pay dlrs 13 million for the new vessels, a
Western diplomat said.
	   For ``a very little difference,'' Kuwait is going to get larger,
stronger and better equipped boats, Col. Ahmed al-Rahmani, a
Defense Ministry spokesman, said.
	   Kuwait originally purchased 12 vessels from the French company
Simoneau at a cost of about dlrs 40 million, the diplomat said.
	   The company began delivering the vessels in 1993, two years
after the Gulf War.
	   Al-Rahmani said the navy discovered ``faults'' in the ships. He
declined to elaborate.
	   An agreement with the company has been reached to replace the
vessels, but the formal contract has yet to be signed, he said.
	   Kuwait and France signed a 10-year defense agreement after the
Gulf War.

Soldiers erect barricades to stop disputed Protestant march

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES grafs 7-9 with Catholic protesters delay protest until

<TEXT>
	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ British army engineers
erected barbed-wire fencing and dug a moat through farm fields
Saturday to deter thousands of Protestant Orangemen from trying to
overpower them and march through a hostile Catholic area nearby.
	   The handiwork of about 700 soldiers, using bulldozers and
backhoes, underlined British authorities' apparent determination to
block the Orange Order's planned parade Sunday from the rural
Drumcree Anglican church back into this staunchly Protestant town
through its main Catholic area.
	   Soldiers and police also blocked every other road leading into
the Catholic area with armored cars and steel barricades, and
installed surveillance video cameras atop poles to record evidence
against potential rioters.
	   The scale of the army operation was bigger than 1996, when the
government last ordered the town's 2,000 Orangemen not to raise
sectarian tensions with their annual march _ but the security
forces ultimately failed to stop them.
	   The Drumcree church rector said the sight of the expanding army
barricade saddened him at a time when April's compromise agreement
on how Northern Ireland should be governed was bringing Protestant
and Catholic politicians together.
	   ``I thought we were beginning on the way for peace.'' said the
Rev. John Pickering. ``But this barrier across the fields of barbed
wire is a great division and it's symbolic of the division in
Northern Ireland. ... I appeal to people to pray to almighty God
for His help.''
	   The Catholic protesters, led by former IRA prisoner Breandan
MacCionnaith, don't trust the British security forces to stop the
Orangemen because of bitter past experiences.
	   But after initially planning a round-the-clock human barricade
at midday on Garvaghy Road, the disputed thoroughfare through their
area, they decided this might unnecessarily bring them into
conflict with the police.
	   MacCionnaith said instead they would mount a curbside picket
beginning at 7 p.m. (1800GMT), which would run overnight and at
least until the Orangemen are supposed to leave Drumcree church
about 1 p.m. (1200GMT) Sunday.

Italian baritone dies in Milan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Renato Capecchi, an Italian baritone best
known for his interpretations of comic roles, has died in Milan,
his family said Saturday. He was 74.
	   His wife, Jeannette, said Capecchi died Tuesday in the city's
Geriatric Institute. She declined to make known the cause of death.
	   Born in Cairo in 1923, Capecchi was the first interpreter of
Mozart's ``Don Giovanni'' at the Lyric Arts Festival of
Aix-en-Provence in 1949 and was long known as one of the best
performers of comic repertory.
	   He started performing on a regular basis internationally,
including at New York's Metropolitan. His roles included Bartolo in
Rossini's ``Barber of Seville,'' Marcello in Puccini's ``La
Boheme,'' Germont in Verdi's ``Traviata'' and many others.
	   A funeral was held on Thursday.
	   Other surivors include a son, Marco, and a daughter, Magali.

	   PARIS (AP) _ World Cup fans heading for quarterfinal matches
Saturday squeezed into packed trains and onto highways clogged with
hundreds of thousands of French people leaving on summer vacation.
	   About 830,000 French people were expected to take the train
Saturday to start their summer holidays. They will be joined by
about 100,000 soccer fans trying to get to Marseille and Lyon.
	   Germany plays Croatia in Lyon on Saturday night, while in
Marseille, the Netherlands meets Argentina in quarterfinal World
Cup play.
	   The state SNCF train company said 1,500 trains will be in
service Saturday, including about 960 high-speed TGV trains.
	   On highways, many of the cars loaded with families, bikes, and
beach gear headed south for the Mediterranean on the country's main
north-south highway that passes Lyon and leads to Marseille.
	   This is the third busiest travel weekend in the year, and extra
police have been deployed in airports, train stations and on the
highways.

Human rights lawyer opens door to negotiations with Marcos family
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Filipino lawyer for human rights
victims who won a suit against the late President Ferdinand Marcos
said Saturday he was ready to negotiate with the Marcos family to
settle the claims.
	   The rights victims won a class action suit against Marcos in
Hawaii, where the former dictator was living at the time. A Hawaii
court awarded the victims dlrs 2 billion in damages from the Marcos
estate.
	   The Marcos family and the government, however, also claim
Marcos' wealth, much of which is in Swiss bank accounts.
	   ``Now is just about the most opportune time for the Marcoses and
the Philippine government to come to terms with the victims,'' said
lawyer Rod Domingo.
	   Domingo said James Linn, a lawyer for Marcos' widow, Imelda, is
in Manila and is expected to discuss the case with the family.
There was no immediate response from the family or their lawyer.
	   Domingo said he and Robert Swift, the American lawyer for the
9,539 abuse victims, are willing to settle their claims against the
dictator's estate for dlrs 150 million.
	   ``While the claims of the Marcos victims will finally put to
rest the human rights issue against the deposed dictator, the
benefits to be reaped by the government is enormous,'' Domingo
said, referring to more than dlrs 500 million of Marcos' Swiss bank
deposits.
	   At least dlrs 300 million were transferred to an escrow account
in a Philippine bank last April and the Swiss Federal Supreme Court
cleared the way for the transfer of the rest of the money last May.
No official, however, has confirmed that more money has been moved
to the escrow account.
	   The government hopes to win a forfeiture and confiscation case
it has filed against Mrs. Marcos to acquire the Swiss deposits.
	   Another way to share the money is through an out-of-court
settlement between the government and the Marcos family.
	   Mrs. Marcos has offered dlrs 150 million to the victims of human
rights violations during her husband's rule. Her offer was rejected
by one group of Marcos victims as ``suspicious.''
	   Marcos was ousted in a ``people power'' revolt in 1986 and died
three years later in exile in Hawaii. The government claims his
Swiss deposits are part of the alleged ill-gotten wealth he amassed
during his 20-year rule.
	   Marcos never admitted any wrongdoing.

Sampras, Ivanisevic in men's final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous. Women's final starts at 1300 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ It's no surprise to find Pete Sampras
back in the Wimbledon final. After all, he's won the title four of
the last five years.
	   But Goran Ivanisevic?
	   Two weeks ago, Ivanisevic wasn't even considered among the
serious title contenders. He'd won only one match in his five
previous Grand Slam tournaments and had slipped to No. 25 in the
world rankings.
	   Ivanisevic was lucky to be seeded (No. 14), a favor from
tournament organizers in recognition of his past record as a
two-time finalist.
	   But the 26-year-old Croat has surprised everybody by returning
to the final for a third time and challenging again for something
he's never been able to achieve: a Grand Slam title.
	   ``A lot of people say, `He's gone, he's never going to be
back,''' Ivanisevic said. ``I knew that I had a bad six months and
Wimbledon came at the right time. I put these six months behind me.
I was practicing hard for the last month trying not to feel sorry
for myself, and now it's paying off.''
	   Like Ivanisevic, Jana Novotna is a two-time Wimbledon runnerup
who has never won a major. She got her chance Saturday in the
women's final against Nathalie Tauziat of France.
	   Novotna hopes to overcome the enduring image of her crying on
the shoulder of the Duchess of Kent after blowing a big lead
against Steffi Graf in the 1993 final.
	   Tauziat, a 30-year-old journeywoman, had never been as far as
the semifinals in 42 previous Grand Slam events. She's the lowest
seed (No. 16) in a women's final and the first French finalist
since Suzanne Lenglen in 1925.
	   Most surprising about Ivanisevic is the way he has held his
temper, concentration and composure _ a sharp contrast from his
reputation for self-destructing.
	   He never lost his head in Friday's semifinal against Richard
Krajicek, even after squandering two match points while serving at
5-4, 40-15 in the fourth set, or going down a break at 3-2 in the
fifth set.
	   Ivanisevic didn't rant and rave. He didn't smash any rackets. He
just kept pounding his left-handed serve and outlasted Krajicek in
a marathon 28-game final set to win 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 6-7 (7-5),
15-13.
	   ``I don't think anybody bet on me when I lost the fourth set,''
Ivanisevic said. ``Everybody said, `Maybe it's going to be 6-2 or
6-3. He's gone, he's going to lose it.' But I did win it. I was
just very mentally strong. I was never like this in my life. I just
believed I was going to win it.''
	   It will take more than self-confidence to beat Sampras in
Sunday's final. Facing his toughest test so far, Sampras reasserted
his grass-court superiority to turn back Tim Henman, his friend and
practice partner, 6-3, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3.
	   Sunday's match will be a rematch of the 1994 final, which
Sampras won in straight sets. Sampras will be favored to win his
fifth title in six years, which would tie him with Bjorn Borg for
the most Wimbledon victories in the Open era.
	   ``I think I have a good chance,'' Ivanisevic said. ``He's going
for the record, I'm going for my first. ... I think this year I
have the best chance. I think I can do it and I would be very
disappointed if I don't do it.''
	   Sampras has a 10-6 record against Ivanisevic, including eight
victories in their last nine matches. He knows what to expect.
	   ``He's going to hit his aces, he's going to hit his
double-faults,'' Sampras said. ``You have to ride the wave with
Goran. It's like riding a roller coaster. He's capable of stringing
some unbelievable service games that you can't do much about.''
	   As for Henman, who was seeking to become the first British men's
finalist in 60 years and first champion in 62 years, Sampras said
it's only a matter of time for him to break through.
	   ``I can't say enough good things about Tim's game,'' he said.
``He's a very, very solid player and will eventually win this
tournament one year.''
	   Not as long, it would seem, as Sampras is playing.

 &UR; Spiegel: Kosovo Liberation Army preparing attack on Pristina &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Kosovo's guerrilla army wants to unite
all Albanians in the Balkans and is prepared for a long fight in
its struggle, a spokesman for the group was quoted as saying
Saturday.
	   ``We want more than independence,'' the weekly Spiegel magazine
quoted Kosovo Liberation Army spokesman Jakub Krasniqi as saying.
``Our goal is the unification of all Albanians.''
	   Krasniqi said his organization was already active in Macedonia,
which neighbors Kosovo and also has a large, and restive Albanian
population.
	   Recognizing that as the guerrillas' popularity grows, support
for Kosovo's Albanian political leaders is waning, the United
States and its allies have begun pressing for a unified Kosovo
Albanian voice, including KLA representatives and political
leaders.
	   Ibrahim Rugova and other Kosovo Albanian politicians met last
week to see how to meld their peaceful struggle with the militant
KLA methods, and similar future meetings are planned.
	   But Krasniqi said the resistance fighters would never accept
commands from Rugova because his non-violent resistance policy has
accomplished nothing.
	   Asked if NATO should take military action in Kosovo, Spiegel
quoted Krasniqi as saying he would only greet NATO intervention if
it can guarantee the Albanians victory.
	   The fight will go on with or without NATO, Spiegel quoted
Krasniqi as saying.
	   In another report, Spiegel said that NATO no longer plans to
take swift military action in Kosovo, because the liberation army
was gaining strength reducing Moscow's willingness to give the
green light for NATO action.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov has warned Klaus
Kinkel, his German counterpart, that Russia would stop all its
cooperation with NATO if an attack on the Serb military in Kosovo
was carried out, the report said.

World Cup: Exulted in defeat, media salute Laudrup's departure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAN M. OLSEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Danish newspapers on Saturday bid
farewell to playmaker Michael Laudrup and lauded the
red-and-whites' valiant effort against Brazil in the soccer World
Cup quarterfinals.
	   Denmark's 3-2 loss to the world champions was ``the world's most
beautiful defeat,'' said Berlingske Tidenede.
	   Jyllands-Posten said it was ``an elegant good-bye to the World
Cup.''
	   Newspapers splashed superlatives across their frontpages.
	   ``Thanks and good-bye,'' the tabloid Ekstra Bladet headlined
across its front page, next to a photo of Laudrup, considered one
of Denmark's best players ever. The 34-year-old had earlier
announced he would retire after 17 years on the Danish side.
	   ``Oh Gods, Michael Laudrup would have deserved to lift the World
Cup trophy in Paris on July 12. But that's how soccer is. The match
should have been a final, with a different winner,'' Ekstra Bladet
said.
	   It added that the Danes, who reached the quarterfinals after a
convincing 4-1 win against favorites Nigeria, gave the Brazilians
``a lesson in modern soccer but we lost because of stupid defensive
errors.''
	   Laudrup left the team ``with a great and dashing contribution as
the team captain,'' Politiken said under the headline ``Thanks for
the dance.''
	   More than 120,000 fans watched the game on giant television
screens in Copenhagen's main square and in Aarhus, Denmark's
second-largest town. The Danish fans lived up to their affable
reputation of being cheerful and nonviolent. No incidents were
reported _ despite high consumption of beer and other alcoholic
beverages through the night.
	   Newspapers in neighboring Sweden, whose team failed to reach the
finals in France, were also full of praise for Denmark's effort.
	   ``Denmark, thank-you for daring,'' wrote sports columnist
Torbjorn Peterson in Sweden's largest morning paper, Dagens
Nyheter. ``And thanks for the soccer party.''
	   The tabloid Aftonbladet, Sweden's largest paper, printed several
pages about the Danish team. The main story's headline was ``The
beaten heroes'' and ``Denmark _ you are the best losers of all
time.''
	   Aftonbladet's rival, Expressen, was also gushing in its
accolades. ``So close Denmark _ Thanks for the party...''

	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ England bowled itself into a position
where its batsmen can really only play for a draw in the third
cricket test against South Africa at Old Trafford.
	   Fast bowler Allan Donald drew first blood for South Africa after
his batsmen set a total on Saturday which virtually eliminated
England's chances of a win.
	   After South Africa had declared on 552 for five, Donald peppered
the English openers with short-pitched bowling and eventually
bounced out Nick Knight.
	   Left-hander Knight ducked into a short pitched Donald delivery
and gloved the ball, giving South Africa's wicketkeeper Mark
Boucher an outstanding catch down leg side.
	   Former England skipper Mike Atherton was unbeaten on 16 with
Nasser Hussain four not out at lunch, with England at 34 for one.
	   South Africa lost Jonty Rhodes for 12 to the fourth ball of the
morning after resuming at 437 for four. Rhodes mis-hit a drive to
Dominic Cork at mid-off to give Darren Gough his third wicket.
	   But South African captain Hanse Cronje, 69 off 105 balls, and
Lance Klusener, 17 off 24, plundered the English attack and hurried
to a declaration after just 54 minutes of batting.
	   The South African innings largely revolved around a maiden
double century by opener Gary Kirsten (208) and a fine 132 by
Jacques Kallis.
	   England was already handicapped by the loss of batsman Graham
Thorpe, who failed to take the field Saturday with a recurrence of
the back spasm which flared up after two days in the field.

<TEXT>
	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ British army engineers
erected barbed-wire fencing and dug a moat through farm fields
Saturday to deter thousands of Protestant Orangemen from trying to
overpower them and march through a hostile Catholic area nearby.
	   The handiwork of about 700 soldiers, using bulldozers and
backhoes, underlined British authorities' apparent determination to
block the Orange Order's planned parade Sunday from the rural
Drumcree Anglican church back into this staunchly Protestant town
through its main Catholic area.
	   Soldiers and police also blocked every other road leading into
the Catholic area with armored cars and steel barricades, and
installed surveillance video cameras atop poles to record evidence
against potential rioters.
	   The scale of the army operation was bigger than 1996, when the
government last ordered the town's 2,000 Orangemen not to raise
sectarian tensions with their annual march _ but the security
forces ultimately failed to stop them.
	   The Drumcree church rector said the sight of the expanding army
barricade saddened him at a time when April's compromise agreement
on how Northern Ireland should be governed was bringing Protestant
and Catholic politicians together.
	   ``I thought we were beginning on the way for peace.'' said the
Rev. John Pickering. ``But this barrier across the fields of barbed
wire is a great division and it's symbolic of the division in
Northern Ireland. ... I appeal to people to pray to almighty God
for His help.''
	   The Catholic protesters, led by former IRA prisoner Breandan
MacCionnaith, don't trust the British security forces to stop the
Orangemen because of bitter past experiences.
	   But after initially planning a round-the-clock human barricade
at midday on Garvaghy Road, the disputed thoroughfare through their
area, they decided this might unnecessarily bring them into
conflict with the police.
	   MacCionnaith said instead they would mount a curbside picket
beginning at 7 p.m. (1800GMT), which would run overnight and at
least until the Orangemen are supposed to leave Drumcree church
about 1 p.m. (1200GMT) Sunday.

Jumblatt criticizes government policy on displaced people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A cabinet minister harshly criticized the
government Saturday, saying it has failed to provide sufficient
funding to resettle people displaced during the 1975-90 civil war.
	   Minister of the Displaced Walid Jumblatt spoke at the opening of
a two-day national conference on the return of displaced people.
The conference was held in the summer resort of Beiteddine, 60
kilometers (37 miles) southeast of Beirut.
	   More than 150,000 people were killed and 500,000 uprooted from
their homes during the civil war.
	   Jumblatt called the conference to discuss ways of speeding up
the return of the more than 300,000 people who remain displaced.
	   Jumblatt, who has supervised the repatriation process since it
began six years ago, accused the government of withholding funds
needed for the return of the remaining displaced.
	   ``Let the government release the frozen funds for the displaced
people so that we can continue the repatriation process,'' Jumblatt
said in an opening speech.
	   Jumblatt, a former Druse warlord, also demanded that the
government-run Fund for the Displaced be placed under his
ministry's supervision.
	   Jumblatt had frequently complained of inadequate government
funding for his ministry.
	   Although the government had provided about dlrs 500 million for
the return of displaced people, only 30 percent of the repatriation
has been completed.
	   The Ministry of the Displaced said it needs 1.88 trillion pound
(dlrs 1.17 billion) to complete the repatriation process.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The worst of a week-long heat-wave ended
Saturday as temperatures dropped to 41 degrees Celsius (106 degrees
Fahrenheit) and a hot wind swept through the capital.
	   Pollution levels dropped below warning levels, although health
officials said hospitals would remain on alert throughout the
weekend.
	   The heat wave has killed four people in Greece and hospitalized
hundreds more. Thursday, temperatures in Greece peaked at 45
degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) and air pollution levels
in Athens soared beyond the danger level to their highest point in
two years.
	   About 5 million people live in the mountain-ringed Athens basin.
	   A cold front moving in from the north will return temperatures
to the low-30s (90s) by Sunday, meteorologists said.
	   Meanwhile storms in the Aegean and northern Greece stirred up
strong gusts of wind that exacerbated several brush and wildfires
flaring around the country.

Novotna tries to win Wimbledon in her third try
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Will be topped after first set

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Third-seeded Jana Novotna was favored
to win her first Wimbledon singles title Saturday in her third try
when the faced 16th seeded Nathalie Tauziat, who was playing her
first Grand Slam final.
	   Novotna, 29, and Tauziat, 30, are the oldest Wimbledon finalists
_ in combined age _ since 1977 as teen sensations like Martina
Hingis, Venus and Serena Williams, and Anna Kournikova have fallen
by the wayside.
	   Novotna reached the finals with a two-set win over Hingis, a
repeat of last year's final won by Hingis, who became the youngest
Wimbledon singles winner of the century. Novotna ousted 18-year-old
Venus Williams in the quarterfinals.
	   The Czech is a two-time runner-up and best remembered for crying
on the shoulder of the Duchess of Kent after blowing a big lead in
the 1993 final against Steffi Graf.
	   Novotna's other Grand Slam singles final came in the 1991
Australian Open where she lost in three sets of American Monica
Seles.
	   Tauziat, a cousin of French World Cup captain Didier Deschamps,
is the first Frenchwoman to reach a Wimbledon final since Suzanne
Lenglen won her sixth title in 1925.
	   Tauziat is a 15-year veteran and the lowest seeded finalist in
history at No. 16. She has won four tour titles _ two on grass _
and cracked the top 10 for the first time in January.
	   She reached the finals with a come-from-behind victory over
Natasha Zvereva of Belarus after dropping the first set 6-1.
	   In eight previous matches, they had each won four but had never
played on grass. Tauziat won their last meeting 7-5, 7-5 in an
indoor tournament last year in Chicago.

Bugner wins world title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOLD COAST, Australia (AP) _ Joe Bugner won the world
heavyweight championship of the fortysomethings Saturday when James
``Bonecrusher'' Smith pulled up lame after one round.
	   Bugner, 48, became the oldest man to hold a world title in the
heavyweight division, albeit under the auspices of the lowly-rated
World Boxing Federation.
	   Smith, 45, started the fight with a flurry of punches as he kept
Bugner near the ropes. But the exertion proved all too much and he
dislocated his right shoulder, withdrawing before the start of
round two.
	   Bugner lost his last world title fight on points against
Muhammad Ali almost 23 years ago, while Smith held the WBA title
before losing it to Mike Tyson in 1987.
	   When it was announced Smith had withdrawn, the crowd at the
Carrara Stadium jeered the American and several scuffles broke out
in the stands.
	   ``I'm just sad that Bonecrusher injured himself,'' Bugner said
after becoming Australia's first world heavyweight title holder.
	   Bugner, who weighed in for the fight at kilograms (260 pounds),
moved his record to 68-13-1. Smith, who weighed 127 kilograms (280
pounds), went to 43-16-1.

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Bahrain's total crude oil production
increased 12 percent last year to 58.4 million barrels from 52.05
million barrels in 1996, the Oil Ministry said Saturday.
	   Crude oil production from onshore fields increased slightly to
14.16 million barrels in 1997 from 14.12 million the previous year,
the ministry said.
	   Offshore output rose nearly 17 percent last year to 44.24
million barrels from 37.93 million barrels in 1996, it said.
	   The increase in crude oil production was mainly due to the
offshore Abu Sa'fah oil field, which Bahrain shares with
neighboring Saudi Arabia, the ministry added.
	   In early 1995, Saudi Arabia granted Bahrain most of Abu Sa'fah's
daily output of around 140,000 barrels per day to help boost the
tiny island state's oil-dependent economy.
 &UR; ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange
dropped 3.6 percent in June because of domestic political tensions
and sluggish oil prices, the National Investments Co. said
Saturday.
	   In a monthly report, the company said the index closed at
2,125.3 at the end of June, down 68.5 points, or 3.6 percent from
the end of May.
	   The 50-seat Parliament and the Cabinet clashed last month over
demands to question the interior minister, a member of the ruling
family. It was feared the crisis would lead to the disbanding of
the legislature.
	   The emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, chose not to dissolve
the parliament.
	   National Investments said the volume of trading fell by 49
percent in June with some 883.96 million shares changing hands,
compared to 1.73 billion in May. The value of these shares fell by
49.2 percent to 242.27 million dinars (dlrs 791.73 million).
	   Investors are hoping that trading will improve when the
government comes through with promises to open the exchange, which
lists 76 companies, to more non-Kuwaitis. Only citizens and
nationals of the other Arab states in the Gulf are allowed to trade
on the market.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Efforts to patent Princess Diana's image have run
into an obstacle at the national Patent Office, but the memorial
fund that made the application said it still had time to overcome
the problem, The Times reported Saturday.
	   The newspaper said that after a seven-month investigation, a
copyright examiner from the government agency objected to the claim
by the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund because the face of
the late princess was not distinctively linked to the goods on
which it may be used, as required by British law.
	   The newspaper did not give a source for its story, but it said
the fund ``understood that the objection was part of the normal
legal procedure,'' and that the fund trustees had until the end of
next month to overcome the objections and their application was not
being withdrawn.
	   The fund can also seek a hearing by a more senior Patent Office
officer, the newspaper said.
	   A spokesman for the Patent Office, speaking on terms of
customary anonymity, confirmed the agency had raised ``a number of
objections,'' but was ``happy to look at any new proposals to meet
those concerns.''
	   ``The ball is now in their court,'' the spokesman said,
referring to the memorial fund representatives. ``The matter has
been considered by an independent official. The Patent Office is
there to ensure the law on intellectual property is properly
interpreted and that is what we are trying to achieve in this
case.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fresh from talks with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, U.S. mediator Richard Holbrooke met
with Kosovo ethnic Albanian leaders Saturday in an attempt to
secure a cease-fire in the aftermath of renewed fighting.
	   Holbrooke held talks with moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova and his more radical rival, Adem Demaci, in the provincial
capital, Pristina. He arrived hours after Serb forces broke the
ethnic Albanian siege of Kijevo.
	   Kijevo figured prominently during a Holbrooke visit last month,
when he tried to persuade the militant Kosovo Liberation Army to
end the siege of the strategic town, fearing Serb forces would use
massive force against it and spark a wider war in the region.
	   Russia, the Serbs' most powerful ally, launched its own
diplomatic foray, sending Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai
Afanasyevsky to Belgrade. He was expected to arrive about the time
Holbrooke returned to that city, capital of both Serbia and
Yugoslavia.
	   In Belgrade, several dozen people people, mostly parents of
draftees doing military service in Kosovo, gathered to demand a
peaceful resolution of the Kosovo crisis and redeployment of their
sons to less violent parts of Yugoslavia.
	   The Serb retaking of Kijevo on Friday, which freed 100 Serb
villagers and 50 policemen surrounded by the rebels, could signal a
turning point, allowing stalled negotiations to go forward.
	   Ethnic Albanian separatists want independence for Kosovo, a
province in southern Serbia where they outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
Serbia is the largest of the two republics remaining in Yugoslavia.
Hundreds of people have died in Kosovo since Serb forces stepped up
efforts to crush militant resistance in February. Serbs consider
Kosovo the cradle of their culture.
	   Milosevic says the crackdown is aimed at ethnic Albanian
terrorists who have targeted Serb police in their fight for
independence.
	   Sitting astride the main east-west road in Kosovo, Kijevo has
been a flash-point since the KLA surrounded it in mid-June and cut
off its Serb inhabitants. Serb police then surrounded the KLA
fighters.
	   In Pristina, Holbrooke said Saturday he was focusing on ways to
help the ethnic Albanian leaders organize themselves. He shuttled
between two different venues just 300 meters (yards) apart to meet
separately with the Rugova and Demaci camps.
	   Earlier, Holbrooke described Rugova as ``the main leader'' of
the province's ethnic Albanian majority, but Demaci also has
considerable popular support.
	   Among the issues to be addressed was the role of the KLA, which
the Serbs consider a terrorist organization but which has been
gaining support in Kosovo at the expense of Rugova, who opposes
violence.
	   The United States has urged the KLA to recognize Rugova as the
head of a joint delegation if negotiations can be started.
	   But that is unlikely. The German news magazine Spiegel on
Saturday quoted a spokesman for the guerrillas as saying the KLA
would never take orders from Rugova, because his peaceful secession
efforts had failed.
	   Spokesman Jakub Krasniqi also said the organization's ultimate
goal was not independence for Kosovo but ``the unification of all
Albanians'' in the Balkans.
	   Krasniqi said his organization was already active in Macedonia,
which neighbors Kosovo and also has a large and restive Albanian
population.

<TEXT>
	   HEIDELBERG, Germany (AP) _ A ban on a planned neo-Nazi
demonstration and hundreds of police on hand for security in
Heidelberg, prevented feared clashes Saturday in the university
city, police said.
	   Police said that for more than a month neo-Nazis in the
so-called ``National Resistance,'' group had been advertising in
the Internet, by telephone and printed pamphlets, a demonstration
in Heidelberg's Old City district marking the 100th anniversary of
the death of Reich's Chancellor Otto von Bismarck.
	   Leftist groups announced a counter-demonstration, and Heidelberg
officials, fearing violence, banned the neo-Nazis from assembling,
police said.
	   The administrative court in Karlsruhe approved the ban Friday,
saying it could not discount that innocent third parties such as
tourists might be in danger if the gathering were allowed.
	   Heidelberg police spokesman Otmar Wolf said the radical
rightists called off the planned demonstration on short notice.
``We detained 19 errant neo-Nazis and sent them back home.''
	   About 200 leftist counter-demonstrators did show up and laid a
wreath at the site of the city's former synagogue, Wolf said.
	   He said police had been called in from other Baden-Wuerttemberg
state cities to make sure things remained peaceful.
	   Originally, police had expected up to 500 neo-Nazis and 1,500
leftists to show up.

 &UR; Leader calls on Rwandans to put aside ethnic differences &QL; 
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Rwanda's top army commander on Saturday
called on his people to set aside ethnic differences and use their
brains, not bullets, to rebuild a nation devasted by the 1994
genocide.
	   Vice President Paul Kagame, who is also defense minister, urged
the nation to have confidence that the army can control a Hutu
insurgency in the northwest that has killed thousands in the past
18 months.
	   Kagame addressed a crowd of about 35,000 at Kigali's Amahoro
soccer stadium, where Rwandans marked the fourth anniversary of the
victory of Tutsi soldiers he led to power in 1994, ending the Hutu
government-orchestrated slaughter of more than 500,000 Tutsis and
moderate Hutus.
	   Dressed in army fatigues, Kagame reviewed the units of the
Rwandan Patriotic Army who paraded at the field before foreign
diplomats, officials and army commanders from neighboring
countries.
	   ``Many people shed blood on the road to liberation,'' he said in
Kinyarwanda, Rwandan national language. ``But now, there must be
other ways of finding peace and developing the country other than
sacrificing lives.''
	   In a reconciliatory tone, he said it was not the lack of
intelligence, but a lack of will that was holding Rwanda back, and
said ethnic differences that had led to violence should be
forgotten for the benefit of the country.
	   Kagame listed the problems of accomodation of refugees _ both
Hutus and Tutsis _ in the country; rebel attacks in northwestern
Rwanda and transformation of the economy.
	   President Pasteur Bizimungu, a Hutu, was absent from the
ceremony, and instead addressed the nation in a recorded radio
broadcast. There was no immediate explanation for his absence.
	   After defeating the Hutu soldiers and militiamen responsible for
the massacres, Kagame's Rwandan Patriotic Front formed a government
of national unity consisting of both Hutus and Tutsis.
	   The army, originally consisting of Tutsis exiles, has so far
reintegrated up to 4,000 former Hutu soldiers and officers in a bid
to restore confidence among the predominantly Hutu population.
	   But the country is still facing a difficult task of
reconciliation. Distrust among many Hutus runs deep and
international human rights groups, notably Amnesty International,
have accused government soldiers of extrajudicial killings of Hutu
civilians.
	   The government denied the claim, and said it was prosecuting
those soldiers suspected of human rights abuses. Army officials say
it often impossible to distinguish between the rebels and ordinary
Hutus, who provide food, shelter and money for the insurgents.

Nigel Albon of Britain powers his Ferrari to take first place
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Nigel Albon of Britain powered his
Ferrari F355 to take first place in the Ferrari Challenge at the
Asian Festival of Speed at Johor Circuit on Saturday, a news report
said.
	   The two races Saturday _ the Ferrari Challenge Round 2 and the
PCHK Porsche Round 3 _ were held in sunny and dry conditions 360
kilometers (216 miles) south of Kuala Lumpur, the official Bernama
news agency said.
	   Albon took first place in 21:18.83 to stay in contention for the
overall title he won last year.
	   Round 2 had been postponed until Saturday following the
cancellation of last month's races because of an oil spill.
	   ``It is good to win after the disappointment last month. I have
no complaints and I am looking for better things to come,'' Albon
said after the 12-lap race.
	   Second place went to Malaysia's Tunku Hammam who was timed at
21:25.76, while Hong Kong's Adrian Fu was third with a time of
21:28.99.
	   In the PCHK Porsche Round 3, Kevin Wong of Hong Kong came out
first in 17:20.25 while Alex Yan, also of Hong Kong, was second in
17:26.41. Third place went to Hong Kong's Philip Ma, whose time was
17:28.12.

Government pegs next year's budget deficit at dlrs 3.2 billion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A budget deficit of 11 billion zlotys
(dlrs 3.2 billion) that the government plans for 1999 should
prevent destabilization of state finances, the Rzeczpospolita daily
newspaper said Saturday.
	   The Solidarity-led Cabinet of Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek made an
initial approach to the 1999 budget at an outside-Warsaw meeting
late Friday.
	   In an interview with Rzeczpospolita, Finance Minister Leszek
Balcerowicz said that the main emphasis on next year's budget will
be put, among others, on adjusting Poland's army to NATO standards
and on the justice system.
	   The government, which will further discuss the 1999 budget in
the coming weeks, has until Sept. 20 to present it to the
parliament.

Guerrillas ambush Israeli patrol in southern Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas detonated a bomb Saturday
near an Israeli army patrol in southern Lebanon.
	   The guerrillas claimed to have killed and wounded members of the
patrol, but security officials could not confirm any casualties.
	   The guerrilla exploded the remote-controlled bomb as an armored
personnel carrier passed near the Ali Taher position, about four
kilometers (2.5 miles) northwest of Marjayoun.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah group claimed responsibility for
the ambush, which triggered retaliatory Israeli shelling of trails
believed to be used by guerrillas for infiltration. No injuries
were reported in the shelling, said the Lebanese officials,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Hezbollah guerrillas are spearheading a campaign to dislodge
Israel from an enclave it has occupied since 1985 to protect its
northern towns from cross-border guerrilla raids and rocket
attacks.
	   The zone is patrolled by some 1,200 Israeli soldiers and 2,500
Israeli-allied militiamen.

Ukrainian border guards detain 26 illegal migrants

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian border guards detained 26 illegal
migrants who were hiding in a truck headed for the Czech Republic,
the guards' command reported Saturday.
	   The migrants, covered by a cargo of animal skins inside the
sealed truck, were discovered by a guard dog at a crossing point
near Uzhhorod in western Ukraine, the report said.
	   It did not say when the incident occurred.
	   Most of the migrants, who apparently originated from Southeast
Asia, had no documents, and their nationality could not immediately
be established, said the report.
	   The number of illegal migrants from poor Asian nations trying to
cross into Western Europe through the former Soviet Union,
especially Ukraine and Russia, has drastically increased in recent
years.

Two opposition journalists released from prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Police have released two journalists jailed
for four months after a court overturned their conviction for
libel.
	   Magdi Hussein, editor-in-chief of the opposition newspaper Al
Shaab, and reporter Mohammed Helal went home late Friday, said
police officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The journalists were convicted of libel in February and
sentenced to two years in prison at hard labor for some 80 articles
they wrote accusing the sons of former Interior Minister Hassan
el-Alfy of abusing their father's position to make money.
	   The court also fined Hussein dlrs 2,200.
	   An appeals court later upheld the convictions, but reduced the
sentences to one year.
	   The two then appealed to the Court of Cassation, Egypt's highest
court. On Thursday, it ordered their release, arguing that their
criticism did not violate any law. The judge also ordered the
former interior minister to pay court costs.
	   President Hosni Mubarak fired el-Alfy in November after six
Islamic militants killed 58 tourists and four Egyptians in a
Pharaonic temple outside the southern city of Luxor.

Ukrainian president introduces single tax for small businesses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma has
signed a new series of economic decrees, introducing a single tax
rate for small businesses and a high import tax on TV sets, his
press service said Saturday.
	   The decree on small businesses set a monthly tax rate of no more
than 200 hryvna (dlrs 100) for private businessmen employing fewer
than 10 people, and of 6 percent of revenues for small companies
employing around 10 workers, the report said.
	   ``This would stimulate legal work of small businesses,'' many of
which now prefer to evade taxation, the president's first deputy
chief of staff, Pavlo Gaidutsky, told the Interfax news agency.
	   The decree abolishes 13 existing taxes on small businesses,
according to Oleksandra Kuzhel, head of the State Committee for
Business Development.
	   A company earning less than 250,000 hryvna (dlrs 125,000) a year
would now pay some 15,000 hryvna (dlrs 7,500) in annual taxes,
instead of about 52,000 hryvna (dlrs 26,000) previously, she said.
	   Kuchma began issuing economic decrees last month in an attempt
to break his deadlock with the largely leftist parliament. The
president accuses the legislature of being too preoccupied with
infighting to address Ukraine's economic crisis.
	   Most of the decrees were aimed at reviving economic reforms. In
one decree last month, Kuchma introduced a single tax rate for
agricultural production, similar to that now set for small
businesses.
	   Another new decree reported Saturday introduced concessions for
building and repairing highways across Ukraine.
	   A separate decree designed to protect Ukrainian producers set a
new tax of 30 percent on all imported TV sets. Simultaneously,
Kuchma freed large television producers in Ukraine from paying
excise tax.
	   The number of Ukrainian-made television sets sold in the country
went down from 2.57 million in 1992 to just 41,800 in 1997,
according to Interfax.

UN Secretary General reiterates that political prisoner releases in
</HEADLINE>
Nigeria will herald return to civilian rule

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan
reiterated Saturday that he believes political prisoner releases by
Nigeria's military junta could herald a return to civilian rule for
the oil-rich west African state.
	   Annan, meeting with British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, said
that he remained confident Nigeria's new leader, Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar, would soon release the more than 250 political detainees
in the country's prisons.
	   On Thursday, Annan said that Nigeria's rulers planned to free
political prisoners, including Moshood Abiola, the country's
best-known political detainee and the presumed winner of 1993
presidential elections. However, Annan gave no timetable on the
releases.
	   After 45 minutes of talks with Cook, Annan told reporters that
he left Nigeria on Thursday ``with the sense that everyone wants to
see the country return to democratic rule and they want to live
under the rule of law.''
	   ``I am convinced that General Abubakar also wants to go the same
route,'' Annan said.
	   Annan also said that he believed that the argument surrounding
Abiola's claim on the Nigerian leadership based on the 1993
election was ``a red herring.''
	   ``I spoke to Abiola and he is realistic about his situation,''
Annan said.
	   Foreign Secretary Cook said that it remained a major objective
for Britain ``to bring Nigeria back into civilian democratic
rule.''
	   Nigeria became an international pariah under the rule of former
leader Gen. Sani Abacha, who took power following a coup in 1993.
The 54-nation Commonwealth, made of up Britain and its former
colonies, dominions and dependent territories, suspended Nigeria
from its ranks after leading activist and playwright Ken Saro-Wiwa
was executed in November 1995.
	   After the death on June 8 of Abacha, junta officials said that
political prisoners would likely be released ``in time.''

Report: Government aims for permanent tax cuts for 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The government and the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party began working Saturday on a 4 trillion yen (dlrs 29 billion)
tax-cut plan to jump-start Japan's struggling economy, a news
report said.
	   The meetings, reported by Kyodo News agency, came one day after
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said for the first time that he
would support permanent income tax cuts.
	   The report, which cited unidentified officials, said the
government and the LDP were considering two plans. Financial
officials could not be reached late Saturday for comment.
	   One proposal would combine 2 trillion yen (dlrs 14.5 billion) in
special income tax cuts for 1999 and more than 2 trillion yen (dlrs
14.5 billion) in permanent cuts.
	   The other plan would call for a single package of more than 4
trillion yen (dlrs 29 billion) in permanent income tax cuts, the
officials were quoted as saying by Kyodo.
	   In a meeting planned for July 22 in Washington, Hashimoto will
brief U.S. President Bill Clinton on the new tax cut plan along
with a government plan, announced Thursday, to fix the nation's
troubled banks, the report said.
	   Japan is coming under increasing pressure from the United States
and other trading partners to right its economy and create a market
for goods from financially hobbled Asian neighbors.
	   Officials say a permanent tax break _ as opposed to the
temperary tax relief offered so far in Japan _ will bolster
consumer confidence and spending and help Japan out of its worst
recession since World War II.
	   To implement the tax cuts, the government and the LDP will
likely bring the maximum combined rate for national and local
income taxes _ which is one of the highest in the industrialized
world at about 65 percent _ down to some 50 percent, the officials
were quoted as saying.

Respite for India's ruling coalition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to ADD quotes, tighten. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By K.N. ARUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRAS, India (AP) _ India's ruling coalition won temporary
relief Saturday when a crucial ally which seemed set to pull down
the wobbly three-month-old government decided not to withdraw
parliament support for now.
	   The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazagham, which controls 30
lawmakers in the 545-member federal parliament, announced that it
will continue to prop up the government, but warned that its
support could not be taken for granted.
	   Those 30 votes of the powerful southern Indian party are crucial
for the survival of the 18-party coalition government, which has a
thin majority in the house.
	   AIADMK lawmakers boycotted parliament when it opened Friday to
discuss the 1998-99 budget, stoking rumors that the party was set
to cross the floor to the government's rivals.
	   The lawmakers were to return to the house on Monday, senior
party leader V.R. Nedunchezhiyan said after a meeting Saturday.
	   AIADMK President Jayaram Jayalalitha is trying to pressure Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee into dismissing the provincial
government in her home state of Tamil Nadu. The state government is
controlled by Jayalalitha's rivals.
	   ``There is no question of going back on that demand,''
Nedunchezhiyan said.
	   Defense Minister George Fernandes met Jayalalitha after her
party's meeting and announced that a crisis had been averted.
	   ``I believe all of us are keen to see that this government lives
its life and whatever irritants are there will be removed.
Jayalalitha also feels the same way,'' Fernandes said after his
two-hour meeting with Jayalalitha.
	   But the peace might be tenuous.
	   Soon after that meeting, she met with Buta Singh, an emissary of
poweesident Sonia Gandhi does not seem to be in
a hurry to dislodge Vajpayee, although smaller political groups are
once again looking for leadership to the party that governed India
for most of the 50 years since its independence from British rule
in 1947.
	   Analysts say Gandhi, who this year took over the party once led
by her assassinated husband Rajiv Gandhi, would rather see the
government fall under the weight of its squabbling allies than be
accused of pushing the country into political uncertainty yet
again.
	   India has had two general elections and four prime ministers in
the past two years.

Novotna takes 1-0 lead as she tries to win Wimbledon in third try
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: LEADS with first set &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Jana Novotna, seeking her first
Wimbledon singles titles in three tries, won the first set 6-4 over
Nathalie Tauziat as she out-played the Frenchwoman at the net.
	   Tauziat, 16th seeded and playing her first Grand Slam final,
held her serve in the first game and then broke Novotna in the
second when the Czech double faulted twice.
	   However, Tauziat was broken in the third after being up 40-15 _
two points from going up 3-0 _ as Novotna began to lose her
early-match jitters.
	   The third-seeded Novotna, still struggling with her first serve,
began to take control at the net and evened at 2-2, breaking
Tauziat with the Frenchwoman holding her serve in the fifth game to
lead 3-2.
	   In the sixth game, Novotna held her serve more easily to level
at 3-3.
	   The crucial game was the seventh when Novotna had seven break
points before breaking Tauziat _ on the seventh _ and taking a 4-3
lead. One shot in game at deuce by Tauziat was called good but
later overruled. Replays appeared to show the shot was good.
	   In the eighth, Novotna held serve to take a 5-3 lead and Tauziat
did the same in the ninth to close to 5-4.
	   Novotna closed out the after 43 minutes as she slowly began to
dominate the net _ chipping and charging the net _ in hitting more
of her first serves.
	   Novotna, 29, and Tauziat, 30, are the oldest Wimbledon finalists
_ in combined age _ since 1977 as teen sensations like Martina
Hingis, Venus and Serena Williams, and Anna Kournikova have fallen
by the wayside.
	   Novotna reached the finals with a two-set win over Hingis, a
repeat of last year's final won by Hingis, who became the youngest
Wimbledon singles winner of the century. Novotna ousted 18-year-old
Venus Williams in the quarterfinals.
	   The Czech is a two-time runner-up and best remembered for crying
on the shoulder of the Duchess of Kent after blowing a big lead in
the 1993 final against Steffi Graf.
	   Novotna's other Grand Slam singles final came in the 1991
Australian Open where she lost in three sets of American Monica
Seles.
	   Tauziat, a cousin of French World Cup captain Didier Deschamps,
is the first Frenchwoman to reach a Wimbledon final since Suzanne
Lenglen won her sixth title in 1925.
	   Tauziat is a 15-year veteran and the lowest seeded finalist in
history at No. 16. She has won four tour titles _ two on grass _
and cracked the top 10 for the first time in January.
	   She reached the finals with a come-from-behind victory over
Natasha Zvereva of Belarus after dropping the first set 6-1.
	   In eight previous matches, they had each won four but had never
played on grass. Tauziat won their last meeting 7-5, 7-5 in an
indoor tournament last year in Chicago.

Lewis camp says Holyfield scared of losing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Evander Holyfield rejected a dlrs 20 million offer
to fight Lennox Lewis for a unified world heavyweight title because
he's scared of losing, Lewis' manager said Saturday.
	   The HBO cable television network made the offer to the IBF and
WBA world heavyweight champion on Wednesday but Holyfield said he
wanted dlrs 25 million for the fight.
	   Lewis' manager Frank Maloney said Holyfield did not want to
fight the WBC champion because he was not confident in his own
ability.
	   ``First he wanted dlrs 20 million _ he was offered that and now
he wants dlrs 25 million. He doesn't really want the fight does
he?'' Maloney said.
	   ``When he's offered dlrs 25 million, he's going to ask for dlrs
30 million _ it's no surprise to me.
	   ``Like I said when the offer was announced, the fight's about as
good a chance of going ahead as England is of winning the World
Cup.''
	   Maloney said the attitude of Holyfield's promoter, Don King, to
the unification fight was irrelevant because the decision came down
to the boxer.
	   ``Holyfield is his own man. He can make his own decision. He
doesn't want to fight Lennox because he is afraid he'll lose,'' he
said.
	   Holyfield told the Dothan Eagle, in Alabama, he wanted a
guaranteed dlrs 25 million before he would agree to fight Lewis.
	   ``This fight is bigger now than it was 10 months ago and the
whole world is saying, `We want to see this fight','' he said.
	   Under the HBO offer, the bout was to be held on America's east
coast on Dec. 5 or 12.
	   But Holyfield said he was prepared to wait until the year 2000
if the right offer was not made.
	   ``I'm going to keep on winning and I'm sure Lennox will keep on
winning because I'm the only guy out there who'll whip him,
Holyfield said.
	   Lewis will commence his new seven-fight contract with HBO with a
mandatory WBC title defense against Croatia's Zelko Mavrovic in
September.
	   Maloney said Lewis would concentrate on the Mavrovic fight
before he started thinking about his next bout.
	   Holyfield faces an IBF mandatory defense against Vaughn Bean and
a WBA mandatory defense against Henry Akinwande.
	   He was scheduled to fight Akinwande June 6, but the fight was
called off when Akinwande tested positive for hepatitis-B.

Guerrillas ambush Israeli patrol in southern Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with two wounded, details on attack. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas detonated a bomb Saturday
near an Israeli army patrol in southern Lebanon.
	   The guerrillas claimed to have killed and wounded members of the
patrol. The Israeli army said an Israeli-allied militiaman was
slightly wounded and taken to a nearby hospital.
	   The guerrillas exploded the remote-controlled bomb as an armored
personnel carrier passed near the Ali Taher position, about four
kilometers (2.5 miles) northwest of Marjayoun.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah group claimed responsibility for
the ambush, which triggered retaliatory Israeli shelling of trails
believed to be used by guerrillas for infiltration. No injuries
were reported in the shelling, said the Lebanese officials,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Later, an Israeli allied-militiamen was seriously hurt when the
car he was driving overturned, the Israeli army said. He was flown
to a hospital in Israel for treatment, the statement said.
	   Hezbollah guerrillas are spearheading a campaign to dislodge
Israel from an enclave it has occupied since 1985 to protect its
northern towns from cross-border guerrilla raids and rocket
attacks.
	   The zone is patrolled by some 1,200 Israeli soldiers and 2,500
Israeli-allied militiamen.

Mimicking dog, union chief barks bear up tree
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Used to raising his voice when
negotiating deals for paper workers, a union chief barked and drove
a bear up a tree when it surprised his family during evening tea.
	   Artturi Pennanen, 55, said the bear arrived at their camp site
while they were grilling sausages and brewing tea on an island in
southeastern Finland, the Ilta-Sanomat newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Pennanen, secretary general of the Paper Workers Union, said his
wife tried to shoo away the bear by shouting and clapping.
	   ``The bear couldn't care less about human voices, so I tried to
mimic the low growl of a sheepdog, and then threw in a few tight,
vicious barks,'' he told the newspaper.
	   ``The bear jumped into the nearest pine and climbed to a height
of five to six meters (16 to 20 feet) surprisingly fast,'' Pennanen
said.
	   The Pennanens own a summer villa in Ruokolahti, 240 kilometers
(150 miles) northeast of Helsinki, where a bear killed a jogger
three weeks ago in the first such fatal attack this century.
	   They were on a boating trip last week when the bear surprised
them, Ilta-Sanomat said.

	   ADANA, Turkey (AP) _ A week after a deadly earthquake hit
southern Turkey, a strong aftershock rocked the same area Saturday,
leaving more than 900 people injured, most of them from jumping out

	   Most of the injured suffered fractures and cuts, Adana's Deputy
Gov. Bulent Egriboz said of the 913 injured.
	   The 5.1-magnitude temblor struck at 5:15 a.m. (0215 GMT), as
many people still slept in this city of 1 million inhabitants.

Death toll rises to four as Japan's heat wave continues
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with two deaths

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Oppressive summer heat gripped Japan for the second
straight day Saturday, killing two, giving scores of people
sunstroke and driving temperatures more than 10 degrees Celsius (20
degrees F) above normal.
	   In Tokyo, where temperatures rose to 36.1 degrees Celsius (97
degrees Farenheit), a 39-year old man collapsed in the street and
died in a hospital of heat exhaustion, the fire department said.
	   Another man, believed to be in his fifties, was found dead near
a park bench in the western city of Osaka, killed by sunstroke,
police said.
	   The fatalities brought the two-day death toll from the heat wave
to four. On Friday a 58-year-old man and a 90-year old woman died.
	   About 160 people have been treated for sunstroke over the two
days of high temperatures, national broadcaster NHK reported.
	   Four people, including a 10-year-old schoolboy in Ota, about 90
kilometers (57 miles) north of Tokyo, were hospitalized Saturday
for heat exhaustion, Kyodo News reported.
	   People hosed down driveways to prevent heat from rising from the
asphalt, while those that ventured out of air-conditioned homes
wore handkerchiefs around their heads as protection from the sun.
	   Haruna, about 100 kilometers (63 miles) north of Tokyo,
registered 40.3 degrees Celsius (104.54 degrees), the highest ever
in the city since the Meteorological Agency began recording
temperatures there in 1972.
	   In Tokyo, the temperature hit a high of 34.4 degrees Celsius (94
degrees Fahrenheit) on Friday.
	   The average high temperature for Japan at this time of the year
is about 26.5 degrees Celsius (80 degrees Fahrenheit).
	   Early July is usually the height of Japan's rainy season, but
sunny weather has prevailed in recent days and near windless air
has contributed to the stifling heat.

Leader calls on Rwandans to put aside ethnic differences
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Rwandans must set aside ethnic differences
and use their brains, not bullets, to rebuild the nation devastated
by genocide in 1994, their top army commander said Saturday.
	   Vice President Paul Kagame, who is also defense minister, urged
the nation to have confidence that the army can control the Hutu
insurgency in the northwest that has killed thousands in the past
18 months.
	   Kagame addressed a crowd of about 35,000 at Kigali's Amahoro
soccer stadium, where Rwandans marked the fourth anniversary of the
victory of Tutsi soldiers he led to power in 1994, ending the Hutu
government-orchestrated slaughter of more than 500,000 Tutsis and
moderate Hutus.
	   Dressed in army fatigues, Kagame reviewed the units of the
Rwandan Patriotic Army, who paraded before foreign diplomats,
officials and army commanders from neighboring countries.
	   ``Many people shed blood on the road to liberation,'' he said in
Kinyarwanda, Rwandan national language. ``But now, there must be
other ways of finding peace and developing the country other than
sacrificing lives.''
	   In a conciliatory tone, he said it was not the lack of
intelligence, but a lack of will that was holding Rwanda back, and
said ethnic differences that had led to violence should be
forgotten for the benefit of all.
	   Problems to address include accommodating refugees, Hutus and
Tutsis both; rebel attacks in northwestern Rwanda and transforming
the economy, Kagame said.
	   President Pasteur Bizimungu, a Hutu, was absent from the
ceremony, instead addressing the nation in a recorded radio
broadcast. There was no immediate explanation for his absence.
	   After defeating the Hutu soldiers and militiamen responsible for
the massacres, Kagame's Rwandan Patriotic Front formed a government
of national unity consisting of both Hutus and Tutsis.
	   The army, originally consisting of Tutsis exiles, has so far
reintegrated up to 4,000 former Hutu soldiers and officers in a bid
to restore confidence among the predominantly Hutu population.
	   But the country is still facing a difficult task of
reconciliation. Distrust among many Hutus runs deep and
international human rights groups, notably Amnesty International,
have accused government soldiers of killing Hutu civilians.
	   The government denied the claim, and said it was prosecuting
soldiers suspected of human rights abuses. Army officials say it
often impossible to distinguish between the rebels and ordinary
Hutus, who provide food, shelter and money for the insurgents.

Guerrillas ambush Israeli patrol in southern Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with two wounded, details on
attack. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas detonated a bomb Saturday
near an Israeli army patrol in southern Lebanon.
	   The guerrillas claimed to have killed and wounded members of the
patrol. The Israeli army said an Israeli-allied militiaman was
slightly wounded and taken to a nearby hospital.
	   The guerrillas exploded the remote-controlled bomb as an armored
personnel carrier passed near the Ali Taher position, about four
kilometers (2.5 miles) northwest of Marjayoun.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah group claimed responsibility for
the ambush, which triggered retaliatory Israeli shelling of trails
believed to be used by guerrillas for infiltration.
	   No injuries were reported in the shelling, said the Lebanese
officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Later, an Israeli allied-militiamen was seriously hurt when the
car he was driving overturned, the Israeli army said. He was flown
to a hospital in Israel for treatment, the statement said.
	   Hezbollah guerrillas are spearheading a campaign to dislodge
Israel from an enclave it has occupied since 1985 to protect its
northern towns from cross-border guerrilla raids and rocket
attacks.
	   The zone is patrolled by about 1,200 Israeli soldiers and 2,500
Israeli-allied militiamen.

Mimicking dog, union chief barks bear up tree
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Used to raising his voice when
negotiating deals for paper workers, a union chief barked and drove
a bear up a tree when it surprised his family during evening tea.
	   Artturi Pennanen, 55, said the bear arrived at their campsite
while they were grilling sausages and brewing tea on an island in
southeastern Finland, the Ilta-Sanomat newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Pennanen, secretary-general of the Paper Workers Union, said his
wife tried to shoo away the bear by shouting and clapping.
	   ``The bear couldn't care less about human voices, so I tried to
mimic the low growl of a sheepdog, and then threw in a few tight,
vicious barks,'' he was quoted as saying. ``The bear jumped into
the nearest pine and climbed to a height of five to six meters (16
to 20 feet) surprisingly fast.''
	   The Pennanens own a summer villa in Ruokolahti, 240 kilometers
(150 miles) northeast of Helsinki, where a bear killed a jogger
three weeks ago in the first such fatal attack this century.
	   They were on a boating trip last week when the bear surprised
them, Ilta-Sanomat said.

World Cup: French dare to dream of World Cup finals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHANIE VAN DEN BERG &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS _ France's victory over Italy to reach the World Cup
semifinals was the talk of a proud nation Saturday following a
night of wild celebrations. Major newspapers headlined ``Keep on
dreaming'' and ``The beautiful adventure of France continues.''
	   During the tense match Friday evening, the economy slowed to a
standstill as most French focused on TV broadcasts to watch their
team struggle through. Shops were empty, offices closed early and
there was no rush-hour traffic.
	   After the French victory 4-3 in the penalty shoot-out, the whole
country exploded in a giant celebration.
	   Fans decked out in red, white and blue filled the Champs Elysees
chanting and shouting ``We won, we won,'' ``We're in the
semifinals'' and ``Italy is going home.''
	   Tens of thousands of people walked to the Arc de Triomphe,
halting traffic along the signature boulevard as riot police looked
on tolerantly. Amused tourists gawked and snapped pictures of the
celebrating throngs.
	   Sitting in a convertible, one man held up the front page of
L'Equipe, the sports daily, that headlined ``You can do it.''
Supporters sat in the street and did an impromptu wave, simulating
an ocean breaker.
	   ``I feel an immense joy. It's great. The match was great and
they deserved to win 2-0,'' said Aline, 45, who would not give her
last name. She had tears in her eyes.
	   Further down the ``Champs,'' Nicolas Leblanc, in his 30s with
the French flag draped around his shoulder, was ecstatic with joy.
	   ``We have been waiting for this since 1986, 12 years of slaving
away,'' Leblanc said. ``The penalty shoot-out session was horrible.
I thought my heart would give out.''
	   ``Justice was done,'' said Pierre Martin, another fan coming to
celebrate under the Arc de Triomphe.
	   One supporter already foresaw France facing Germany in the
semifinals and shouted at full volume to anyone passing by, ``We'll
eat the Germans alive.''
	   Most newspapers were not as confident about France's chances in
the semifinals. Many acknowledged that France's victory also came
about because of Italian failure during the game and the penalty
shootout.
	   ``Grazie Di Biagio'' headlined the southern French daily
Var-Matin. Luigi Di Biagio is the Italian player who missed the
decisive penalty try.
	   L'Humanite called the Italian inability to score ``La tragedia
dell'arte.''
	   French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez became the overnight poster boy
for the French team with his picture in every paper. But Bartez
declined to take sole credit for the victory.
	   ``Every one says that the goalkeeper is the hero, but I think
that the goalkeeper is not that important in a penalty shootout,''
Bartez said in Le Parisien. He praised the strikers for staying
calm under pressure.
	   But France is not in the finals yet, and most newspapers
remarked on France's seeming inability to put the ball into the
goal in regular time.
	   ``It would be good to end by scoring,'' headlined Le Parisien,
echoing the opinions of the other papers.
	   Still, the French coach Aime Jacquet was confident that his team
could go further.
	   ``We can't stop here. The team still has so much to give to the
French public,'' Jacquet said in an interview with L'Equipe. ``Yes,
I think we can go all the way. ''

	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Rwanda's top army commander on Saturday

Mbeki moves to dispel jitters over central bank control in South
</HEADLINE>
Africa &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The South African government,
eager to stabilize the nation's volatile currency, appointed a
political heavyweight Saturday to replace the central bank governor
next year.
	   Labor Minister Tito Mboweni, a development economist considered
a member of President Nelson Mandela's inner circle, will
understudy Chris Stals as his special deputy until he retires from
the South African Reserve Bank on Aug. 7, 1999.
	   The announcement by Vice President Thabo Mbeki came after
currency traders and business leaders urged the government to
dispel uncertainty over Stals' successor.
	   Rumors that Stals was being fired fueled wild fluctuations in
the value of the South African currency as it came under attack
from speculators in the past week.
	   The government moved quickly to dispel those rumors, saying
Stals would serve his full term, but acknowledged the need to
reassure jittery markets over the future control and independence
of the central bank.
	   Mboweni, flanking Mbeki at Saturday's news conference, vowed
that the impartiality of the bank's board of directors will be
maintained.
	   ``There will be no surprises,'' he said.
	   Mboweni said he will resign from all his political posts in the
governing African National Congress party.
	   Mbeki said Mboweni's appointment did away with uncertainty over
future control of the central bank, and business leaders were
pleased that the issue was addressed.
	   At the close of business Friday, the South African rand had
plunged to a record low against the U.S. dollar for a second
straight day.
	   The rand closed at 6.37 to the U.S. currency, having fallen to
6.44 _ it weakest ever _ on Friday morning. It recovered as
speculators backed off and U.S. money markets were closed for the
U.S. Independence Day holiday.
	   The rand has been under pressure because of the global emerging
market crisis sparked by Asia's financial woes. As the rand became
vulnerable, it came under assault by currency speculators.
	   So far this year it has lost about 23 percent of its value
against the dollar, the same amount it lost in all of 1996, when
the South African currency last lost stability.

World Cup: Another shootout disappointment for Italy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING FOR ALL NEEDING &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy on Saturday was suffering the World Cup
shootout blues for the third straight time.
	   But while disappointment was rife in this soccer-mad nation, so
was the sense that the beloved Azzurri got what they deserved in
Friday's quarterfinal loss to cup host France.
	   ``Penalty kicks are an invention of the devil,'' Gazzetta dello
Sport editor Candido Cannavo wrote in a front-page column, ``but
this time our right to detest them is very questionable.''
	   In a reference to the Azzurri's defense-first tactics, the
newspaper's front page had the banner headline: ``France is better
... Adieu `Fort Italy.'''
	   Unlike most countries, where thoughts of a world title are
harbored but not necessarily believed, Italians truly expect a
championship each and every four years. They have been right three
times, but not since 1982.
	   Another of the sports dailies, Corriere dello Sport, blared on
its front page, ``Cursed penalties. But it also is our fault.''
	   Editor Mario Sconcerti summed up the feelings of most Italians
with one line. ``We were very unlucky,'' he wrote, ``but not
good.''
	   This time, Italy's World Cup hopes went awry with a Luigi Di
Biagio penalty smacking the crossbar, handing France a 4-3 win in
the shootout after 120 minutes of scoreless play. Four years ago,
Italy lost the title match to Brazil when Roberto Baggio sent the
final penalty high. And, as hosts in 1990, Italy suffered a similar
fate, losing on penalties to Argentina after their semifinal match
ended 1-1.
	   No sooner had Di Biagio slumped to the ground after his errant
shot than talk in Italy turned to tactics and coach Cesare
Maldini's job status.
	   While the team's return home might not be met with tossed
tomatoes _ as infamously occurred at Milan's Linate airport after
Italy was shockingly defeated by North Korea during the 1966 World
Cup _ the ever-fragile relationship with the fans suffered a blow.
	   ``The red thread that was slowly tying the Italians to Italy's
team has been broken,'' Sconcerti wrote.
	   ``To only defend and look for the long pass or the counterattack
are solutions that are too fragile for the final phase of the World
Cup,'' he added. ``And they have value only if the team wins in the
end.''
	   It didn't, and the fans' bitterness was tangible.
	   ``There's just no luck. When it comes to penalties, Italy has no
luck,'' said Nicola Ambrosini, owner of La Tavernelle, a restaurant
within sight of the Colosseum that the late film director Federico
Fellini used to frequent. ``Somebody has to miss. It's so random,
it's painful. Maybe if they had tried to win before the penalties.
... No one is happy now.''
	   The painful wait until 2002 has begun.

Heat eases in Rome, but southern Italy still suffering
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A week-long heat wave eased in the capital Saturday,
but fires whipped by dry, hot winds continued to burn in the south,
forcing the evacuation of patients from a Sicilian hospital.
	   A blaze in the woods outside Catania, in eastern Sicily, filled
a hospital with smoke. Two helicopters lifted to safety a score of
patients, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.
	   In Bari, an Adriatic port city, and surrounding towns,
authorities restricted water supplies after heavy use drastically
lowered levels in water tanks, the AGI news agency said. Earlier in
the week, temperatures in the city reached the mid-40s C (over 110
F).
	   Temperatures in the south generally were in the low 30s C (low
90s F).
	   In Rome, central Italy, a bit of a breeze Friday night helped
keep temperatures from soaring over 30C (86F).
	   The relentless heat earlier in the week was blamed for at least
seven deaths, including that of a 21-month-old boy in Catania whose
father Friday left him broiling in the back seat of a car after the
man apparently forgot to drop off the child at a nursery en route
to work.
	   A shepherd in Calabria was burned to death Friday night when he
tried to save his sheep from a brush fire in that southern region.

World Cup: Les Bleus a game away from becoming greatest French
</HEADLINE>
team &QL; 
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ Les Bleus now face the next
challenge, one victory away from becoming the greatest French team
ever.
	   Already the 1998 squad is on a par with three other great teams
of the past. The 1958 squad of the World Cup's all-time top scorer
Just Fontaine, the 1982 team of mastermind Michel Platini and the
1986 edition with the ``magic midfield quartet.''
	   However, all three earlier teams lost in the semifinal and fell
a step short of the ultimate goal: a berth in the World Cup final.
Next Wednesday, the bulk of 80,000 fans in the Stade de France and
most of the 60 million other French will be urging Aime Jacquet's
men on into this uncharted territory.
	   ``It's the only comparison that can be made,'' said star
playmaker Zinedine Zidane, looking back into French soccer history.
``Now we have to make sure we can get higher.''
	   Zidane's energetic play inspired the French team during its
quarterfinal victory over Italy on Friday in a penalty shootout.
	   Jacquet felt the momentum was going France's way. ``In my mind,
we cannot stop in the semifinals,'' he said.
	   ``We have this culture of victory within us now,'' said defender
Lilian Thuram.
	   The team will need to regain its scoring touch, though. So far,
France has been an impregnable defensive bulwark, with the most
frustrated forward line left in the tournament.
	   After tallying nine goals in the three first-round games, the
scoring well has dried up alarmingly. France only scored in the
114th minute to beat Paraguay in the second round and couldn't
score a single goal in two hours against Italy.
	   ``We cannot do anything about it. It's all up to confidence and
patience,'' said Jacquet.
	   ``I know the problem and there is no explanation,'' said captain
Didier Deschamps.
	   In the games against Italy and Paraguay, France created plenty
of opportunities but failed each time on the last touch. Youri
Djorkaeff missed a golden opportunity and Stephane Guivarc'h had
little immediate impact.
	   ``If we keep creating opportunities, we will finally end up by
scoring some,'' said Jacquet.
	   Zidane, coming back after a two-game suspension, had a
near-perfect game, spreading passes around at will, but, he too,
realized his performance was missing something. ``A goal,'' he
said.
	   Often compared to Platini, Zidane realized all too well his
playmaker predecessor readily scored when the team needed it.
	   ``I haven't scored yet, so I hope it will come in the
semifinals,'' he said.
	   Even if Fontaine scored a World Cup record 13 goals in the 1958
finals, when France finished third, a pure striker for Les Bleus
has been a very rare bird indeed.
	   The offense thrust has always come from midfield, especially in
1982 and 1986, when France lost to Germany twice in the semifinals.
	   Now Jacquet is putting his hope in two 20-year olds from Monaco,
Thierry Henry, who scored three times in the first round, and David
Trezeguet.
	   With heavy responsibility weighing down on young shoulders, the
two remained cool when they both hit perfect penalties in the
shootout against Italy.
	   And it was a defender, Laurent Blanc, who scored the deciding
penalty. Blanc had already scored the Golden Goal in the 1-0 win
over Paraguay.
	   If one thing is certain, it is that the French defense has
carried the whole team. In five games, it has conceded on goal, a
penalty, and on Friday it overwhelmed World Cup top scorer
Christian Vieri.
	   Marcel Desailly has been outstanding. ``You don't need a
photofinish. He is the best defender of the World Cup.''

Jordan, Saudis plan a free trade zone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan and Saudi Arabia are working on
creating a free trade zone to bolster commercial ties.
	   The proposed zone would allow goods between the two Arab
neighbors to be exchanged free of tax and customs duty, Saudi Trade
Minister Osama al-Faqeeh told reporters.
	   ``Such a zone will lead to increased trade between us,'' he said
after talks with his Jordanian counterpart, Hani Mulqi.
	   Saudi Arabia is the second largest importer of Jordanian goods
after Iraq. Trade in 1997 was dlrs 345 million, the bulk of it
Jordanian imports of Saudi foodstuffs.
	   Al-Faqeeh declined to say how much the proposed zone would cost
or provide details. But he said the two also discussed ways to
facilitate the flow of goods and passengers.
	   Jordan has a fleet of more than 100 trucks that handles Saudi
Arabia-bound goods imported through the Red Sea port of Aqaba.
	   Al-Faqeeh is in Jordan to attend a Saudi industrial exhibition,
which is displaying foodstuffs and other products by more than 60
Saudi firms. The five-day exposition opened on Saturday.

	   After embracing Tauziat at the net, Novotna ran up into the
players' box in the Centre Court stands, where she hugged her
coach, Hana Mandlikova, and her mother.
	   Five years ago, Novotna wept on the duchess' shoulder after
blowing a 4-1 third-set lead in the final against Steffi Graf. Last
year, after losing in three sets to Martina Hingis, the duchess
encouraged her with the words ``third-time lucky.''
	   There were no tears Saturday when Novotna accepted the winner's
plate from the duchess. The two held each other's outstretched
hands and spoke animatedly for almost a minute.
	   ``I'm so proud of you,'' the duchess told Novotna.
	   When she first took the trophy, Novotna let out a big sigh of
relief.
	   ``I don't believe it,'' she said as she held the trophy over her
head, then pressed it to her cheek like a pillow and kissed it
gently.
	   Novotna circled the court and mouthed ``thank you'' as the
15,000 fans gave her a rousing standing ovation that lasted for
several minutes.
	   While the players walked off, the duchess waved to Novotna, who
responded by giving the thumbs-up sign.

Police nab five smugglers, 51 immigrants near Turkish border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Police arrested five smugglers and 51
illegal immigrants in northern Greece Saturday as part of a
continuing crackdown against immigrant trafficking.
	   A special border control unit arrested four Greek smugglers and
46 illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, Pakistan and India. Police
said the smugglers were driving in a truck toward the city of
Alexandroupolis a few kilometers (miles) from the Turkish border.
	   The immigrants told police they had paid a total of dlrs 92,000
to be smuggled into Greece.
	   Police arrested another Greek smuggler with five illegal
immigrants Saturday in Didimoticho, less than five kilometers
(three miles) from the Turkish border.
	   The immigrants will be placed in temporary shelters until their
petitions for asylum can be processed.
	   Tens of thousands of illegal immigrants sneak into Greece each
year, mainly from Albania or Turkey. Most of them move on to other
European countries, although some apply for political asylum and
are housed in refugee camps. Several thousand stay in Greece and
work illegally.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian authorities ordered a South Korean
diplomat expelled Saturday after he was detained overnight on
suspicion of spying.
	   The diplomat, who's name was believed to be Cho Sung-woo, was
taken into custody as he met with an alleged Russian contact,
according to a statement from the Federal Security Service, a
successor to the Soviet-era KGB.
	   The contact, an employee of Russia's Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, was also detained and is under investigation, the
statement said.
	   Cho, an advisor to the South Korean ambassador, has diplomatic
immunity and was released after questioning, the statement said.
	   However, later in the day the Foreign Ministry filed a formal
complaint with the South Korean ambassador, ordering Cho to leave
Russia within three days for ``illegal activities incompatible with
his diplomatic status.''
	   An employee of the South Korean Embassy who gave his name as Lee
said the Embassy had no immediate comment. In Seoul, calls to the
South Korean Foreign Ministry went unanswered late Saturday.

the U.S. Virgin Islands overnight. At 5 a.m. the weather radar
indicated scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms across the
east sections of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Numerous
showers and thunderstorms were observed across the coastal waters
south and west of Puerto Rico. This shower activity was associated
with a tropical wave located in the Mona Channel this morning.

Roberto Baggio, peaceful Paris &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Coach Cesare Maldini doesn't plan to
resign in the wake of Italy's World Cup elimination and wants to
respect his contract until it expires at the end of the year.
	   That means he will stay in charge during Italy's initial
qualifying matches of the European Championship.
	   ``The Federation president (Luciano Nizzola) praised the team
despite the quarterfinal loss on penalties,'' Maldini said
Saturday.
	   ``I read in some papers that also my son Paolo (the team
captain) would quit the national team. It would be a big mistake
because he still is one of the best world defenders. I believe the
Maldinis will stay on (with Italy),'' said the coach, whose
contract expired Dec. 31.
	   Maldini also disclosed that France's coach Aime Jacquet told him
recently that he will leave the French team at the end of the world
competition - no matter what the result is.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ A member of France's World Cup semifinalists was
praised Saturday, not for scoring a goal but for passing up a
chance so he could help an injured foe.
	   FIFA said Emmanuel Petit displayed ``a gesture of outstanding
sportsmanship'' when he kicked the ball out of bounds from close to
the Italian goal as Luigi Di Biagio lay on the ground on the middle
of the penalty box during the final minute of overtime. Play does
not routinely stop for injuries in international soccer matches.
	   ``I wasn't really conscious about what I was doing,'' Petit said
Saturday. ``I was so tired, I saw two legs of an Italian on the
ground, and I kicked the ball out.
	   ``We need fair play, I've always been like that,'' the Arsenal
midfielder said. ``I don't pull shirts, I don't insult anyone _
unless they are coming after me. Then I reply.''
	   Di Biagio was not seriously hurt and remained in the
quarterfinal match, which France won 4-3 on penalty kicks after
play ended in a scoreless tie.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French victory was the 12th time a World Cup
match was decided in a shootout, and the first time the host nation
won.
	   Mexico lost to Germany in 1986 and Argentina beat Italy in 1990
in previous penalty kick showdowns.
	   FIFA said that, of 123 shots taken in the shootouts, 97 were
converted, a 78.8-percent rate. On penalty kicks in games, the
conversion rate was 84.7 percent, 122 out of 144.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Roberto Baggio took Italy all the way to
the final in 1994. This World Cup ended too soon.
	   ``I hoped to play more, although I knew to have come here as a
reserve (to Alessandro Del Piero),'' said the veteran forward,
whose shootout penalty wasn't enough to stop his team losing to
host France Friday after a 0-0 tie in the quarterfinal.
	   ``We all were confident to make it to the final ...
unfortunately we lost once again on penalties,'' Baggio said
Saturday.
	   ``I did the best I could in a competition which ended too soon
for us.''
	   Midfielder Luigi Di Biagio, who missed a penalty in the 4-3
shootout loss to France, said it spoiled his good performances in
the competition.
	   ``I was calm as I reached the penalty spot. After the ball hit
the bar and bounced into the field I collapsed,'' he said. ``I
cried. I'll never forget that moment.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ It was a dream come true for stressed Parisians,
deserted streets, empty department stores and no rush hour traffic.
French economy grinded to a halt during the France-Italy game
Friday afternoon newspapers reported Saturday.
	   Great numbers of employees took a half day off. To avoid empty
workplaces many employers have installed televisions and video
screens so that their workers can watch the match.
	   The Paris stock exchange has installed TVs since the beginning
of the World Cup ``to avoid losing millions'', the management is
quoted as saying in sports daily L'Equipe.
	   According to the Liberation paper, the status of official World
Cup sponsor doesn't always help workers to get time off for soccer.
	   The paper said that McDonalds didn't allow their personnel even
a minute to watch the game. Another sponsor, Danone, was much more
generous, without going to the extremes of their factories in
Argentina. There, workers get the day off if the national team
play. In France, Danone installed giant screens for employees to
watch the match.

	   The victory marked the long-awaited breakthrough for Novotna,
long considered the best women's player without a Grand Slam title.
She finally accomplished it at the age of 29, playing in her 13th
Wimbledon and 45th Grand Slam event.
	   Playing classic grass-court tennis, Novotna controlled
Saturday's match from the net. Always on the attack, the Czech
served and volleyed, chipped and charged and soared to put away
high backhand volleys.
	   For awhile, though, it seemed as though Novotna might repeat her
1993 collapse. She led 3-1 and 5-3 in the second set and served for
the match at 5-4.
	   But Novotna played tentatively and was broken for 5-5. After
Tauziat held in the next game for 6-5, a third set seemed to be
looming.
	   But Novotna held for 6-6 and completely dominated the
tiebreaker, winning five straight points from 2-2 to close out the
match.
	   Tauziat seemed to know it was over when she made a forehand
error on the sixth point of the tiebreaker. She fell to the ground
and dropped her racket in disgust.

Missile purchase delay allows for negotiations, official says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By THANASSIS CAMBANIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A decision by Cyprus to postpone the
delivery of a Russian anti-aircraft missile system will reduce
tensions in the region and give Turkey more time to consider
demilitarizing the island, a Greek official said Saturday.
	   ``Every move that has a goal of reduced tension helps the
situation,'' Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman Theodoros Theodorou
told The Associated Press.
	   Russian and Greek officials announced this week that the S-300
missile system, originally scheduled for delivery to the island
this summer, will not arrive on Cyprus before November.
	   U.S. and European officials have pressured Cyprus to cancel the
dlrs 375 million purchase, saying it needlessly increases tension
and could set off a war between Greece and Turkey, NATO partners
with longstanding differences in the eastern Mediterranean.
	   Turkish officials claim the advanced anti-aircraft missile
launching system would give Cyprus the offensive capability to
strike aircraft flying over southern Turkey.
	   High-profile negotiators, including Richard Holbrooke, the
former U.S. special envoy for Cyprus and now nominee for U.N.
ambassador, and U.N. Special Envoy Diego Cordovez, have made
repeated visits to the island to break the deadlock.
	   Cordovez wrapped up his most recent visit Saturday, declaring no
breakthrough but announcing a return visit in September.
	   Tension escalated as the planned delivery date for the missiles
approached. In June, Greece sent fighter planes to a new air base
in Cyprus, and Turkey responded with its own display of military
force over the island.
	   This week's announcement by the Russian ambassador to Ankara
that the missiles would not be delivered until the late fall
provided the first step toward averting a crisis.
	   Greek and Russian officials said that Cyprus requested the
delay, although Cypriot officials refused to confirm they had done
so. In recent weeks Cyprus has avoided public comments about the
missile purchase.
	   Cypriot officials have repeatedly proposed total
demilitarization of the island as a basic step toward a solution.
	   Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Valery Nesterushkin said
Saturday that the government would be willing to cancel the missile
sale if it meant peace for Cyprus.
	   ``We believe that if significant progress is made in a Cyprus
peace settlement and demilitarization of the island is on the
agenda, there will be no need for the systems to be there,'' he
said.
	   Turkey invaded the northern third of Cyprus in 1974 and has
about 35,000 troops stationed in the self-styled Turkish Republic
of Northern Cyprus.
	   Negotiations to reunify the island have stalled over Turkish
demands to halt Cyprus' European Union accession talks.
	   On Saturday, Turkey repeated its threat to use force to stop
Cyprus from installing the S-300 system.
	   ``We are taking necessary military measures against the possible
deployment of the missiles,'' Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit told a
news conference in Ankara.
	   Turkey also has threatened to annex northern Cyprus outright if
the missiles are deployed.

Yokohama beats Yakult 9-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Central League-leading Yokohama BayStars rapped
out 17 hits Saturday as they trounced the Yakult Swallows 9-0 at
Kumamoto and extended their winning streak to six.
	   BayStars hurler Takeo Kawamura blanked the Swallows over eight
innings to improve to 7-2.
	   Yokohama outfielder Takanori Suzuki slammed a solo homer in the
first to start the scoring for the BayStars.
	   At Nagoya Dome, Kenshin Kawakami struck out nine over nine full
innings to notch his seventh win against two losses.
	   Yomiuri starter Sung-min Cho, formerly in the South Korean
league, took the loss and slipped to 7-5.
	   At Hiroshima, Kenjiro Nomura batted in three runs, including a
2-run homer in the sixth, to lead the Hiroshima Carp to a 5-3 win
over the Hanshin Tigers.
	   In the Pacific League, the Seibu Lions beat the front running
Nippon Ham Fighters 4-3 in extra innings.
	   Lions pinch-hitter Hiroyuki Takagi batted in the winning run in
the top of the eighth.
	   Seibu reliever Yui Tomori pitched out the game to pick up his
sixth win of the season against two losses.
	   Nippon Ham sluggers, Jerry Brooks, formerly with the Florida
Marlins, and Nigel Wilson, a former Cleveland Indian, hit solo
homeruns but they were not enough to power the Fighters to victory.
	   In another extra innings game, the Daiei Hawks defeated the
Lotte Marines 10-7 at Chiba.
	   Hawks infielder Tadahito Iguchi blasted a three-run homer in the
eleventh to seal the victory after pinch-hitter Ryo Kawano batted
in the winning run off a sacrifice fly.
	   At Green Stadium Kobe, Orix hurler Takhide Ito gave up two hits
and struck out four over six innings to lead the BlueWave to a 5-3
win over the Kintetsu Buffaloes.

Northern Ireland braces for Orange parade showdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout for AMs

<TEXT>
	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ British soldiers and state
police have transformed Portadown into a military camp, wrapping
the town's Catholic enclave in an armored cocoon and throwing
elaborate barbed-wire defenses across pastures to thwart Protestant
marchers.
	   Politicians from all sides appealed for Sunday's now-annual
showdown over who ``owns'' Portadown's Garvaghy Road _ the
Catholics who live alongside it, or the Orangemen who treat this
staunchly Protestant town as their spiritual heartland _ not to
spark riots across Northern Ireland, the awful outcome for the past
two years.
	   ``We do not want to see violence on our streets. We do not want
the two sides of our community to embark on a collision course
where all will be losers,'' said David Trimble, an Orangeman and
leader of the north's major pro-British party, the Ulster
Unionists, which has formal links with the 80,000-strong Orange
Order brotherhood.
	   Trimble spoke alongside Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the main
moderate Catholic party. Together they head Northern Ireland's new
power-sharing Assembly, the main pillar of April's multi-party
agreement on how Northern Ireland should be governed.
	   Mallon appealed for both the protesters and the Portadown
Orangemen to demonstrate ``tolerance, restraint and generosity.''
	   At his English country retreat, Prime Minister Tony Blair blamed
the deadlock on the fact that Orangemen had refused to talk
directly with the protest group and that both sides had adopted
``two very entrenched positions.''
	   Alistair Graham, chairman of the Parades Commission that ordered
Orangemen to avoid Garvaghy Road, attributed failure to defuse the
showdown on ``the strong personalities that exist on either side,''
an apparent reference to Portadown's Orange district master, Harold
Gracey, and the Catholic protest leader, former IRA prisoner
Breandan MacCionnaith.
	   Orangemen insist they must be allowed to parade back into town
from their rural Drumcree Anglican church along the disputed road.
Since 1807 they have marched that route as part of their annual
demonstration of Protestant solidarity beneath emblems of a British
crown on an open Bible.
	   But now facing a network of barbed-wire coils, high steel walls,
a deep trench and video recording cameras erected early Saturday by
British soldiers, the Orangemen say when their parade leaves the
church Sunday afternoon they will camp out in the adjoining
cemetery and fields for as long as it takes to win the argument.
	   MacCionnaith, meanwhile, organized his protesters to form a
round-the-clock picket alongside Garvaghy Road, so fearful are they
that the forces of law and order will cave in to Orange pressure
and force the marchers down the road.
	   That's exactly what happened in 1996, when police were ordered
to abandon their Drumcree cordon after four increasingly disastrous
nights for Northern Ireland, when Orangemen blocked key roads and
Protestants attacked Catholics and destroyed businesses.
	   Even more embittering for Catholics is the legacy of 1997, when
soldiers erected barbed wire at Drumcree, but only as a ruse to
catch most of the protesters asleep when Garvaghy Road was
saturated with armor and riot police before dawn.
	   This time the military chiefs _ with a possible 13,000 officers
and 19,000 soldiers at their disposal _ seem to have learned
tactical lessons from 1996, when tens of thousands of Orangemen
were allowed to travel to Drumcree.
	   All roads around Portadown were being monitored by joint
police-army checkpoints late Saturday, a deployment that might make
it possible to block Orange reinforcements from reaching Drumcree
from other parts of Northern Ireland.
	   Lost amid all the hard-line rhetoric of the Garvaghy Road
protesters is the fact that the community is divided over the
merits of confrontation. These people _ moderate and intimidated _
are staying in their homes, silently angry that their militant
neighbors would risk Northern Ireland's fragile peace for the cause
of shaming Orangemen.
	   ``Their community has their dictators, and we have ours,'' said
a resident who explained he couldn't give his name because local
IRA supporters ``would make my life hell, and I've small children
to think about.''
	   ``MacCionnaith doesn't even live here, but he's been sent in to
do a mission _ stir up the Prods (Protestants) _ and he's done it
well. He really makes me sick,'' said the resident, who plans to
spend his Sunday watching Wimbledon and the World Cup on
television.
	   ``Sure no Catholic would be a fan of Orange marches, but they're
only once a year for 10 minutes. Stopping them is not worth one
ounce of anyone's blood.''

World Cup:
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Patrick Kluivert and Claudio Lopez
traded goals in the first 24 minutes and the Netherlands and
Argentina were tied 1-1 after an evenly played first half of their
World Cup quarterfinal match Saturday.
	   In addition to their goals, both sides hit the post once and
created several chances.
	   Kluivert, playing in his first game since being ejected and from
the Dutch's group opener against Belgium, finished a three-man
combination in the 12th minute.
	   Ronald de Boer sent in a long ball from midfield to the top left
corner of the penalty area where Dennis Bergkamp sent a falling
header into the path of Kluivert. The 22-year-old AC Milan striker
then simply knocked the ball over approaching Argnetine keeper
Carlos Roa from 11 meters.
	   The goal came seven minutes after the Netherlands shook
Argentina with Wim Jonk's 15-meter blast off the right post.
	   But Argentina composed itself and tied the game midway through
the half when Lopez capitalized on a gambling Dutch defense. Juan
Veron sent a ball out of midfield down the middle of the field and
marking back Michael Reiziger stepped forward and raised his hand
to catch Lopez off side.
	   But Lopez remained clearly onside, walked in on Edwin van der
Sar unmolested and paused before adding the indignity of scoring
through the Dutch keeper's legs.
	   Both sides exchanged offensive forays. Jonk had a blast from 25
meters that Roa had to parry away in the 35th minute and Ariel
Ortega had a rocket from 30 meters that rang off the left post
three minutes later.
	   Both sides were looking to reach a semifinal meeting against
Brazil on Tuesday in Marseille. The two-time champion Argentines
were hoping to return to the final four for the first time since
1990, while the Dutch sought to go back for the first time since
1978, when it lost the final to Argentina.
	   With Marc Overmars out due to a pulled hamstring suffered in
training Thursday, the Dutch were forced to adjust their starting
lineup. Phillip Cocu moved back into the midfield for Overmars and
Jonk replaced Clarence Seedorf, two changes that indicated a more
defensive strategy.
	   Kluivert's return followed a two-match suspension for elbowing
Lorenzo Staelens in the Netherlands' opening group game against
Belgium.

Report: Ugandan officials to meet with rebel commanders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Local officials of Uganda's rebel-wracked
north are in the Kenyan capital Nairobi to hold talks with Ugandan
rebel commanders aimed at establishing a peace process, a newspaper
report said Saturday.
	   The move was welcomed by a government spokesman who was cited by
the report as saying peaceful solutions to the violence should be
explored.
	   The district commissioners of the northern Gulu and Kitgum
districts were to meet in Nairobi with eight commanders of the
rebel Lord's Resistance Army, which plagues those regions with
violence, according to the state-run daily New Vision.
	   Lt. Col. Walter Ochora of Gulu, 275 kilometers (175 miles) north
of the Ugandan capital Kampala, and John Bosco Oryem of Kitgum, 90
kilometers (60 miles) northeast of Gulu, arrived in Nairobi
Wednesday to talk peace with the unidentified rebel officers, the
report said.
	   In the past, President Yoweri Museveni has rejected talks with
the LRA, saying a military solution was the only viable option.
	   But Museveni has also recently admitted to laziness and
indiscipline in his army, which has failed to stem the 12-year
rebellion.
	   ``President Yoweri Museveni has often said the government is
prepared to suppoert whoever can find a peaceful solution to the
conflict,'' Amama Mbabazi, a minister of state in the presidency
was quoted by the newspaper as saying. ``The government will not
stand in the way of any peaceful initiative.''
	   The report followed a three-day seminar in Gulu last week by
religious leaders who called for the government to enter into peace
talks with the rebels, saying the military had failed to stem the
bloodshed.
	   The LRA, the largest of several Ugandan rebel groups, has been
targeting civilians in its efforts to topple Museveni's government.
	   The rebels sometimes kill their victims and more recently, have
increased the practice of abducting children and young adults to
serve as warriors, bearers or sex slaves.
	   Last week, the army rescued 29 schoolgirls captured by the LRA
during clashes near the Sudanes border. Ugandan officials said the
girls returned with a letter from LRA chief Joseph Kony in which he
demanded control over northern Uganda.
	   But in a press release obtained by the New Vision, the rebels
denied sending the letter and said they were not interested in
dividing up Uganda.
	   ``We want the whole thing,'' the New Vision quoted the statement
as saying.
	   Meanwhile, the newspaper said that the military units fighting
Alliance of Democratic Forces rebels in western Uganda along the
Congolese border would move its main regional army base into a
captured rebel headquarters, 15 kilometers (10 miles) inside
eastern Congo.
	   The newspaper cited acting chief of staff and commander of
troops fighting the ADF James Kazini as saying the base at Ntabi,
about 375 kilometers (235 miles) west of Kampala, was operationally
advantageous to fighting the ADF.
	   The army captured the ADF base at Ntabi on June 28, along with
1,591 machine guns, ammunition and mortars, the newspaper said.

Algerian government imposes Arabic as official language
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Despite widespread opposition, the
Algerian government was set to impose a law that will ban the
official use of all languages except Arabic.
	   Starting Sunday, the 36th anniversary of Algeria's independence
from France, Arabic will become the only official language in this
multi-cultural North African country.
	   Over the past 10 days, the law has provoked protests among the
country's Berbers, who represent a third of Algeria's population
and speak their own language, Berber, also known as Tamazghit.
	   The law also would prohibit from official use other languages
including French, which is still widely used in this former French
colony, especially in urban areas and among educated people.
	   Many Algerians consider the Arabic-only law as an attempt by the
military-backed government to court favor with supporters of
Islamic movements.
	   Since 1992, the Algerian authorities have been fighting an
Islamic insurgency that broke out after the government canceled
parliamentary elections Muslim parties were set to win.
	   Neither the government nor the insurgents, however, has been
able to gain the upper hand in the conflict that has left an
estimated 75,000 people dead.
	   The most impassioned protests against the new law have been in
the city of Tizi-Ouzou, a largely Berber town about 90 kilometers
(60 miles) east of the capital Algiers.
	   In Tizi-Ouzou and Bejaia, nearby port city, Arabic-language
signs have been destroyed. Demonstrators in recent days have
shouted, ``We are not Arabs.''
	   The region has been shaken by unrest since late June when Muslim
militants assassinated Lounes Matoub, a popular Berber singer who
had just returned from France where he had lived in exile.
	   Much of the protesters' anger has been directed against
President Liamine Zeroual, who on Wednesday expressed his
determination to make sure the law was applied.
	   The Berbers, an ancient group of tribes, have long fought to
preserve their language and several language revolts since
independence have been repressed.
	   Nevertheless, since independence, the Algerian government has
moved to impose Arabic as the sole official language. In 1968,
knowledge of Arabic became mandatory for government officials.
	   Legal proceedings in Algeria are conducted in Arabic, and it is
the main language in schools. However, for millions of people,
Berber and French remain important languages.

Donald and Ntini leave England struggling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with tea score
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Fast bowler Makhaya Ntini produced a
crucial breakthrough by taking the wicket of Mike Atherton as South
Africa tightened its grip on the third cricket test Saturday.
	   Faced with the prospect of scoring 353 to avoid following on,
England lost Nick Knight, Nasser Hussain and then Atherton to slump
to 100 for three at tea on the third day at Old Trafford.
	   Ntini had Atherton caught behind to break up a threatening
partnership with skipper Alec Stewart, after the pair had come
together on 34 for two.
	   The third wicket pair added 60 runs, surviving a fearsome
battering from fast bowler Allan Donald and Lance Klusener in the
97 minutes together.
	   Donald, bowling at speeds about 90 mph (144 kph), got rid of
Knight and Hussain in the overs before and after lunch.
	   Stewart is unbeaten on 37 and Mark Ramprakash is four not out,
batting ahead of an injured Graham Thorpe.
	   England was already handicapped by the loss of Thorpe, who
failed to take the field this morning with a recurrence of the back
injury after two days in the field.
	   England's reply came after South Africa had batted for 13 hours
before declaring on 552 for five due largely to a career-best 210
by opener Gary Kirsten and 132 by Jacques Kallis.
	   The home side needs another 253 runs to make South Africa bat
again on a wicket that is already producing varied bounce.
	   Atherton, who batted for 160 minutes for his 41 runs, was hit on
the back of his helmet ducking into a Klusener bouncer and later
was struck on the ribs by Donald.
	   But the former skipper courageously continued as England faced
the grim task of saving the test and stopping South Africa from
taking a 2-0 lead in the five-match series.
	   Donald began the England slide by bouncing out Knight and
Hussain, both caught behind by Mark Boucher, who later caught
Atherton off the bowling of Ntini.
	   South Africa resumed play at 487 for four and continued batting
for 55 minutes, adding 65 runs, before declaring its innings.
	   Jonty Rhodes was out to the fourth ball of the day, driving
half-heartedly at Darren Gough and lobbing a simple catch to
Dominic Cork at mid-off.
	   But Hansie Cronje (69 not out) and Klusener (17 not out),
smacked 62 runs in 49 minutes before deciding to declare. England
was just one delivery short of bowling 200 overs.

WIMBLEDON: in disgust.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   With their combined age of 59, Novotna and the 30-year-old
Tauziat were the oldest women's finalists at Wimbledon since 1977
when Virginia Wade and Betty Stove totaled 63 years.
	   Tauziat, the first French women's finalist since Suzanne Lenglen
in 1925, was the lowest seeded player (16) in a women's final.
	   Like Novotna, Tauziat played a natural grass-court game but she
lacked the speed and athleticism of her opponent. She also was hurt
by her poor first-serve percentage as Novotna punished her
repeatedly on the second serve.
	   With both players looking tight at the start of the match,
Tauziat led 2-0 and had two points to go up 3-0. But she squandered
both and Novotna broke back for 2-1.
	   The seventh game proved the turning point of the set _ and
possibly the match.
	   Tauziat, serving, fell behind 0-40. She fought off three, then a
fourth break point. At deuce, she hit a volley that was called in
but was overruled by chair umpire Jane Harvey.
	   ``No, no, no, no, no,'' Tauziat shrieked. ``You didn't call it
straight away. Who is the umpire here?''
	   On the seventh break point, Novotna hit a high forehand volley
for a winner to break for 4-3. She pumped her right fist and did a
hop and skip as she ran to her chair, while Tauziat stopped and
stared in disgust. The Frenchwoman continued to complain to the
umpire during the changeover.
	   Three games later, Novotna served out the set. She broke in the
first game of the second set and led 3-1 before double faulting on
break point to allow Tauziat to even the score at 3-3. Novotna
broke back in the next game and the two stayed on serve until
Novotna failed to serve out the match in the 10th.
	   Pete Sampras, seeking his fifth title in six years, faces Goran
Ivanisevic in the men's final Sunday.
	   Two weeks ago, Ivanisevic wasn't even considered among the
serious title contenders. He'd won only one match in his five
previous Grand Slam tournaments and had slipped to No. 25 in the
world rankings.
	   Ivanisevic was lucky to be seeded (No. 14), a favor from
tournament organizers in recognition of his past record as a
two-time finalist.
	   But the 26-year-old Croat has surprised everybody by returning
to the final for a third time and challenging again for something
he's never been able to achieve: a Grand Slam title.
	   ``A lot of people say, `He's gone, he's never going to be
back,''' Ivanisevic said. ``I knew that I had a bad six months and
Wimbledon came at the right time. I put these six months behind me.
I was practicing hard for the last month trying not to feel sorry
for myself, and now it's paying off.''
	   Most surprising about Ivanisevic is the way he has held his
temper, concentration and composure _ a sharp contrast from his
reputation for self-destructing.
	   He never lost his head in Friday's semifinal against Richard
Krajicek, even after squandering two match points while serving at
5-4, 40-15 in the fourth set, or going down a break at 3-2 in the
fifth set.
	   Ivanisevic didn't rant and rave. He didn't smash any rackets. He
just kept pounding his left-handed serve and outlasted Krajicek in
a marathon 28-game final set to win 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 6-7 (7-5),
15-13.
	   ``I don't think anybody bet on me when I lost the fourth set,''
Ivanisevic said. ``Everybody said, `Maybe it's going to be 6-2 or
6-3. He's gone, he's going to lose it.' But I did win it. I was
just very mentally strong. I was never like this in my life. I just
believed I was going to win it.''
	   It will take more than self-confidence to beat Sampras in
Sunday's final. Facing his toughest test so far, Sampras reasserted
his grass-court superiority to turn back Tim Henman, his friend and
practice partner, 6-3, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3.
	   Sunday's match will be a rematch of the 1994 final, which
Sampras won in straight sets. Sampras will be favored to win his
fifth title in six years, which would tie him with Bjorn Borg for
the most Wimbledon victories in the Open era.
	   ``I think I have a good chance,'' Ivanisevic said. ``He's going
for the record, I'm going for my first. ... I think this year I
have the best chance. I think I can do it and I would be very
disappointed if I don't do it.''
	   Sampras has a 10-6 record against Ivanisevic, including eight
victories in their last nine matches. He knows what to expect.

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ The Duchess of Kent was right. The
third time was the right time for Jana Novotna.
	   Novotna, the losing finalist in 1993 and 1997, won her first
Wimbledon title Saturday with a 6-4, 7-6 (7-2) victory over
Nathalie Tauziat.
	   After Novotna hit a forehand passing shot to end the match, she
dropped to her knees, held her arms in the air and covered her face
with both hands as she wept with joy.
	   After embracing Tauziat at the net, Novotna ran up into the
players' box in the Centre Court stands, where she hugged her
coach, Hana Mandlikova, and her mother.
	   Five years ago, Novotna wept on the duchess' shoulder after
blowing a 4-1 third-set lead in the final against Steffi Graf. Last
year, after losing in three sets to Martina Hingis, the duchess
encouraged her with the words ``third-time lucky.''
	   There were no tears Saturday when Novotna accepted the winner's
plate from the duchess. The two held each other's outstretched
hands and spoke animatedly for almost a minute.
	   ``I'm so proud of you,'' the duchess told Novotna.
	   When she first took the trophy, Novotna let out a big sigh of
relief.
	   ``I don't believe it,'' she said as she held the trophy over her
head, then pressed it to her cheek like a pillow and kissed it
gently.
	   Novotna circled the court and mouthed ``thank you'' as the
15,000 fans gave her a rousing standing ovation that lasted for
several minutes.
	   While the players walked off, the duchess waved to Novotna, who
responded by giving the thumbs-up sign.
	   The victory marked the long-awaited breakthrough for Novotna,
long considered the best women's player without a Grand Slam title.
She finally accomplished it at the age of 29, playing in her 13th
Wimbledon and 45th Grand Slam event.
	   Playing classic grass-court tennis, Novotna controlled
Saturday's match from the net. Always on the attack, the Czech
served and volleyed, chipped and charged and soared to put away
high backhand volleys.
	   For awhile, though, it seemed as though Novotna might repeat her
1993 collapse. She led 3-1 and 5-3 in the second set and served for
the match at 5-4.
	   But Novotna played tentatively and was broken for 5-5. After
Tauziat held in the next game for 6-5, a third set seemed to be
looming.
	   But Novotna held for 6-6 and completely dominated the
tiebreaker, winning five straight points from 2-2 to close out the
match.
	   Tauziat seemed to know it was over when she made a forehand
error on the sixth point of the tiebreaker. She fell to the ground
and dropped her racket in disgust.
	   With their combined age of 59, Novotna and the 30-year-old
Tauziat were the oldest women's finalists at Wimbledon since 1977
when Virginia Wade and Betty Stove totaled 63 years.
	   Tauziat, the first French women's finalist since Suzanne Lenglen
in 1925, was the lowest seeded player (16) in a women's final.
	   Like Novotna, Tauziat played a natural grass-court game but she
lacked the speed and athleticism of her opponent. She also was hurt
by her poor first-serve percentage as Novotna punished her
repeatedly on the second serve.
	   With both players looking tight at the start of the match,
Tauziat led 2-0 and had two points to go up 3-0. But she squandered
both and Novotna broke back for 2-1.
	   The seventh game proved the turning point of the set _ and
possibly the match.
	   Tauziat, serving, fell behind 0-40. She fought off three, then a
fourth break point. At deuce, she hit a volley that was called in
but was overruled by chair umpire Jane Harvey.
	   ``No, no, no, no, no,'' Tauziat shrieked. ``You didn't call it
straight away. Who is the umpire here?''
	   On the seventh break point, Novotna hit a high forehand volley
for a winner to break for 4-3. She pumped her right fist and did a
hop and skip as she ran to her chair, while Tauziat stopped and
stared in disgust. The Frenchwoman continued to complain to the
umpire during the changeover.
	   Three games later, Novotna served out the set. She broke in the
first game of the second set and led 3-1 before double faulting on
break point to allow Tauziat to even the score at 3-3. Novotna
broke back in the next game and the two stayed on serve until
Novotna failed to serve out the match in the 10th.
	   Pete Sampras, seeking his fifth title in six years, faces Goran
Ivanisevic in the men's final Sunday.
	   It will be a rematch of the 1994 final, which Sampras won in
straight sets. Sampras will be favored to win his fifth title in
six years, which would tie him with Bjorn Borg for the most
Wimbledon victories in the Open era.
	   Two weeks ago, Ivanisevic wasn't even considered among the
serious title contenders. He'd won only one match in his five
previous Grand Slam tournaments and had slipped to No. 25 in the
world rankings.
	   Ivanisevic was lucky to be seeded (No. 14), a favor from
tournament organizers in recognition of his past record as a
two-time finalist.
	   But the 26-year-old Croat has surprised everybody by returning
to the final for a third time and challenging again for something
he's never been able to achieve: a Grand Slam title.
	   ``A lot of people say, `He's gone, he's never going to be
back,''' Ivanisevic said. ``I knew that I had a bad six months and
Wimbledon came at the right time. I put these six months behind me.
I was practicing hard for the last month trying not to feel sorry
for myself, and now it's paying off.''

Communists' No. 2 calls risk for Italian elections `enormous'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ As a meeting to resolve differences among Premier
Romano Prodi's center-left coalition partners grew nearer, a leader
of his hardline Communists, a key ally, has contended that the risk
of elections is ``enormous' if more isn't done to create jobs.
	   ``The optimism that's going around is unfounded, the risk for
elections (is) enormous'' because of social unease over
unemployment, which is running 12.2 percent nationally, Communist
Refoundation president Armano Cossutta was quoted as saying in an
interview Saturday in Rome daily La Repubblica.
	   The Olive Tree coalition enjoys a majority in the lower Chamber
of Deputies thanks to outside support from the Communists.
	   On Thursday, Prodi's partners are expected to starting
discussing the health of the coalition following last month's
refusal by the Communists to back the government in Parliament on a
key foreign policy plank -- support for NATO's eastward expansion.
	   Since Communists have indicated they are committed to keeping
the government in place, Cossutta's remarks appeared aimed mainly
at reassuring its blue-collar working voter base that the party was
taking a hard stand on fighting joblessness.
	   Communist leader Fausto Bertinotti has insisted that despite the
split on NATO his group would support Prodi in any confidence vote,
making any near prospect for a government collapse unlikely.
	   Prodi has said he sees no alternative to his coalition partners,
which include former Communists, ex-Christian Democrats and Greens,
as well as the hardline Communist allies.

Hussein of Jordan and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will meet
Sunday in Cairo for talks on stalled Mideast peace talks.

Bavarian minister wants expulsion of Turkish youth for repeated
</HEADLINE>
crime &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Bavarian Interior Minister Guenther
Beckstein said Saturday that a Turkish boy that he wants expelled
from Germany for repeated crimes along with his parents, was
involved in another robbery and beating overnight.
	   The 13-year-old youth, identified only as Mehmet, along with two
other boys, beat and robbed another school-age youth late Friday,
Beckstein said.
	   According to Beckstein, the latest incident brings to 61 the
number of crimes the Turkish boy has been involved in, including
stealing, robberies, extortion and beatings.
	   Because of his age, the boy cannot be jailed for the crimes, and
instead has been repeatedly returned to his parents and entered
into a special training program.
	   Beckstein said it was high time Munich's social aid office,
which has been fighting the expulsion as too harsh, understand that
the young Turk is a danger to the public.
	   He said the state had wasted some 8,400 marks (dlrs 4,600) thus
far to pay for special schooling trying to re-socialize the boy.
	   In the first such action against a juvenile delinquent in
Germany, Munich district officials decided several weeks ago to
expel the youth and his parents at the end of July.
	   The parents have filed a suit with the local administrative
court to get the expulsion order voided.

Finnish, Swedish fight heats up over vintage booze in shipwreck

	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ A Finnish businessman said Saturday he
will defy a court order and continue to dive for thousands of
liters of vintage champagne, cognac and wine in a shipwreck in the
Gulf of Bothnia.
	   The wreck of the Joenkoeping schooner, some 20 kilometers off
the Finnish coast near Rauma, was found last year by Swedish divers
who say the sunken treasure is theirs.
	   Peter Fryckman, a Finnish businessman whose diving team has
brought up several hundred bottles of 1907 vintage champagne from
the Joenkoeping, claims the treasure because the company of his
great grandfather, Sven Gustav Fryckman, was involved in delivering
the order.
	   After the Swedes, who belong to the C-Star team, complained they
were being blocked from the wreck, a district court in southwestern
Finland on Friday ordered Fryckman to remove his diving gear and
vessel, which is anchored over the site.
	   ``The court order won't affect our diving at all because it was
based on papers from one party only,'' Fryckman said. ``We plan to
salvage, as soon as possible, as many bottles and barrels as
possible,'' he added.
	   The C-Star team located the Joenkoeping in June last year after
a Finnish trawler reported its nets were entangled in an underwater
obstacle at a depth of 64 meters (211 feet).
	   The 20-meter (66-feet) ship, which was torpedoed by a German
U-boat in 1916, went down with a cargo that included 44 crates of
champagne, 67 barrels of cognac and 17 barrels of port wine. The
consignment, currently valued at some 5 million markkaa (dlrs 1
million), had been ordered by Russia's czarist army.
	   The C-Star team, which has permission to dive to the wreck until
the end of the year, maintains its right to the treasure because
its divers found the ship.
	   Finnish citizens do not need permission to dive because the
wreck lies in the country's regional waters.
	   The Bank of Finland, which supervised the monetary transfer of
the 1916 deal, said the ownership of the cargo has not been
determined.
	   ``It's a very tricky question and certainly the bank has no
evidence that Fryckman owns the cargo,'' said Arno Lindgren, head
of legal affairs at the Bank of Finland.
	   Police in Uusikaupunki, 240 kilometers (150 miles) northwest of
Helsinki, are responsible for keeping the peace over the wreck in
the Gulf of Bothnia.
	   ``We are worried. There's a lot of tension out there between the
Finnish and Swedish diving groups,'' said Police Chief Inspector
Pentti Koski.
	   On Thursday, the Swedish diving team arrived with a vessel to
float the Joenkoeping, Koski said. But their efforts were blocked
by Fryckman's ship.
	   ``It seems to be a total stalemate,'' Koski said. ``Let's hope
everyone can keep a cool head.''
	   Since the wreck was found, the C-Star group and Fryckman's team
have salvaged several hundred bottles of 1907 Gout Americain
champagne.
	   ``It's good stuff and there's plenty more down there,'' Fryckman
said. ``We plan to bring the whole lot up.''

Report: Ugandan officials to meet with rebel commanders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Local officials of Uganda's rebel-wracked
north are in the Kenyan capital to hold talks with Ugandan rebel
commanders on establishing a peace process, a newspaper reported
Saturday.
	   The move was welcomed by a government spokesman cited as saying
that peaceful solutions should be explored.
	   The district commissioners of Uganda's northern Gulu and Kitgum
districts were to meet in Nairobi with eight commanders of the
rebel Lord's Resistance Army, the state-run daily New Vision
reported.
	   Lt. Col. Walter Ochora of Gulu and John Bosco Oryem of Kitgum
arrived in Nairobi on Wednesday to talk peace with the unidentified
rebel officers, the report said.
	   In the past, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has rejected
talks with the LRA, saying a military solution was the only viable
option. But he recently admitted to laziness and lack of discipline
in his army, which has failed to stem the 12-year rebellion.
	   ``The government will not stand in the way of any peaceful
initiative,'' Ugandan minister of state Amama Mbabazi was quoted as
saying.
	   The report followed a three-day seminar in Gulu last week for
religious leaders who called on the government to enter into peace
talks with the rebels since the military has not ended the
bloodshed.
	   The LRA, the largest of several Ugandan rebel groups, has been
targeting civilians in its efforts to topple Museveni's government.
	   The rebels sometimes kill their victims and more recently have
increased the practice of abducting children and young adults to
serve as warriors, bearers or sex slaves.
	   Last week, the army rescued 29 schoolgirls captured by the LRA
during clashes near the Sudanese border. Ugandan officials said the
girls returned with a letter from LRA chief Joseph Kony in which he
demanded control over northern Uganda.
	   But in a statement reported by New Vision, the rebels denied
sending the letter and said they were not interested in dividing up
Uganda. ``We want the whole thing,'' New Vision quoted the LRA
rebels as saying.
	   Meanwhile, the newspaper said that the military units fighting
Alliance of Democratic Forces rebels in western Uganda, along the
Congolese border, would move its main regional army base into a
captured rebel headquarters 15 kilometers (10 miles) inside Congo,
formerly Zaire.
	   The newspaper cited acting Chief of Staff James Kazini, who
commands the troops fighting the ADF, as saying that the base at
Ntabi, about 375 kilometers (235 miles) west of Kampala, was a good
spot to fight the ADF from.
	   The army captured the base on June 28, along with 1,591 machine
guns, ammunition and mortars, the newspaper said.

Nigeria waits, wondering when Abiola will go free
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GILBERT DA COSTA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Moshood Abiola will go free, the Nigerian
junta says, along with every other political prisoner. But exactly
when that freedom will come has become the big question.
	   Ask Abiola's family and some are predicting that the apparent
winner of 1993's presidential elections will have his liberty in
the next couple days, while many government officials think it
won't come until after the mourning period for former dictator Sani
Abacha ends July 7.
	   Some officials even have him languishing in his guest
house-prison for weeks or even months more because his supporters
have reacted loudly and angrily to reports that Abiola has
renounced his presidential mandate.
	   July 8 is the date to watch, the Lagos-based newspaper This Day
reported Saturday.
	   Quoting unidentified sources in the presidency, the newspaper
said Abiola's freedom would be given that day _ the same day that
they say Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, Nigeria's new junta leader, will
announce a new political transition program.
	   The current transition program, which was created by Abacha and
blatantly manipulated by him, calls for the military to cede power
to a civilian government by Oct. 1. While Abubakar has pledged to
stand by that date, it is rapidly approaching and a new timetable
is widely rumored.
	   Abiola's family, meanwhile, has been sprucing up his home since
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan announced Thursday that the junta
would free all the country's political prisoners, including Abiola.
	   ``The family is hopeful about his early return,'' one of his
wives, Doyin, told Lagos Radio on Saturday.
	   Others aren't so sure. Nigeria's opposition has been up in arms
since Annan announced the planned releases _ and also announced
that Abiola had relinquished his claim to the presidency.
	   Annan has been the focus of many of the attacks, with opposition
leaders accusing him of putting pressure on Abiola to give up his
claims.
	   ``Why is the international community putting pressure on
Abiola,'' demanded Shina Loreminkan, a spokesman for the Joint
Action Committee on Nigeria.
	   ``There is no way Abiola can renounce his mandate,'' another of
Abiola's wives, Dupe, told the Lagos-based Guardian newspaper for
its Saturday edition. ``He has been held for four years because he
will not renounce the mandate. Why should anyone now expect him to
suddenly change his mind.''
	   Such reactions have angered some junta officials. One, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said Abiola may be held longer than
expected, perhaps even months more, until their anger settles down.
	   Just what Abiola really wants remains unclear, including whether
he agreed to renounce the mandate under duress or even if he wants
to remain in politics.
	   His personal physician, Ore Falomo, told the Guardian that a
group of leading Nigerians are gathering together to denounce
claims that Abiola had renounced the mandate.
	   ``Let them free him,'' Falomo said, ``so that he can truly
negotiate without all the pressure and the intimidation of
detention.''
	   Abubakar has moved forcefully to bring change to Nigeria, which
floundered under Abacha.
	   Brutal authoritarianism and rampant corruption left the country
an economic cripple and a diplomatic pariah, particularly after
Abacha executed playwright and pro-democracy activist Ken Saro-Wiwa
in November 1995.
	   But since his sudden rise to power last month, Abubakar has
already freed dozens of political prisoners, met with a number of
prominent diplomats and, most importantly, pledged to free
Nigeria's best-known prisoner, Abiola.

Puerto Rico and federal personnel to help fight Florida fires

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A brigade of 50 local and federal
officials trained in fighting forest fires is being sent to Florida
to join the battle against wild fires that have burned hundreds of
thousands of acres.
	   The Hot Caribe brigade, as it is known, is expected to remain in
Florida for 21 days and additional personnel could be sent if
needed, according to a statement from the U.S. Forest Service
office in Puerto Rico on Saturday.
	   The Puerto Rico personnel, from the island's Fire Department and
Department of Natural Resources, along with officers with the
Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and other agencies,
will join firefighters from around the United States who are trying
to control the blazes in parched northeastern Florida.

Aftershocks terrify Turks, injure over 1,000
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: AMs. RECASTS with a second aftershock, HIGHER injury toll,
details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ADANA, Turkey (AP) _ A week after a deadly earthquake hit
southern Turkey, two strong aftershocks rocked the same area
Saturday, leaving more than 1,000 people injured, most of them from
jumping out of windows or from balconies in panic.
	   Most of the injured suffered fractures and cuts, said Adana's
Deputy Gov. Bulent Egriboz.
	   Metin Demirtas, another deputy governor, put the number of
injured at 1,039.
	   The bigger of the jolts was a 5.1 magnitude temblor which struck
at 5:15 a.m. (0215 GMT), as many people still slept in this city of
1 million inhabitants.
	   There were no fatalities and only one building collapsed,
without hurting anyone. The building was weakened by the
6.3-magnitude quake on June 27 which killed 144 people in the
region.
	   Istanbul's Kandilli observatory said Saturday's temblor at dawn
was the strongest of more than 70 aftershocks that have followed
the June 27 quake.
	   Wary of more aftershocks, authorities evacuated several
buildings, including a prison, in Adana, the semi-official Anatolia
agency said.
	   Many residents in Adana, 490 kilometers (300 miles) south of
Ankara, have been sleeping outdoors since last Saturday's quake,
afraid to move back into their damaged homes.
	   ``We will sleep outside tonight as well,'' Demirtas said.
	   More than 1,000 buildings collapsed in Adana and nearby town of
Ceyhan in the June 27 quake. Another 5,200 buildings sustained
severe damage.
	   Turkey's Aegean and Mediterranean coastal areas, as well as its
entire eastern region, sit atop the Anatolian fault and are subject
to frequent earthquakes.

Novotna wins her first Wimbledon title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with quotes; edits to trim &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ The Duchess of Kent was right. The
third time was the right time for Jana Novotna.
	   Novotna, the losing finalist in 1993 and 1997, won her first
Wimbledon title Saturday with a 6-4, 7-6 (7-2) victory over
Nathalie Tauziat.
	   ``Winning Wimbledon means everything really,'' Novotna said.
``It's what I've been working for for many, many years. It's a
dream come true.''
	   After Novotna hit a forehand passing shot to end the match, she
dropped to her knees, held her arms in the air and covered her face
with both hands as she wept with joy.
	   After embracing Tauziat at the net, she ran up into the players'
box in the Centre Court stands, where she hugged her coach, Hana
Mandlikova, and her mother, Lina.
	   Five years ago, Novotna sobbed on the duchess' shoulder after
blowing a 4-1 third-set lead in the final against Steffi Graf. Last
year, after losing in three sets to Martina Hingis, the duchess
encouraged her with the words ``third-time lucky.''
	   There were no tears Saturday when Novotna accepted the winner's
plate from the duchess. The two held each other's outstretched
hands and spoke animatedly for almost a minute.
	   ``She said, `I told you last year if you make it to the final
for the third time, it will be third-time lucky and you will make
it,''' Novotna said. ``She told me she was happy for me to finally
win this championship. ... I told her she was absolutely right
whatever she told me last year.''
	   When she first took the trophy, Novotna let out a big sigh of
relief.
	   ``I don't believe it,'' she said as she held the trophy over her
head, then pressed it to her cheek like a pillow and kissed it
gently.
	   Novotna circled the court and mouthed ``thank you'' as the
15,000 fans gave her a rousing standing ovation that lasted for
several minutes.
	   Novotna was reluctant to part with the trophy.
	   ```They told me I have to give it back,'' she said. ``So I gave
it up but I'm running after it.''
	   While the players walked off, the duchess waved to Novotna, who
responded by giving the thumbs-up sign. After being presented with
a bouquet of flowers, Novotna handed them to a woman in the front
row of the stands.
	   The victory marked the long-awaited breakthrough for Novotna,
long considered the best women's player without a Grand Slam title.
She finally accomplished it at the age of 29, playing in her 13th
Wimbledon and 45th Grand Slam event.
	   ``I stayed aggressive,'' Novotna said. ``I stayed positive. I
really wanted to win and I think I wanted to win just a little more
than Nathalie.''
	   Novotna said she was so overwhelmed that she couldn't even
remember the final point.
	   ``I had to ask (referee) Alan Mills what did I do on that match
point?'' she said. ``You are in a zone. I was just so pleased.''
	   Novotna dedicated the victory to Mandlikova, her coach of nine
years. A fellow Czech, Mandlikova won four Grand Slam titles during
the 1980s but never won Wimbledon.
	   ``She made me a better player,'' Novotna said. ``She always
believed in myself.''
	   Playing classic grass-court tennis, Novotna controlled
Saturday's match from the net. Always on the attack, she served and
volleyed, chipped and charged and soared to put away high backhand
volleys.
	   ``Today's match didn't bring the best out of us,'' she said.
``We both felt quite a lot of prressure. We wanted to win really so
much. Thank God, I was a little more aggressive and I was good at
the net.''
	   For awhile, though, it seemed as though Novotna might repeat her
1993 collapse. She led 3-1 and 5-3 in the second set and served for
the match at 5-4.
	   But Novotna played tentatively and was broken for 5-5. After
Tauziat held in the next game for 6-5, a third set seemed to be
looming.
	   Novotna said she relaxed too much when trying to serve out the
match.
	   ``The whole match from the beginning to the end I was struggling
with my serve,'' she said. ``I wasn't putting any first serves in,
and Nathalie was all over me. I felt so much pressure on my second
serve.''
	   But Novotna held for 6-6 and completely dominated the
tiebreaker, winning five straight points from 2-2 to close out the
match.
	   Tauziat seemed to know it was over when she made a forehand
error on the sixth point of the tiebreaker. She fell to the ground
and dropped her racket in disgust.
	   With their combined age of 59, Novotna and the 30-year-old
Tauziat were the oldest women's finalists at Wimbledon since 1977
when Virginia Wade and Betty Stove totaled 63 years.
	   Tauziat, the first French women's finalist since Suzanne Lenglen
in 1925, was the lowest seeded player (16) in a women's final.
	   Like Novotna, Tauziat played a natural grass-court game but she
lacked the speed and athleticism of her opponent. She also was hurt
by her poor first-serve percentage as Novotna punished her
repeatedly on the second serve.
	   ``I have nothing to regret,'' Tauziat said. ``It was one of the
best days of my life so far and I hope I'm going to do another one
next year like I played this year. I'm very happy with what I've
done.''
	   Pete Sampras, seeking his fifth title in six years, faces Goran
Ivanisevic in the men's final Sunday.
	   It will be a rematch of the 1994 final, which Sampras won in
straight sets. Sampras will be favored to win his fifth title in
six years, which would tie him with Bjorn Borg for the most
Wimbledon victories in the Open era.

South Korean diplomat detained on spy charges in Moscow
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in graf 4 with Russian accused of spying for South
Korea. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian authorities ordered a South Korean
diplomat expelled Saturday after he was detained overnight on
suspicion of spying.
	   The diplomat, identified as Cho Sung-woo, was taken into custody
as he met with an alleged Russian contact, according to a statement
from the Federal Security Service, a successor to the Soviet-era
KGB.
	   The contact, an employee of Russia's Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, was also detained and is under investigation, the
statement said.
	   The Russian is accused of ``providing confidential information
to South Korean security services that was damaging to Russia's
political and economic interests,'' the statement said.
	   Cho, an advisor to the South Korean ambassador, has diplomatic
immunity and was released after questioning, the statement said.
	   Later in the day the Foreign Ministry filed a formal complaint
with the South Korean ambassador, ordering Cho to leave Russia
within three days for ``illegal activities incompatible with his
diplomatic status.''
	   An employee of the South Korean Embassy who gave his name as Lee
said the Embassy had no immediate comment. In Seoul, calls to the
South Korean Foreign Ministry and intelligence service went
unanswered late Saturday.
	   Russia's Federal Security Service, or FSB, is responsible for
counterintelligence. It is one of several successor agencies to the
Soviet-era KGB.

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Writer and film director Henrik
Stangerup, one of the few Danish authors to succeed internationally
in the 1970s and 1980s, has died, Danish national radio said
Saturday. He was 60.
	   Stangerup wrote more than 20 books that were translated into a
dozen languages. His European breakthrough came in 1973 with the
novel ``The Man who Wanted to Be Guilty,'' published in the United
States in 1983.
	   The author of ``It is Hard to Die in Dieppe'' made several trips
to Brazil where he found inspiration for his bestseller ``The Road
to Lagoa Santa.''
	   Stangerup also worked as journalist in Paris for Danish and
French media, and considered France as a second home. He directed
three Danish movies and did a documentary for French state
television in 1970.
	   In 1986, Stangerup was awarded the prestigious French order
Knight of the Arts and Letters. He is survived by his second wife,
Susanne Krage, and a son from his first marriage.
	   The cause of his death was not known, nor were details for
funeral arrangements.

	   ROME (AP) _ A week-long heat wave eased in the capital Saturday,
but fires whipped by dry, hot winds continued to burn in the south,
forcing the evacuation of patients from a Sicilian hospital and
bathers from a Sardinian beach.
	   A blaze in the woods outside Catania, in eastern Sicily, filled
a hospital with smoke. Two helicopters lifted to safety a score of
patients, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.
	   Ten vacationers on a beach near Villasimius in southern Sardinia
were evacuated on rubber dinghies after flames approached the
resort area.

India to ban lottery, traders threaten to go to court
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NEELESH MISRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India will ban lotteries which lure
millions of poor people to blow up their paltry earnings every day,
the government said Saturday, but lottery traders threatened to
challenge the move in court.
	   Interior Minister Lal Krishna Advani announced in parliament
that the federal government will outlaw all forms of lottery in
consultation with the provincial governments, which run many
lotteries. He gave no timeframe.
	   Lottery trade officials say there are 2.5 million Indians
engaged in the business who sell tickets worth rupees 500 billion
(dlrs 12 billion) annually, earning revenues of over rupees 12
billion (dlrs 285 million) each year. Independent confirmation was
not available.
	   The country's largest body of lottery traders said the
government had no right to impose a ban, and threatened that tens
of thousands of traders would hold demonstrations and petition the
courts if the prohibition came through.
	   ``Our trade does not go against the law. It is mentioned even in
the constitution,'' said Pradeep Kapur, publicity secretary of the
All India Lottery Traders Association.
	   Lottery is seen in India as a social evil equated with the
addictions of gambling or drinking cheap, locally brewed liquor
which have gripped millions of people _ mostly from the underclass.
But the lottery trade is legal.
	   With an annual per capita income of dlrs 450, India is one of
the world's poorest countries, and nearly half of its 980 million
population is illiterate. Millions from among these people
faithfully buy lottery tickets every day with hopes of a life
beyond their daily squalor.
	   ``Lottery is not about gambling. It is about hopes. It is about
dreams,'' Kapur told The Associated Press.
	   ``The government cannot ban the trade without giving alternate
employment to all the people involved in it,'' he said. ``The
government is behaving like a dictator, and we will drag it to
court.''
	   The government seems ready for that.
	   Advani said in parliament that the government was readying a
comprehensive legislation which would not have loopholes likely to
result in a court setback. The Lok Sabha or lower house of
parliament on Saturday also passed a bill banning the hugely
popular single-digit lottery.
	   Given the huge spread of the lottery business in India, traders
say a ban on their trade will cut into related industries _ like
paper and publishing _ as well.
	   ``Even communist China has lottery. Why not India?'' Kapur
asked.

Algerian government imposes Arabic as official language
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Fixed typo in 3rd graf, RECASTS lede to raise reference to
independence. &QL; 
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Despite widespread opposition, Algeria's
government was preparing to celebrate the country's independence by
banning the official use of all languages except Arabic.
	   Starting Sunday, the 36th anniversary of Algeria's independence
from France, Arabic will become the only official language in this
multi-cultural North African country.
	   Over the past 10 days, the law has provoked protests among the
country's Berbers, who represent a third of Algeria's population
and speak their own language, Berber, also known as Tamazight.
	   The law also would prohibit from official use other languages
including French, which is still widely used in this former French
colony, especially in urban areas and among educated people.
	   Many Algerians consider the Arabic-only law as an attempt by the
military-backed government to court favor with supporters of
Islamic movements.
	   Since 1992, the Algerian authorities have been fighting an
Islamic insurgency that broke out after the government canceled
parliamentary elections Muslim parties were set to win.
	   Neither the government nor the insurgents, however, has been
able to gain the upper hand in the conflict that has left an
estimated 75,000 people dead.
	   The most impassioned protests against the new law have been in
the city of Tizi-Ouzou, a largely Berber town about 90 kilometers
(60 miles) east of the capital Algiers.
	   In Tizi-Ouzou and Bejaia, nearby port city, Arabic-language
signs have been destroyed. Demonstrators in recent days have
shouted, ``We are not Arabs.''
	   The region has been shaken by unrest since late June when Muslim
militants assassinated Lounes Matoub, a popular Berber singer who
had just returned from France where he had lived in exile.
	   Much of the protesters' anger has been directed against
President Liamine Zeroual, who on Wednesday expressed his
determination to make sure the law was applied.
	   The Berbers, an ancient group of tribes, have long fought to
preserve their language and several language revolts since
independence have been repressed.
	   Nevertheless, since independence, the Algerian government has
moved to impose Arabic as the sole official language. In 1968,
knowledge of Arabic became mandatory for government officials.
	   Legal proceedings in Algeria are conducted in Arabic, and it is
the main language in schools. However, for millions of people,
Berber and French remain important languages.

World Cup: Late Bergkamp goal sends Dutch to semifinals with 3-2
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
victory &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Dennis Bergkamp scored with 32 seconds
remaining in regulation to give the Netherlands and a 2-1 victory
over Argentina on Saturday and send the Dutch back to the World Cup
semifinals for the first time since 1978.
	   Bergkamp scored only two minutes after Ariel Ortega was ejected
for a headbutt on Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar, an expulsion
which evened the sides at 10 men apiece.
	   Bergkamp settled a ball from Frank de Boer with his right foot,
touched it inside defender Roberto Ayala and beat Argentine keeper
Carlos Roa with a blast from seven meters.

German Social Democrats far ahead in eastern German states
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Less than three months before parliamentary
elections in Germany, the leftist Social Democrats lead by a wide
margin in the country's eastern states, a poll published Saturday
showed.
	   The poll of 1,200 voting-age people by the Leipzig Institute for
Market Research, said that the Social Democrats were picked by 50
percent of those asked, against 22 percent for Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's conservative Christian Democrats.
	   The former communists, the Party of Democratic Socialism, was
chosen by 17 percent, while the environmental Bundnis 90/Greens
party were picked by 5 percent of those asked, the poll published
by the Berlin-based magazine Super Illu said.
	   The business-oriented Free Democrats were only picked by 2
percent of those asked, a percentage point less than the radical
rightist German People's Union, the report said.
	   In April, the radical rightist party won nearly 13 percent of
the vote in Saxony Anhalt elections to gain 16 seats in that state
parliament.
	   In a head-on comparison of Kohl with his top challenger, Gerhard
Schroeder of the Social Democrats, Schroeder was chosen by 54
percent of eastern Germans asked compared to only 17 percent for
Kohl, the report said.
	   A survey for all of Germany by the Munich-based Polis Institute
published June 28, said the Social Democrats would get 43 percent,
and that Kohl's Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party
Christian Social Union would get 36 percent of the vote if the
election had been held then.
	   No margin of error was given for the eastern German poll, but a
survey of that size normally has a margin of error of plus or minus
3 percent.

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Dennis Bergkamp scored with 32 seconds
remaining in regulation to give the Netherlands a 2-1 victory over
Argentina on Saturday and send the Dutch back to the World Cup
semifinals for the first time since 1978.
	   Bergkamp scored only two minutes after Ariel Ortega was ejected
for a headbutt on Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar, an expulsion
which evened the sides at 10 men apiece.
	   Bergkamp settled a ball from Frank de Boer with his right foot,
touched it inside defender Roberto Ayala and beat Argentine keeper
Carlos Roa with a blast from seven meters.

	   Argetina played 12 of the final minutes late in the second half
with a man advantage after Dutch defender Arthur Numan was ejected
for his second yellow card. Numan was cautioned in the 17th minute
for a foul on Ariel Ortega and then picked up his second in the
76th for another foul on Diego Simeone.
	   But with only 2 1-2 minutes to go, Ortega evened the strength.
	   Ortega fell in the penalty area after a collision with Dutch
defender Jaap Stam. Mexican referee Arturo Brizio chose not to call
a penalty and Van der Sar confronted Ortega, who was arguing for a
call.
	   The Argentine midfielder then headbutted the goalkeeper, drawing
a red from Brizio.
	   The Dutch return to the semifinals for the first time since
losing the championship match in 1978 to the Argentines.
	   They will play Brazil on Tuesday in Marseille. The two-time
champion Argentines were hoping to return to the final four for the
first time since 1990, when it was beaten in the final by Germany.
	   Until Numan's ejection, the Dutch controlled much of the second
half, swarming around the Argentine net and missing its best chance
when Patrick Kluivert directed a header from eight meters that
Argentine keeper Carlos Roa finger-tipped over the bar in the 65th
minute.
	   A minute earlier, against the run of play, Gabriel Batistuta
blasted a shot from the top of the penalty area off the left post.
	   Kluivert, playing in his first game since being ejected and from
the Dutch's group opener against Belgium, gave the Netherlands the
lead in the 12th minute, finishing a three-man combination.
	   Ronald de Boer sent in a long ball from midfield to the top left
corner of the penalty area where Bergkamp sent a falling header
into the path of Kluivert. The 22-year-old AC Milan striker then
simply knocked the ball over approaching Argnetine keeper Carlos
Roa from 11 meters.
	   The goal came seven minutes after the Netherlands shook
Argentina with Wim Jonk's 15-meter blast off the right post.
	   But Argentina composed itself and tied the game midway through
the half when Claudio Lopez capitalized on a gambling Dutch
defense. Juan Veron sent a ball out of midfield down the middle of
the field and marking back Michael Reiziger stepped forward and
raised his hand to catch Lopez off side.
	   But Lopez remained clearly onside, walked in on Van der Sar
unmolested and paused before adding the indignity of scoring
through the Dutch keeper's legs.
	   Both sides exchanged offensive forays. Jonk had a blast from 25
meters that Roa had to parry away in the 35th minute and Ariel
Ortega had a rocket from 30 meters that rang off the left post
three minutes later.
	   With Marc Overmars hobbled due to a pulled hamstring suffered in
training Thursday, the Dutch were forced to adjust their starting
lineup. Phillip Cocu moved back into the midfield for Overmars and
Jonk replaced Clarence Seedorf, two changes that indicated a more
defensive strategy.
	   Kluivert's return followed a two-match suspension for elbowing
Lorenzo Staelens in the Netherlands' opening group game against
Belgium.

Protests and pleas for statehood mark Fourth in divided Puerto
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Divided by the question of its
political future and a simmering labor dispute, Puerto Rico marked
July Fourth with protests and a plea by the governor for statehood
for the U.S. commonwealth.
	   Exactly three weeks before the 100th anniversary of the date
that U.S. troops first landed on Puerto Rico and changed the course
of the island's history, Gov. Pedro Rossello said Saturday it was
time for the United States to make the island a full partner in the
country by granting statehood.
	   While the United States celebrated its independence, ``there
still remains a territory, a colony of the nation, that has not had
a real opportunity to exercise self-determination and has not
reached full self-government,'' said Rossello.
	   The official ceremony at which the governor spoke was closed to
the general public and surrounded by extra security. Tensions were
higher than usual as employees of the Puerto Rico Telephone Company
began their 16th day on strike Saturday to protest Rossello's plans
to sell a controlling interest in the government-owned company.
	   Dozens of unions have planned a 48-hour general island-wide
strike on Tuesday to protest the government's privatization policy.
	   The U.S. Congress is considering a bill that would authorize a
vote this year on the political future of Puerto Rico, either
statehood, continued commonwealth status or independence. Polls
show the public is split between the first two options, with
neither holding majority support.
	   Puerto Rico Justice Secretary Jose Fuentes Agostini read a
letter from President Clinton supporting the bill in Congress.
	   ``That is why I am working with you and others to enable the
people of Puerto Rico to choose their future political status,''
the president wrote.
	   While Rossello was calling for statehood, protesters gathered in
front of U.S. military bases to call for independence and to
criticize the U.S. military's control of two-thirds of the small
offshore island of Vieques.
	   Two groups organized a protest by taking their boats into
restricted areas between Vieques and the sprawling Roosevelt Roads
Naval Base on the main island of Puerto Rico.
	   Meanwhile, a few hundred protesters carried signs and a huge
Puerto Rican flag in front of the main gate at the Fort Buchanan
base in the San Juan suburb of Guaynabo, within sight of the
telephone company headquarters where picketers and police have
clashed during the strike.
	   Issues mixed together as some protesters at Fort Buchanan
carried signs protesting the telephone company sale, along with
placards calling for the U.S. military to leave the island.

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Dennis Bergkamp scored with 32 seconds
remaining in regulation to give the Netherlands a 2-1 victory over

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ On a seemingly impossible mission,
U.S. mediator Richard Holbrooke sought common ground on Saturday
between the president of Yugoslavia and ethnic Albanian leaders on
ending Kosovo's violence.
	   As Holbrooke shuttled between Belgrade and Pristina, a guerrilla
spokesman dented U.S. hopes of getting Kosovo's Albanian fighters
and politicians to speak with one voice in their struggle for
independence.
	   The German news magazine Spiegel quoted a Kosovo Liberation Army
spokesman Jakub Krasniqi as saying the KLA would never take orders
from the main political leader, Ibrahim Rugova, because his
peaceful secession efforts had failed.
	   Ethnic Albanian separatists want independence for Kosovo, a
province in southern Serbia where they outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
Serbia is the larger of the two republics remaining in Yugoslavia.
Hundreds of people have died in Kosovo since Serb forces stepped up
efforts to crush militant resistance in February. Serbs consider
Kosovo the cradle of their culture.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic says the crackdown is
aimed at ethnic Albanian terrorists who have targeted Serb police
in their fight for independence.
	   Holbrooke held talks with Rugova and his more radical rival,
Adem Demaci, in the provincial capital, Pristina. The United States
has urged the KLA to recognize Rugova as the head of a joint
delegation if negotiations can be started.
	   Holbrooke said he was focusing on ways to help the ethnic
Albanian leaders organize themselves. He shuttled between two
different venues just 300 meters (yards) apart to meet separately
with the Rugova and Demaci camps.
	   Earlier, Holbrooke described Rugova as ``the main leader'' of
the province's ethnic Albanian majority, but Demaci also has
considerable popular support.
	   Among the issues to be addressed was the role of the KLA, which
the Serbs consider a terrorist organization but which has been
gaining support in Kosovo at the expense of Rugova, who opposes
violence.
	   Asked Saturday if the KLA should be included in talks, Holbrooke
said Washington wanted ``everybody who has a legitimate role in the
destiny of Kosovo'' to have a place in the negotiations. ``But how
that works out remains to be seen,'' he said.
	   Holbrooke also met in Pristina with members of the Albanian
Democratic Movement, which split away from Rugova with ambitions of
becoming the KLA's political wing. No details were available.
	   Departing for Belgrade afterward, Holbrooke said the various
Albanian factions agreed on some points but ``a wide range of
opinions'' continued to exist on other issues. He did not
elaborate. Members of his party said Holbrooke would return to
Pristina early Sunday.
	   Beside meeting Milosevic, Holbrooke also could talk with Russian
Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky, also in Belgrade,
capital of both Serbia and Yugoslavia. A three-way meeting also was
possible.
	   In Belgrade, several dozen people people, mostly parents of
draftees doing military service in Kosovo, gathered to demand a
peaceful resolution of the Kosovo crisis and redeployment of their
sons to less violent parts of Yugoslavia.
	   Kosovo remained relatively peaceful Saturday, a day after Serb
forces broke the ethnic Albanian siege of Kijevo.
	   Sitting astride the main east-west road in Kosovo, Kijevo has
been a flash-point since the KLA surrounded it in mid-June and cut
off its Serb inhabitants. Serb police then surrounded the KLA
fighters.
	   Both sides reported a clash in the southwest Saturday. Serb
sources said police pushed back Albanian militants who attacked
Serb villagers at Movljane, a village some 50 kilometers (30 miles)
south of Pristina. An Albanian report said police and armed Serb
villagers attacked Gornja Krusica, an Albanian village in the same
region, killing one person.
	   Ahead of Holbrooke's visit to the region, Milosevic denied any
government repression in Kosovo and offered to restore the autonomy
he yanked from the province in 1989 on grounds of protecting its
Serb minority.
	   Holbrooke is pressing for a cease-fire before trying to get
Milosevic to withdraw his forces. But he and other Western
officials are insistent that Kosovo should not be allowed
independence.
	   That may not satisfy even the moderate ethnic Albanian leaders
on whom Washington had pinned hopes for a negotiated settlement.

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Dennis Bergkamp scored with 32 seconds
remaining in regulation to give the Netherlands a 2-1 victory over
Argentina on Saturday and send the Dutch back to the World Cup
semifinals for the first time since 1978.
	   Bergkamp scored only two minutes after Argentine midfielder
Ariel Ortega was ejected for a headbutt on Dutch goalkeeper Edwin
van der Sar, an expulsion which evened the sides at 10 men apiece.
	   Bergkamp settled a ball from Frank de Boer with his right foot,
touched it inside defender Roberto Ayala and beat Argentine keeper
Carlos Roa with a blast from seven meters.
	   ``It was thanks to the pass from Frank,'' Bergkamp said. ``He
saw it fantastically.''
	   Argentina played 12 of the final minutes late in the second half
with a man advantage after Dutch defender Arthur Numan was ejected
for his second yellow card. Numan was cautioned in the 17th minute
for a foul on Ortega and then picked up his second in the 76th for
another foul on Diego Simeone.
	   But with only 2 1-2 minutes to go, Ortega evened the strength.
	   Ortega fell in the penalty area after a collision with Dutch
defender Jaap Stam. Mexican referee Arturo Brizio chose not to call
a penalty and Van der Sar confronted Ortega, who was arguing for a
call.
	   The Argentine midfielder then headbutted the goalkeeper, drawing
a red from Brizio.
	   ``It was a match that had everything,'' Bergkamp said. ``Just at
the right moment we got a lift because of Ortega's red card. Now
it's Brazil. Let them come.''
	   The Dutch return to the semifinals for the first time since
losing the championship match in 1978 to the Argentines.
	   They will play Brazil on Tuesday in Marseille. The two-time
champion Argentines were hoping to return to the final four for the
first time since 1990, when they were beaten in the final by
Germany.
	   Until Numan's ejection, the Dutch controlled much of the second
half, swarming around the Argentine net and missing its best chance
when Patrick Kluivert directed a header from eight meters that Roa
finger-tipped over the bar in the 65th minute.
	   A minute earlier, against the run of play, Gabriel Batistuta
blasted a shot from the top of the penalty area off the left post.
	   Kluivert, playing in his first game since being ejected and from
the Dutch's group opener against Belgium, gave the Netherlands the
lead in the 12th minute, finishing a three-man combination.
	   Ronald de Boer sent in a long ball from midfield to the top left
corner of the penalty area where Bergkamp sent a falling header
into the path of Kluivert. The 22-year-old AC Milan striker then
simply knocked the ball over an approaching Roa from 11 meters.
	   The goal came seven minutes after the Netherlands shook
Argentina with Wim Jonk's 15-meter blast off the right post.
	   But Argentina composed itself and tied the game midway through
the half when Claudio Lopez capitalized on a gambling Dutch
defense. Juan Veron sent a ball out of midfield down the middle of
the field and marking back Michael Reiziger stepped forward and
raised his hand to catch Lopez offside.
	   But Lopez remained clearly onside, walked in on Van der Sar
unmolested and paused before adding the indignity of scoring
through the Dutch keeper's legs.
	   Both sides exchanged offensive forays early in the first half.
Jonk had a blast from 25 meters that Roa had to parry away in the
35th minute and Ortega had a rocket from 30 meters that rang off
the left post three minutes later.
	   With Marc Overmars hobbled due to a pulled hamstring suffered in
training Thursday, the Dutch were forced to adjust their starting
lineup. Phillip Cocu moved back into the midfield for Overmars and
Jonk replaced Clarence Seedorf, two changes that indicated a more
defensive strategy.
	   Kluivert's return followed a two-match suspension for elbowing
Lorenzo Staelens in the Netherlands' opening group game against
Belgium.

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ The Duchess of Kent was right. The
third time was the right time for Jana Novotna.
	   Novotna, the losing finalist in 1993 and 1997, won her first
Wimbledon title Saturday with a 6-4, 7-6 (7-2) victory over
Nathalie Tauziat.
	   ``Winning Wimbledon means everything really,'' Novotna said.
``It's what I've been working for for many, many years. It's a
dream come true.''
	   After Novotna hit a forehand passing shot to end the match, she
dropped to her knees, held her arms in the air and covered her face
with both hands as she wept with joy.
	   After embracing Tauziat at the net, she ran up into the players'
box in the Centre Court stands, where she hugged her coach, Hana
Mandlikova, and her mother, Lina.
	   Five years ago, Novotna sobbed on the duchess' shoulder after
blowing a 4-1 third-set lead in the final against Steffi Graf. Last
year, after losing in three sets to Martina Hingis, the duchess
encouraged her with the words ``third-time lucky.''
	   There were no tears Saturday when Novotna accepted the winner's
plate from the duchess. The two held each other's outstretched
hands and spoke animatedly for almost a minute.
	   ``She said, `I told you last year if you make it to the final
for the third time, it will be third-time lucky and you will make
it,''' Novotna said. ``She told me she was happy for me to finally
win this championship. ... I told her she was absolutely right
whatever she told me last year.''
	   When she first took the trophy, Novotna let out a big sigh of
relief.
	   ``I don't believe it,'' she said as she held the trophy over her
head, then pressed it to her cheek like a pillow and kissed it
gently.
	   Novotna circled the court and mouthed ``thank you'' as the
15,000 fans gave her a rousing standing ovation that lasted for
several minutes.
	   Novotna was reluctant to part with the trophy.
	   ```They told me I have to give it back,'' she said. ``So I gave
it up but I'm running after it.''
	   While the players walked off, the duchess waved to Novotna, who
responded by giving the thumbs-up sign. After being presented with
a bouquet of flowers, Novotna handed them to a woman in the front
row of the stands.
	   Mandlikova received a winner's check of dlrs 620,000, while
Tauziat collected dlrs 310,000.

Mexican state elections important to parties' presidential hopes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN RICE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHIHUAHUA, Mexico (AP) _ History was made in Chihuahua in 1992
when an opposition party defeated Mexico's long-ruling and
seemingly omnipotent Institutional Revolutionary Party.
	   Now this northern Mexican state may be the harbinger of yet
another major change in Mexican politics _ this time inside the
ruling party itself, known by its Spanish initials as the PRI.
	   A PRI candidate chosen in an unprecedented open primary has a
strong chance Sunday to regain the governorship for the party,
renowned for the hermetic process of selecting its nominees.
	   ``It is an election that is important not only for Chihuahua,
but for the country,'' said Guillermo Lujan Pena of the opposition
National Action Party.
	   Chihuahua, a sun-scorched sprawl of desert and mountains south
of the Texas border, is one of three northern states whose
elections Sunday could affect the race for Mexico's president in
the year 2000.
	   The PRI has held power in Mexico since 1929, but until 15 years
ago, ``elections were really a formality,'' said Chihuahua PRI
leader Jorge Esteban Sandoval.
	   The party's grip has never been shakier. Chihuahua was the
second of six state governorships won by National Action, a
center-right party, over the past decade. Last year, the PRI lost
its majority in the lower house of Congress and was thrashed in the
Mexico City mayor's race.
	   Yet most polls show it holds a narrow lead in this state _ one
that has been a longtime base of Mexico's No. 2 party, National
Action.
	   It would be the first time the PRI had recaptured a lost
governorship, and its only chance to do so before the 2000
presidential elections.
	   In a dramatic break from the traditional practice of having
party leaders impose candidates, the PRI tried a different tactic
here. In March, it held a primary election open to all voters.
	   More than 233,000 people _ roughly 13 percent of the electorate
_ took part, choosing former Chihuahua Mayor Patricio Martinez over
a man favored by local party brokers.
	   Even National Action leaders admit the primary gave a boost to
the PRI.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo has even endorsed such a primary as a
way to choose his successor. Zedillo has promised an end to the
traditional practice of the ``dedazo,'' or ``big touch,'' by which
outgoing presidents select the PRI's candidate.
	   In the northern state of Zacatecas, that selection process has
backfired on the PRI, putting a sure victory Sunday at risk.
	   Angered at being shunned for the PRI's nomination, popular
Congressman Ricardo Monreal bolted from the PRI to run for the
leftist Democratic Revolution Party, taking many supporters with
him.
	   Though the leftist party had been a minor force in Zacatecas, as
throughout northern Mexico, polls show Monreal in a dead heat with
the PRI for what would be its first state-level victory outside of
Mexico City.
	   The PRI held a sizable lead in polls in Durango, though National
Action appeared to be gaining, The leftist Labor Party, weak
elsewhere in Mexico, was also running strongly in Durango.
	   National Action leader Lujan says the election in Chihuahua is a
test of six years of his party's leadership, a ratification ``that
the party governs well, that the party is effective, that the party
is honest.''
	   Most say National Action has cut down on corruption. But soaring
crime in the state's largest city, Ciudad Juarez, and PRI
allegations of wrongdoing by National Action members have tarnished
the party.
	   Lujan said some voters ``expected too much'' from a change after
63 years of single-party government.
	   ``There was an expectation ... that all of their problems would
be solved instantly,'' he said.

Estonians take double victory in international wife carrying

contest &QL;

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland _ In a radical shift from tradition, two
Estonian men carried their partners upside down to take first and
second place in the Wife Carrying World Championships on Saturday.
	   The winning couple, Imre Ambos, 22, and Annela Ojaste, beat a
field of 37 couples from eight countries, finishing the grueling
253-meter (278-yard) course in one minute 9.2 seconds.
	   ``The mood was different this year, and the innovative way to
carry partners seemed to work,'' said Hannu Keranen, one of the
organizers. ``We had some really fit, young sportsmen, and the
women were as light as grasshoppers.''
	   The wife carrying race has been organized four times at national
level in Sonkajarvi, 550 kilometers (340 miles) north of Helsinki,
before popular demand in 1996 turned them into an international
annual event.
	   Most of the couples were Finnish, but competitors came from from
Germany, Norway, Sweden, Russia and Switzerland.
	   The contest dates back 200 years when a local, legendary hero,
Ronkainen the Robber, tested aspiring members to his gang by making
them carry huge sacks on their backs over an obstacle course.
	   Reacting to suggestions that wife carrying was demeaning to
women, the region's governor Pirjo Ala-Kapee said she approved of
the contest.
	   ``If anything, it's uplifting,'' said Ala-Kapee, speaking to the
competitors and spectators. ``It's also authentic and exotic.''
	   More than 7,000 people watched as the couples braved the course
in a rough forest clearing, which included water obstacles and
timber hurdles.
	   The wives, or women, who are carried have to be at least 17
years old, and there is no weight limit, Keranen said.
	   ``They can be one's own wife, borrowed and or even stolen if
necessary,'' he added.
	   Dropping a partner adds 15 seconds to a couple's time at the end
of the race.
	   This year's best time was four seconds slower than the record
set in 1997 by a Finnish couple, who won the contest two years in a
row. This year they were expecting a baby and decided to skip the
event.
	   The winning couple came away with 8,000 markkaa (dlrs 1,500)
worth of prizes that included a TV set and about 45 liters (94
pints) of beer _ the equivalent of the wife's weight.

Late Bergkamp winner puts Netherlands in semifinals against Brazil

	   PARIS (AP) _ Dennis Bergkamp scored the winner with 32 seconds
remaining as the Netherlands downed Argentina 2-1 Saturday to gain
a World Cup semifinal confrontation with defending titlist Brazil.
	   In a dramatic and explosive ending to the game in Marseille, the
Arsenal striker's 90th minute goal came two minutes after
Argentina's talented forward Ariel Ortega had been red-carded for
headbutting Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar.
	   That left the sides 10-on-10 after the Dutch had lost defender
Arthur Numan 12 minutes from the end. He was expelled for a second
yellow card with the score tied at 1-1.
	   Patrick Kluivert, back after a two-game suspension, fired the
Dutch ahead in the 12th minute and Carlos Lopez replied for the
two-time champion six minutes later.
	   Five-goal Gabriel Batitusta, bidding to move to the top of the
scorers' list, hit the post and so did Ortega. Dutch midfielder Wim
Jonk also struck the upright.
	   ``It was a match that had everything,'' Bergkamp said. ``Just at
the right moment we got a lift because of Ortega's red card. Now
it's Brazil. Let them come.''
	   The Netherlands-Brazil semifinal also will be at Marseille on
Tuesday. At the Stade de France a day later, host nation France
will face the winner of the remaining quarterfinal between
three-time champion Germany and World Cup rookie Croatia, who met
at Lyon later Saturday.
	   Brazil survived an early scare before downing upstart Denmark
3-2 in Nantes Friday to make the last four.
	   The Danes, in the quarterfinal for the first time, took the lead
after only two minutes before the defending titlist hit back with
two strikes by Rivaldo and one by Bebeto.
	   Going into the semifinal against the Netherlands, four
Brazilians have their own goal-scoring race going on. Rivaldo,
Bebeto, Ronaldo and Cesar Sampaio all have three goals. Brazil's
only other score was an own goal by Scotland's Tommy Boyd in the
opening game.
	   The France-Italy quarterfinal at the Stade de France was a
predictable 0-0 draw after extra time that had to be decided on a
penalty shootout. The French prevailed 4-3 in the shootout after
Italy's Luigi Di Biagio hit the bar with his spot kick.
	   Emmanuel Petit, the pony-tailed French midfielder who has played
impressively throughout the competition, gained more praise
Saturday. But it was nothing to do with his probing midfield runs
or passes.
	   FIFA said Petit displayed ``a gesture of outstanding
sportsmanship'' when he kicked the ball out of bounds from close to
the Italian goal as Luigi Di Biagio lay on the ground on the middle
of the penalty box during the final minute of overtime.
	   ``I wasn't really conscious about what I was doing,'' Petit said
Saturday. ``I was so tired, I saw two legs of an Italian on the
ground, and I kicked the ball out.
	   ``We need fair play, I've always been like that,'' the Arsenal
midfielder said. ``I don't pull shirts, I don't insult anyone _
unless they are coming after me. Then I reply.''

South Korean diplomat detained on spy charges in Moscow
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 7-8 with confirmation from South Korean
embassy, CHANGES transliteration of name to conform to diplomat's
preference. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian authorities ordered a South Korean
diplomat expelled Saturday after he was detained overnight on
suspicion of spying.
	   The diplomat, Cho Seong-ho, was taken into custody as he met
with an alleged Russian contact, according to a statement from the
Federal Security Service, a successor to the Soviet-era KGB.
	   The contact, an employee of Russia's Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, was also detained and is under investigation, the
statement said.
	   The Russian is accused of ``providing confidential information
to South Korean security services that was damaging to Russia's
political and economic interests,'' the statement said.
	   Cho, a political officer at the embassy, has diplomatic immunity
and was released after questioning.
	   Later in the day the Foreign Ministry filed a formal complaint
with the South Korean ambassador, ordering Cho to leave Russia
within three days for ``unlawful activities incompatible with his
diplomatic status.''
	   A spokesman for the South Korean Embassy, Lee Sok-bae, confirmed
that Cho had been detained and would be departing Russia. He
declined to comment on the nature of the charges against the
diplomat, or whether South Korea would take reciprocal action.
	   In Seoul, calls to the South Korean Foreign Ministry and
intelligence service went unanswered late Saturday.
	   Russia's Federal Security Service, or FSB, is responsible for
counterintelligence. It is one of several successor agencies to the
Soviet-era KGB.

World Cup: Late Bergkamp goal sends Dutch to semifinals with 2-1
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: ADDS Passarella quotes in new grafs 11, 15. &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Dennis Bergkamp scored with 32 seconds
remaining in regulation to give the Netherlands a 2-1 victory over
Argentina on Saturday and send the Dutch back to the World Cup
semifinals for the first time since 1978.
	   Bergkamp scored only two minutes after Argentine midfielder
Ariel Ortega was ejected for a headbutt on Dutch goalkeeper Edwin
van der Sar, an expulsion which evened the sides at 10 men apiece.
	   Bergkamp settled a ball from Frank de Boer with his right foot,
touched it inside defender Roberto Ayala and beat Argentine keeper
Carlos Roa with a blast from seven meters.
	   ``It was thanks to the pass from Frank,'' Bergkamp said. ``He
saw it fantastically.''
	   Argentina played 12 of the final minutes late in the second half
with a man advantage after Dutch defender Arthur Numan was ejected
for his second yellow card. Numan was cautioned in the 17th minute
for a foul on Ortega and then picked up his second in the 76th for
another foul on Diego Simeone.
	   But with only 2 1-2 minutes to go, Ortega evened the strength.
	   Ortega fell in the penalty area after a collision with Dutch
defender Jaap Stam. Mexican referee Arturo Brizio chose not to call
a penalty and Van der Sar confronted Ortega, who was arguing for a
call.
	   The Argentine midfielder then headbutted the goalkeeper, drawing
a red from Brizio.
	   ``It was a match that had everything,'' Bergkamp said. ``Just at
the right moment we got a lift because of Ortega's red card. Now
it's Brazil. Let them come.''
	   The Dutch return to the semifinals for the first time since
losing the championship match in 1978 to the Argentines.
	   ``Holland is a very, very big team,'' Argentine coach Daniel
Passarella said. ``A very important team, and a very good team.''
	   They will play Brazil on Tuesday in Marseille. The two-time
champion Argentines were hoping to return to the final four for the
first time since 1990, when they were beaten in the final by
Germany.
	   Until Numan's ejection, the Dutch controlled much of the second
half, swarming around the Argentine net and missing its best chance
when Patrick Kluivert directed a header from eight meters that Roa
finger-tipped over the bar in the 65th minute.
	   A minute earlier, against the run of play, Gabriel Batistuta
blasted a shot from the top of the penalty area off the left post.
	   ``I must say it was a very, very tough match, especially in the
first half,'' Passarella said. ``Holland is a very tough opponent
and in the second half we were forced to go a little bit back and
play more defensively.''
	   Kluivert, playing in his first game since being ejected and from
the Dutch's group opener against Belgium, gave the Netherlands the
lead in the 12th minute, finishing a three-man combination.
	   Ronald de Boer sent in a long ball from midfield to the top left
corner of the penalty area where Bergkamp sent a falling header
into the path of Kluivert. The 22-year-old AC Milan striker then
simply knocked the ball over an approaching Roa from 11 meters.
	   The goal came seven minutes after the Netherlands shook
Argentina with Wim Jonk's 15-meter blast off the right post.
	   But Argentina composed itself and tied the game midway through a
very evenly played half when Claudio Lopez capitalized on a
gambling Dutch defense. Juan Veron sent a ball out of midfield down
the middle of the field and marking back Michael Reiziger stepped
forward and raised his hand to catch Lopez offside.
	   But Lopez remained clearly onside, walked in on Van der Sar
unmolested and paused before adding the indignity of scoring
through the Dutch keeper's legs.
	   Both sides exchanged offensive forays early in the first half.
Jonk had a blast from 25 meters that Roa had to parry away in the
35th minute and Ortega had a rocket from 30 meters that rang off
the left post three minutes later.
	   With Marc Overmars hobbled due to a pulled hamstring suffered in
training Thursday, the Dutch were forced to adjust their starting
lineup. Phillip Cocu moved back into the midfield for Overmars and
Jonk replaced Clarence Seedorf, two changes that indicated a more
defensive strategy.
	   Kluivert's return followed a two-match suspension for elbowing
Lorenzo Staelens in the Netherlands' opening group game against
Belgium.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Jubilant soccer fans trickled out
of bars and took their celebrations to the streets following the
Netherlands' 2-1 victory over Argentina in Saturday's World Cup
quarterfinal match.
	   Streets that were deserted during the match were immediately
filled with giddy fans celebrating their team's big win.
	   Careening down the streets in their cars, fans honked their
horns and screamed their traditional soccer victory song.
	   Even tram conductors chimed in with their bells.
	   Although some Dutch fans are prone to violence, there were no
immediate reports of trouble, said Amsterdam police spokesman Klaas
Wilting.
	   ``This is incredible,'' said 22-year-old Ralph Manheim, who was
headed to the city's Dam Square where hundreds of fans gathered for
an impromptu celebration. ``I've never had this experience
before.''
	   A few blocks down the road, Ilja Bruggeman, who watched the big
game in her neighborhood bar, came outside to join her friends
dancing in the streets.
	   ``They were so good,'' she said, stopping every few words to
blow on her horn. ``I had some doubts during the game, but I am so
relieved.''
	   Dutchman Micha van der Klis, 29, who bet five guilders (dlrs
2.50) against his own team, sheepishly admitted his mistake.
	   ``Argentina was very good, but the Dutch played their best,'' he
said.
	   The celebrations followed earlier outbursts of joy following the
team's first goal during the first half.
	   A shopkeeper, clad in the national color of orange, dashed out
of her store, clenching her hands in the air and relaying to
passersby of the goal by Patrick Kluivert.
	   Another fan leaned out of his living room window, proclaiming
the good news to whomever would listen.
	   During the match, Amsterdam's central shopping street,
Kalverstraat, usually packed with Saturday shoppers, was abandoned
to mostly camera-toting and map-reading tourists.
	   But just a few meters (yards) away on the Spui street, hundreds
of soccer fans screamed and sighed in the half-dozen bars (jc/bk)

Novotna thanks coach Mandlikova; Mandlikova chides teen stars
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Hana, thanks.
	   That sums up what 29-year-old Jana Novotna said as she dedicated
her Wimbledon title _ her first singles Grand Slam _ to her coach
Hana Mandlikova, who won four singles Grand Slams but none at
Wimbledon.
	   ``Without her I would never have made this championship,''
Novotna said of her fellow Czech. ``There's no question about it.
When we started to work together _ about nine years ago _ she
simply made me a better player.''
	   Mandlikova also chided the upstart teens who are grabbing the
headline in women's tennis, particularly the American sisters Venus
and Serena Williams.
	   ``The young ones will come up,'' Mandlikova said. ``They need a
couple of years to develop. They have to grow up into the Grand
Slams.
	   ``How can Venus Williams say that she and Serena are going to be
No. 1 and win everything. Excuse me, but that's bull. They're going
to be great, but at 17 I would never have said something like
that.''
	   Serena is 16 and Venus is 18.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   AGE SPOTS: &LR;  In tennis terms, Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna is
ancient. At 29 years, 9 months, she's the oldest first-time Grand
Slam women's singles winner in the Open Era (1968). She surpasses
Australian Kerry Melville-Reed, who was 29 years, 4 months when she
won the 1976 Australian Open.
	   The youngest in the Open Era was Martina Hingis (16 years, 4
months) when she claimed the 1997 Australian Open. A year ago at
Wimbledon, Hingis became the youngest Wimbledon singles winner of
the century.
	   ___
	   BABY VIP: &LR;  Mark McCormack, who runs the sports management
company International Management Group, got a VIP pass for his
6-month-old daughter Mary Elizabeth. ``It was a lovely gesture, now
I look forward to her debut as a player,'' McCormack said.
McCormack, 67, listed by Forbes Magazine as one of America's 400
richest, is married to Betsy Nagelsen, who is playing women's
over-35 doubles this year.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   COSTLY LOSS: &LR;  Britain's Tim Henman missed a chance to collect a
$3.3 million (2 million pounds) bonus from his equipment sponsor
when he lost Friday to Pete Sampras in the semifinals at Wimbledon.
	   If Henman had won the title, he would have cracked the ATP
Tour's top 10 for the first time, earning him the bonus from
Slazenger.
	   Henman is ranked 17th and will climb to about 13th next week.
	   The last player to win the men's singles title at Wimbledon
using a Slazenger racket was John Newcombe in 1971.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   VENUS SIGHTING: &LR;  Venus Williams lost her mixed doubles semifinal
Saturday playing with fellow American Justin Gimelstob. The duo
fell 6-4, 7-5 to Mahesh Bhupathi of India and Mirjana Lucic of
Croatia.
	   Sister Serena, teaming with Belarussian Maxim Mirnyi, was to
face the Dutch team of Paul Haarhuis and Caroline Vis in a late
semifinal Saturday.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SERVE AND VOLLEY: Nine-time Wimbledon singles champion Martina
Navratilova _ now 41 _ talking about the two old timers reaching
Saturday's Wimbledon final: ``It's fabulous to see the veterans
doing it.''
	   Chris Evert, who reached 10 Wimbledon singles finals but won
only three: ``I've been the runner-up queen of Wimbledon.''
	   Novotna's victory moves her to No. 2 in the WTA Tour ranking,
matching her highest ever. Tauziat goes to No. 10, equaling her
best.
	   There have been different winners of all three Grand Slams this
year _ Martina Hingis, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and Novotna. The
last time that happened was 1994.
	   Russian 16-year-old Anna Kournikova, who withdrew from Wimbledon
with a thumb injury, will drop out of the WTA top 10 this week,
falling to No. 15.

Estonians take double victory in international wife carrying
</HEADLINE>
contest &QL; 
 &UR; By MATTI HUUHTANEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland _ In a radical shift from tradition, two
Estonian men carried their partners upside down to take first and
second place in the Wife Carrying World Championships on Saturday.
	   The winning couple, Imre Ambos, 22, and Annela Ojaste, beat a
field of 37 couples from eight countries, finishing the grueling
253-meter (278-yard) course in one minute, 9.2 seconds.
	   ``The mood was different this year, and the innovative way to
carry partners seemed to work,'' said Hannu Keranen, one of the
organizers. ``We had some really fit, young sportsmen, and the
women were as light as grasshoppers.''
	   The wife carrying race was organized four times at the national
level in Sonkajarvi, 550 kilometers (340 miles) north of Helsinki,
before popular demand in 1996 turned it into an annual
international event.
	   Most of the couples were Finnish, but competitors came from
Germany, Norway, Sweden, Russia and Switzerland.
	   The winning couple came away with 8,000 markkaa (dlrs 1,500)
worth of prizes that included a TV set and about 45 liters (94
pints) of beer _ the equivalent of the wife's weight.
	   The contest dates back 200 years when a local legendary hero,
Ronkainen the Robber, tested aspiring members of his gang by making
them carry huge sacks on their backs over an obstacle course.
	   Reacting to suggestions that wife carrying was demeaning to
women, the region's governor, Pirjo Ala-Kapee, said she approved of
the contest.
	   ``If anything, it's uplifting,'' said Ala-Kapee, speaking to the
competitors and spectators. ``It's also authentic and exotic.''
	   More than 7,000 people watched as the couples braved the course
in a rough forest clearing, which included water obstacles and
timber hurdles.
	   The women who are carried have to be at least 17 years old, and
there is no weight limit, Keranen said.
	   ``They can be one's own wife, borrowed and or even stolen if
necessary,'' he said.

Miners' protest in Siberia draws support from others
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A protest by Siberian coal miners was joined by
workers from other industries and organizations Saturday, and
picketers blocked 11 trains along the Trans-Siberian railway, news
reports said.
	   Several hundred miners in the western Siberian mining town of
Anzhero-Sudzhensk began the protest Friday over government plans to
close their mines and reduce subsidies to local coal-related
industries.
	   They are also demanding the ouster of President Boris Yeltsin
and the payment of up to six months' of back wages.
	   Television and news agencies reported that their blockade of
Russia's vital east-west railway, the Trans-Siberian, was joined by
local workers from other industries, such as teachers and bus
drivers.
	   The town of Anzhero-Sudzhensk, heavily depending on the mining
industry, came to a halt as bus drivers and other transport workers
joined the protest, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Footage broadcast on the NTV network showed pensioners and even
policemen sitting on the rails.
	   The protest comes about six weeks after a wave of protests by
coal miners around the country, who blocked the Trans-Siberian and
other railways in May to demand attention and support from the
federal government.
	   Those strikes ended when the government pledged to pay a portion
of the back wages. The Kremlin insists that the money has been paid
out, but miners' officials say only a portion has reached the
mines.
	   Russia has been slowly shutting down many of its coal mines,
which have been losing money steadily. But since many are located
in isolated regions, it has been difficult to find new employment
for the miners and workers in affiliated industries.

meeting; clash near border with Albania. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ On a seemingly impossible mission,
U.S. mediator Richard Holbrooke sought common ground on Saturday
between the president of Yugoslavia and ethnic Albanian leaders on
ending Kosovo's violence.
	   As Holbrooke shuttled between Belgrade and Pristina, a guerrilla
spokesman dented U.S. hopes of getting Kosovo's Albanian fighters
and politicians to speak with one voice in their struggle for
independence.
	   The German news magazine Spiegel quoted a Kosovo Liberation Army
spokesman Jakub Krasniqi as saying the KLA would never take orders
from the main political leader, Ibrahim Rugova, because his
peaceful secession efforts had failed.
	   Ethnic Albanian separatists want independence for Kosovo, a
province in southern Serbia where they outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
Serbia is the larger of the two republics remaining in Yugoslavia.
Hundreds of people have died in Kosovo since Serb forces stepped up
efforts to crush militant resistance in February. Serbs consider
Kosovo the cradle of their culture.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic says the crackdown is
aimed at ethnic Albanian terrorists who have targeted Serb police
in their fight for independence.
	   Holbrooke held talks with Rugova and his more radical rival,
Adem Demaci, in the provincial capital, Pristina. The United States
has urged the KLA to recognize Rugova as the head of a joint
delegation if negotiations can be started.
	   Holbrooke said he was focusing on ways to help the ethnic
Albanian leaders organize themselves. He shuttled between two
different venues just 300 meters (yards) apart to meet separately
with the Rugova and Demaci camps.
	   Earlier, Holbrooke described Rugova as ``the main leader'' of
the province's ethnic Albanian majority, but Demaci also has
considerable popular support.
	   Among the issues to be addressed was the role of the KLA, which
the Serbs consider a terrorist organization but which has been
gaining support in Kosovo at the expense of Rugova, who opposes
violence.
	   Asked Saturday if the KLA should be included in talks, Holbrooke
said Washington wanted ``everybody who has a legitimate role in the
destiny of Kosovo'' to have a place in the negotiations. ``But how
that works out remains to be seen,'' he said.
	   Holbrooke also met in Pristina with members of the Albanian
Democratic Movement, which split away from Rugova with ambitions of
becoming the KLA's political wing. No details were available.
	   Departing for Belgrade afterward, Holbrooke said the various
Albanian factions agreed on some points but ``a wide range of
opinions'' continued to exist on other issues. He did not
elaborate. Members of his party said Holbrooke would return to
Pristina early Sunday.
	   Before talks with Milosevic, Holbrooke first met with Russian
Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky, also in Belgrade,
capital of both Serbia and Yugoslavia. Afanasyevsky met with
Milosevic earlier in the day.
	   In Belgrade, several dozen people people, mostly parents of
draftees doing military service in Kosovo, gathered to demand a
peaceful resolution of the Kosovo crisis and redeployment of their
sons to less violent parts of Yugoslavia.
	   The flurry of diplomacy came a day after Serb forces broke the
ethnic Albanian siege of Kijevo.
	   Sitting astride the main east-west road in Kosovo, Kijevo has
been a flash-point since the KLA surrounded it in mid-June and cut
off its Serb inhabitants. Serb police then surrounded the KLA
fighters.
	   Both sides reported clashes in the southwest Saturday.
	   Serb sources said police pushed back Albanian militants who
attacked Serb villagers at Movljane, a village some 50 kilometers
(30 miles) south of Pristina. An Albanian report said police and
armed Serb villagers attacked Gornja Krusica, an Albanian village
in the same region, killing one person.
	   In a separate incident, the state-run Tanjug news agency cited
an army statement that the border troops exchanged fire with arms
smugglers crossing over from Albania. A different version was
reported by Kosovo Albanians, who said the army targeted three
Albanian-populated villages near the border.
	   Ahead of Holbrooke's visit to the region, Milosevic denied any
government repression in Kosovo and offered to restore the autonomy
he yanked from the province in 1989 on grounds of protecting its
Serb minority.
	   Holbrooke is pressing for a cease-fire before trying to get
Milosevic to withdraw his forces. But he and other Western
officials are insistent that Kosovo should not be allowed
independence.
	   That may not satisfy even the moderate ethnic Albanian leaders
on whom Washington had pinned hopes for a negotiated settlement.

Israel, Palestinians trade accusations after Gaza standoff
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Arafat leaving for Cairo summit &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo JRL101
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat accused Israel
of violating the peace agreements in a confrontation in the Gaza
Strip and said the Palestinians ``will not hesitate to confront any
attempted aggression on our land.''
	   In a Cabinet statement published Saturday, Arafat said ``We will
not accept anyone harming the lives or jobs of our people in the
Gaza Strip. The Israeli side must respect the agreement.''
	   Israel and the Palestinians heaped blame on each other after
troops from the two sides confronted the other with cocked assault
rifles and armored personnel carriers Thursday night and early
Friday in what began as an argument over control of a Gaza Strip
road.
	   The incident came at a time when the United States appears to be
making little headway in winning Israeli agreement on a troop
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Arafat left Saturday for Cairo, for a meeting with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Hussein, about the
deadlock in the peace process. The meeting was to take place
Sunday.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested that the
12-hour showdown in Gaza, during which Palestinian truckers
blockaded Jewish settlements, could make Israel even more hesitant
to hand over land to the Palestinians. Israeli hard-liners claim
that a troop pullback would leave more than a dozen settlements
isolated and at the mercy of the Palestinians.
	   ``You could also understand how sensitive we are to the issue of
redeployment, which could place tens of thousands of Israelis ...
at great peril any time the Palestinians decide to violate the
agreement, as they did last night,'' Netanyahu said Friday.
	   Netanyahu accused the Palestinians of staging a deliberate
provocation and said Israel would not succumb to threats of
violence.
	   The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, dismissed
Netanyahu's accusation, saying the Palestinian Authority had made
every possible effort to defuse the situation.
	   Netanyahu ``is the one to be blamed for the tense situation on
the ground'' because he has refused to live up to Israel's
promises, including a troop pullback, Erekat said.
	   The Gaza confrontation began with a routine argument over the
use of a road. About two-thirds of the Gaza Strip is controlled by
the Palestinian Authority, but Israeli troops patrol near Jewish
settlements and control several access roads.
	   On Thursday afternoon, Palestinian Supplies Minister Abdel Azziz
Shaheen demanded that Israel allow a convoy of 22 Palestinian cars
to use a coastal route it controls. Israeli soldiers said they
would let Shaheen pass because as a Cabinet minister he has special
privileges, but told the others to turn back.
	   The dispute quickly escalated into scuffles and shouting matches
between Israeli and Palestinian troops. Israeli troops stationed
three armored personnel carriers on a road linking two major Gaza
Strip cities and created a huge traffic jam. In retaliation,
Palestinian police ordered dozens of trucks to block access roads
to Jewish settlements. Israel, in turn, sealed off the Gaza Strip.
	   As night fell, both sides dug roadside trenches and took up
positions just a few dozen yards from one another _ with rifles
pointed.
	   Under a compromise reached early Friday with the help of U.S.
Mideast envoy Dennis Ross, the Palestinians agreed to move the
trucks from the settlement roads while Israel allowed Shaheen and
his convoy to drive along the coastal road.
	   Nabil Shaath, Palestinian planning minister, blamed Israel for
causing the incident by blocking Palestinian traffic.
	   ``We were lucky,'' he said after Friday night's Cabinet meeting
in the West Bank city of Hebron. ``We escaped a confrontation that
we do not want. But the Israelis must understand we will not accept
that they enforce their rule by military power against the
agreements they signed and the world witnessed.''
	   Shaath said Israel's policies would lead to ``nothing but an
explosion.''
	   ``We are doing our best not to get to that situation, but the
Israelis are pushing our patience beyond the limits,'' he said.

Italy, Libya pledge closer ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Libya, which is under U.N. sanctions for refusing to
surrender two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner, on
Saturday pledged to work more closely with Italy in fighting
terrorism.
	   Tripoli also committed itself to improving ties with Rome, which
have been strained lately by failure by Tripoli to promptly pay
Italian companies and by arrests of Sicilian fishermen.
	   Leading the latest in a series of periodic Libyan-Italian
meetings were Italy's foreign minister Lamberto Dini and Libya's
Omar al-Muntasser.
	   An Italian foreign ministry statement gave no details about the
pledge to fight terrorism and to work more closely with Italy
against the proliferation of arms of mass destruction.
	   Libya in the past has been accused of building chemical weapons
factories, a charge it has denied.
	   Dini's talks with the Libyans fit into broader Italian efforts
to improve Western relations with countries under U.N. or U.S.
embargo or shunned for suspected support of terrorism.
	   Earlier in the week, Premier Romano Prodi became the first
European Union leader to travel to Iran for talks since 1992.
Earlier this year Dini went to Cuba, a country under U.S. embargo.
	   Relations between Italy and Libya hit a low in 1986 when Tripoli
fired a missile at the tiny Sicilian island of Lampedusa to
retaliate for U.S. bombings of two Libyan cities. But Italy is
heavily dependant on Libyan petroleum and gas, and relations, while
tested at times, have endured.
	   Efforts at improving relations ``will lead soon, by means of a
joint document, to closing definitively, by both sides, the
negative heritage of the past and leaving an imprint for a new,
more dynamic course for relations between the two countries,'' the
ministry statement said.
	   Libya, the statement said, confirmed it would try to rapidly
unblock payments to Italian companies.
	   Rome, for its part, pledged to push for Libyan participation in
meetings related to Mediterranean energy issues. Italy also pledged
to promote a plan for fiber-optic cables running under the
Mediterranean between Tripoli and Sicily.
	   Future meetings will concentrate on improving protection and
promotion of investments, increasing industrial and technical
cooperation between Libya and Italian companies and collaboration
in tourism, agriculture and fishing.

Northern Ireland braces for Orange parade showdown

	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ British soldiers and state
police have transformed Portadown into a fortress, wrapping the
town's Catholic enclave in an armored cocoon and throwing elaborate
barbed-wire defenses across pastures to thwart Protestant marchers.
	   Hoping to defuse Sunday's now-annual showdown over who ``owns''
Portadown's Garvaghy Road, politicians from all sides appealed to
the Catholics who live along the road, and the Orangemen who treat
this staunchly Protestant town as their spiritual heartland, not to
spark riots across Northern Ireland, the awful outcome for the past
two years.
	   ``We do not want to see violence on our streets. We do not want
the two sides of our community to embark on a collision course
where all will be losers,'' said David Trimble, an Orangeman and
leader of the north's major pro-British party, the Ulster
Unionists, which has formal links with the 80,000-strong Orange
Order brotherhood.
	   Trimble spoke alongside Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the main
moderate Catholic party. Together they head Northern Ireland's new
power-sharing Assembly, the main pillar of April's multi-party
agreement on how Northern Ireland should be governed.
	   Mallon appealed for both the protesters and the Portadown
Orangemen to demonstrate ``tolerance, restraint and generosity.''
	   At his English country retreat, Prime Minister Tony Blair blamed
the deadlock on the refusal by Orangemen to talk directly with the
protest group and that both sides had adopted ``two very entrenched
positions.''
	   Alistair Graham, chairman of the Parades Commission that ordered
Orangemen to avoid Garvaghy Road, attributed the impasse to ``the
strong personalities that exist on either side,'' an apparent
reference to Portadown's Orange district master, Harold Gracey, and
the Catholic protest leader, former IRA prisoner Breandan
MacCionnaith.
	   Orangemen insist they must be allowed to parade back into town
from their rural Drumcree Anglican church along the disputed road.
Since 1807 they have marched that route beneath emblems of a
British crown on an open Bible as part of their annual
demonstration of Protestant solidarity.
	   But now facing a network of barbed-wire coils, high steel walls,
a deep trench and video cameras erected early Saturday by British
soldiers, the Orangemen say when their parade leaves the church
Sunday afternoon they will camp out in the adjoining cemetery and
fields for as long as it takes to get down Garvaghy Road.
	   Ronnie Flanagan, commander of Northern Ireland's predominantly
Protestant police force, said no level of civil disobedience by
Orangemen would achieve their goal.
	   ``The march will not be forced down,'' Flanagan said, noting
that Parades Commission decisions were now the law of the land and
must be enforced.
	   ``I know people who feel themselves at the wrong end of these
decisions are genuinely hurt by them. But there are plenty of
legitimate avenues through which such people can protest,
legitimately and peacefully, against this decision.''

World Cup: Bergkamp winner sends Dutch to semifinal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Optional; adds quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ The Netherlands didn't need any magic
potions or incantations to break its quarterfinal curse, just a
last-minute goal from Dennis Bergkamp.
	   The Arsenal striker's 90th-minute winner the gave the Dutch a
2-1 victory over Argentina on Sunday and sent them to their third
World Cup semifinal.
	   The Dutch, who crashed out of their last two tournaments after
reaching the final eight, will meet Brazil in Tuesday for a place
in the championship match.
	   The match in Marseille will give the Netherlands a chance to
avenge their 3-2 loss to Brazil in the 1994 World Cup quarterfinals
in the United States.
	   ``We are looking forward to Brazil,'' Dutch coach Guus Hiddink
said. ``We know Brazil, Brazil knows us .... It will be an
interesting contest.''
	   Bergkamp put the Dutch in the final four for the first time
since 1978 when he latched on to a long pass by Frank de Boer and
beat Argentinean goalkeeper Carlos Roa.
	   In 1978, the Dutch, who have won both their previous semifinals,
lost the final to the Argentines.
	   Bergkamp turned inside defender Roberto Ayala after controlling
the ball and then fired right-footed past Roa.
	   ``It was thanks to the pass from Frank,'' Bergkamp said. ``He
saw it fantastically.''
	   Both teams ended a thrilling encounter with only 10 men after
first Arthur Numan and then Ariel Ortega were shown the red card.
	   ``I must say it was a very, very tough match,'' Argentine coach
Daniel Passarella said.
	   He said his players were still tired following their
second-round victory over England on penalties following 120
minutes of play.
	   ``Our opponents had one day more (to recover) which is really
important at this stage,'' Passarella said.
	   Patrick Kluivert, who returned to the Dutch starting lineup for
the first time since being sent off against Belgium in the
Netherlands' World Cup opener, started the scoring in the 12th
minute.
	   Ronald de Boer began the move with a long pass to Bergkamp, who
stooped to send a cushioned header to Kluivert, who finished calmly
with a first-time shot from seven meters.
	   Hiddink praised the Dutch scores as ``very good goals. The first
because we were dominating in midfield. And then you have to wait
for the good pass ... Bergkamp made a very intelligent layoff for
Patrick and Kluivert was very, very controlled to score.''
	   Wim Jonk had earlier rattled the Argentine post with a powerful
drive as the Dutch came out playing their trademark fluent,
attacking soccer.
	   But Argentina began playing with more composure and attacking
intent after falling behind, and it wasn't long before it pulled
itself back into the match.
	   Claudio Lopez beat the Dutch offside trap to collect a long pass
from Juan Veron and calmly slide a shot under the advancing Edwin
van der Sar to equalize in the 18th minute.
	   The chances flowed for both sides before the break in an open
and attacking match played in searing heat in this southern French
city's Stade Velodrome.
	   Jonk forced Roa into a two-handed block in the 35th minute with
a 25-meter drive and three minutes later Ortega beat Van der Sar
with a 30-meter rocket but the post came to the Netherlands'
rescue.
	   The Dutch kept up the pressure with a dominating spell of
possession after the break but it was the Argentines who came
closest to taking a lead.
	   In the 64th minute Gabriel Batistuta broke clear of Frank de
Boer and fired a powerful left-foot shot past Van der Sar but again
the post intervened.
	   The Dutch responded by bringing on Marc Overmars, who did not
start because of a hamstring injury. The speedy winger's first
touch was a cross from the right that Kluivert headed goalward,
forcing a fingertip save from Roa.
	   Numan was sent off in the 77th minute for his second yellow card
after a late tackle of Diego Simeone, but Argentina could not
transform its man advantage into a goal. It gave the bonus back
when Ortega head butted Van der Sar.
	   Van der Sar was remonstrating with Ortega after he collided with
Jaap Stam and argued for a penalty with 2 1-2 minutes remaining.
	   Bergkamp's goal made him the lone top Dutch marksman of all time
with 36 goals.
	   ``It was a fantastic action by Bergkamp,'' Hiddink said.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat accused Israel
of violating the peace agreements in a confrontation in the Gaza
Strip and said the Palestinians ``will not hesitate to confront any
attempted aggression on our land.''
	   In a Cabinet statement published Saturday, Arafat said ``We will
not accept anyone harming the lives or jobs of our people in the
Gaza Strip. The Israeli side must respect the agreement.''
	   Israel and the Palestinians heaped blame on each other after
troops from the two sides confronted the other with cocked assault
rifles and armored personnel carriers Thursday night and early
Friday in what began as an argument over control of a Gaza Strip
road.
	   The incident came at a time when the United States appears to be
making little headway in winning Israeli agreement on a troop
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Arafat left Saturday for Cairo, for a meeting with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Hussein on the deadlock
in the peace process. The meeting was to take place Sunday.

Missile purchase delay allows for negotiations, official says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By THANASSIS CAMBANIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A decision by Cyprus to postpone the
delivery of a Russian anti-aircraft missile system will reduce
tensions in the region and give Turkey more time to consider
demilitarizing the divided island, a Greek official said Saturday.
	   ``Every move that has a goal of reduced tension helps the
situation,'' Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman Theodoros Theodorou
told The Associated Press.
	   Russian and Greek officials announced this week that the S-300
missile system, originally scheduled for delivery this summer, will
not arrive on Cyprus before November.
	   Turkey invaded the northern third of Cyprus in 1974 and has
about 35,000 troops stationed in the self-styled Turkish Republic
of Northern Cyprus. Negotiations to reunify the island have stalled
over Turkish demands to halt Cyprus' European Union accession
talks.
	   U.S. and European officials have pressured Cyprus to cancel the
dlrs 375 million purchase, saying it needlessly increases tension
and could set off a war between Greece and Turkey, NATO partners
with longstanding differences in the eastern Mediterranean.
	   Turkish officials claim the advanced anti-aircraft missile
launching system would give Cyprus the offensive capability to
strike aircraft flying over southern Turkey.
	   High-profile negotiators, including Richard Holbrooke, the
former U.S. envoy for Cyprus and now nominee for U.N. ambassador,
and U.N. envoy Diego Cordovez, have made repeated visits to the
island to break the deadlock.
	   Cordovez wrapped up his most recent visit Saturday, declaring no
breakthrough but announcing a return visit in September.
	   Tension escalated as the delivery date approached. In June,
Greece sent fighter planes to a new air base in Cyprus, and Turkey
responded with its own display of military force over the island.
	   This week's announcement by the Russian ambassador to Ankara
that the missiles would not be delivered until the fall provided
the first step toward averting a crisis.
	   Greek and Russian officials said that Cyprus requested the
delay, although Cypriot officials refused to confirm they had done
so. In recent weeks Cyprus has avoided public comments about the
missile purchase.
	   Cypriot officials have repeatedly proposed total
demilitarization of the island as a basic step toward a solution.
	   Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Valery Nesterushkin said
Saturday that the government would be willing to cancel the missile
sale if it meant peace for Cyprus.
	   ``We believe that if significant progress is made in a Cyprus
peace settlement and demilitarization of the island is on the
agenda, there will be no need for the systems to be there,'' he
said.
	   On Saturday, Turkey repeated its threat to use force to stop
Cyprus from installing the S-300 system.
	   ``We are taking necessary military measures against the possible
deployment of the missiles,'' Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit said in
Ankara.
	   Turkey also has threatened to annex northern Cyprus outright if
the missiles are deployed.

Hundreds evacuated, homes burnt as hot winds drive brush fires
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Planned &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Out-of-control brush fires driven by
gusting winds and high temperatures Saturday burnt dozens of houses
and forced hundreds of people to evacuate their homes.
	   Two soldiers were hospitalized for smoke inhalation after trying
to move weapons out of the path of a fire at Avlona, the nation's
largest army base, about 25 kilometers (16 miles) north of Athens.
	   Officials attributed the rash of wildfires to the sudden fierce
winds, high temperatures and dry land.
	   As a week-long heat wave that had pushed temperatures as high as
45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) and killed four people
abated, firefighters struggled to contain the rash of wildfires.
	   Army personnel and fire-fighting planes joined the effort to
combat 24 fires that flared around Athens and other parts of the
country.
	   There was no official tally of houses burnt and people
evacuated.
	   Burning brush sent a thick black cloud over countryside,
covering the capital. The highway linking Athens to northern Greece
was closed off in at least three places.
	   Homes were evacuated in dozens of villages, including suburbs
north of Athens and west of the port city of Piraeus.
	   Over-extended fire fighting forces couldn't reach every front,
and residents tried to beat out flames using branches, rocks and
blankets.
	   Weather forecasters predicted a slight drop in temperature but
said that strong winds would continue throughout the weekend.

Russian customs accuses U.S. diplomat of smuggling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian customs and security officials have
accused an American diplomat of trying to smuggle cultural
valuables out of Russia, news reports said Saturday.
	   The NTV network broadcast photos of 44 items found in a shipment
of household goods belonging to the diplomat, including silver
cutlery, two rugs one painting and two small samovars.
	   It was not clear in the footage whether any or all of the items
were valuable or even of Russian origin.
	   Russian officials said the diplomat, military attache Philip
Hatch, should have obtained export licenses for the items.
	   The American Embassy issued a statement saying that U.S. policy
prohibits diplomats from illegally exporting Russian national
treasures.
	   ``The embassy has worked with the state customs committee to
resolve such issues in accordance with standard diplomatic
procedure,'' the statement said.

World Cup: Fans in all colors, but Dutch paint Marseille orange
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MORT ROSENBLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Special Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ The color du jour at the Octopussy Bar
is bright Dutch orange. In fact, victory-crazed Holland fans
painted the whole town orange, a happy change for a tough port city
still recovering from too much English red.
	   Something about soccer turns perfectly normal people into
temporary lunatics, and they love it. Pre-game madness is loony
enough. But the Dutch reached new heights after beating Argentina
2-1 to earn a crack at Brazil in the World Cup semifinals.
	   ``That's because soccer is the most important thing the world,''
explained Fred Martens, 25, a Dutch technology consultant with red
and blue paint on his cheeks and an orange cape. ``People say it's
a game. Hah. It's life.''
	   No, corrected Patrick Snijders, a coworker in the same get-up,
matching his laugh. ``It's war.''
	   It can be, but it wasn't on Saturday. The same riot troops who
fought running battles with the English near the Octopussy took off
their helmets to put on silly orange stocking caps and pose with
Dutch fans.
	   ``We're the craziest soccer fans in the world,'' Martens
assured. ``Maybe it's because things aren't so exciting in Holland,
but this gives us a chance to party.''
	   Perhaps. Stereotypes of the sober, soft-spoken Dutch fly out the
window as hordes of them bellow in unison, guzzle beer in the
streets and swing giant inflatable hammers to the amusement of
uninvolved bystanders.
	   But it would take a World Cup of fans, rather than players, to
determine who are craziest. Brazilians might win. Or maybe the
English, the Italians, the Scots, the Nigerians, the Jamaicans. Or,
of course, the Argentines.
	   Saturday's game was fought as hard in the stands as on the
field.
	   The Dutch scored first, and a thunderous roar rose under a blur
of orange flags. Then Argentina kicked in a goal. The noise was the
same but the color was blue.
	   The Argentines, who have won two World Cups and thought they
smelled a third, are normally the most fervent of soccer loonies.
Their cheers can be crude, referring to their opponents' parentage,
virility and skin tones. They hate to lose.
	   And the Dutch, driven to a frenzy as their team outclassed the
favorite, matched them yell for yell. When the game ended, both
sides stood firm, trading cheers for half an hour across an empty
playing field.
	   Outside, Argentines drifted away, leaving the Dutch to party.
One reveler, Stephan Eltink, wore orange pants, a flag and a
half-pound of paint. ``I'm a paramedic,'' he explained, ``in normal
life.''
	   Holland has its hooligans who are a match for the English, but
few were in evidence. Fans like Hannie Opheij were far more common.
At 27, she lives in a small village and takes care of old people.
	   ``I love soccer,'' she pronounced, ablaze in orange, with a
liter of beer in hand and a wide grin. ``It's not only the game,
but everything about it.''
	   She expects Brazil to beat Holland, but that does not bother
her. ``Win or less,'' she said, echoing a sentiment heard in
different languages at nearly every game, ``it's a party.''

Springboks crush England in fourth consecutive Test victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's Springboks slid
and grappled their way to a muddy 18-0 victory over England on
Saturday, their fourth consecutive rugby Test win in four weeks.
	   Wet and slippery conditions ruled out exciting back line play at
Newlands and back Andre Snyman, star of last week's 96-13 thrashing
of Wales, hardly touched the ball.
	   Joost van der Westhuizen scored the first try after he stormed
down a kick from English fly half Josh Lewsey in the 22nd minute.
	   South Africa easily dominated the lineouts. Both Springbok tries
were scored in the first half.
	   In the only noteworthy back line movement watched by 40,000
fans, Stephen Terblanche touched down three minutes before the
break.
	   The balance of the points came from the boot of full back Percy
Montgomery, who goaled the first try and posted two penalties after
the break for a team total of two tries, one conversion and two
penalties.
	   For England, full back Matt Perry fielded the slippery and wet
balls without mistakes. A game England pack won their share of
rucks, but South African flanks Rassie Erasmus and Johan Erasmus
mounted a virtually impregnable defense.
	   South Africa has now won ten consecutive tests since August last
year, and coach Nick Mallett's policy of boosting player confidence
appears to have paid off as they prepare for the upcoming
Tri-Nations competition against Australia and New Zealand.

Women once denied degrees celebrate Cambridge reversal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAMBRIDGE, England (AP) _ Women who studied at Cambridge
University without a hope of getting a degree in the first half of
this century joined in a celebration Saturday marking the 50th
anniversary of the university's change of heart.
	   ``I never thought about the equality aspect of it at all,'' said
Edith Butcher, who at 96 was the oldest of some 900 former students
to join the event.
	   ``You just took it for granted. In many ways I had much more
freedom at Cambridge than I had had before. I enjoyed it.''
	   Two Cambridge colleges _ Girton and Newnham _ were among the
first in Britain to offer higher education to women, but the
university did not award degrees and university membership to women
until 1948.
	   The women invited to Saturday's ceremony have been eligible to
apply for degrees since 1948, and the university said many had
received their degrees.
	   Oxford University had begun to award full degrees to women in
the early 1920s.
	   Before 1948, male and female students at Cambridge were kept
apart as much as possible. Lecture theaters were divided into male
and female sections, and women could visit male colleges only with
a chaperone.
	   Baroness David of Romsey, 84, who had been a whip for the Labor
government in the 1970s, said she hadn't thought about inequality
when she was studying English at Newnham from 1932 to 1935.
	   ``I was just so pleased to be here. It was tremendously
exciting. I had a wonderful time. I suppose looking back I should
say it was awful, but I must confess I don't really feel that,''
she said.
	   But she added in a speech to former students that there was
``much to be done.''
	   ``Cambridge, like other universities in the U.K., presents a
very flat pyramid,'' she added. ``Forty-five percent of the
students may be women but only 14 percent of the lecturers and 6
percent of the professors are women.''

World Cup: Another shootout disappointment for Italy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with team's return to Italy &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy on Saturday was suffering the World Cup
shootout blues for the third straight time.
	   But while disappointment was rife in this soccer-mad nation, so
was the sense that the beloved Azzurri got what they deserved in
Friday's quarterfinal loss to cup host France.
	   ``Penalty kicks are an invention of the devil,'' Gazzetta dello
Sport editor Candido Cannavo wrote in a front-page column, ``but
this time our right to detest them is very questionable.''
	   In a reference to the Azzurri's defense-first tactics, the
newspaper's front page had the banner headline: ``France is better
... Adieu `Fort Italy.'''
	   Unlike most countries, where thoughts of a world title are
harbored but not necessarily believed, Italians truly expect a
championship each and every four years. They have been right three
times, but not since 1982.
	   Another of the sports dailies, Corriere dello Sport, blared on
its front page, ``Cursed penalties. But it also is our fault.''
	   Editor Mario Sconcerti summed up the feelings of most Italians
with one line. ``We were very unlucky,'' he wrote, ``but not
good.''
	   This time, Italy's World Cup hopes went awry with a Luigi Di
Biagio penalty smacking the crossbar, handing France a 4-3 win in
the shootout after 120 minutes of scoreless play. Four years ago,
Italy lost the title match to Brazil when Roberto Baggio sent the
final penalty high. And, as hosts in 1990, Italy suffered a similar
fate, losing on penalties to Argentina after their semifinal match
ended 1-1.
	   No sooner had Di Biagio slumped to the ground after his errant
shot than talk in Italy turned to tactics and coach Cesare
Maldini's job status.
	   A small crowd in Milan applauded the players when the team
returned to Italy Saturday night.
	   ``Unfortunately we didn't win, but I think people understood we
gave our all,'' said Paolo Maldini, team captain and coach's son,
after he got off the plane.
	   While the team's return home might not have been met with tossed
tomatoes _ as infamously occurred at Milan's Linate airport after
Italy was shockingly defeated by North Korea during the 1966 World
Cup _ the ever-fragile relationship with the fans suffered a blow.
	   ``The red thread that was slowly tying the Italians to Italy's
team has been broken,'' Sconcerti wrote.
	   ``To only defend and look for the long pass or the counterattack
are solutions that are too fragile for the final phase of the World
Cup,'' he added. ``And they have value only if the team wins in the
end.''
	   It didn't, and the fans' bitterness was tangible.
	   ``There's just no luck. When it comes to penalties, Italy has no
luck,'' said Nicola Ambrosini, owner of La Tavernelle, a restaurant
within sight of the Colosseum that the late film director Federico
Fellini used to frequent. ``Somebody has to miss. It's so random,
it's painful. Maybe if they had tried to win before the penalties.
... No one is happy now.''
	   The painful wait until 2002 has begun.

England battle to save the third test
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stumps score
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ South Africa's bowling attack had
England battling to save the third cricket test at Old Trafford on
Saturday.
	   England, in reply to South Africa's 552 for five declared, was
precariously placed on 162 for eight at stumps on the third day and
still needs another 191 runs to avoid the follow on.
	   On a pitch producing varied bounce, the English batsmen were
never at ease facing pacemen Allan Donald, Makhaya Ntini or
left-arm spinner Paul Adams.
	   However, two contentious umpiring decisions contributed to
England's perilous position just before stumps.
	   Mark Ramprakash and Graham Thorpe, both well-accomplished
batsmen capable of salvaging England's innings, were dismissed
within the space of four overs.
	   Thorpe was trapped leg before wicket off a ball that appeared to
have come off the inside edge.
	   Ramprakash, who batted steadily for 138 minutes for 30, was
adjudged caught behind but the ball appeared to deflect off his
forearm.
	   Adams was South Africa's most successful bowler, taking 3-48 in
27 overs, while Donald and Ntini claimed two wickets apiece.
	   England was sent into bat an hour before lunch and went to the
first break with one wicket down and then lost two wickets,
including former captain Mike Atherton for 41, in the second
session.
	   But South Africa wreaked havoc in the third session, taking five
wickets and conceding only 54 runs.
	   Donald made inroads into the England innings with the wickets of
Nick Knight and Nasser Hussain before and after lunch.
	   Atherton and Alec Stewart (40) held up South Africa's advance
with a bold 60-run stand before Ntini had Atherton caught behind.
	   Kallis followed up his 132 in the South African innings with the
prized wicket of Stewart and England was soon in trouble on 108 for
four.
	   While Ramprakash was holding his end intact, Adams and Ntini
combined to remove Dominic Cork and Robert Croft.
	   England will start play Saturday facing the likely prospect of
having to bat out two full days to save the test.

No tears from Wimbledon runnerup Tauziat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEVEN WINE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ The match had just ended, and new
Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna climbed into the Centre Court
stands to share the jubilant moment with her mother and coach.
	   The crowd cheered, Novotna beamed, and Nathalie Tauziat quietly
watched the celebration from her courtside chair. Then she buried
her face in a towel.
	   There were no tears, however, and Tauziat later acknowledged the
second-place finish as the greatest achievement in her 15-year
career. She lost to Novotna 6-4, 7-6 (7-2) in Saturday's final.
	   ``It was one of the best days of my life so far,'' Tauziat said.
``I'm very happy with what I've done. I have nothing to regret.''
	   The Grand Slam final was the first for Tauziat, and it was the
first Wimbledon final for a Frenchwoman since the legendary Suzanne
Lenglen won her sixth title in 1925.
	   Because of Tauziat's inexperience in big matches, she was
considered an underdog against Novotna, who earned her first major
title after finishing second at Wimbledon in 1993 and 1997.
	   ``It's never easy to play your game when you are for the first
time in the final of a big tournament like this,'' said Tauziat,
the No. 16 seed. ``She played better than me. She has more
experience than me in the final of a Grand Slam. She deserved to
win Wimbledon, and I hope next year is going to be my Wimbledon.''
	   That's a long shot. Tauziat, 30, cracked the top 10 for the
first time just this year, and she has won only four WTA Tour
titles. She may be closer to retirement than another Grand Slam
final.
	   Tauziat and Notovna had split eight previous meetings, and
Novotna was concerned about the matchup, even after beating Venus
Williams and Martina Hingis in earlier rounds.
	   ``I knew coming into this match that it was going to be really,
really hard to beat her,'' Novotna said. ``She's very experienced,
and I knew that this would be probably the toughest match of the
whole championship. I felt like the match against Martina was a
piece of cake compared to this one.''
	   Tauziat wanted to serve and volley, but she struggled with her
first serves and was reluctant to come to the net behind soft
second serves. Her hesitancy allowed Novotna to charge behind her
returns, which may have decided the outcome.
	   ``She always puts you under pressure,'' Tauziat said. ``I
decided at the end sometimes to come in on my second serve to put
her under pressure, but I think it was too late.''
	   As the match slipped away, Tauziat shrieked, kicked the ball and
looked to the sky for help. When none was forthcoming, she settled
for second place.

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Former Ryder Cup player Barry Lane shot a
course record equalling 62 _ the lowest round of his European Tour
career _ Saturday to take a share of the lead in the Irish Open.
	   The 38-year-old Englishman, who has missed the cut 13 times in
14 tournaments, shares the lead with David Carter in the 1 million
pound (dlrs 1.66 million) event at Druids Glen.
	   Carter fired a 67 to join Lane at 6-under with an aggregate 207.
	   Colin Montgomerie, European No.1 for the last five years, is
still a chance to snatch three consecutive Irish Open titles.
	   Battling an ankle injury, he shot a third-round 71 to finish
3-under and three strokes off the lead.
	   Lane's 9-under par round equalled the course record set by
Montgomerie last year when he won his second successive Irish Open.
	   Lane, currently 164th on the European money list, was clubhouse
leader when the European Grand Prix at Slaley Hall was cancelled
due to rain three weeks ago.
	   ``That was annoying but I've been trying not to get angry,'' he
said. ``My problem has been that I was just losing my temper on the
course.''
	   ``I still feel I'm a good player and I felt I should be doing
better than I was. This week I've tried to be a bit `tranquillo',''
he added.
	   Irish Open halfway leader John McHenry, Montgomerie's old tour
school colleague who has not won a cent on tour this year, shot 70
to finish one stroke behind the leaders.
	   His fellow halfway leaders Craig Hainline and Tony Johnstone had
mixed rounds Saturday.
	   Hainline, who has failed three times to qualify for the American
tour, scored 72 to be three shots off the pace, while Johnstone of
Zimbabwe hit 77 to be eight shots off the pace.
	   Ian Woosnam shot a 65 to move to 1-under after three rounds,
while his playing partner Nick Faldo shot 67 to go 1-over.
	   World No.2 Ernie Els shot a 70 to add to his two even rounds and
joins Woosnam at 1-under.

Mounted Israelis smash Palestinians car windows
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Three Israeli horsemen disguised as Arabs
smashed the windows of Palestinians' cars in the tense, divided
West Bank city of Hebron, Israeli police said Saturday.
	   Wielding chains, and wearing keffiyehs, a traditional Arab
headgear, the three shattered the windshields and dented the
body-work of Arab-owned cars parked near the Jewish suburb of
Kiryat-Arba, on the outskirts of the mainly Palestinian city,
police spokesman Ofer Sivan said.
	   The incident took place late Friday.
	   Police pounced on the three, catching one, but the other two
escaped on foot, Sivan said. A policewoman who jumped onto the back
of one of the horses was slightly injured.
	   The suspect, aged about 20, was to be brought before a
magistrate in Jerusalem on Saturday night for his arrest to be
extended. Police were looking for the two fugitives.
	   The police patrol was watching the Arab neighborhood because
several Arab-owned cars had been set afire there recently, Sivan
said.
	   About 500 Jewish settlers live in downtown Hebron surrounded by
more than 130,000 Palestinians. Relations between the two
communities are tense and from violence breaks out from time to
time.
	   Most of the city is controlled by the Palestinian Authority, but
the Israeli army and police control the Jewish enclaves and some
Arab neighborhoods close to them.

Azerbaijani opposition leaders vow to boycott presidential

election &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Five opposition leaders vowed Saturday
to boycott Azerbaijan's presidential election on Oct. 11.
	   In a statement, the leaders complained that Azerbaijan's
elections law would make any ballot unfair and anti-democratic.
	   President Geidar Aliev, who was Azerbaijan's Soviet-era
Communist Party boss, came to power in a bloodless military coup in
June 1993 and has been cracking down on opposition groups ever
since.
	   The five leaders were: Alfubaz Elchibin, chairman of the
National Front and former president of Azerbaijan; Isa Gambar,
chairman of the Musabad Party and a former speaker of parliament;
Rasul Guriev, ex-speaker of the parliament in the first three years
of Aliev's presidency;, Lala-Shorket Gadzhieva, leader of the
Liberal Party and Aliev's former chief of staff; and Ilyas
Ismailov, leader of the Democratic Party.

Dutch team stops Woodies five-year run
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ The Dutch team to Jacco Eltingh and
Paul Haarhuis ended the five-year run of the Australian doubles
pair of Tood Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde, taking their doubles
semifinal Saturday 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-3) 5-7, 10-8.
	   The top-seeded Eltingh and Haarhuis won over the second-seeded
Australians and took the four-hour match when Woodbridge hit a
half-volley backhand into the net in the 18th game.
	   It was the third match point for the winning Dutch and the
service break was the only one of the fifth set.
	   The Australians won the last five Wimbledon titles _ tying the
championships record _ and were going for a record six. They share
the record of five straight set by Britons Reggie and Laurie
Doherty in 1897-1901.
	   In women's doubles, Martina Hingis and Jana Novotna _ Saturday's
singles champion _ reached the final with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over
Lisa Raymond of the United States and Rennae Stubbs of Australia.

World Cup: Fans in all colors, but Dutch paint Marseille orange
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS to ``lose'' sted ``less'' in last graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By MORT ROSENBLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Special Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ The color du jour at the Octopussy Bar
is bright Dutch orange. In fact, victory-crazed Netherlands fans
painted the whole town orange, a happy change for a tough port city
still recovering from too much English red.
	   Something about soccer turns perfectly normal people into
temporary lunatics, and they love it. Pre-game madness is loony
enough. But the Dutch reached new heights after beating Argentina
2-1 to earn a crack at Brazil in the World Cup semifinals.
	   ``That's because soccer is the most important thing the world,''
explained Fred Martens, 25, a Dutch technology consultant with red
and blue paint on his cheeks and an orange cape. ``People say it's
a game. Hah. It's life.''
	   No, corrected Patrick Snijders, a coworker in the same get-up,
matching his laugh. ``It's war.''
	   It can be, but it wasn't on Saturday. The same riot troops who
fought running battles with the English near the Octopussy took off
their helmets to put on silly orange stocking caps and pose with
Dutch fans.
	   ``We're the craziest soccer fans in the world,'' Martens
assured. ``Maybe it's because things aren't so exciting in Holland,
but this gives us a chance to party.''
	   Perhaps. Stereotypes of the sober, soft-spoken Dutch fly out the
window as hordes of them bellow in unison, guzzle beer in the
streets and swing giant inflatable hammers to the amusement of
uninvolved bystanders.
	   But it would take a World Cup of fans, rather than players, to
determine who are craziest. Brazilians might win. Or maybe the
English, the Italians, the Scots, the Nigerians, the Jamaicans. Or,
of course, the Argentines.
	   Saturday's game was fought as hard in the stands as on the
field.
	   The Dutch scored first, and a thunderous roar rose under a blur
of orange flags. Then Argentina kicked in a goal. The noise was the
same but the color was blue.
	   The Argentines, who have won two World Cups and thought they
smelled a third, are normally the most fervent of soccer loonies.
Their cheers can be crude, referring to their opponents' parentage,
virility and skin tones. They hate to lose.
	   And the Dutch, driven to a frenzy as their team outclassed the
favorite, matched them yell for yell. When the game ended, both
sides stood firm, trading cheers for half an hour across an empty
playing field.
	   Outside, Argentines drifted away, leaving the Dutch to party.
One reveler, Stephan Eltink, wore orange pants, a flag and a
half-pound of paint. ``I'm a paramedic,'' he explained, ``in normal
life.''
	   The Netherlands has its hooligans who are a match for the
English, but few were in evidence. Fans like Hannie Opheij were far
more common. At 27, she lives in a small village and takes care of
old people.
	   ``I love soccer,'' she pronounced, ablaze in orange, with a
liter of beer in hand and a wide grin. ``It's not only the game,
but everything about it.''
	   She expects Brazil to beat the Netherlands, but that does not
bother her. ``Win or lose,'' she said, echoing a sentiment heard in
different languages at nearly every game, ``it's a party.''

Brazil makes a formal protest in contraceptive controversy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK EPSTEIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ The Brazilian government
officially condemned a German pharmaceutical firm embroiled in a
phony birth control scandal.
	   Brazil expressed its ``surprise and displeasure'' for what it
described as a ``lamentable episode'' regarding a recent communique
released by Schering AG, a German pharmaceutical firm.
	   Berlin-based Schering had accused Brazil's Health Minister Jose
Serra of using the scandal for political reasons, saying ``The
motive for his behavior is that (October) elections are near.''
	   At least 10 women in the state of Sao Paulo have said they
became pregnant after taking fake Microvlar contraceptives
manufactured by Schering, which said they were intended solely to
test out new packaging equipment.
	   The placebo pills, made of lactose and sugar, were supposed to
have been incinerated after the tests, but were stolen and sold
illegally. Some 650,000 packages, containing 21 pills each, were
manufactured. It is unclear how many packages were stolen and
distributed.
	   Schering's Brazilian subsidiary is being investigated for
possible violations of consumer protection law, including
misleading advertising and endangering the lives of consumers.
	   The investigation is expected to be completed within a month. If
found liable, Schering could have its license to produce Microvlar
suspended and may even be shut down. Health authorities have
ordered the company to cease production and sales of all its
products.
	   Moreover, the Justice Ministry has slapped the Brazilian
subsidiary with a dlrs 2.5 million fine and the Sao Paulo state
attorney's office announced Friday that it would file a civil suit
on behalf of the pregnant women.
	   Rainer Bitzer, president of Schering's Brazilian subsidiary, has
promised to contact the 10 pregnant women by next week and study
the situation on a case-by-case basis.
	   On Friday, Schering announced that Brazilian authorities had
reauthorized company production _ except for Microvlar _ but kept
the ban on all sales to distributors and pharmacies. Also on
Friday, Schering attorney Jose Carlos Dias said that police had
several suspects in custody for the theft of the placebo pills.

Brazil's road to Cup title turns uphill in semifinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout with quotes from Zagallo, edits to conform. &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LESIGNY, France (AP) _ Through five games, Brazil has looked
down on opponents as a king among commoners. The idea of losing was
always associated with the word ``upset.''
	   No more.
	   The defending champions head to the semifinals, where they will
face the Netherlands, a 2-1 winner over Argentina. And whatever the
outcome, it won't be an upset.
	   The Dutch knocked Brazil out of the World Cup in 1974 and their
attacking style is unlikely to be as generous with the lapses the
Brazilian defense that Denmark was in in its quarterfinal thriller.
	   ``Things could get complicated,'' Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo
said. ``They have a refined ball touch and great individual
players. I even picked the Netherlands as a contender to win the
title.''
	   Zagallo hopes the Dutch won't be as aggressive as Denmark, which
tested the Brazilian defense and found it wanting.
	   ``Denmark is a sniper and doesn't come to the Cup aspiring to
the title,'' he said. ``The Netherlands does. They come at you but
should be more cautious.''
	   The underdog Danes were valiant, bold and smart, but the
Brazilian defense collaborated on both Danish goals before the
four-time champs finally prevailed 3-2 Friday night.
	   And with defender Cafu suspended for the semifinal with two
yellow cards, the Brazilian back line could be more vulnerable than
ever.
	   Brazil's first lapse came just two minutes into the game. It was
slow setting up for a Danish free kick, and Brian Laudrup raced
through a confused defense and passed to Martin Jorgensen for an
easy tap-in.
	   ``I warned them about this in practice. We knew Denmark did
this. I told them to be on guard. And still it happened,'' Zagallo
said.
	   After Ronaldo set up Bebeto and Rivaldo to give Brazil a 2-1
lead, the defense helped the Danes again.
	   Roberto Carlos tried to clear a ball from his penalty area with
a spectacular scissors kick but missed. The ball landed at the feet
of a surprised Brian Laudrup, who promptly kicked it into the upper
corner for a 2-2 tie.
	   A Rivaldo solo run made it 3-2, and Zagallo reinforced his
defense in the midfield. But it didn't help much. Jorgensen and
Laudrup had near-misses, and Marc Rieper's header struck the
crossbar just before the final whistle.
	   Zagallo, drained and tense, called the game ``beautiful, frank
and open,'' but admitted the defense had nearly blown it.
	   ``The three goals erased our foolish mistakes,'' he said, before
cutting short post-game interviews.
	   Erased, but not forgotten. Brazil has shown flashes of offensive
brilliance at the feet of Ronaldo, Bebeto and Rivaldo, but defense
_ the strong point of the 1994 Cup champions _ remains its biggest
worry.
	   In Brazil's 2-1 loss to Norway, fullback Junior Baiano was badly
beaten by striker Andre Tore Flo on one goal and committed a silly
penalty to set up the second.
	   While Zagallo has demanded more offense from Roberto Carlos, his
upfield players have left big holes on the left side of the
defensive line that 32-year-old fullback Aldair has been slow to
cover.
	   Cafu will be replaced by Ze Carlos, an obscure defender from Sao
Paulo who was a last-minute replacement for Flavio Conceicao,
dropped from the team with a leg injury.
	   Zagallo says he knows how to play the Dutch.
	   ``I have everything in my head,'' he said.
	   He has until Tuesday to get it on the field.

Caribbean leaders seek help in persuading U.S. not to hurt banana
</HEADLINE>
industry &QL; 
 &UR; By GUY ELLIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ Leaders of two Caribbean
banana-producing nations hurt by U.S.-backed trade rulings are
looking for lobbying help from everyone from South African
President Nelson Mandela to Caribbean nationals living in the
United States.
	   Caribbean Community leaders who met this week with Mandela
during the organization's summit asked the South African leader to
help convince the United States not to be the ``main attacker'' of
the banana industry, Dominica Prime Minister Edison James said
Saturday.
	   The United States successfully challenged trade preferences some
small, former colonies in the Caribbean have with European
countries. Producing bananas in the Caribbean is generally more
expensive than in Latin America, where U.S. fruit corporations have
large plantations.
	   James said it was ``unfair, unreasonable and indefensible'' for
the United States to damage the banana trade on which his small
island depends.
	   ``We find ourselves having to spend a large part of our
financial resources, which we don't have, trying to defend our
livelihood,'' said James.
	   He also called on Caribbean nationals living in the United
States to lobby their representatives in Congress on the issue.
	   St. Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister James Mitchell
said he recently wrote to U.S. President Bill Clinton asking that a
new trade regime between the Caribbean and European countries be
accepted by the United States.
	   Dominica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and St. Lucia, which
hosted the summit, are the small eastern Caribbean nations most
dependent on banana exports.

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ The Dutch team to Jacco Eltingh and
Paul Haarhuis ended the five-year run of the Australian doubles
pair of Tood Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde, taking their doubles
semifinal Saturday 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-3) 5-7, 10-8.
	   The top-seeded Eltingh and Haarhuis won over the second-seeded
Australians and took the four-hour match when Woodbridge hit a
half-volley backhand into the net in the 18th game.
	   It was the third match point for the winning Dutch and the
service break was the only one of the fifth set.
	   The Australians won the last five Wimbledon titles _ tying the
championships record _ and were going for a record six. They share
the record of five straight set by Britons Reggie and Laurie
Doherty in 1897-1901.
	   In women's doubles, Martina Hingis and Jana Novotna _ Saturday's
singles champion _ reached the final with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over
Lisa Raymond of the United States and Rennae Stubbs of Australia.
	   Hingis and Novotna will face the second-seeded team of American
Lindsay Davenport and Belarussian Natasha Zvereva, who won their
semifinal Saturday 6-3, 6-0 over South African Mariaan de Swardt
and American Debbie Graham.

World Cup: Croatia leads Germans 1-0 at halftime
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Robert Jarni fired home a 25-meter shot in
the third minute of first half injury time Saturday as World Cup
debutant Croatia took a 1-0 half time lead against three-time
titlist Germany, which was down to 10-men after the expulsion of
defender Christian Woerns.
	   Jarni, who plays in Spain for Real Betis, collected a sideways
pass from Mario Stanic and drove the ball with his left foot past
German 'keeper Andreas Koepke to pile more misery on the
short-handed Germans.
	   Woerns expulsion came eight minutes earlier.
	   With the ball 40 meters from the German goal, Croatian striker
Davor Suker pushed the ball inside the defender and appeared set to
run direct for goal.
	   Woerns's tackle missed the ball and swept Suker's legs from
under him and, with the Real Madrid striker writhing on the round,
Norwegian Rune Pedersen reached to his back pocket for the red
card.
	   It looked a major blow for the Germans who had looked well in
control in the opening half.
	   Croatia's Igor Stimac and Dario Simic and Germany's Jorg
Heinrich all saw the yellow card in a seven minute period for
needless tackles that sent opponents sprawling.
	   Dietmar Hamann went close to giving the Germans the lead when
Thomas Haessler swung in a free kick from the right and the
defender's header shaved the crossbar from eight meters.
	   Croatian 'keeper Drazen Ladic made an impressive double save in
the 31st minute when Oliver Bierhoff climbed to meet another
rightwing cross. Ladic did well to block the header at the foot of
the post and, with Juergen Klinsmann swooping in to try and force
home the rebound, the 'keeper reacted quickly to kick the ball to
safety.
	   Lineups:
	   Germany _ Andreas Koepke; Lothar Matthaeus, Juergen Kohler,
Christian Woerns; Joerg Heinrich, Thomas Haessler, Jens Jeremies,
Dietmar Hamann, Michael Tarnat; Juergen Klinsmann, Oliver Bierhoff.
	   Croatia _ Drazen Ladic; Igor Stimac, Slaven Bilic, Dario Simic,
Robert Jarni; Zvonimir Soldo, Aljosa Asanovic, Zvonimir Boban,
Mario Stanic; Davor Suker, Goran Vlaovic.
	   Referee _ Rune Pedersen, Norway.

<SLUG> No tears for Novotna, Wimbledon champion at last </SLUG>
<HEADLINE>
AP Tennis Writer

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout, adds new byline &QL; 
 &UR; By STEVE WILSTEIN &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ The Duchess of Kent warmly clasped
Jana Novotna's hands, and this time there were no tears, no need
for consoling words, no mention of the day's jittery moments
bringing back memories of two final fiascoes.
	   This time Novotna's blue eyes sparkled as brightly as
Wimbledon's silver championship trophy, and the duchess gently
teased her, saying: ``What was the big thing?''
	   Winning Wimbledon at last Saturday was only the biggest thing in
Novotna's life, a 6-4, 7-6 (7-2) victory over France's Nathalie
Tauziat that gave the 29-year-old from the Czech Republic her first
Grand Slam title on the court of her most traumatic losses.
	   Novotna tenderly caressed the giant silver salver, kissed it
over and over, and leaned her cheek on it as if it were a pillow
she didn't want to let go.
	   ``This is what I have been working for,'' she said, ``for many,
many years.''
	   Novotna dedicated her victory to Hana Mandlikova, the coach and
friend who has been with her for nine years.
	   ``Without her, I would never have made this championship,''
Novotna said.
	   ``If she doesn't win another match, it doesn't matter,'' said
Mandlikova, a former tennis star who never won Wimbledon on her
own, but who always believed in Novotna.
	   No one could watch Novotna's performance without remembering how
she dampened the duchess' white suit with sobs in 1993 after
choking up and whacking the wildest of shots with a 4-1 lead in the
third set of the final against Steffi Graf.
	   Just as fresh in memory was Novotna's loss a year ago after
leading Martina Hingis by a set and a break. Suddenly Novotna could
do nothing right, and Hingis could do nothing wrong.
	   The duchess told Novotna then that she would be ``third time
lucky'' if she returned to the final.
	   ``You were absolutely right,'' Novotna told her as they stood
again holding hands at the award ceremony on Centre Court.
	   Novotna reached the final this time determined to rewrite her
legacy, to put away the failures and excuses and move beyond being
called, derisively, the best woman player never to win a major. The
$620,000 winner's prize and the No. 2 ranking she would achieve
meant little compared with the feeling of being called, forever,
Wimbledon champion.
	   And the fans, touched by her vulnerability and the manner in
which she breached royal protocol by crying on the duchess'
shoulder, came to cheer Novotna and share with her the moment of
her triumph.
	   ``She has always felt the warmth that the people here have for
her after 1993,'' Mandlikova said. ``They took her to their hearts
because she showed she was human. Now Jana talks the whole year
about coming back to Wimbledon.''
	   Yet when the match began on a bleak, chilly day, Novotna
promptly double faulted her first serve, then double faulted again
in falling behind 0-2. A nervous murmur coursed through the crowd
as if everyone were thinking the same thing: ``Here we go again.''
	   Novotna had trouble controlling her serve throughout the match _
she double faulted seven times _ but she played with a resolve that
never wavered.
	   ``I was really tense from the beginning all the way until the
end,'' Novotna said. ``I said to myself, `This is wonderful. How do
you think you're going to win this championship without your
serve?'''
	   She broke back against the 30-year-old Tauziat _ at No. 16 the
lowest seeded finalist in history _ in the second game by taking
charge at the net and forcing Tauziat into errors.
	   Then with the match tied 3-3, Novotna proved just how tough she
would be when she pushed Tauziat to seven break points before
putting her away with an overhead smash for a 4-3 lead.
	   When Novotna reached set point with a diving forehand volley
crosscourt that epitomized her athleticism, she hopped up and down
and pumped her fist as the crowd roared. Significantly, she didn't
celebrate when she actually clinched the set on the next point on a
netted return by Tauziat. Instead, Novotna breathed deeply, sighing
in relief and preparing to finish the job.
	   Novotna went right at it in the second set, breaking Tauziat in
the opening game with two volleys, a backhand pass and a backhand
return as she showed off the full repertoire of her shots. But when
Novotna clanked a serve off the frame on a second straight double
fault in the next game, some fans started to laugh nervously. All
anyone could think about was the same kind of shot against Graf
five years ago.
	   Novotna managed to get out of this predicament, despite yet
another double fault, but she seemed far from comfortable.
	   And Tauziat, trailing 0-2, was far from finished. Revealing a
solid, if unspectacular all-court style, and a grim resolve to go
down fighting in her first Grand Slam final, Tauziat yielded only
three points in her next two service games, then broke Novotna to
even the set at 3-3.
	   The crowd groaned when Novotna double faulted at break point in
that sixth game, and the feeling once more swept through the
stadium that perhaps Novotna would find a way to lose. But she
briefly ended that thought by breaking back on a fine passing
volley to take a 4-3 lead.
	   Novotna held to 5-3, and after Tauziat held as well, Novotna
served for the match at 5-4. The crowd roared again for Novotna,
eager to see her close it out, but still there was the suspicion
that she could find a way to capitulate. And so she did.
	   With the match in her grasp, Novotna clubbed an easy volley into
the tape, made three other errors and finally lost the game when
Tauziat drilled a volley winner.
	   The crowd moaned most audibly now, fearful of witnessing another
collapse, but Novotna regained her poise. She served confidently to
push the set to a tiebreaker, and won it easily by taking the last
five points, the final one on a crisp forehand return down the line
that Tauziat couldn't touch.
	   Novotna slowly fell to both knees, tears welling in her eyes,
before she hugged Tauziat, who won $310,000, and charged into the
stands to embrace her mother, Liba, Mandlikova, and other friends.
	   Novotna's mother had not come to Wimbledon for the two previous
finals, and Novotna wasn't sure she wanted her to fly over this
time from the Czech Republic.
	   ``I always said I didn't want anybody to come, I don't want to
be disturbed, I want to stick to the routine,'' Novotna said.
``This time I said, `Whatever. It didn't work twice, Mom, come
over.' She came over last night. I guess she brought me luck, and
I'm very happy that she was part of this occasion.''

	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ The Dutch team to Jacco Eltingh and
Paul Haarhuis ended the five-year run of the Australian doubles
pair of Tood Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde, taking their doubles
final Saturday 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-3) 5-7, 10-8.
	   The top-seeded Eltingh and Haarhuis won over the second-seeded
Australians and took the four-hour match when Woodbridge hit a
half-volley backhand into the net in the 18th game.
	   It was the third match point for the winning Dutch and the
service break was the only one of the fifth set.
	   The Australians won the last five Wimbledon titles _ tying the
championships record _ and were going for a record six. They share
the record of five straight set by Britons Reggie and Laurie
Doherty in 1897-1901.
	   In women's doubles, Martina Hingis and Jana Novotna _ Saturday's
singles champion _ reached the final with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over
Lisa Raymond of the United States and Rennae Stubbs of Australia.
	   Hingis and Novotna will face the second-seeded team of American
Lindsay Davenport and Belarussian Natasha Zvereva, who won their
semifinal Saturday 6-3, 6-0 over South African Mariaan de Swardt
and American Debbie Graham.

	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ The leader of Montserrat, the small
Caribbean island devastated by a volcano, is putting out the help
wanted sign.
	   Chief Minister David Brandt said there are 200 vacancies in the
island's civil service alone, as most of the population has left
and the country is about to begin a three-year, dlrs 124 million
(75 million British pounds) recovery plan with help from the
British government.
	   Brandt also praised Britain for coming to the aid of its small,
Carribean island.
	   ``Let me say that I have criticized them in the past and I will
do so again when the situation warrants it,'' Brandt said. ``But at
this time I would like to express my gratitude for the assistance
they have given and for their commitment of the 75 million pounds
(dlrs 124 million).''
	   Most residents have left Montserrat since the Soufriere Hills
volcano became active three years ago, leaving most of the
39-square-mile (101-square-kilometer) island uninhabitable and
buried under mountains of ash.
	   The British-backed recovery plan includes the construction of
new housing on the safe, northern side of the island, which was
sparsely inhabited prior to the volcanic eruptions. But Montserrat
lacks personnel, in some cases, to begin the recovery.
	   ``We advertised for an attorney general,'' said Brandt. ``We
were hoping that Caribbean citizens would have applied, but instead
we had to accept an attorney general from the United Kingdom who
was the only one to apply.''
	   The island lacks surveyors, for example, to begin the
construction of at least 150 new homes, Brandt said. Montserrat now
allows residents of other Caribbean Community nations to work on
the island without getting a special permit.

	   Rodrigues, known affectionately here as ``Maguila,'' was once

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Efforts were under way to reach a
``practical, fair and reasonable'' formula to restart negotiations
to unite Cyprus, a U.N. envoy said Saturday.
	   Diego Cordovez said both the U.N. Security Council and
Secretary-General Kofi Annan were deeply concerned about the
situation in Cyprus and wanted to see talks resume on ending the
partition of the war-divided eastern Mediterranean island.
	   Cordovez told a news conference that he planned to return in
September to give Greek Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash time to think about his
proposals to resume direct talks, which broke down last year.
	   He declined to elaborate on his proposals, saying only: ``I am
going today but hope that when I come back there will be be a
process started.''
	   Tensions rose dangerously two weeks ago when Greece and Turkey,
NATO partners and traditional rivals, sent warplanes to Cyprus in a
show of force that threatened to erupt in hostilities.
	   Cyprus has been unofficially divided into a Turkish Cypriot
north and a Greek Cypriot south since Turkey invaded the island in
1974 following an abortive coup in Nicosia by supporters of union
with Greece. The island's Greek and Turkish communities have since
lived apart, separated by a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone.
	   Cordovez, a former Ecuadoran foreign minister, arrived Thursday
in Cyprus and held two rounds of separate talks with Clerides and
Denktash.
	   Cypriot officials had said his mission was not expected to make
any headway in breaking the deadlock.
	   ``We need a formula that will be practical, fair and reasonable
to both sides,'' Cordovez said. ``I am very much satisfied with the
progress we have made.''
	   Cordovez reports Monday to the U.N. Security Council.
	   Repeated efforts to solve the Cyprus problem have failed.
	   Denktash insists he will not resume talks until his breakaway
state, declared in 1983 in the Turkish-held north, is recognized.
He also wants the Clerides government, the island's internationally
recognized administration, to abandon its bid to join the European
Union.
	   Both conditions have been rejected by the Greek Cypriots.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Out-of-control brush fires driven by
gusting winds and high temperatures Saturday killed at least one
person, burnt dozens of houses and forced hundreds of people to
evacuate their homes.
	   A 67-year-old woman in Salamina died after being hospitalized
for smoke inhalation.
	   At least five more people were hospitalized, including two
soldiers who were trying to move weapons out of the path of a fire
at Avlona, the nation's largest army base, about 25 kilometers (16
miles) north of Athens.
	   Officials attributed the rash of wildfires to the sudden fierce
winds, high temperatures and dry land.
	   Premier Costas Simitis, touring a central Greek region struck by
15 fires, called an emergency meeting of top public safety
officials. ``I have given an order for the army and firefighters to
go anywhere they are needed,'' he said.
	   A week-long heat wave that had pushed temperatures as high as 45
degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) and killed four people set
the stage for Sunday afternoon's outbreak of fires.
	   Army personnel and fire-fighting planes joined the effort to
combat fires raging out of control in virtually every part of the
country. Officials said they could not count the number of blazes.
	   There was no official tally of houses burnt and people
evacuated.
	   Burning brush from suburbs north of Athens sent a thick black
cloud over the capital, making it difficult to breathe. Fire
fighters struggled to prevent fires from spreading into more
densely populated suburbs closer to the city.
	   The government set up temporary shelters for children from areas
that had already burned or were threatened by brush fires.
	   The highway linking Athens to northern Greece was closed off in
at least three places.
	   Homes were evacuated in dozens of villages, including suburbs
north of Athens and west of the port city of Piraeus.
	   Over-extended fire fighting forces couldn't reach every front,
and residents tried to beat out flames using branches, rocks and
blankets.
	   Weather forecasters predicted a slight drop in temperature but
said that strong winds would continue fanning flames through
Sunday.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Jubilant soccer fans trickled out
of bars and took their celebrations to the streets following the
Netherlands' 2-1 victory over Argentina in Saturday's World Cup
quarterfinal match.
	   Streets that were deserted during the match were immediately
filled with giddy fans celebrating their team's big win.
	   Careening down the streets in their cars, fans honked their
horns and screamed their traditional soccer victory song.
	   Even tram conductors chimed in with their bells.
	   Although some Dutch fans are prone to violence, there were no
reports of trouble in the capital city, said Amsterdam police
spokesman Klaas Wilting.
	   But in the port city of Rotterdam, extra police officers were
called in after a group of rowdy fans started to throw beer glasses
at police.
	   A handful of revelers were also arrested for making the Nazi
salute, reported Dutch television.
	   ``This is, pvs 6th graf.

	   LYON, France (AP) _ World Cup rookie Croatia produced one of the
biggest upsets in soccer history Saturday when it ousted three-time
titlist Germany 3-0 to reach the semifinal.
	   Robert Jarni fired home a 25-meter (yard) shot in the third
minute of first half injury time eight minutes after German
defender Christian Worns had been expelled for hauling down
Croatian striker Davor Suker.
	   Goran Vlaovic drove a 20-meter shot past Andreas Koepke 10
minutes from the end and Suker netted the third in the 85th minute
as Croatia became the first debutant since Portugal in 1966 to make
the semifinal.
	   It also was a second quarterfinal defeat in a row for the
Germans. In 1994 they were ousted by Bulgaria.

	   What made it even more historic for Croatia, which only came
about after the splitting of Yugoslavia seven years ago, was that
this was its first attempt to qualify. And it reached the last four
by beating a soccer giant which also was a three-time losing
finalist.
	   Jarni, who plays in Spain for Real Betis, collected a sideways
pass from Mario Stanic and drove the ball with his left foot past
Koepke to pile more misery on the short-handed Germans.
	   Woerns expulsion came eight minutes earlier.
	   With the ball 40 meters from the German goal, Suker pushed the
ball inside the defender and appeared set to run direct for goal.
	   Woerns' tackle missed the ball and swept Suker's legs from under
him and, with the Real Madrid striker writhing on the round,
Norwegian referee Rune Pedersen reached to his back pocket for the
red card.
	   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is regarded as a lucky fan as
he has not seen the German team lose since 1986, was in the crowd
at the Stade de Gerland to witness one of its lowest moments.
	   Thomas Haessler made an ambitious attempt to put the Germans
ahead when Croatian goalkeeper Drazen Ladic miskicked a clearance
straight to him. The Karlsruhe midfielder saw Ladic momentarily
away from his goal and decided to shoot first time from 45 meters
but the ball curled wide.
	   Croatia's Igor Stimac and Dario Simic and Germany's Jorg
Heinrich all saw the yellow card in a seven-minute period early in
the game for needless tackles that sent opponents sprawling.
	   Dietmar Hamann went close to giving the Germans the lead when
Thomas Haessler swung in a free kick from the right and the
defender's header shaved the crossbar from eight meters.
	   Croatian 'keeper Drazen Ladic made an impressive double save in
the 31st minute when Oliver Bierhoff climbed to meet another
rightwing cross. Ladic did well to block the header at the foot of
the post and, with Juergen Klinsmann swooping in to try and force
home the rebound, the 'keeper reacted quickly to kick the ball to
safety.
	   Woerns dismissal and Jarni's goal stung the Germans who needed
to produce another of their amazing comebacks. Against Yugoslavia,
they hit back from 2-0 down to force a 2-2 tie and ousted the
Mexicans 2-1 after trailing with 15 minutes to go.
	   The Germans almost tied it up five minutes into the second half
when a leftwing corner flew to Bierhoff at the far post and his
first-time hip-high volley from no more than six meters was blocked
by Ladic on his line.
	   Then Stanic fired a low center into the German box from the
right and Suker turned it wide of the near post with Koepke beaten.
	   An acrobatic save by Koepke, palming over a 20-meter drive by
Zvonimir Boban in the 67th minute, kept his team in contention.
Then Goran Vlaovic fired high and wide from the edge of the area
after a swift break from defense.
	   Twelve minutes from the end, German midfielder Michael Tarnat
fired a low, 25-meter shot from a free kick which took a deflection
and hit the outside of the Croatian post.
	   A minute later it was all over for the Germans.
	   With the German defense retreating, Vlaovic moved into a
shooting position on the edge of the area and fired a low drive
that flew past Koepke and just inside his right hand post.
	   With the Germans committed to attack, they left huge gaps at the
back and Suker easily got round a defender with five minutes to go
to fire a low, close range shot under Koepke for the third.
	   Lineups:
	   Germany _ Andreas Koepke; Lothar Matthaeus, Juergen Kohler,
Christian Woerns; Joerg Heinrich, Thomas Haessler (Ulf Kirsten,
69th), Jens Jeremies, Dietmar Hamann (Olaf Marschall, 79th),
Michael Tarnat; Juergen Klinsmann, Oliver Bierhoff.
	   Croatia _ Drazen Ladic; Igor Stimac, Slaven Bilic, Dario Simic,
Robert Jarni; Zvonimir Soldo, Aljosa Asanovic, Zvonimir Boban,
Mario Stanic; Davor Suker, Goran Vlaovic (Zoran Mamic, 83rd).

Anglican leader criticizes Diana museum and public adulation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Archbishop of York has criticized the museum
dedicated to Princess Diana which her brother opened on July 1.
	   ``It's the last thing she would have wanted,'' Archbishop David
Hope was quoted as saying in an interview with The Sunday Times.
The Archbishop of York is effectly the second-ranking leader of the
Church of England.
	   The museum, opened by Earl Spencer on the estate where Diana
grew up, includes home movies, her wedding gown and some of her
high-fashion dresses.
	   ``Her museum would be people _ lives changed, wounds healed,
bodies remodeled and remade,'' The Sunday Times quoted Hope as
saying.
	   ``That is what she would have wanted. She would be saying to
people, 'Don't think about me, rather think about the causes I
tried to effect to make the world a better place.'''
	   Hope said he was concerned by some of the continuing adulation
of Diana.
	   ``We should be careful that she is not worshipped. That worship
should be directed to the God who created her,'' Hope said.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Out-of-control brush fires driven by
gusting winds and high temperatures Saturday killed at least one
person, burnt dozens of houses and forced hundreds of Greeks to
evacuate their homes.
	   A 67-year-old woman in Salamina died after being hospitalized
for smoke inhalation.
	   At least five more people were hospitalized, including two
soldiers who were trying to move weapons out of the path of a fire
at Avlona, the nation's largest army base, about 25 kilometers (16
miles) north of Athens.
	   Officials attributed the rash of wildfires to sudden fierce
winds, high temperatures and dry land.
	   Premier Costas Simitis, touring a central Greek region struck by
15 fires, called an emergency meeting of top public safety
officials.
	   A week-long heat wave that had pushed temperatures as high as 45
degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) and killed four people set
the stage for Sunday afternoon's outbreak of fires.
	   There was no official tally of houses burnt and people
evacuated.
	   Weather forecasters predicted a slight drop in temperature but
said the strong winds would continue fanning flames through Sunday.

World Cup: Croatia upsets Germany 3-0

1954 &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ World Cup rookie Croatia produced one of the
biggest upsets in soccer history Saturday when it ousted three-time
titlist Germany 3-0 to reach the semifinal.
	   Robert Jarni fired home a 25-meter (yard) shot in the third
minute of first half injury time eight minutes after German
defender Christian Woerns had been expelled for hauling down
Croatian striker Davor Suker.
	   Goran Vlaovic drove a 20-meter shot past 'keeper Andreas Koepke
10 minutes from the end and Suker netted the third in the 85th
minute as Croatia became the first debutant since Portugal in 1966
to make the semifinal.
	   It also was Germany's heaviest loss since an 8-3 defeat by
Hungary in the 1954 World Cup and a second quarterfinal defeat in a
row. In 1994 the Germans were ousted by Bulgaria.
	   What made it even more historic for Croatia, which only came
about after the splitting of Yugoslavia seven years ago, was that
this was its first attempt to qualify. And it reached the last four
by beating a soccer giant which also was a three-time losing
finalist.
	   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is regarded as a lucky fan as
he has not seen the German team lose since 1986, was in the crowd
at the Stade de Gerland to witness what turned out to be one of its
lowest moments.
	   ``I didn't the sending off was fair,'' said German defender
Juergen Kohler.
	   ``I think you could say that the referee lost us the game. But
we never gave up and we gave it all we could. There was at the most
just one goal in it.
	   ``It's very sad to lose and this is the end for us,'' Kohler
said. It's a great shame because I don't think it was fair to lose
in this way.''
	   Dietmar Hamann went close to giving the Germans the lead when
Thomas Haessler swung in a free kick from the right and the
defender's header shaved the crossbar from eight meters.
	   Croatian 'keeper Drazen Ladic made an impressive double save in
the 31st minute when Oliver Bierhoff climbed to meet another
rightwing cross. Ladic did well to block the header at the foot of
the post and, with Juergen Klinsmann swooping in to try and force
home the rebound, the 'keeper reacted quickly to kick the ball to
safety.
	   Woerns expulsion came eight minutes before half time.
	   With the ball 40 meters from the German goal, Suker pushed the
ball inside the defender and appeared set to run direct for goal.
	   Woerns' tackle missed the ball and swept Suker's legs from under
him and, with the Real Madrid striker writhing on the round,
Norwegian referee Rune Pedersen reached to his back pocket for the
red card.
	   It looked worse for the Germans when the Croatians went ahead.
	   Jarni, who plays in Spain for Real Betis, collected a sideways
pass from Mario Stanic and drove the ball with his left foot past
Koepke to pile more misery on the short-handed Germans.
	   Woerns dismissal and Jarni's goal stung the Germans who needed
to produce another of their amazing comebacks. Against Yugoslavia,
they hit back from 2-0 down to force a 2-2 tie and ousted the
Mexicans 2-1 after trailing with 15 minutes to go.
	   The Germans almost tied it up five minutes into the second half
when a leftwing corner flew to Bierhoff at the far post and his
first-time hip-high volley from no more than six meters was blocked
by Ladic on his line.
	   Then Stanic fired a low center into the German box from the
right and Suker turned it wide of the near post with Koepke beaten.
	   An acrobatic save by Koepke, palming over a 20-meter drive by
Zvonimir Boban in the 67th minute, kept his team in contention.
Then Goran Vlaovic fired high and wide from the edge of the area
after a swift break from defense.
	   Twelve minutes from the end, German midfielder Michael Tarnat
fired a low, 25-meter shot from a free kick which took a deflection
and hit the outside of the Croatian post.
	   A minute later it was all over for the Germans.
	   With the German defense retreating, Vlaovic moved into a
shooting position on the edge of the area and fired a low drive
that flew past Koepke and just inside his right hand post.
	   With the Germans committed to attack, they left huge gaps at the
back and Suker easily got round a defender with five minutes to go
to fire a low, close range shot under Koepke for the third.
	   Lineups:
	   Germany _ Andreas Koepke; Lothar Matthaeus, Juergen Kohler,
Christian Woerns; Joerg Heinrich, Thomas Haessler (Ulf Kirsten,
69th), Jens Jeremies, Dietmar Hamann (Olaf Marschall, 79th),
Michael Tarnat; Juergen Klinsmann, Oliver Bierhoff.
	   Croatia _ Drazen Ladic; Igor Stimac, Slaven Bilic, Dario Simic,
Robert Jarni; Zvonimir Soldo, Aljosa Asanovic, Zvonimir Boban,
Mario Stanic; Davor Suker, Goran Vlaovic (Zoran Mamic, 83rd).

Holbrooke presses ahead with peace efforts

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ On a seemingly impossible mission,
U.S. mediator Richard Holbrooke sought common ground on Saturday
between the president of Yugoslavia and ethnic Albanian leaders on
ending Kosovo's violence.
	   As Holbrooke shuttled between Belgrade and Pristina, a guerrilla
spokesman dented U.S. hopes of getting Kosovo's Albanian fighters
and politicians to speak with one voice in their struggle for
independence.
	   The German news magazine Spiegel quoted a Kosovo Liberation Army
spokesman Jakub Krasniqi as saying the KLA would never take orders
from the main political leader, Ibrahim Rugova, because his
peaceful secession efforts had failed.
	   Ethnic Albanian separatists want independence for Kosovo, a
province in southern Serbia where they outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
Serbia is the larger of the two republics remaining in Yugoslavia.
Hundreds of people have died in Kosovo since Serb forces stepped up
efforts to crush militant resistance in February. Serbs consider
Kosovo the cradle of their culture.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic says the crackdown is
aimed at ethnic Albanian terrorists who have targeted Serb police
in their fight for independence.
	   Holbrooke held talks with Rugova and his more radical rival,
Adem Demaci, in the provincial capital, Pristina. The United States
has urged the KLA to recognize Rugova as the head of a joint
delegation if negotiations can be started.
	   Holbrooke said he was focusing on ways to help the ethnic
Albanian leaders organize themselves. He shuttled between two
different venues just 300 meters (yards) apart to meet separately
with the Rugova and Demaci camps.
	   Among the issues to be addressed was the role of the KLA, which
the Serbs consider a terrorist organization but which has been
gaining support in Kosovo at the expense of Rugova, who opposes
violence.
	   Asked Saturday if the KLA should be included in talks, Holbrooke
said Washington wanted ``everybody who has a legitimate role in the
destiny of Kosovo'' to have a place in the negotiations. ``But how
that works out remains to be seen,'' he said.
	   Holbrooke also met in Pristina with members of the Albanian
Democratic Movement, which split away from Rugova with ambitions of
becoming the KLA's political wing. No details were available.
	   Departing for Belgrade afterward, Holbrooke said the various
Albanian factions agreed on some points but ``a wide range of
opinions'' continued to exist on other issues. He did not
elaborate.
	   Before talks with Milosevic, Holbrooke first met with Russian
Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky, also in Belgrade,
capital of both Serbia and Yugoslavia. Afanasyevsky met with
Milosevic earlier in the day.
	   Afterward, both the Russian and the American announced
separately that they would travel jointly on Sunday to Pristina,
for talks with Albanian leaders.
	   Underlining Russian-U.S. differences on the role of the KLA,
Afansyevsky told reporters that there was no grounds to negotiate
with armed radicals who ``kill citizens who are loyal to Serbia.''

Winds add another obstacle at Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Pak and Neumann tied at 2-under at turn and only
golfers below par with more than half of field finished; Will be
updated with finishers &QL; 
 &UR; By ARNIE STAPLETON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KOHLER, Wisconsin (AP) _ Just what the beleaguered field in the
U.S. Women's Open needed, wicked wind.
	   Already succumbing to the unforgiving Blackwolf Run Golf Course,
the field had to fight swirling wind whipping off Lake Michigan on
Saturday.
	   Overnight rain drenched the course, softening the fast greens,
but that didn't help as much as Liselotte Neumann had hoped.
	   As storm clouds gathered Friday night, Neumann, one stroke off
the lead, said rain would be a godsend for the third round.
	   ``Yes, please. That would be nice,'' she said. ``I think
everybody would definitely be able to be a little bit more
aggressive. And, I think it would definitely help the scores for
sure.''
	   Instead, scores soared Saturday, thanks to the gusts coming off
the lake.
	   After the 36-hole cut was determined Saturday morning _ darkness
halted play Friday night with 21 golfers still on the course _ only
two players were under par halfway through the biggest event in
women's golf: Neumann and Se Ri Pak. The 20-year-old South Korean,
who won the McDonald's LPGA Championship in May, was the leader at
3-under 139, followed by Neumann, winner of the 1988 Open.
	   At the turn Saturday, Pak and Neumann were tied at 2-under and
remained the only golfers below par with more than half the field
already in.
	   Annika Sorenstam, the 1995 and '96 Open winner who began the day
seven strokes back, saw her chances of winning a third title in
four years sink with a quintuple-bogey on the 402-yard (meter),
par-4 third hole.
	   After adding a bogey on No. 6, a double-bogey on 7 and a bogey
on 8, she played the back nine in 1-under to finish the day 8-over
and the third round 12-over at 225.
	   The wind didn't bother Brandie Burton on No. 13, however, as she
aced the 142-yard (meter) hole. It was the third straight day that
there was a hole-in-one in the Open, a record.
	   Helen Alfredsson aced the 152-yard (meter) eighth hole Thursday
and Clarissa Childs did the same Friday.
	   Amy Geithner and Julie Stanger had holes-in-one in 1981 at
LaGrange, Ill., and Pat Bradley and Jane Lock did it two years
later in Tulsa, Okla.
	   Just two of the first 36 golfers to complete the third round
shot in the low 70s on the par-71 layout Saturday.
	   Karrie Webb was 3-under for the day after 13 holes but slipped
as the wind picked up, gathering three bogeys and a double bogey on
the final five holes for a 73 and 222.
	   ``It was pretty windy all over,'' Webb said. ``I play well in
the wind a lot, but it was really windy today, and we don't play on
courses this long.''
	   The 6,412-yard (meter) layout, second-longest in the
53-year-history of the Open, has proven so merciless that several
golfers predicted nobody would master the Pete Dye-designed course.
	   ``I think level par will win,'' said 1987 winner Laura Davies,
who began the day four strokes off the lead.
	   High scores, a nearly hour-long lightning delay and even a deer
crossing the 17th green _ ``Obviously, he wasn't wearing spikes,''
cracked Hollis Stacy _ contributed to slow play in Round 2.
	   Two golfers who had to return to complete their second rounds
Saturday morning made the cut of 62 golfers: Isabelle Blais, an
amateur who plays for the University of Oklahoma, and Anna
Acker-Macosko.
	   ``The conditions were very hard this morning,'' Blais said. ``It
was difficult with the cold and the wind. But I'm used to that in
Oklahoma.''
	   Pak is seeking to become the first rookie to win two majors
since Juli Inkster won the Nabisco Dinah Shore and du Maurier Ltd.
Classic in 1984.
	   The last women to win consecutive majors was Meg Mallon in 1991.
Davies is the last to win two majors in a year, the du Maurier and
the LPGA Championship in 1996.
	   Davies liked Pak's chances.
	   ``She has got nothing to lose,'' Davies said. ``She is 20. She
is going to play in 20 more Opens. Probably the rest of us are
counting down how many more Opens we are going to play. If it
doesn't work out for her this time _ that is the way I used to
think when I came out here and started playing _ then she will win
it next year, and so on and so forth.
	   ``So, I think she will be very tough to beat. I think the course
is the thing that will keep her from going too far under par. If
you are one shot ahead of her, you will probably be holding the
trophy.''

	   ``We always believed we could win. Like our coach says, we are
the best in the world. After the expulsion, everything went our
way.''
	   It also was Germany's heaviest loss since an 8-3 defeat by
Hungary in the 1954 World Cup and a second quarterfinal defeat in a
row. In 1994 the Germans were ousted by Bulgaria. Never before had
Germany lost two World Cup quarterfinals in a row.
	   The last time Germany lost by three goals was in October 1986,
4-1 in a friendly against Austria.
	   What made it even more historic for Croatia, which only came

Late Bergkamp winner puts Netherlands in semifinal against Brazil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Croatia beating Germany. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Croatia made World Cup history with a 3-0 victory
over three-time titlist Germany Saturday, reaching the semifinals
on its first attempt.
	   Qualifying for the first time in its short history, the
Croatians, who broke away from Yugoslavia in 1991 and was
recognized by FIFA a year later, will now meet host France on
Wednesday in Saint-Denis for a place in the June 12 final.
	   The other semifinal on Tuesday in Marseille will be between
defending titlist Brazil and the Netherlands, who downed two-time
titlist Argentina 2-1 on a goal by Dennis Bergkamp 32 seconds from
the end in Marseille.
	   Croatia's achievement is all the more remarkable because it had
to face one of the toughest teams of all.
	   Germany has not only won the World Cup three times, it is a
three-time losing finalist and beat the Croatians on the way to
becoming European champion in 1996.
	   Robert Jarni scred from 25 meters (yard) in the third minute of
first-half injury time, eight minutes after German defender
Christian Woerns had been expelled for hauling down Croatian
striker Davor Suker.
	   Goran Vlaovic drove a 20-meter shot past keeper Andreas Koepke
10 minutes from the end and Suker added the third in the 85th
minute. Croatia became the first debutante since Portugal in 1966
to make the semifinals although that wasn't the Portuguese's first
attempt at qualifying.
	   ``This is not the end, we are going all the way,'' Croatian
goalkeeper Drazen Ladic said. ``We always believed we could win.
Like our coach says, we are the best in the world. After the
expulsion, everything went our way.''
	   It also was Germany's heaviest loss since an 8-3 defeat by
Hungary in the 1954 World Cup and a second quarterfinal defeat in a
row. In 1994, the Germans were ousted by Bulgaria.
	   ``I didn't the sending off was fair,'' German defender Juergen
Kohler said.
	   ``I think you could say that the referee lost us the game. But
we never gave up and we gave it all we could. There was at the most
just one goal in it.
	   ``It's very sad to lose and this is the end for us,'' Kohler
said. It's a great shame because I don't think it was fair to lose
in this way.''
	   A sending off also had a dramatic effect to the game in
Marseille.
	   Bergkamp's 90th-minute goal came two minutes after Argentina's
talented forward, Ariel Ortega, had been red-carded for headbutting
Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar.
	   That made it 10-on-10 after the Dutch had lost defender Arthur
Numan 12 minutes from the end. He was expelled for a second yellow
card with the score tied at 1-1.
	   Patrick Kluivert, back after a two-game suspension, put the
Dutch ahead in the 12th minute and Carlos Lopez replied for the
two-time champion six minutes later.
	   Gabriel Batitusta, who entered with five goals and was bidding
to move to the top of the scorers' list by himself, hit the post
and so did Ortega. Dutch midfielder Wim Jonk also struck the
upright.
	   ``It was a match that had everything,'' Bergkamp said. ``Just at
the right moment we got a lift because of Ortega's red card. Now
it's Brazil. Let them come.''
	   Going into the semifinal against the Netherlands, four
Brazilians have their own goalscoring race going on. Rivaldo,
Bebeto, Ronaldo and Cesar Sampaio are all on three goals. Brazil's
only other was an own goal by Scotland's Tommy Boyd in the opening
game.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ On a seemingly impossible mission,
U.S. mediator Richard Holbrooke sought common ground on Saturday
between the president of Yugoslavia and ethnic Albanian leaders on
ending Kosovo's violence.
	   As Holbrooke shuttled between Belgrade and Pristina, a guerrilla
spokesman dented U.S. hopes of getting Kosovo's ethnic Albanian
fighters and politicians to speak with one voice in their struggle
for independence.
	   The German news magazine Spiegel quoted a Kosovo Liberation Army
spokesman, Jakub Krasniqi, as saying that the KLA would never take
orders from the main political leader, Ibrahim Rugova, because his
peaceful secession efforts had failed.
	   Ethnic Albanian separatists want independence for Kosovo, a
province in southern Serbia where they outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
Serbia is the larger of the two republics remaining in Yugoslavia.
Hundreds of people have died in Kosovo since Serb forces stepped up
efforts to crush militant resistance in February. Serbs consider
Kosovo the cradle of their culture.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic says the crackdown is
aimed at ethnic Albanian terrorists who have targeted Serb police
in their fight for independence.
	   Holbrooke is pressing for a cease-fire before trying to get
Milosevic to withdraw his forces. But he and other Western
officials are insistent that Kosovo should not be allowed
independence.
	   That may not satisfy even the moderate ethnic Albanian leaders
on whom Washington had pinned hopes for a negotiated settlement.
	   Holbrooke held talks with Rugova and his more radical rival,
Adem Demaci, in the provincial capital, Pristina. The United States
has urged the KLA to recognize Rugova as the head of a joint
delegation if negotiations can be started.
	   Holbrooke said he was focusing on ways to help the ethnic
Albanian leaders organize themselves. He shuttled between two
different venues just 300 meters (yards) apart to meet separately
with the Rugova and Demaci camps.
	   Earlier, Holbrooke described Rugova as ``the main leader'' of
the province's ethnic Albanian majority, but Demaci also has
considerable popular support.
	   Among the issues to be addressed was the role of the KLA, which
the Serbs consider a terrorist organization but which has been
gaining support in Kosovo at the expense of Rugova, who opposes
violence.
	   Asked Saturday if the KLA should be included in talks, Holbrooke
said Washington wanted ``everybody who has a legitimate role in the
destiny of Kosovo'' to have a place in the negotiations. ``But how
that works out remains to be seen,'' he said.
	   Holbrooke also met in Pristina with members of the Albanian
Democratic Movement, which split from Rugova with ambitions of
becoming the KLA's political wing. No details were available.
	   Departing for Belgrade afterward, Holbrooke said the various
ethnic Albanian factions agreed on some points but ``a wide range
of opinions'' continued to exist on other issues. He did not
elaborate. Members of his party said Holbrooke would return to
Pristina early Sunday.
	   Before talks with Milosevic, Holbrooke met with Russian Deputy
Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky, also in Belgrade, capital of
both Serbia and Yugoslavia. Afanasyevsky met with Milosevic earlier
in the day.
	   Afterward, both the Russian and the American announced
separately that they would travel jointly on Sunday to Pristina,
for talks with Albanian leaders.
	   Underlining Russian-U.S. differences on the role of the KLA,
Afansyevsky told reporters that there was no grounds to negotiate
with armed radicals who ``kill citizens who are loyal to Serbia.''

World Cup: Croatia upsets Germany 3-0

 &UR; Eds: Optional, UPDATES with more quotes, recasts &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Oliver Bierhoff lost his golden touch and
the aging German team ran out of comebacks. Croatia stormed into
the semifinals of the world Cup with a stunning 3-0 victory over
the three-time champion, one of the biggest upsets in soccer
history.
	   Left with 10 men when its best defender Christian Woerns was
sent off in the 40th minute, Germany's game collapsed against a
team playing in its first World Cup finals.
	   ``It's a historic result for us,'' said Croatia's coach Miroslav
Blazevic.
	   ``It's true that the expulsion made things easier for us, but I
don't think it diminishes our merit.''
	   Robert Jarni fired home a 25-meter (yard) shot in the third
minute of first half injury time, eight minutes after Christian
Woerns had been expelled for hauling down striker Davor Suker.
	   Goran Vlaovic drove a 20-meter shot past 'keeper Andreas Koepke
10 minutes from the end and Suker netted the third in the 85th
minute as Croatia became the first debutant since Portugal in 1966
to make the semifinal.
	   ``This is not the end, we are going all the way,'' said
Croatia's goalkeeper Drazen Ladic.
	   ``We always believed we could win. Like our coach says, we are
the best in the world. After the expulsion, everything went our
way,'' said Ladic, who made two astonishing saves to deny Bierhoff.
	   It was Germany's heaviest loss since an 8-3 defeat by Hungary in
the 1954 World Cup and a second quarterfinal defeat in a row. In
1994 the Germans were ousted by Bulgaria. Never before had Germany
lost two World Cup quarterfinals in a row.
	   The last time Germany lost by three goals was in October 1986,
4-1 in a friendly against Austria.
	   What made it even more historic for Croatia, which gained
independence from Yugoslavia seven years ago, was that it reached
the last four in its first World Cup appearance by beating a soccer
giant which also was a three-time losing finalist.
	   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is regarded as a lucky fan as
he has not seen the German team lose since 1986, was in the crowd
at the Stade de Gerland to witness what turned out to be one of its
lowest moments.
	   ``I didn't think the sending off was fair,'' said German
defender Juergen Kohler.
	   ``I think you could say that the referee lost us the game. But
we never gave up and we gave it all we could. There was at the most
just one goal in it.
	   ``It's very sad to lose and this is the end for us,'' Kohler
said. It's a great shame because I don't think it was fair to lose
in this way.''
	   Yet, it was Germany that dominated the early action and appeared
in control until Woerns' expulsion.
	   ``Until the expulsion, we played our best game in the
tournament. It's useless to talk about the expulsion now, Croatia
is through and we are going home,'' said German coach Berti Vogts.
	   ``My team gave everything but it wasn't enough. I am still happy
with my team.''
	   Ladic made an impressive double save in the 31st minute when
Bierhoff climbed to meet another rightwing cross. Ladic did well to
block the header at the foot of the post and, with Juergen
Klinsmann swooping in to try and force home the rebound, the
'keeper reacted quickly to kick the ball to safety.
	   Woerns expulsion came eight minutes before half time.
	   With the ball 40 meters from the German goal, Suker pushed the
ball inside the defender and appeared set to run direct for goal.
	   Woerns' tackle missed the ball and swept Suker's legs from under
him and, with the Real Madrid striker writhing on the round,
Norwegian referee Rune Pedersen reached to his back pocket for the
red card.
	   It looked worse for the Germans when the Croatians went ahead.
	   Jarni, who plays in Spain for Real Betis, collected a sideways
pass from Mario Stanic and drove the ball with his left foot past
Koepke to pile more misery on the short-handed Germans.
	   The Germans almost tied it up five minutes into the second half
when a leftwing corner flew to Bierhoff at the far post and his
first-time hip-high volley from no more than six meters was blocked
by Ladic on his line. Bierhoff had scored three goals in the
tournament.
	   With 11 minutes left, it was all over for the Germans, the
oldest team in the tournament with an average age of just under 30.
	   With the German defense retreating, Vlaovic moved into a
shooting position on the edge of the area and fired a low drive
that flew past Koepke and just inside his right hand post.
	   With the Germans committed to attack, they left huge gaps at the
back and Suker easily got round a defender with five minutes to go
to fire a low, close range shot under Koepke for the third.
	   Lineups:
	   Germany _ Andreas Koepke; Lothar Matthaeus, Juergen Kohler,
Christian Woerns; Joerg Heinrich, Thomas Haessler (Ulf Kirsten,
69th), Jens Jeremies, Dietmar Hamann (Olaf Marschall, 79th),
Michael Tarnat; Juergen Klinsmann, Oliver Bierhoff.
	   Croatia _ Drazen Ladic; Igor Stimac, Slaven Bilic, Dario Simic,
Robert Jarni; Zvonimir Soldo, Aljosa Asanovic, Zvonimir Boban,
Mario Stanic; Davor Suker, Goran Vlaovic (Zoran Mamic, 83rd).
	   Referee _ Rune Pedersen, Norway.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The New York Yankees became the first team in 86
years to win 60 of its first 80 games, using Orlando Hernandez's
pitching and Chad Curtis' two-run single in the sixth to beat the
Baltimore Orioles 4-3 Saturday.
	   The Yankees joined the 1912 New York Giants, 1907 Chicago Cubs
and 1902 Pittsburgh Pirates as the only teams in modern major
league history to start the season 60-20.
	   Hernandez (3-1), the Cuban defector who was spending his first
Independence Day in this country, allowed six hits and two walks in
eight innings. Mariano Rivera got his 21st save.
	   Curtis' two-run single off Alan Mills scored Tino Martinez and
Tim Raines, who reached against starter Doug Drabek (5-9).
 &UR; Blue Jays 8, Devil Rays 0 &QC; 
	   In Toronto, Chris Carpenter pitched a four-hitter and Carlos
Delgado had two homers and five RBIs as Toronto handed Tampa Bay

three in his second shutout of his career.
	   Delgado went 3-for-4 with a three-run homer in the sixth, a solo
shot in the eighth and an RBI double in the first off Dennis
Springer (2-11).
 &UR; White Sox 3, Red Sox 0 &QC; 
	   In Boston, Chicago's John Snyder outdueled Korean Jin Ho Cho and

big-league appearance Tuesday, allowed five hits in 7 2-3 innings.
Bill Simas pitched the ninth for his fifth save.
	   Boston's Nomar Garciaparra went 0-for-2, ending his 24-game
hitting streak, the longest in the majors this season.

 &UR; MONTSERRAT: Island needs workers to help rebuild &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ The leader of Montserrat, the small
Caribbean island devastated by a volcano, is putting out the help
wanted sign.
	   Chief Minister David Brandt said there are 200 vacancies in the
island's civil service alone, as most of the population has left
and the country is about to begin a three-year, dlrs 124 million
(75 million British pounds) recovery plan with help from the
British government.
	   Brandt also praised Britain for coming to the aid of its small,
Carribean island.
	   ``Let me say that I have criticized them in the past and I will
do so again when the situation warrants it,'' Brandt said. ``But at
this time I would like to express my gratitude for the assistance
they have given and for their commitment of the 75 million pounds
(dlrs 124 million).''
	   Most residents have left Montserrat since the Soufriere Hills
volcano became active three years ago, leaving most of the
39-square-mile (101-square-kilometer) island uninhabitable.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Divided island marks July 4th
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Divided by the question of its
political future and a simmering labor dispute, Puerto Rico marked
July Fourth with protests and a plea by the governor for statehood
for the U.S. commonwealth.
	   Exactly three weeks before the 100th anniversary of the date
that U.S. troops first landed on Puerto Rico and changed the course
of the island's history, Gov. Pedro Rossello said Saturday it was
time for the United States to make the island a full partner in the
country by granting statehood.
	   The official ceremony at which the governor spoke was closed to
the general public and surrounded by extra security. Tensions were
higher than usual as employees of the Puerto Rico Telephone Company
began their 16th day on strike Saturday to protest Rossello's plans
to sell a controlling interest in the government-owned company.
	   Dozens of unions have planned a 48-hour general island-wide
strike on Tuesday to protest the government's privatization policy.
 &UR; ST. LUCIA: Caribbean leaders look for help in banana dispute with
U.S.
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ Leaders of two Caribbean
banana-producing nations hurt by U.S.-backed trade rulings are
looking for lobbying help from everyone from South African
President Nelson Mandela to Caribbean nationals living in the
United States.
	   Caribbean Community leaders who met this week with Mandela
during the organization's summit asked the South African leader to
help convince the United States not to be the ``main attacker'' of
the banana industry, Dominica Prime Minister Edison James said
Saturday.
	   The United States successfully challenged trade preferences some
small, former colonies in the Caribbean have with European
countries. Producing bananas in the Caribbean is generally more
expensive than in Latin America, where U.S. fruit corporations have
large plantations.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Local and federal personnel to join Florida
firefighters
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A brigade of 50 local and federal
officials trained in fighting forest fires is being sent to Florida
to join the battle against wild fires that have burned hundreds of
thousands of acres.
	   The Hot Caribe brigade, as it is known, is expected to remain in
Florida for 21 days and additional personnel could be sent if
needed, according to a statement from the U.S. Forest Service
office in Puerto Rico on Saturday.
	   The Puerto Rico personnel, from the island's Fire Department and
Department of Natural Resources, along with officers with the
Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and other agencies,
will join firefighters from around the United States who are trying
to control the blazes in parched northeastern Florida.

	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Raul Mondesi singled twice, doubled,
tripled and drove in three runs as the Los Angeles Dodgers, who
traded for All-Star reliever Jeff Shaw during the game, won 9-5
Saturday over the San Francisco Giants.
	   Mondesi, hitting .480 with eight RBIs in his last six games
since moving to the third spot in the lineup, had a two-run triple
in the first, doubled in the third and added a run-scoring single
in the fifth off Giants starter Mark Gardner (7-4).
	   Mondesi also popped out in the sixth and then had a single in
the ninth that scooted past left fielder Barry Bonds for a two-base
error, allowing a run to score.
	   Dave Mlicki (4-4) allowed four runs on six hits in five innings
for the victory.

	   CINCINNATI (AP) _ Bret Boone drove in the winning run with a

	   The Reds loaded the bases in the ninth off Rick Croushore (0-1)
before Boone's RBI gave the Reds their eighth victory in nine
games. Danny Graves (2-0) got the final out in the ninth for the
win.
	   Mark McGwire walked three times and went 0-for-2 on a pair of
grounders, leaving him tied with Reggie Jackson for most homers
before the All-Star break with 37.
	   The Cardinals lost for the ninth time in 11 games.
 &UR; Cubs 5, Pirates 4 &QC; 
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Mickey Morandini homered to tie the game and
Henry Rodriguez hit a go-ahead, two-run single in the seventh as
Chicago won its fourth straight.
	   Jose Hernandez tripled to start the seventh and then Morandini
homered to right to tie the game at 3-3. It was his third hit of
the game.
	   Sammy Sosa walked off Jason Schmidt (8-5) and Mark Grace greeted
reliever Jason Christiansen with a single and both runners advances
on an error by Jose Guillen and scored on Rodriguez's hit.
	   Mark Pisciotta (1-2) got the win and Rod Beck picked up his 22nd
save.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _U.S. mediator Richard Holbrooke
sought common ground on Saturday between the president of
Yugoslavia and ethnic Albanian leaders on ending Kosovo's violence.
As Holbrooke shuttled between Belgrade and Pristina, a guerrilla
spokesman dented U.S. hopes of getting Kosovo's ethnic Albanian
fighters and politicians to speak with one voice in their struggle
for independence. The German news magazine Spiegel quoted a Kosovo
Liberation Army spokesman, Jakub Krasniqi, as saying that the KLA
would never take orders from the main political leader, Ibrahim
Rugova, because his peaceful secession efforts had failed. Ethnic
Albanian separatists want independence for Kosovo, a province in
southern Serbia where they outnumber Serbs 9-to-1. Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic says the crackdown is aimed at ethnic
Albanian terrorists who have targeted Serb police in their fight
for independence. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat accused Israel
of violating the peace agreements in a confrontation in the Gaza
Strip and said the Palestinians ``will not hesitate to confront any
attempted aggression on our land.'' In a Cabinet statement
published Saturday, Arafat said ``We will not accept anyone harming
the lives or jobs of our people in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli side
must respect the agreement.'' Israel and the Palestinians heaped
blame on each other after troops from the two sides confronted the
other with cocked assault rifles and armored personnel carriers
Thursday night and early Friday in what began as an argument over
control of a Gaza Strip road. The incident came at a time when the
United States appears to be making little headway in winning
Israeli agreement on a troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West
Bank. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian authorities ordered a South Korean
diplomat expelled Saturday after he was detained overnight on
suspicion of spying. The diplomat, Cho Seong-ho, was taken into
custody as he met with an alleged Russian contact, according to a
statement from the Federal Security Service, a successor to the
Soviet-era KGB. The contact, an employee of Russia's Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, was also detained and is under investigation, the
statement said. The Russian is accused of ``providing confidential
information to South Korean security services that was damaging to
Russia's political and economic interests,'' the statement said.
Cho, a political officer at the embassy, has diplomatic immunity
and was released after questioning. (RUSSIA-SKOREA-SPY)
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India will ban lotteries which lure
millions of poor people to blow up their paltry earnings every day,
the government said Saturday, but lottery traders threatened to
challenge the move in court. Interior Minister Lal Krishna Advani
announced in parliament that the federal government will outlaw all
forms of lottery in consultation with the provincial governments,
which run many lotteries. He gave no timeframe. Lottery trade
officials say there are 2.5 million Indians engaged in the business
who sell tickets worth rupees 500 billion (dlrs 12 billion)
annually, earning revenues of over rupees 12 billion (dlrs 285
million) each year. Independent confirmation was not available. The
country's largest body of lottery traders threatened to hold
demonstrations and petition the courts if the prohibition is
imposed. (INDIA-LOTTERY BAN)
	   ADANA, Turkey (AP) _ A week after a deadly earthquake hit
southern Turkey, two strong aftershocks rocked the same area
Saturday, leaving more than 1,000 people injured, most of them from
jumping out of windows or from balconies in panic. Most of the
injured suffered fractures and cuts, said Adana's Deputy Gov.
Bulent Egriboz. Metin Demirtas, another deputy governor, put the
number of injured at 1,039. The bigger of the jolts was a 5.1
magnitude temblor which struck at 5:15 a.m. (0215 GMT), as many
people still slept in this city of 1 million inhabitants. There
were no fatalities and only one building collapsed, without hurting
anyone. The building was weakened by the 6.3-magnitude quake on
June 27 which killed 144 people in the region. (TURKEY-QUAKE)

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ A popular comic strip featuring Pavlov the dog,
which started in the Toronto Sun in 1971 and appeared in 100
newspapers around the world at the height of its popularity, will
retire near the end of this month.
	   The last Pavlov panel will be published July 25.
	   Ted Martin's daily cartoons began as a social commentary, with a
couple commenting on life, and the dog was just a prop with nothing
to do with the punchline. But readers could see him misbehaving in
the background, doing headstands or crossing his eyes. Soon the
scene-stealing dog walked off with the whole show.
	   ``On the days when the dog wouldn't appear, the switchboard lit
up,'' Martin says.
	   In 1978, Martin mailed 36 man-and-dog gags to the Universal
Press Syndicate. Within a week, Universal Press called back with an
offer to syndicate the comic.
	   Eventually, the dog evolved to the standing, talking,
wrist-watch and spotted handkerchief-wearing character it is today.
	   For years, Martin woke up, ate, then sat at his dining room
table imagining absurd situations for his dog. Some days the ideas
came slowly.
	   ``I sat there with my head in my hands until something bubbled
to the surface,'' Martin said.
	   When those days became more common, he decided it was time to
put Pavlov to bed and move on to a new project, which is still top
secret. He hopes to unveil a new comic strip next spring.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Michael Jackson is returning to his Motown roots
this week to unveil a new video, do some charity work and talk
business with entrepreneur Don Barden.
	   Barden is the former owner of Detroit's cable television system
whose current holdings include a casino in Jackson's hometown of
Gary, Indiana. Barden said he and Jackson also plan a ``major
announcement'' this week.
	   Details weren't announced, but Barden said he and Jackson began
working together this spring to develop business opportunities
worldwide.
	   ``Whether it's selling trains, building dams or bridges or
highways or hotels or casinos, we're going to be a diversified
company worldwide,'' Barden told the Detroit Free Press in a report
published Saturday. ``This is a phenomenal, historic partnership.
There's no reason we can't be the largest African-American company
in the world in two years.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Arnold Schwarzenegger is leasing his
6-year-old Schatzi on Main restaurant to fellow Austrian Charly
Temmel, who owns a neighboring restaurant on the trendy
thoroughfare that runs through Venice and Santa Monica.
	   The mostly California cuisine menu at Schatzi's will retain its
sprinkling of Austrian flavor, including Schwarzenegger favorites
like Wienerschnitzel, Lammkeule mit Gerostetem Gemuese (molasses
glazed rack of lamb) and Zwiebel Rost Braten.
	   Schwarzenegger and wife Maria Shriver often frequent Schatzi's,
and the actor said he will continue attending the monthly Cigar
Night, which draws such celebrities as William Shatner and Wilt
Chamberlain.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Steve Buscemi, best known for his portrayals of
low-life characters in films like ``Fargo'' and ``Reservoir Dogs,''
was a little concerned about his mug appearing all over his
hometown on the poster for his latest movie ``Armageddon.''
	   ``I called my manager and said, `Could we maybe not have these
put up in Brooklyn?''' he says in the July 13 issue of People.
``It's just too embarrassing to see myself on a bus shelter. And I
don't want to have to see my face graffitied.''
	   Playing an action hero had its perils for Buscemi.
	   ``I tripped and I had a swollen knee for a while,'' he says.
``It was a case of an overzealous actor getting the chance to do
something physical and trying too hard. You know, we were saving
the world.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   VICKSBURG, Mississippi (AP) _ Actress Beah Richards says her
mother constantly encouraged her to do whatever she wished to do.
	   But growing up in a segregated South, the one-time Academy Award
nominee felt the message just didn't apply.
	   ``That woman told me I could be anything I wanted, but I
couldn't check a book out from the library or drink from the same
water fountain,'' Richards said. ``I was thinking, `Here I can't do
anything I want.'''
	   Richards and fellow Vicksburg native Governor Kirk Fordice were
among those honored Friday at an event promoting the Museum of
African American Culture and The Marketplace.
	   The 71-year-old actress, who got her Oscar nomination for her
role in 1967's ``Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,'' said her mother's
encouragement taught her how to beat the odds.
	   ``I am so grateful at this moment to my family, friends and
teachers,'' she said. ``Words cannot tell you.''

China trip cures some domestic Clinton ills, but not all
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With US-Clinton-China &QL; 
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; By WALTER R. MEARS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Special Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ For a president with troubles, the political
adage goes, traveling abroad can help cure headaches at home. It
puts him on the world stage, rallying supporters, perhaps quieting
critics.
	   And changing the subject.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton's nine days in China gained him some
of those benefits, but not all.
	   Call it a split decision.
	   The impact of a foreign mission showed in the tone of his
farewell news conference in Hong Kong, before he flew home for the
Fourth of July. In Washington, he surely would have been questioned
about Kenneth Starr's investigation of sex and cover-up allegations
against him. In Hong Kong, the subject wasn't raised.
	   Clinton said his summit with China's President Jiang Zemin
produced substantial, substantive progress on issues ranging from
nuclear proliferation to environmental pollution, despite
disappointing results on trade.
	   Back home, the Republican Congress is pursuing investigations of
White House policies and satellite-launch dealings with Beijing,
plus allegations of illicit Chinese campaign contributions. Clinton
said Jiang told him he found no evidence of Chinese government
involvement. Clinton said he asked Jiang to have his government
cooperate with U.S. investigators.
	   In addition, a congressional dispute lies just ahead over
renewal of normal trade ties, an annual exercise with a predictable
outcome: approval, perhaps narrowly.
	   Ardent critics talked acidly of the president's mission while he
was on it. Six congressional Democrats _ no Republicans _ traveled
with him, one of whom called the Republican boycott a blot on the
tradition of bipartisanship in foreign policy.
	   Then there's the Monica Lewinsky matter: no pause in special
prosecutor Starr's pursuit, but two courtroom strikes against his
cases.
	   Starr summoned his tipster to testify in the case of the White
House intern's alleged sex and cover-up involving Clinton _ he
denies both _ on Tuesday, while the president was in Shanghai after
the Beijing summit.
	   Asked about the timing of Linda Tripp's grand jury testimony,
the White House brushed it off, saying the president was concerned
with one trip: China, not Linda.
	   Besides, Starr's two losses in court while Clinton was abroad
were good for the president, blows to Starr's investigations.
	   Clinton's diplomatic travelogue cast him in the prime
presidential role, all televised back home. There he was, the
American president, debating the president of China, lecturing
Beijing on human rights, broadcast live on Chinese television. One
day in the village, next day in the city, at the Shanghai stock
exchange, defending democracy in Hong Kong.
	   Scenes like those dominate the messages Americans see and hear.
Such coverage is difficult on an ordinary work day at the White
House but not on a foreign mission.
	   Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia said it was a week
of extraordinary diplomatic progress in a difficult relationship.
	   He also said in Hong Kong that anyone who believes ``the sense
of euphoria'' stirred by the summit and grand tour will ease the
controversy over the extension of normal U.S. trade ties with
Beijing doesn't understand Congress.
	   The annual trade debates and votes began after the bloody
repression of democracy demonstrators near Beijing's central
Tiananmen Square in 1989. Clinton was officially welcomed to China
at the square and was criticized for it at home.
	   Rockefeller warned of resentment in Congress at barriers to U.S.
imports in China, blamed for a trade deficit projected by the
administration to hit dlrs 60 billion this year. The summit didn't
produce any deals on that score.
	   Secretary of Commerce William Daley said there was no
encouragement from Chinese officials who fear open markets would
risk ending their economic progress.
	   The trade imbalance is a political problem as well. Daley said
increases could stir a backlash in Congress and that the Chinese
know it and should want to avoid it.
	   It was Rockefeller who complained at the absence of Republicans
in the U.S. delegation and blamed Republican congressional leaders
for it.
	   He said there were Republicans who wanted to come, but ``they
were told not to come,'' Rockefeller said. He told Hong Kong civic
and business leaders Friday the decision was a bad omen for
bipartisanship.
	   Indeed, he said, Republicans told Clinton he shouldn't go
himself, and ``if you go, you won't say what you need to say.
	   ``And of course, he proved them both wrong,'' Rockefeller said.
	   Although not to the satisfaction of his GOP critics, despite
almost daily lectures to the Chinese for human rights and against
trade barriers.
	   And congressional champions of Taiwan will be rebuking Clinton
over his purposeful, personal restatement in Shanghai of American
policy toward the island state China claims. It is that the United
States does not support independence for Taiwan, and the future
relationship should be worked out peacefully by Beijing and Taipei.
	   Clinton didn't change that policy of careful ambiguity. But to
say it himself, in China, was a gesture to Beijing, enough to stir
diplomatic and political argument at home.
	   Starr called Tripp, the wiretapping witness in the Lewinsky
case, to testify to a Washington grand jury Tuesday. She is the
woman who recorded telephone calls from the White House intern,
telling of a purported sexual relationship and attempts to keep it
quiet.
	   She testified for six hours; what she said was in grand jury
secrecy.
	   Starr's setbacks were not, a Supreme Court ruling that he can't
get a lawyer's notes on a discussion with Vincent Foster nine days
before the 1994 suicide of the deputy White House counsel; then
dismissal of a tax indictment against Webster Hubbell, a friend of
Clinton's, by a judge who called it a Starr fishing expedition.
	   Clinton, in Shanghai, said he was happy for the Hubbells.
	   Overall, advantage Clinton. Now his test is to try to hold onto
it.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Crowded, colorful and heart-stopping is giving
way to shiny, hi-tech and functional.
	   When the wheels of Cathay Pacific Flight 251 bound for London
leave a runway that pokes out into Kowloon Bay on Sunday night,
downtown Kai Tak airport will be history.
	   During the night, workers will load tons of airport equipment on
trucks and barges and haul it 30 kilometers (20 miles) to the edge
of an outlying island. Seven hours later, gleaming new Hong Kong
International at Chek Lap Kok opens for business.
	   It's a bittersweet time for Hong Kong, which has grown to love
Kai Tak over its 73 years, despite its noise and roof-skimming
approaches over Hong Kong. Chek Lap Kok, dedicated Thursday by
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and used by U.S. President Bill
Clinton for his visit last week, just won't be the same.
	   Chek Lap Kok's eight-level passenger terminal, one of the
largest enclosed spaces in the world, features a metal wing-like
roof designed by British architect Norman Foster. The dlrs 20
billion airport was built by flattening two islets and reclaiming
land.
	   The glass-walled terminal gives a sweeping view of mountains, a
glimpse of the ocean and plenty of sunlight _ unlike the cramped,
windowless Kai Tak. A driverless shuttle train carries passengers
under the central concourse.
	   The timing, however, couldn't be much worse. Asia's financial
turmoil has thrown Hong Kong into recession, and tourist arrivals
are down nearly 25 percent.
	   Visits to Kai Tak have been soaring _ at least by residents
looking for a final thrill.
	   Chan Shuk-man, a chubby-cheeked 5-year-old, nestled in her
father's arms on top of an airport garage and watched a Qantas
jumbo jet arrive. The plane glided over apartment buildings that
crowd rows of congested streets.
	   The child had a typical reaction to the typical Kai Tak landing:
	   ``It's coming toward us,'' she said. ``No! It's turning! Look!
It's touching the rooftop. Dad, it's not going to make it. Wa...!''
She covered her eyes.
	   Landings like that provided Kai Tak's unique appeal, and
ultimately doomed it. The International Federation of Airline
Pilots' Association recently rated it ``critically deficient,'' and
many have complained of the gut-wrenching approach.
	   Chek Lap Kok couldn't be more different. Its
557,413-square-meter (6-million-square-foot) terminal is nine times
bigger. Unlikely Kai Tak, which is closed at night because of the
noise over residential areas, the new one will run around the clock
because of its more distant location. Ultimately, it is designed to
take 87 million passengers annually.
	   Despite its size and architecture, the point of Chek Lap Kok
isn't to dazzle.
	   ``There's nothing unique in the airport,'' said Airport
Authority spokesman Phillip Bruce. ``Our aim is to take passengers
in and out as quickly as possible.''
	   The airport project includes a 1,363-meter (4,475-foot)-long
suspension bridge, an express highway and a railway to link the
remote airport to downtown.
	   Construction has been plagued by snags and disputes. Its opening
was delayed by a dispute between China and Britain over funding
when Hong Kong still was a British colony, and by problems in
completing the railway.
	   And now Asia's economic crisis is dimming the airport's
prospects.
	   The International Air Transport Association in February adjusted
its five-year forecast of annual growth in passenger traffic in
Asia to 4.4 percent, down from 7.7 percent.
	   The airport relocation also is putting strains on the airlines.
Landing charges will be about 20 percent higher. Hong Kong-based
Cathay Pacific airline has invested dlrs 1 billion in a new
headquarters at Chek Lap Kok.
	   Meanwhile, passenger loads are at a 10-year low, and profits way
down.
	   Still, tourism officials have plans for a new convention center
and a 1,100-room hotel, Hong Kong's largest.
	   But flight attendant Beyonka Chan says Kai Tak's closure is a
big loss.
	   ``When you come down, you can see all the buildings and the
people, all the hustle and bustle,'' she said. ``It's a true Hong
Kong experience.''

World Cup: ``Wonderful adventure'' for Danes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Disappointed. Upset. Angry. Bitter. Other
teams may leave the World Cup with those emotions. Not Denmark.
Empty perhaps, but nothing more.
	   ``It will take a long time to understand this. ... Only a few
people in the world will have an adventure like this,'' Denmark's
coach Bo Johansson said.
	   ``Even if it didn't look so good in the beginning of the
tournament and even if we didn't win against Brazil, I think we've
had a very good World Cup.''
	   The Danes were criticized for their first-round performances,
scraping past Saudi Arabia, drawing with South Africa and finishing
off their group with a loss to France.
	   Then, with the tournament entering the single-elimination phase,
the Danes scored six goals.
	   First, they surprised 1996 Olympic champion Nigeria 4-1, one of
the pre-tournament favorites, before losing their quarterfinal to
defending World Cup champion Brazil 3-2 in one of the best games of
the competition.
	   After the loss, Johansson approached Mario Zagallo. He hugged
and kissed the Brazilian coach, whom he had watched at age 16 in
his native Sweden when Zagallo played for the Brazilian team that
beat the Swedes 5-2 in the 1958 final in Stockholm.
	   That showed just how much Johansson appreciates Brazilian
soccer.
	   ``Pele, of course, was the big star in that final, but Zagallo
was a pretty good left-winger,'' Johansson said. ``He's a very nice
man. He looked tired (after the victory over Denmark), but I can
understand it. There's so much more pressure for a Brazilian
coach.''
	   Reaching the quarterfinals was one of the biggest achievements
for Denmark, one of seven charter members when FIFA was founded in
1904.
	   ``It feels great to have reached the quarters, but we're not
satisfied,'' Johansson said. ``It doesn't matter if the other team
is the world champion. You still want to win. That's what soccer is
all about.
	   ``Until the end we tried to beat them and I wonder if any team
has been closer for a while in a tournament like this,'' added
Johansson, referring to Danish defender Marc Rieper's 89th-minute
header that hit the Brazilian crossbar and could have forced extra
time.
	   Denmark's Scandinavian neighbor Norway managed to defeat the
Brazilians 2-1 in the final Group A match. But the South Americans
already had clinched first place and were assured of a second-round
berth.
	   In its only previous World Cup appearance in Mexico in 1986,
Denmark beat Scotland, Uruguay and eventual finalist Germany before
being eliminated by Spain 5-1.
	   Denmark's only major triumph came six years ago when it won the
European Championship in Sweden. The Danes had failed to qualify,
but were called up 10 days before the start as replacement for
Yugoslavia, which had been expelled by United Nations sanctions.
	   Michael Laudrup, the only remaining member of the 1986 side,
feels he is ending his international career on a positive note.
	   ``It was a great experience, a great way to finish my career,''
he said. ``It was great propaganda for Danish football... We played
Brazilian-style football.''
	   Laudrup, 34, one of Europe's top soccer players in the past 15
years, is the only player ever to win league titles for European
powerhouses Juventus, Barcelona, Real Madrid and Ajax.
	   He won the Italian championship with Juventus in 1986. In Spain,
he became a league champion four straight times (1991-94) with
Barcelona before leaving for Real Madrid, where he won a fifth
straight title in 1995. After a year in Japan with Vissel Kobe, he
returned to Europe and Ajax, which won this season.
	   ``We will always miss Michael Laudrup, of course,'' Johansson
said. ``There will never be another Michael Laudrup again.''

World Cup: Confident Italians upset with early exit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ So confident of their ability, Italy's players only
negotiated bonus money for an appearance in the World Cup
semifinals.
	   They had reached the semifinals three times since 1982 _
including the final twice _ so it seemed like a good bet.
	   Their quarterfinal elimination on penalties to France not only
left the Azzurri stunned, but disappointed their millions of fans
who look forward every quadrennium to a chance to win the title and
who consider their domestic league the best in the world.
	   More than that, Italy's elimination came at the end of an overly
defensive match, a game in which tournament co-leading scorer
Christian Vieri and forwards Alessandro Del Piero and Roberto
Baggio rarely threatened French keeper Fabien Barthez's net.
	   The blame was quick to be doled out.
	   Coach Cesare Maldini, rated the most popular man in Italy
following the second-round victory against Norway, was bitterly
criticized as the champion of old-fashioned soccer, mostly intended
to destroy the opponents' play without creating offense.
	   Maldini defended himself saying he fielded the best team
available, representing a league by now dominated by the presence
of foreign players in key midfield roles _ Italy's weakest element
in France.
	   The rotation between Del Piero and Baggio, initially considered
the best possible solution to the questionable form of the younger
star, did not work in the quarterfinals with both players failing
to produce the winning spark.
	   Del Piero, dubbed as the potential star after he scored 10 goals
with Juventus in the European Champions League and 21 more in
Italian first-division matches this year, was the biggest
disappoinment.
	   After being hampered in his preparation by a thigh strain
suffered before traveling to France, Del Piero never produced for
Maldini, who placed him among the starting 11 in four matches
instead of Baggio.
	   Having placed his faith in the youngster, Maldini was expected
to pay for the ``brutta figura'' suffered on French soil, although
it came without a loss.
	   His contract with the Italian federation expires on Dec. 31, and
its seems unlikely he would be granted a new one with some already
suggesting possible successors, including former AC Milan and Real
Madrid coach Fabio Capello.

World Cup: Second revenge mission awaits Dutch in semifinal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECAPS. &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ One painful World Cup defeat has been
avenged. The Dutch can settle another old score in the semifinals
Tuesday.
	   Dennis Bergkamp's last-minute goal earned the Netherlands a 2-1
victory over Argentina on Saturday in a World Cup quarterfinal that
gave the Dutch some taste of vengence for their 3-1 defeat by the
South Americans in the 1978 final.
	   The next opponent for Guus Hiddink's Oranje is Brazil _ which
beat the Dutch 3-2 in the quarterfinals of the 1994 World Cup.
	   ``We are looking forward to Brazil,'' Dutch coach Guus Hiddink
said. ``We know Brazil, Brazil knows us. ... It will be an
interesting contest.''
	   Despite totally dominating the second 45 minutes after an evenly
played first half that ended 1-1, the Dutch left it until the very
last minute to beat a tired Argentina.
	   In the end, the Dutch strategy was simple: Get the ball to
Bergkamp.
	   ``When you have a quality player like that who can finish the
play, you always try to get him the ball,'' Ronald de Boer said.
``He can explode at any moment to make the big shot.''
	   Bergkamp controlled a long pass from Frank de Boer, turned
inside Roberto Ayala and shot past Carlos Roa.
	   It was Bergkamp's 36th goal for the Netherlands, making him the
country's all-time leading scorer.
	   ``I thought as the ball was coming I had a chance for it,''
Bergkamp said. ``It was sent to me in just the right place. You
cannot imagine a goal like that, it just happens.''
	   Argentine coach Daniel Passarella, captain when Argentina beat
the Dutch in the 1978 final, blamed his players' fatigue for the
defeat.
	   ``Our opponents had one day more (to recover from their
second-round match) which is really important at this stage,''
Passarella said.
	   Argentina had a physically-draining second round match against
England, finally prevailing on penalties after a 2-2 draw.
	   Bergkamp said the Netherlands should be able to avoid the same
problem as it seeks its third World Cup final berth. The Dutch have
won both their previous semifinals but lost both title games.
	   ``We have got a good squad of 22 players and if some players get
tired we can put others in,'' he said.
	   One player the Dutch won't be able to use in the semifinal is
left back Arthur Numan, who was sent off in the 78th minute for his
second yellow card offense.
	   Argentina, as in the game against England, was unable to
capitalize on its man advantage and shortly before the end also was
reduced to 10 men when Ariel Ortega was ejected for headbutting
Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar.
	   Van der Sar had been arguing with Ortega, who protested in vain
to Mexican referee Arturo Brizio for a penalty after the Argentine
midfielder had collided with Dutch defender Jaap Stam and went down
in the Dutch penalty area.
	   Patrick Kluivert opened the scoring in the 12th minute,
finishing a three-man combination by lifting the ball over Roa
after Bergkamp had headed a Ronald de Boer pass into his path.
	   Argentina equalized through Claudio Lopez, who sprang the Dutch
offside trap as he collected a Juan Veron pass and calmly slotted
the ball through Van der Sar's legs in the 18th minute.
	   Chances kept coming, Argentina twice hit the woodwork, but it
was not until Bergkamps 90th-minute strike that either team was
able to score again.
	   Orange-clad Dutch fans chanting ``Champions!'' and dancing
behind the goal where Bergkamp scored finally had to be asked to
leave the stadium almost an hour after the final whistle.

Algerian government imposes Arabic as official language

	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Since independence from France 36 years
ago, the Algerian government has moved to impose Arabic as the sole
official language.
	   Despite widespread opposition, the government fulfills that
quest Sunday _ the 36th anniversary of Algerian independence _ with
a new Arabic-only law.
	   The law has provoked protests across this multicultural North
African country, particularly among the country's Berbers, an
ancient group of tribes who represent a third of Algeria's
population and speak their own language: Berber, also known as
Tamazight.
	   The law also would prohibit from official use other languages,
including French, which is still widely used in cities.
	   Many Algerians consider the Arabic-only law an attempt by the
military-backed government to court favor with supporters of
Islamic movements.
	   Since 1992, the Algerian authorities have been fighting an
Islamic insurgency that broke out after the government canceled
parliamentary elections Muslim parties were set to win.
	   Neither the government nor the insurgents, however, has been
able to gain the upper hand in the conflict that has left an
estimated 75,000 people dead.
	   In 1968, knowledge of Arabic became mandatory for government
officials. Legal proceedings in Algeria are conducted in Arabic and
it is the main language in Algerian schools.
	   The most impassioned protests against the new law have been in
the city of Tizi-Ouzou, a largely Berber town 97 kilometers (60
miles) east of the capital, Algiers.
	   In Tizi-Ouzou and Bejaia, a nearby port city, Arabic-language
signs have been destroyed. Demonstrators in recent days have
shouted, ``We are not Arabs!''
	   The region has been shaken by unrest since late June, when
Muslim militants assassinated Lounes Matoub, a popular Berber
singer who had just returned from France where he had lived in
exile. Matoub was an outspoken defender of Berber culture.
	   Much of the protesters' anger has been directed against
President Liamine Zeroual, who expressed his determination earlier
this week to make sure the law was applied.

Red cards flutter again; less frequent, more impact
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECAPS. &QL; 
 &UR; By BRIAN TRUSDELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Red cards have fluttered again at the World Cup.
Only this time they'll be remembered for their timing, not their
frequency.
	   Only one card was shown in Saturday night's quarterfinal between
Germany and Croatia. But the first-half expulsion to Christian
Woerns was followed by three Croatian goals and one of the biggest
upsets in World Cup history, 3-0.
	   Earlier, the Dutch and Argentines both had one player shown to
the lockerroom. But it was Ariel Ortega's sending off in the 87th
minute that gave the Dutch a spark and enabled the Netherlands to
win 2-1.
	   ``It was a match that had everything,'' said Dutch striker
Dennis Bergkamp, who scored with 32 seconds remaining to beat
Argentina. ``Just at the right moment we got a lift because of
Ortega's red card. Now it's Brazil. Let them come.''
	   Three weeks ago, when five players were ejected in two games it
was called ``Red Thursday.'' But those red cards were attributed to
FIFA president Sepp Blatter's call for tougher enforcement of the
rules.
	   This time there was nobody to blame but the players involved.
	   Saturday's victories completed the semifinal field, pitting
Brazil against the Netherlands on Tuesday at Marseille while
Croatia will take on the host French at Saint-Denis on Wednesday.
	   For Croatia, Wednesday's game will make the first time since
Portugal in 1966 that a team has advanced all the way to the
semifinals while appearing in its first World Cup. Even more
remarkable was the fact that Croatia has advanced this far in only
its first attempt to qualify for a World Cup.
	   ``It's a historic result for us,'' Croatian coach Miroslav
Blazevic said. ``It's true that the expulsion made things easier
for us, but I don't think it diminishes our merit.''
	   Woerns' ejection in the 40th minute came after he stuck his leg
out and tripped Croatian striker Davor Suker in midfield. With
Woerns the last defender, he appeared to make no attempt to play
the ball and Norwegian referee Rune Pedersen showed no hesitancy in
pulling out the red card.
	   It took only eight minutes for Croatia to capitalize. Robert
Jarni took a 25-meter (80-feet) shot that gave the Croats the lead
just before halftime and Goran Vloavic and Suker's goals six
minutes apart in the final 10 minutes sealed Germany's fate.
	   ``I didn't think the sending off was fair,'' German defender
Juergen Kohler said. ``I think you could say that the referee lost
us the game. But we never gave up and we gave it all we could.
There was at the most just one goal in it.''
	   The Croats didn't care how it happened.
	   ``This is not the end, we are going all the way,'' said
Croatia's goalkeeper Drazen Ladic. ``We always believed we could
win. Like our coach says, we are the best in the world. After the
expulsion, everything went our way.''
	   After Ortega's ejection, it all went the Netherlands' way too.
The only difference was the Dutch only had three minutes to work
with.
	   Bergkamp took full advantage. He settled a ball from Frank de
Boer, who drove a long ball from well inside his own half, touched
it inside defender Roberto Ayala, and pounded it past Argentine
keeper Carlos Roa from seven meters (23 feet).
	   ``It was thanks to the pass from Frank,'' Bergkamp said. ``He
saw it fantastically.''
	   The goal came after an evenly played first half, one in which
Patrick Kluivert and Claudio Lopez traded goals.
	   The Dutch, however, swarmed the Argentine net in the second
half, and dominated until Arthur Numan was sent off for his second
yellow in the 77th.
	   That gave Argentina the man advantage, and a little life.
	   But that changed again when Ortega collided with Dutch defender
Jaap Stam in the penalty area, protested with Mexico referee Arturo
Brizio for a penalty and got into an argument with Dutch keeper
Edwin van der Sar.
	   Ortega apparently objected to Van der Sar's interference and
headbutted the keeper to earn a red from Brizio.
	   That restored the on-field balance, and the Dutch took it from
there.
	   ``We are looking forward to Brazil,'' Dutch coach Guus Hiddink
said. ``We know Brazil, Brazil knows us .... It will be an
interesting contest.''

World Cup: Four-timer Brazil faces no-timers France, Netherlands,
</HEADLINE>
Croatia &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A five-time champion or a first-time winner?
	   Brazil, the defending titlist and the most successful World Cup
team of all time, aims to hold on to the trophy, while the other
three semifinalists, Netherlands, France and Croatia, have never
won it before.
	   In Croatia's case, it has gone all the way to the final four in
its first appearance at the World Cup, including qualifying. Now
the team is aiming to beat host France and make it all the way to
the final.
	   Brazil, winner in 1958, '62, '70 and '94, meets the Netherlands,
losing finalist in 1974 and '78, in Marseille on Tuesday. The
France-Croatia semifinal is on the following night at Saint-Denis.
	   A look at the four semifinalists:
 &UR; Brazil &QC; 
	   Coach Mario Zagallo has a wealth of talent on offense and
midfield but his defense has shown alarming weaknesses.
	   Four Brazilians have their own goalscoring race going on with
Rivaldo, Bebeto, Ronaldo and Cesar Sampaio all with three goals.
Ronaldo has shown himself to be a impressive goal provider rather
than scorer, while Rivaldo and Denilson have unlocked defenses with
their weaving runs.
	   But the defense was repeatedly caught out by Denmark's fast
forwards, and the Dutch, who also have talented strikers like
Dennis Bergkamp, Patrick Kluivert and Marc Overmars, will relish
the opportunity of attacking Junior Baiano and Aldair at the heart
of the Brazilian defense.
	   Roberto Carlos was guilty of a glaring blunder against the
Danes, missing his overhead kick when he tried to clear the ball in
front of goal, and will want to make up for that. Probably with one
of his trademark long-range free kicks.
 &UR; Netherlands &QC; 
	   The Arsenal attacking duo of Bergkamp and Overmars have been
embarrassing defenders all through the World Cup, and Bergkamp's
last minute goal to oust Argentina in the quarterfinals is one of
the goals of the championship.
	   Kluivert, sent off in their opening game against Belgium, looked
sharp again on his return and Edgar Davids, Philip Cocu and Ronald
de Boer are influential support players.
	   But Jaap Stam, hailed as the world's most expensive defender
after his 10-million-pound (dlrs 16.7-million) move from PSV
Eindhoven to Manchester United, has been guilty of errors that gave
away goals.
 &UR; France &QC; 
	   After scoring nine goals in three first round group games, the
French forwards seem to have forgotten how to find the net.
	   Although midfield stars such as Zinedine Zidane, Youri Djorkaeff
and Emmanuel Petit have supplied plenty of ammunition, strikers
David Trezeguet, Thierry Henry, Bernard Diomede and Stephane
Guivarc'h couldn't score against either Paraguay or Italy and the
lone French goal in those games came from central defender Laurent
Blanc.
	   At the least the defense, with Blanc and Marcel Desailly looking
consistent, have only yielded one goal in five games.
 &UR; Croatia &QC; 
	   The complete outsider left in the competition upset three-time
titlist Germany 3-0 in the quarterfinal.
	   Robert Jarni, Goran Vlaovic and Davor Suker hit the goals after
the Germans had a player sent off. But the Croatians have stars
from big Italian and Spanish clubs who have tested club soccer at
the highest level and won't feel out of their depth, even against
the home team.

Croatia overwhelmed with joy after 3-0 victory over Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia exploded in joy Saturday night,
with people going out of their apartments to celebrate, honking
horns and screaming with joy as their team advanced to the
semifinals in the World Cup by defeating Germany 3-0.
	   ``We can now move to the finals and even possibly win it!''
exclaimed Bozo Susec, Croatian TV sports commentator, in a live TV
coverage of the match.
	   President Franjo Tudjman, 76, who attended the match in Lyon,
told Croatian television that the victory ``means a lot for our
homeland, for Croatian people. It boosts our confidence, but it
also raises our reputation in the world.''
	   ``It's great to be the winner,'' said Tudjman, who wore the
team's shawl.
	   It was hard to find anyone in the country of 4.5 million who did
not watch the match on TV. Bars carried the game alive on the big
screens and no one went to sleep. Shops were closed earlier because
they expected no customers.
	   Zagreb was in complete silence during the match, except from the
outbursts following each of the three goals.
	   With the last few minutes of the match, the roar increased and
when the game ended, people rushed out to the streets, kissing and
hugging each other, waving with flags. Mass celebrations were held
in all the cities.
	   At the main square in Zagreb, young men and women in
red-and-white T-shirts and with the checkerboard colors marked on
their faces, sang and danced.
	   ``We are a small nation; many in the world did not even know
that we existed,'' Ante Zupan, 33-year-old electrician said, almost
crying of joy. ``Now they'll know.''
	   The country has not seen such a huge celebration since it
proclaimed independence from former Yugoslavia in 1991.

World Cup: Fired-up Croats get revenge against Germans

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Croatia waited two years to get revenge
against Germany. When it came, it was sweet and stunning and made
World Cup history.
	   A country that didn't exist seven years ago, Croatia vaulted
into the elite club of semifinalists with a 3-0 triumph over the
once-mighty Germans, the first team to get that far in its World
Cup debut.
	   Set ablaze by patriotism, German put-downs and a lost
quarterfinal in the 1996 European Championship, the Croats claimed
a triumph for soccer's small powers.
	   ``When I heard (German coach) Berti Vogts called us a small
country, this raised our morale by 200 percent,'' exulted star
striker Davor Suker. ``We were fired up to send the Germans
packing. This shows that small can beat big.''
	   Not that Croatia came completely out of nowhere. The squad's
core, including playmaker Zvonomir Boban of AC Milan, goes back to
the Yugoslav team that won the 1987 world youth championship.
	   When Yugoslavia broke up and Croatia gained independence in a
1991 war, most of its talent left for Western Europe. The team
surged onto the international stage in the 1996 European
Championship, where it was ousted in a rough quarterfinal with
Germany, the eventual champion.
	   Croatia turned the tables in Saturday's World Cup quarterfinal.
Aided by the 40th minute expulsion of German defender Christian
Woerns after a tangle with their star striker Davor Suker, the
Croats got a goal in first-half injury time from Robert Jarni.
	   The Germans, seeking their fourth world title, never recovered
and with an extra man, the Croats were free to run an often
sparkling counterattack game after the break.
	   Croatia's substitutes began celebrating after Goran Vlaovic
knocked in goal No. 2 in the 80th minute and Suker added to the
Germans' misery with a classy close-range goal five minutes from
the end, the Real Madrid striker's fourth of the tournament.
	   ``For 45 years in Yugoslavia, we never played with the same fire
as we are for Croatia,'' declared defender Igor Stimac, whose
sending off in the 1996 game contributed to the Croat loss.
	   Among those celebrating along with some 7,000 Croatian fans in
Gerland Stadium was President Franjo Tudjman.
	   ``We were very motivated, also because our president was here''
said Stimac. ``I've been dreaming for two years about meeting
Germany again.''
	   The Adriatic country of 4 million people was savoring the
biggest sports success in its young history.
	   ``The country is exploding with joy tonight,'' Suker said. ``I'm
really proud to be a Croat.''

World Cup: Stunned Germans at a loss for words
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Captain Juergen Klinsmann walked past the
reporters without a word, a look of utter dejection on his pale,
tired face.
	   Some others talked, of bitter disappointment, of injustice.
	   Incredulous, a shocked German team prepared to pack its bags, a
once mighty team knocked out of the World Cup by a plucky Croatian
side playing its first finals.
	   The 3-0 defeat Saturday meant that for the second time in a row,
Germany, a three-time champion, failed to get past the World Cup
quarterfinals, something that had never happened before.
	   ``We were completely crushed in the dressing room. It's a pity
to go out this way. We are all very disappointed,'' said the
37-year-old German captain, who has played a World Cup record of 25
matches in five World Cup tournaments.
	   The Germans blamed Norwegian referee Rune Pedersen of Norway for
their defeat. Pedersen sent off Germany's best defender Christian
Woerns in the 40th minute for a foul on Croatian striker Davor
Suker. Until then, Germany, the European champion, had controlled
the match.
	   ``The red card was a joke,'' Woerns said. ``I am aware of no
guilt.''
	   ``It was the decisive moment of the game. The team still fought
well. In your career, you have the chance to play perhaps only one
World Cup, therefore it's especially disappointing,'' said Woerns,
who had been Germany's best defender in the tournament.
	   Matthaeus said the team had watched two replays of Woerns' foul
in the dressing room. ``It wasn't justified.''
	   ``Sometimes FIFA puts referees on the field who have only
officiated second-rate matches,'' Matthaeus said.
	   ``I didn't think the sending off was fair,'' said German
defender Juergen Kohler.
	   ``I think you could say that the referee lost us the game. But
we never gave up and we gave it all we could. There was at the most
just one goal in it.
	   ``It's very sad to lose and this is the end for us,'' Kohler
said. ``It's a great shame because I don't think it was fair to
lose in this way.''
	   Coach Berti Vogts said the expulsion was the result of the
``provocative way'' the Croatians played.
	   ``Until the expulsion, we played our best game in the
tournament. It's useless to talk about the expulsion now, Croatia
is through and we are going home,'' Vogts said.
	   ``My team gave everything but it wasn't enough. I am still happy
with my team.''
	   Vogts took over the team in 1990, after Germany won its last
World Cup title, under Franz Beckenbauer.
	   ``I'll have to make a personal decision but I cannot make it a
half-hour after the game,'' he said.
	   ``I'll be thinking about rebuilding the team without rushing
myself, but I must have the players necessary for that. We have to
analyze everything well, it's not all in my hands,'' said Vogts
after one of Germany's worst defeats, which came in his 100th game
as national coach.
	   It was Germany's worst defeat in a World Cup since the 8-3
thrashing by Hungary in an early round in 1954. But that time,
Germany rebounded to win its first World Cup title by beating
Hungary 3-2 in the final.
	   ``The mood is really downbeat,'' said striker Oliver Bierhoff.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Officials in the northern state of Durango
said reports of people bitten by scorpions have increased by more
than 50 percent this year, due to unusually high temperatures in
recent months.
	   Scorpions have bitten 1,227 Durango residents so far in 1998,
compared with 800 in the same period in 1997, when temperatures
were lower, the government news agency Notimex reported.
	   Temperatures in Durango, a state largely covered by desert and
pine forests, have soared to as high as 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40
Celsius) in recent weeks.
	   It is unclear weather the increase in bites was caused by the
heat making the arachnids more aggressive and active, or the high
temperatures encouraging more people to go barefoot.
	   No deaths have been reported among those bitten.
	   ___
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Adilson Rodrigues, Brazil's most
famous boxer, was released Saturday from a Sao Paulo hospital after
being shot by a policeman, a Brazilian newspaper reported.
	   Police officials say Rodrigues was shot in the leg Friday soon
after he exchanged angry words with a patrolman at a roadblock. The
policeman's gun then accidentally fired, said the newspaper Jornal
do Brasil.
	   Rodrigues was once ranked second among world heavyweights. In
past years, he has fought and lost to George Foreman and Evander
Holyfield.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico will sell 49 percent stakes in several
petrochemical plant complexes beginning in September, local media
reported Saturday.
	   Mexico's state-owned oil monopoly Pemex will retain control of
the plants, holding a 51 percent stake.
	   The plant complexes originally were to have been privatized in
1993. That sale was to have included 60 plants at 10 complexes.
	   Pemex Director Adrian Lajous did not specify how many of the
plants would be included in the sale.
	   The company gave no estimate on what it expects to raise from
the sale.
	   ___
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ The Brazilian government has
criticized a German pharmaceutical firm embroiled in a phony birth
control scandal.
	   Brazil on Friday expressed its ``surprise and displeasure'' for
what it described as a ``lamentable episode'' regarding a recent
statement by Schering AG, a German pharmaceutical firm.
Berlin-based Schering had accused Brazil's health minister of using
the scandal for political reasons.
	   At least 10 women in the state of Sao Paulo have said they
became pregnant after taking fake Microvlar contraceptives made by
Schering.
	   Schering said the pills, made of lactose and sugar, were
intended solely to test new packaging equipment. The tablets were
supposed to have been incinerated after the tests, but were stolen
and sold illegally.
	   Schering's Brazilian subsidiary is being investigated for
possible violations of consumer protection law.
	   The Justice Ministry last week fined the subsidiary dlrs 2.5
million and the Sao Paulo state attorney's office has said it will
file a civil suit on behalf of the pregnant women.
	   On Friday, the government suspended sales of all products made
by Schering, though the company can still produce its drugs, the
Health Ministry said.

	   GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala (AP) _ A Guatemalan judge handed down
death sentences Saturday against three men convicted of the 1996
kidnapping and murder of a 14-year-old girl.
	   The three men were identified as the kidnappers of Karla Julissa
Trujillo by the victim's boyfriend.
	   They join 21 other men awaiting execution or appealing death

Sears' store in a Mexico City shopping mall. Four people in the
store suffered smoke inhalation, local media reported.
	   Only one of the injured required hospitalization, and
firefighters quickly controlled the blaze, which apparently started
with a short-circuit in a basement freight elevator.

Efforts to revive stalled peace process overshadowed by latest

incidents &QL;

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Efforts to revive the stalled Mideast peace
process has been further jeopardized as Israelis and Palestinians
engaged in a recent 12-hour showdown and three Israeli horsemen
disguised as Arabs smashed the windows of Palestinians' cars.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat accused Israel on Saturday of
violating the peace agreements in the showdown that stemmed from a
dispute over a Gaza Strip road.
	   The Palestinians ``will not hesitate to confront any attempted
aggression on our land,'' he said in a Cabinet statement. ``We will
not accept anyone harming the lives or jobs of our people in the
Gaza Strip. The Israeli side must respect the agreement.''
	   Israeli and Palestinian troops confronted each other with cocked
assault rifles and armored personnel carriers Thursday night and
early Friday.
	   The incident, which prompted accusations from both sides, came
as the United States appears to be making little headway in winning
Israeli agreement on a troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West
Bank.
	   Arafat left Saturday for Cairo, for a Sunday meeting with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Hussein about
the deadlock in the peace process.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested that the
confrontation in Gaza, during which Palestinian truckers blockaded
Jewish settlements, could make Israel even more hesitant to hand
over land to the Palestinians. Israeli hard-liners claim that a
troop pullback would leave more than a dozen settlements isolated
and at the mercy of the Palestinians.
	   ``You could also understand how sensitive we are to the issue of
redeployment, which could place tens of thousands of Israelis ...
at great peril any time the Palestinians decide to violate the
agreement, as they did last night,'' Netanyahu said Friday.
	   Netanyahu accused the Palestinians of staging a deliberate
provocation and said Israel would not succumb to threats of
violence.
	   The Gaza confrontation began with a routine argument over the
use of a road. About two-thirds of the Gaza Strip is controlled by
the Palestinian Authority, but Israeli troops patrol near Jewish
settlements and control several access roads.
	   On Thursday afternoon, Palestinian Supplies Minister Abdel Azziz
Shaheen demanded that Israel allow a convoy of 22 Palestinian cars
use a coastal route it controls. Israeli soldiers let Shaheen pass
because he was a Cabinet minister, but told the others to turn
back.
	   The dispute quickly escalated. As night fell, both sides dug
trenches and took up positions just a few dozen yards from one
another _ with rifles pointed.
	   A compromise deal was reached Friday with the help of U.S.
Mideast envoy Dennis Ross, and Shaheen and his convoy were allowed
to drive along the coastal road.
	   Also Saturday, Israeli police said three Israeli horsemen
disguised as Arabs smashed the windows of Palestinians' cars in the
tense, divided West Bank city of Hebron,
	   Wielding chains and wearing keffiyehs, a traditional Arab
headgear, the three shattered windshields and dented Arab-owned
cars parked late Friday near the Jewish suburb of Kiryat-Arba, on
the outskirts of the mainly Palestinian city, police spokesman Ofer
Sivan said.
	   About 500 Jewish settlers live in downtown Hebron surrounded by
more than 130,000 Palestinians. Relations between the two
communities are tense and from violence breaks out from time to
time.
	   Most of the city is controlled by the Palestinian Authority, but
the Israeli army and police control the Jewish enclaves and some
Arab neighborhoods close to them.

Mexican state elections important to parties' presidential hopes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHIHUAHUA, Mexico (AP) _ Chihuahua _ site of a historic event in
1992 when an opposition party defeated Mexico's long-ruling and
seemingly omnipotent Institutional Revolutionary Party _ may be the
harbinger of yet another major change in Mexican politics.
	   That change may come from inside the ruling party itself, known
by its Spanish initials as the PRI.
	   A PRI candidate chosen in an unprecedented open primary has a
strong chance Sunday to regain the governorship for the party,
renowned for the hermetic process of selecting its nominees.
	   ``It is an election that is important not only for Chihuahua,
but for the country,'' said Guillermo Lujan Pena of the opposition
National Action Party.
	   The northern Mexican state of Chihuahua, a sun-scorched sprawl
of desert and mountains, is one of three northern states whose
elections Sunday could affect the race for Mexico's president in
2000.
	   The PRI has held power in Mexico since 1929, but until 15 years
ago, ``elections were really a formality,'' said Chihuahua PRI
leader Jorge Esteban Sandoval.
	   The party's grip on power has never been shakier. Chihuahua was
the second of six state governorships won by National Action, a
center-right party that is Mexico's second largest, over the past
decade. Last year, the PRI lost its majority in the lower house of
Congress and was thrashed in the Mexico City mayor's race.
	   Yet most polls show it holds a narrow lead in this state _ one
that has been a longtime base for the National Action.
	   It would be the first time the PRI had recaptured a lost
governorship, and its only chance to do so before the 2000
presidential elections.
	   In a dramatic break from the traditional practice of having
party leaders chose candidates, the PRI held a primary election in
March that was open to all voters.
	   More than 233,000 people _ roughly 13 percent of the electorate
_ took part, choosing former Chihuahua Mayor Patricio Martinez over
a man favored by local party brokers.
	   Even National Action leaders admit the primary gave a boost to
the PRI.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo has endorsed such a primary as a way
to choose his successor. Zedillo has promised an end to the
traditional practice of the ``dedazo,'' or ``big touch,'' by which
outgoing presidents select the PRI's candidate.
	   In the northern state of Zacatecas, the new selection process
has backfired on the PRI, putting a sure victory Sunday at risk.
	   Angered at being shunned for the PRI's nomination, popular
Congressman Ricardo Monreal bolted from the PRI to run for the
leftist Democratic Revolution Party, taking many supporters with
him.
	   Although the leftist party had been a minor force in Zacatecas,
as throughout northern Mexico, polls show Monreal in a dead heat
with the PRI for what would be the Democratic Revolution Party's
first state-level victory outside of Mexico City.
	   The PRI held a sizable lead in polls in Durango, although
National Action appeared to be gaining. The leftist Labor Party,
weak elsewhere in Mexico, was also running strongly in Durango.
	   National Action leader Lujan says the election in Chihuahua is a
test of six years of his party's leadership, a ratification ``that
the party governs well, that the party is effective, that the party
is honest.''
	   Most say National Action has cut down on corruption. But soaring
crime in the state's largest city, Ciudad Juarez, and PRI
allegations of wrongdoing by National Action members have tarnished
the party.
	   Lujan said some voters ``expected too much'' from a change after
63 years of single-party government.
	   ``There was an expectation ... that all of their problems would
be solved instantly,'' he said.

Screen blockbuster gives Walter Lord second ride on bestseller

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Walter Lord did not stand on the deck of the
Titanic as the great ship went down 86 years ago, but it's easy to
come away with that impression after talking with ``Mr. Titanic.''
	   It's all there inside Lord's mind, more vivid than the
Technicolor of any cinematic blockbuster: deck plans and
staircases; carpeting and wallpaper; the glass-smooth water of the
North Atlantic and a looming iceberg; acts of heroism and
cowardice.
	   From the wheelchair he uses to move a body debilitated by
Parkinson's disease, the author of the seminal ``A Night to
Remember'' speaks of the night of April 14-15, 1912 with a
familiarity easily mistaken for the crystalline memories of a
witness.
	   Lord, whose 1955 book restored the nearly forgotten disaster to
America's cultural memory, observes that lifeboats on the starboarde
remarks on the amazing speed with which the ship Carpathia rushed
to rescue the survivors from their lifeboats.
	   Can Lord see it all in his head?
	   ``Everything,'' he responds crisply. ``What the different rooms
look like, the people smoking in the lifeboats.''
	   In the four decades since publication, ``A Night to Remember''
has never been out of print. This year, propelled by the runaway
success of the film ``Titanic,'' the book enjoyed a rare second run
on the bestseller lists. At 80, Lord is back in the spotlight.
	   In an April ceremony at the Ocean Liner Museum in Manhattan, the
institution's president, John Maxtone-Graham, presented Lord with a
miniature of one of Titanic's funnels, that reads: ``For Walter
Lord, Mr. Titanic, who single-handedly raised the vessel from the
bottom of the North Atlantic four decades ago.''
	   ``This is the guy who started it all,'' Maxtone-Graham told the
gathering.
	   A Baltimore native, a graduate of Princeton (1939) and of Yale
Law School (1946), Lord was a copywriter for the J. Walter Thompson
advertising agency when he stumbled into his life's work at a used
book store.
	   What he found was a British officer's diary of travels in the
South during the Civil War. Lord bought it, did some editing, and
it was published in 1954 as ``The Fremantle Diary.''
	   Lord's editor then encouraged him to write a book himself,
perhaps about that ship he was always talking about, the Titanic.
	   As a child, Lord sailed with his family on the Olympia, the
Titanic's sister ship on the White Star Line. As a history buff, he
was fascinated with great ocean liners and the Titanic's sinking in
the North Atlantic on its maiden voyage.
	   The Titanic tragedy was actually little remembered in the
mid-1950s, pushed to history's back pages by the horrors of the two
world wars, Lord theorizes. ``It came to seem for a while
unimportant and rather trivial to study the Titanic,'' he says.
	   Lord tracked down survivors by writing author's queries in
several New York newspapers and discovered some who ``had been
waiting for years to tell their stories.''
	   The 200-page book was an immediate hit with its minute-by-minute
reconstruction of the disaster: the ``unsinkable'' ship's collision
with an iceberg at 11:40 p.m.; the lowering of the first lifeboat
at 12:45 a.m.; the Titanic's disappearance beneath the surface at
2:20 a.m.; the first rescue of survivors by the Carpathia at 4:10
a.m. More than 1,500 of the 2,200 passengers and crew died.
	   The book's smooth narrative came from intense research. Lord
integrates survivor interviews and details culled from 1,200 pages
of evidence and testimony from British and American inquiries into
the wreck.
	   Like any good disaster tale, ``A Night to Remember'' illuminates
the endless branching of human decisions _ both flawed and brave _
that give a tragedy its shape: the hubris of Capt. Edward J. Smith,
who steamed forward despite repeated ice warnings; the folly of a
nearby ship, the California, in ignoring the Titanic's distress
call; the gallantry of men who stayed aboard to let women and
children get away; the paralysis of the White Star Line's managing
director, J. Bruce Ismay, who escaped in a lifeboat and went into
seclusion.
	   With all the amazing true stories, Lord professes astonishment
that James Cameron, who directed the movie, felt the need to add a
fictional romance.
	   Similar themes of courage and folly echo through many of the 10
books Lord wrote later: ``A Time to Stand,'' about the Alamo; ``Day
of Infamy,'' about Pearl Harbor; ``Incredible Victory,'' about the
Battle of Midway; ``The Past Lives On,'' about the integration of
the University of Mississippi. There was also a second Titanic
book, ``The Night Lives On.''
	   Lord developed Parkinson's disease in the early 1970s, and he
now takes 27 pills each day to try to control the symptoms. But
writing finally became too difficult, and he hasn't published a
book since 1986. ``My physical strength is just not there,'' he
says.
	   He continues to speak to groups. Otherwise, Lord, who never
married, spends much of his time in an apartment crammed with
historical memorabilia that range from the sacred (the faded ticker
tape that brought news of the Titanic disaster to the New York
Times) to the mundane (``Teatanic,'' a ship-shaped teapot).
	   Eventually, Lord says, all of his Titanic material, including
every known book on the disaster, will go to the National Maritime
Museum in Greenwich, England.

Lena Horne: singing serenely of stormy weather

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ When she was young, Lena Horne couldn't quite
cut the song ``Stormy Weather.''
	   ``I couldn't do it worth a toot,'' she says.
	   But life taught her to deliver it with such smoldering ease that
it became her signature song.
	   Now Miss Horne, who turned 81 on June 30, slips comfortably into
the verses about love and the misery of it.
	   ``But I'm at ease with the misery. So that's the way I sing this
song,'' she says, her dark eyes smiling above smooth, high
cheekbones.
	   On a recent sunny day in Manhattan, the first after two weeks of
rain, she gives her own weather report, playfully riding her
musical war-horse: ``Many days this past week there has been no sun
_ stormy weather ...,'' she sings in a melting oboe of a voice,
which still sounds youthful _ or rather, ageless.
	   ``Stormy Weather'' has become a touchstone of her life.
	   ``It's me, now,'' she says. ``It's from all the years of
musicians I've been with, the two husbands I've had, from different
people who've been important in my life. They all go into the
song.''
	   The woman who has torched the world's stages for six decades has
just recorded a new album of songs including ``Autumn in New
York,'' ``After You'' and ``Some of My Best Friends Are the
Blues.''
	   As she plays with the soaring phrases of Cole Porter and George
Gershwin, her fresh take on the old tunes turns cabaret sensuality
into the sublime.
	   But Miss Horne would really rather sound like Aretha Franklin.
	   ``I want to be Aretha. I want to sing like she does. She sings
so gloriously,'' Miss Horne says. ``I always loved Aretha Franklin
_ her freedom.'' Still, she thinks she sings better now than she
did when she was 40 or 50. ``It's easier for me to sing now,
because I swallowed whatever the frog was in my throat.''
	   Miss Horne's own talent was crowned this spring with an honorary
doctorate of humane letters from Yale University.
	   She is the picture of elegance as she sits in the Park Avenue
offices of Blue Note Records. Her short haircut, simple pearls and
black pants perfectly jibe with the minimalist decor. ``I think
Blue Note wanted a den grandmother, you know,'' she says, laughing.
	   The title of her latest album, ``Being Myself,'' is rooted in a
battle she says she's waged most of her life: to dare to be
herself.
	   She was 16 when she landed a job as a chorus-line dancer at
Harlem's Cotton Club in the 1930s, then broke into the nightclub
and Hollywood scenes as a kind of singing pinup girl. Some accused
the black singer of trying to ``pass'' into white culture with her
cafe-au-lait complexion, and a film studio even invented a makeup
for her called ``Light Egyptian.''
	   To her, it was a matter of survival.
	   Her father, a Brooklyn bar owner whom she remembers as ``a
hoodlum in the numbers racket,'' had divorced her mother when Lena
was 3. For several years, she lived with ``people all over the
South who were kind enough to take me in,'' then with her mother
and grandmother in New York.
	   ``My priorities were always very simple, I never wanted to be _
I guess now it's called a star. I just wanted to sing GOOD,'' she
says.
	   At first, singing was merely a job. ``I never had aspirations
about singing until I found out that I could make a little money,''
she says. Then she decided to learn and hone her craft, turning
especially to the musicians she was with who taught her new ways to
feel and think about a song.
	   The road to stardom, though, was paved with injustice. Miss
Horne may have smiled under the spotlights, but she seethed with
anger because her audiences were white; black people were not
allowed in the Cotton Club or most other places she played at that
time.
	   Miss Horne developed a classy act that combined earthiness and
elegance. She seduced both club and concert hall audiences with her
husky, velvet sound, brilliant smile and infectious joie de vivre.
	   In her mid-20s, she signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, appearing
in movie musicals like the 1943 ``Cabin in the Sky'' and, the same
year, ``Stormy Weather.''
	   She rose in the entertainment industry with the help of her
second husband, MGM music director Lennie Hayton, who was white.
Married in Paris in 1947, they faced angry reactions to their mixed
union from some in Hollywood.
	   By then, Miss Horne was finding her voice as a moral force, too.
	   In 1945, as she performed in a show at an Army base, she noticed
something peculiar and especially offensive: white European
prisoners of war were seated at the front of the audience while
black soldiers were forced to sit in back. That was the last straw,
she says.
	   She plunged into politics, fighting for equality. Along the way,
she befriended actor and singer Paul Robeson and, in the 1950s, she
was blacklisted with him during Sen. Joseph McCarthy's
anti-communist ``witch hunts.''
	   By the 1960s, she was one of the most visible celebrities
defending civil rights. She even threw a lamp at a patron who had
hurled an ethnic slur in a Beverly Hills restaurant.
	   The next decade brought tragedy and her biggest artistic
breakthrough.
	   In 1970 and '71, Miss Horne suffered the deaths of her father,
her husband and her son. She secluded herself, comforted by her
daughter, Gail Lumet. A friend, comedian Alan King, spent months
trying to persuade her to return to the stage. When she finally
did, she exploded with an artistry that surprised her.
	   In 1981, her Broadway show, ``The Lady and Her Music,'' won a
Tony award, and the show's recording won her the first of three
Grammys.
	   ``For the first time, I enjoyed listening to myself and seeing
what effect it had on the audience,'' she says of her
song-and-dance performance at age 65. ``They showed me the way, and
I began to like it.''
	   Today, she lives alone in Manhattan, and enjoys her private
life, including her 3-year-old great-grandson.

Hidden song shows Gary Allan's independence

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ If you wait 1:02 minutes after Gary
Allan's CD ``It Would Be You'' apparently has finished, you'll hear
a mournful acoustic guitar kick off the album's most striking song.
	   ``Judgement Day,'' the unlisted 12th selection, is about the
murder of an elderly store owner by three young men in a small
town. The angry lyrics, written by Allen Shamblin, aren't what
you're likely to hear on the country music hit parade, which is
peppered with harmless, peppy ditties or bombastic love ballads.
	   The 30-year-old Allan, from Long Beach, California, brings a
message to his music on his new album. In ``Judgement Day,'' he
sings about how parents today are raising children who don't have
many values.
	   Allan says his record company, Decca, didn't want the song on
the album. They compromised by adding it on as a hidden track
that's not terribly hard to find.
	   Elsewhere on Allan's second album are songs about the
temptations of drinking and cheating, like the new single, ``No Man
in His Wrong Heart.'' There's a fair number of traditional love
songs, too. The first single was ``It Would Be You,'' a top 10 hit.
	   ``I find I walk a fine line getting material that's true to my
heart and also works in the commercial machine,'' he said.
	   Allan's music is sturdy barroom honky-tonk he learned from his
father, Harley Herzberg, a musician who started bringing his son to
performances when he was a toddler.
	   The early musical education of Allan, born Gary Allan Herzberg,
centered on the music of Ernest Tubb, Merle Haggard, Buck Owens,
Willie Nelson and Marty Robbins.
	   Allan was good enough to merit an offer of a recording contract
from A and M Records when he was 15. His father refused to co-sign
the contract, telling Allan he couldn't justify committing him to a
seven-year contract at such an early age.
	   ``And he said I had a lot left to learn, that I still imitated
people,'' Allan said. ``And in hindsight, I think he was right. I
imitated Merle Haggard and I imitated George Jones.''
	   At the time, he considered it a bitter setback. For five years,
he played clubs only sparingly. After graduating from high school,
he served a hitch in the Army and then poured his energy into
starting a construction company.
	   For much of his 20s, Allan toiled on construction sites during
the day and played clubs at night. He got married, had three
daughters and got divorced. He sold the construction company when
he was offered a Nashville record deal about five years ago, only
to have the deal collapse. He sold cars to make ends meet and kept
plugging away in the clubs.
	   Overtures from Nashville scouts convinced him that he should
give the town another try, and he traveled to Music City and
recorded four songs in 1996.
	   A bidding war ensued. Allan asked two questions of all the
interested record executives: What did they want him to change, and
how fast would they release an album?
	   Shelia Shipley Biddy of Decca had the right answers: ``nothing''
and ``immediately.''
	   Allan's debut album, ``Used Heart for Sale,'' sold more than
250,000 and won favorable reviews. ``Judgement Day'' tested Biddy's
pledge of artistic freedom.
	   The hidden-track compromise seems to be working: The tune is
getting some airplay. Decca recently shipped singles of the song to
radio stations, so those who want to play it won't have to find the
hidden track.
	   But Decca will not promote the single.
	   ``If we go out and try to ram it up the charts, then it seems
negative, like Decca is trying to capitalize on these shootings
that are happening,'' said Decca's Rick Baumgartner, who promotes
Allan's records to radio stations. ``If the song sparks some
discussion and changes some attitudes, I think it will accomplish
what Gary had in mind.''

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ American jazz performers, a German
classical orchestra and folk singer Fairouz, symbol of Lebanon's
prewar heyday, will star in Baalbek this summer in the biggest year
for the international music and arts festival since the civil war.
	   Baalbek and its majestic Roman ruins, a two-hour drive from the
capital Beirut, were shunned by foreign tourists and art lovers
during the 1975-90 conflict as anti-Western Muslim extremists
turned the town in the Bekaa Valley into their stronghold.
	   As the government restored its authority over much of the
country, the festival resumed in 1997, ending a 23-year lapse.
	   But it was a somewhat shy start.
	   The festival was a shadow of the grandeur of the prewar
summer-long extravaganzas, which hosted international performers
like Rudolf Nureyev, the Berlin Philharmonic, Ella Fitzgerald and
famous Arab singers like Egypt's Umm Kalthoum.
	   Unlike last year's four days of performances before the Temple
of Bacchus, 14 nights are scheduled at Baalbek this summer, from
July 23 to Aug. 29, festival organizer May Arida said Thursday.
	   Most of the performances will be before the floodlit soaring
columns of the Temple of Jupiter _ just like in the old days.
	   More foreigners are expected, too. The only foreign acts last
year were a French orchestra and cellist Mstislav Rostropovitch.
The Lebanese dance troupe Caracalla played the other acts.
	   The U.S. decision to lift a ban on its citizens traveling to
Lebanon 10 months ago cleared the way for Americans to take part
for the first time since 1974.
	   The ban was imposed in 1987 after extremists kidnapped
Westerners during the chaos of the civil war. Some of the scores of
Western hostages were held in Baalbek, a city once accustomed to
marches in which gunmen trampled the U.S. flag.
	   American jazz pianist Herbie Hancock will perform Aug. 1 and
jazz singer Nina Simone a week later. Carl St. Claire will conduct
the Radio Symphony Orchestra of Stuttgart, Arida told a news
conference.
	   The emphasis on German performances this year is to mark the
centennial of the first archeological mission to Baalbek following
a landmark visit by Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany.
	   The Stuttgart orchestra of 106 musicians, 120 choirists from the
Choir Podium Musiker Foundation and four soloists will play
Beethoven's ``9th Symphony'' and Gershwin's ``An American in
Paris'' among other works. Frenchman Georges Pretre will conduct
two performances, and St. Claire of the United States will lead the
orchestra on one night.
	   For Lebanon, it is a cultural and entertainment encore.
	   What started as a recital at the citadel by a small group of
Lebanese and French poetry lovers in 1922 later became a
full-fledged international festival. Beginning in the late 1960s,
it drew world dance troupes, musicians, classical and folk
performances until the civil war struck.
	   Fairouz, the Lebanese singer who became synonymous with the
Baalbek International Festival, will sing excerpts from her best
oldies and re-enact some of her plays on six nights this summer.
	   ``People feel nostalgic about the past. A generation grew up not
knowing Baalbek,'' said Mansour Rahbani, who is directing Fairouz's
work. ``This is a new leap in remembering our past.''
	   Lebanese singer Fadia El-Hage, the Ensemble ``Sarband'' and the
Osnabruck Jugend Choir will perform traditional Hispano-Oriental
medieval music.
	   On the last two days of the festival, Urban Sax and Fire Organ
present a spectacle featuring choreographers and climbers across
the temple grounds _ and columns _ performing to the sound of
various instruments, choirs, soloists and fire organs. Performers
will wear otherworldly costumes with lighting suggesting an alien
invasion.
	   The price range for festival tickets runs from 30,000 Lebanese
pounds (dlrs 20) for a majority of the 3,400 seats to 196,000
pounds (dlrs 130) for limited first-class seating for each
performance.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. mediator Richard Holbrooke is
trying to get both Serbs and Albanians to set aside irreconcilable
differences over the future of Kosovo and concentrate on something
more immediate _ a cease-fire.
	   Holbrooke plans to return to Pristina, Kosovo's capital, for the
second time in two days on Sunday to meet with ethnic Albanian
factions on suspending the fighting that has rent the province for
months. He spent the night in Belgrade, capital of both Serbia and
Yugoslavia, where he met with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
on the same issue.
	   Holbrooke also met in Belgrade with Russian Deputy Foreign
Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky, who held separate talks with
Milosevic. Afterward, both the Russian and the American announced
they would be going jointly to Pristina to talk on Sunday with the
Albanians.
	   But with lack of agreement separating not only Serbs and
Albanians but Albanians themselves, chances of a long-term peaceful
stretch look slight.
	   As Holbrooke shuttled between Belgrade and Pristina Saturday, a
guerrilla spokesman dented U.S. hopes of getting Kosovo's Albanian
fighters and politicians to speak with one voice in their struggle
for independence.
	   The German news magazine Spiegel quoted a Kosovo Liberation Army
spokesman, Jakub Krasniqi, as saying the KLA would never take
orders from the Ethnic Albanians' main political leader, Ibrahim
Rugova, because his peaceful secession efforts had failed.
	   Unlike the Americans, Afansyevsky indicated that Russia did not
believe in talking with the KLA, saying there was no grounds to
negotiate with armed radicals who ``kill citizens who are loyal to
Serbia.''
	   Ethnic Albanian separatists want independence for Kosovo, a
province in southern Serbia where they outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
Serbia is the larger of the two republics remaining in Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds of people have died in Kosovo since Serb forces stepped
up efforts to crush militant resistance in February. Milosevic says
the crackdown is aimed at ethnic Albanian militants who have
targeted Serb police.
	   Clashes, meanwhile, were reported in southwestern Kosovo on
Saturday. Serb sources said police pushed back Albanian militants
who attacked Serb villagers at Movljane, a village 30 miles south
of Pristina. An Albanian report said police and armed Serb
villagers attacked Gornja Krusica, a nearby Albanian village,
killing one person.
	   In a separate incident, the state-run Tanjug news agency cited
an army statement that border troops exchanged fire with arms
smugglers crossing over from Albania. A different version was
reported by Kosovo Albanians, who said the army targeted three
Albanian-populated villages near the border.

Ben Affleck's measure for success: inner happiness
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: 'Armageddon' opened Wednesday &QL; 
 &UR; By CYNTHIA L. WEBB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARINA DEL REY, California (AP) _ When Ben Affleck looks back on
his life, he doesn't have to go far. There was his first movie role
at age 7 and the Academy Award at 25.
	   His introspection is worthy of an actor twice his age. In fact,
there is so much self-reflection, you feel you've joined ``Zen with
Ben.''
	   In less than a year, Affleck went from low-budget obscurity to
an Oscar-winner. Now he's a co-star in one of the summer's loudest
adventure movies, ``Armageddon.''
	   ``You have to make sure that you don't start feeling entitled,
so that you don't become spoiled, you don't become
self-indulgent,'' Affleck says. ``I want to grow and change, but I
don't want to grow and change for the worse.''
	   Affleck and co-writer Matt Damon, who met 17 years ago, turned
their screenplay for ``Good Will Hunting'' into an Academy Award
winner this year. Affleck said he thought about using his Oscar as
a hood ornament for his 1969 Cadillac, but finally put it on a
shelf in his rented Hollywood Hills apartment _ a place that has
become more of a pit stop than a residence because of his busy
schedule.
	   As Affleck sits next to a hotel window for an interview, the sun
dapples his stubbled face. Wearing jeans and brown work boots,
propped comfortably on a coffee table, he has a Camel Light in one
hand and three cans of Diet Coke nearby.
	   Affleck has been in the business since he was 7 when his
mother's friend cast him in an independent production. He went on
to work in a PBS series and other television projects before
joining ``School Ties'' in 1992.
	   He gained notice last year playing a guy who falls for a lesbian
in Kevin Smith's ``Chasing Amy,'' a project whose budget would have
covered only one production hour for Disney's dlrs 135 million-plus
``Armageddon.''
	   In ``Armageddon,'' he plays A.J., a scrappy oil driller who
joins a team contracted to save the world from an asteroid.
	   He says doing an action flick is one more project, not a
sellout. Every role he takes on embodies an essence of him, he
says.
	   ``There's a certain sensibility and humor that I have in this
movie that is similar to my own, but I try to stay away from
playing myself,'' Affleck says.
	   A.J., his character in ``Armageddon,'' is trying to kindle a
newfound love while he fights to rescue the world. More essence.
Meanwhile, Affleck himself is trying to manage his success while
maintaining personal and romantic relationships. He's done the
random dating thing and questioned the virtue of pretty over brainy
in his bachelor days.
	   ``I'm ultimately romantic. At times I will get very swept away,
and then it can sometimes become overwhelming and I run away,'' he
says.
	   Affleck had a 10-year on-again, off-again relationship with a
woman that ended last year despite counseling and reconciliation
attempts.
	   ``I've made enough mistakes to realize that one of the things
that's really important is to keep a certain part of your life to
yourself,'' he says. ``I've got to maintain some sense of normalcy
and sanity in my life.''
	   That means details of his courtship with girlfriend Gwyneth
Paltrow are sacred.
	   ``I don't like to gossip. I'm very private. Even my friends
complain and say, 'Why didn't you tell us?''' he said.
	   ``Why would you want people to know the intimate secrets that
you share _ the way you are with somebody who you are really close
to?'' he asked. ``The point of an intimate relationship is that
it's intimate. You don't make yourself vulnerable to the world _
it's to that person ... and that's what is special about it.''
	   He said marriage is not in the near future, though.
	   ``I love life. I really do. I like to watch the sun set. I like
to have adventures,'' says the actor who enjoys riding his three
motorcycles. His next adventure will be in Georgia, where he is
filming the romantic comedy ``Forces of Nature'' opposite Sandra
Bullock.
	   Damon and Affleck are also working on two more scripts, one they
owe to Castle Rock for buying their script and one to Miramax for
releasing the film. Affleck also is working solo on his own script.
	   Born in Berkeley and raised in Cambridge, Affleck's parents
split-up when he was 11.
	   ``I never had a contentious relationship with my father,'' he
said. His dad, who works in a rehabilitation clinic, is still a
part of his life, and his schoolteacher mother accompanied him to
the Oscars.
	   A short-lived stint at Occidental College in Los Angeles ended
when Affleck found that juggling acting and school was too much.
	   He chose Hollywood. He played a high schooler in the 1993 movie
``Dazed and Confused,'' and a Korean War veteran in ``Going All the
Way'' in 1997. He played a blue-collar tough guy in ``Good Will
Hunting,'' an angel with Damon in Kevin Smith's upcoming ``Dogma,''
and took on a British accent for a new project with Paltrow called
``Shakespeare in Love.''
	   Affleck often ends his thoughts with the question, ``You know
what I mean?'' His comments are peppered with words like
``tawdry,'' ``vapid'' and ``acrimonious.''
	   ``I probably talk too much and don't listen enough. I try to be
sensitive, but I don't succeed all the time,'' he said in his
rapid-fire delivery. ``I'm pretty easy going and pretty comfortable
in my own skin. But I'm ambitious. I try to work hard and I have a
lot of goals. I want to do 20 things at once.''
	   Affleck was toned and tan for ``Armageddon'' (thanks to
mandatory tanning bed sessions), but as Smith says, it's hard to
make the 6-foot-3-inch, brown-eyed actor look bad.
	   ``He's one of my favorite actors on the planet,'' says Smith,
who remembered Affleck for leaving post-production thank-you notes.
``He's the template, the role model for the actor in the 21st
century.''
	   But ``Armageddon'' director Michael Bay, who made Will Smith and
Nicolas Cage action film contenders, says he initially wasn't sure
he made the right choice in Affleck.
	   ``I'm like, 'Uh oh,''' Bay says. ``I hadn't found the thing I
liked about him, that spark, and it takes you a while. ... Ben was
trying too hard.''
	   Bay found the charm he was looking for after the first week of
shooting. ``He got a lot more comfortable,'' the director says.
Producer Jerry Bruckheimer says simply: ``He can have a career in
whatever he wants. He's that good. It's up to him.''
	   Affleck knows stardom can go as easily as it comes. But there is
more, he says.
	   ``You don't have any way of gauging whether or not someone's
happy by the movies they are doing or their salary, but whether or
not they've made peace with themselves,'' Affleck says. ``That's a
continuing project for me.
	   ``I hope there are better years ahead. The Oscar is certainly
something they say in your obituary. I hope to have things that I
look back on with much more satisfaction, like having children and
having lifelong relationships that were meaningful,'' he says.
	   ``I hope they say something like: Devoted husband and father,
humanitarian or philanthropist, you know? Just the small things.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The New York Yankees became the first team in 86
years to win 60 of its first 80 games, using Orlando Hernandez's
pitching and Chad Curtis' two-run single in the sixth to beat the
Baltimore Orioles 4-3 Saturday.
	   The Yankees joined the 1912 New York Giants, 1907 Chicago Cubs
and 1902 Pittsburgh Pirates as the only teams in modern major
league history to start the season 60-20.
	   Hernandez (3-1), the Cuban defector who was spending his first
Independence Day in this country, allowed six hits and two walks in
eight innings. Mariano Rivera got his 21st save.
	   Curtis' two-run single off Alan Mills scored Tino Martinez and
Tim Raines, who reached against starter Doug Drabek (5-9).
 &UR; Blue Jays 8, Devil Rays 0 &QC; 
	   In Toronto, Chris Carpenter pitched a four-hitter and Carlos
Delgado had two homers and five RBIs as Toronto handed Tampa Bay
its fifth straight loss.
	   Carpenter (5-3), who allowed seven runs in 2 1-3 innings in his
last start Saturday against Atlanta, walked two and struck out
three in his second shutout of his career.
	   Delgado went 3-for-4 with a three-run homer in the sixth, a solo
shot in the eighth and an RBI double in the first off Dennis
Springer (2-11).
 &UR; White Sox 3, Red Sox 0 &QC; 
	   In Boston, Chicago's John Snyder outdueled Korean Jin Ho Cho and
Mike Cameron hit a solo homer in the fifth to give the White Sox
the win in a matchup of pitchers making their first major league
starts.
	   Snyder (1-0), who gave up six runs in 1 2-3 innings in his only
big-league appearance Tuesday, allowed five hits in 7 2-3 innings.
Bill Simas pitched the ninth for his fifth save.
	   Boston's Nomar Garciaparra went 0-for-2, ending his 24-game
hitting streak, the longest in the majors this season.
	   Cho (0-1) allowed six hits and one run in six innings in his
major league debut.
 &UR; Tigers 4, Twins 2 &QC; 
	   In Minneapolis, Justin Thompson won his sixth straight road
start, limiting the Twins to eight hits in eight-plus innings as
Detroit beat Minnesota for its fourth victory in five games.
	   Thompson (7-8) matched a season high with eight strikeouts and
allowed only one walk. The left-hander, 7-2 on the road and 0-6 at
Tiger Stadium, left after allowing consecutive singles to open the
ninth.
	   Todd Jones got the last three outs for his 14th save.
	   Dan Serafini (3-1) took the loss.

Russian immigrants transform musical life in Israel

	   KIRYAT GAT, Israel (AP) _ Sitting in tiny chairs or crosslegged
on the floor, dozens of kindergarten students listened with rapt
attention as guitarist Kobi Fieman filled the room with the soft,
melodious sounds of a Spanish ballad.
	   As if to break the spell, percussionist Josef Mushaiev launched
into La Cucaracha, Tico-Tico and other Latin American melodies. The
youngsters clapped and swung with the music.
	   Fieman and Mushaiev are immigrants from the former Soviet Union.
Along with scores of compatriots, they form the backbone of a new
program that brings music to pre-schoolers in Israel's development
towns which have become a byword for neglect, unemployment and
discontent.
	   The kindergartens are one of many areas in which Russian
musicians and music teachers _ who arrived as part of a wave of
800,000 immigrants over the past decade _ have transformed the
musical life of their new homeland.
	   The number of professional orchestras has swelled from four to
11, in addition to the creation of innumerable smaller ensembles
and choirs. Israeli music academies, universities and high schools
today have a choice of the finest teachers.
	   The immigration began with a trickle in the early 1970s when the
Soviet government first allowed some Jews to leave. It swelled to a
flood two decades later when all restrictions were lifted. Among
the newcomers were 12,000 musicians and music teachers.
	   ``We'll all have to go to concerts at least three times a week
to provide work for them,'' quipped the late Yizhak Modai, who was
finance minister at the time.
	   The most talented found work in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv, with the
Israel Philharmonic or one of the other major orchestras. Rudolph
Barshai, founder of the prestigious Moscow Chamber Orchestra,
became conductor of the Israel Chamber Orchestra.
	   In veteran orchestras, Russian immigrants account for 35 percent
of the players, while in newer ones more than 90 percent of the
players are of Russian origin. The chorus of the New Israeli Opera
is predominantly Russian, as is the opera's 86-piece orchestra.
	   Russian immigrants also fill the symphony orchestras of the two
music academies in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. ``Without them I just
wouldn't have an orchestra,'' said conductor Aharon Harlap.
	   However, many could not find work in the big cities and had no
choice but to settle in the outlying areas. Mushaiev, the
percussionist, moved from Rishon Lezion, a Tel Aviv suburb, to
Sderot, a development town of 20,000 in the Negev Desert.
	   ``I was working in a restaurant in Rishon Lezion, chopping up
vegetables for salads, but I just couldn't afford an apartment in
that area, so I came south,'' said Mushaiev who is originally from
Tashkent in the former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan.
	   The first town to benefit from the influx was Beersheba, capital
of the Negev, where a 25-piece chamber orchestra, the Sinfonietta,
was formed. Later, it was increased to 40 players, and has acquired
a national and even international reputation.
	   Further south, in the industrial town of Dimona, home to
Israel's nuclear reactor, Russian immigrants put together the
20-piece chamber group, the Camerata. The city can afford to pay
them only a nominal salary, and most of the players have other
jobs. The lucky ones teach music. Others work in the factories.
	   ``Twice or three times a week they dress up and come for a
performance or a rehearsal,'' said Yossi Artman, the ensemble's
conductor. ``It restores their self-respect. It reminds them of who
they are.''
	   The kindergarten program, aimed at children from low-income
families, offers another outlet for the musicians.
	   The youngsters are carefully prepared for each concert. They
often dress in white shirts, with paper bow ties of a uniform color
they have chosen.
	   ``I play them a tape with the music they are going to hear at
the next concert,'' said music teacher Marina Guttman, from Baku,
Azerbaijan. ``I show them instruments and let them touch them. I
talk to them about the music, trying to fire their imagination.''
	   Luva Yunger, a cellist, performs together with a pianist and
violinist. ``When I played a solo, the Swan from Saint-Saens'
`Carnival des Animaux,' the kids were moving their arms in a
sinuous way like a swan,'' she said.
	   Hava Rabinowich, teacher at the Dvora Kindergarten in Kiryat
Gat, said ``before these musicians came some of the kids had no
idea what a concert was.''
	   Whether in small class rooms or the concert halls of the big
cities, the Russians have made their mark, said Motte Schmidt, a
leading Israeli violinist and an adviser to the government on
absorbing immigrant musicians.
	   ``Go to the most God-forsaken backwater, and there, in some
basement, you will find a trio or a string quartet. That is the
difference the Russian immigrants have made,'' he said.

his first British tour. Jackson appeared briefly on a viewing
platform, wearing dark glasses and a ``Sgt. Pepper'' suit in the
style of the Beatles.
	   Linda Ronstadt, Placido Domingo and a mariachi band fired up
100,000 sweltering fans in New York's Central Park for the close of
the First New York International Festival of the Arts.
Cuban-American pop singer Gloria Estefan was also on the bill for
the Latin-flavored theme of ``love and music.''
	   And the Ramones, the band that gave the world ``Cretin Hop,''
``Teen-age Lobotomy'' and other short, loud, fast and somewhat
silly punk tunes, celebrated its 15th anniversary.
	   Five years ago: ``In the Line of Fire'' starred Clint Eastwood
as a Secret Service agent and John Malkovich as an assassin. The
film was directed by Wolfgang Petersen.
	   Spoken 10 years ago:
	   ``Michael knows the public thinks he's weird, strange and
unusual, but he's nothing like that. That's just people's
tendencies to magnify those in the spotlight. Michael knows where
he stands, and that's what counts.'' _ Pop star Michael Jackson's
sister, LaToya.
	   Spoken one year ago:
	   ``If I said, `Well, we are a hot band,' that's true. We play hot
music. But that's inadequate to describe the sort of slower torch
numbers or the calypsos or the sort of Hawaiian stuff or bluegrass
influence _ all that stuff that goes into the mix to make a
Squirrel Nut Zipper sound or record. I can't even begin to describe
it.'' _ Tom Maxwell, a vocalist, guitarist and saxophonist in the
septet.

Five questions with Sandy Dalal: Young designer's star on the rise
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY339 &QL; 
 &UR; By DEEPTI HAJELA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ With dark hair and emerald-green eyes,
21-year-old Sandy Dalal could be mistaken for one of the models of
his menswear fashions.
	   And why not? He's on People magazine's list of the 50 ``most
beautiful people in the world'' for 1998, an honor that he
describes as ``a little weird.''
	   How did the People magazine spot come about?
	   ``As far I know, it was a telephone call, and they said, 'You've
been chosen to be one of the 50,' and I said, 'All right.' I wasn't
really too familiar with the issue,'' he recalls.
	   The ``most beautiful people'' list links Dalal's face and name
with such high-profile celebrities as Gwyneth Paltrow, Julia
Louis-Dreyfus, Erykah Badu and Leonardo DiCaprio.
	   ``For me, it's the clothes that are supposed to be seen,'' says
Dalal, the youngest recipient of the Perry Ellis Award for New
Talent, presented by the Council of Fashion Designers of America.
	   Dalal, a native of New York, is a designing talent whose two
menswear lines have been praised for their tailoring, beautiful
fabrics and mix of patterns.
	   The son of Indian parents, Dalal became interested in fashion at
age 10, when he accompanied his mother on a six-week trip to
clothing factories in Asia.
	   His family is very involved in his business. His parents'
Manhattan apartment is his studio. Dalal's father, who is an
accountant, manages his finances. His mother, who scouts global
production facilities for other designers, does the same for her
son.
	   Dalal's start-up capital came from money set aside for his
fourth year at the University of Pennsylvania. When the nationally
ranked fencer finished school in three years (there are two papers
he has yet to turn in), his parents decided to invest the money in
his business.
	   1. How does it feel to know you're known for your face as much
as for your clothes?
	   Dalal: Right now it's a cool gig where I can feed off the
clothes and the clothes can feed off me, and rightfully so. We come
from the same mind and heart. It's OK right now, it's cool.
	   2. Does it ever bother you?
	   Dalal: I'm as savvy as anyone else. It's going to go on for a
little while and then I'll get glasses and get all wrinkly and no
one will want to see me anymore, which is fine, which is cool.
	   3. Is there more pressure on you as a designer after winning the
Perry Ellis Award?
	   Dalal: No, because just like anything else, good lines come,
good lines go, bad lines come, bad lines go. Nothing will ever be
perfect. You always hope for a good season, hope things will go
well, hope for good reviews. But how can you judge someone's
growing up? It's going to be good sometimes, it's going to be bad
sometimes.
	   4. What kind of person do you design your clothes for?
	   Dalal: There's not really a prototype person, it has nothing to
do with their age, it's just a guy who just has this air of
self-confidence and youth. That attitude, people dig that. I dig
that. I find it really attractive when you find someone who's just
so self-confident, who's just like, not cocky, it's just like
they're comfortable with who they are. To me, it's a cool feeling
to have.
	   4 1-2 . Any plans for a women's line?
	   Dalal: I would love to. I've started working on stuff. I'm not
going to rush, I have enough on my plate right now. I'm not in dire
straits to do something else.
	   5. It seems like you don't take yourself too seriously, despite
the awards and fame. How come?
	   Dalal: How seriously can you take it? Clothes don't talk back to
you. You take people seriously, you take relationships seriously.
You take the idea that one day you will have a family seriously.
Those are my real goals in life. This is a cool gig, it's amazing.
If it lasts forever, that would be even more amazing, but if it
doesn't, you're not going to shoot yourself.

Celebrity musical missteps: Hey, Mr. William Shatner, play a song
</HEADLINE>
for me &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ``Hey!
	   ``Mr. Tambourine Man!
	   ``Play a SONG for me!''
	   _William ``Capt. Kirk'' Shatner, 1968
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; By TED ANTHONY &QC; 
 &UR; AP National Writer &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Sing. Sing a song. Sing out loud. Sing out
strong.
	   Wait. On second thought, don't sing at all. For pity's sake,
just go away.
	   Leonard Nimoy probably should have gone away. William Shatner
definitely should have gone away. Sebastian Cabot, Buddy Ebsen, Joe
Pesci and, Lord help us, Watergate's Sen. Sam Ervin and ``Tic Tac
Dough's'' Wink Martindale really should have gone away, too.
	   But they didn't. Instead, they decided to augment their
sometimes soaring, sometimes flagging careers by recording what in
some realms might be considered music.
	   ``Golden Throats,'' an occasional series of compact discs from
the folks at Rhino Records, resurrects these stars' questionable
decisions like so many rotting graveyard corpses. In four agonizing
CDs, ``Golden Throats'' compiles the most outlandish examples of
celebrities' tuneful dilettantery and offers them up in hunks hefty
enough to choke on.
	   ``They never imagined we'd be digging this stuff up,'' says Gary
Peterson, a Rhino producer who came up with the ``Golden Throats''
concept a decade ago with his then-partner, Pat Sierchio.
	   ``Can you imagine being in the recording studio, seeing this
going on?'' says Sierchio.
	   It hurts to listen to Shatner, with his staccato voice, emoting
the late, lamented John Lennon's ``Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds''
or belting out a ``Mr. Tambourine Man'' that suggests he ran out of
laxatives the night before. It hurts to hear the voice of Andy
Griffith _ the voice that comforted Opie and gently upbraided
Barney Fife _ drawling through the folk-tune-cum-rock-ballad
``House of the Rising Sun.''
	   It hurts to hear Nimoy, in full Ronald Reagan twang, nasaling
out a decidedly un-Spockian ``I Walk the Line.'' It hurts even to
contemplate Ebsen singing ``Your Cheatin' Heart.'' And Martindale
doing a John Wayne-ish ``Peace in the Valley''? We'll put an ``X''
in the middle square to block, Pilgrim.
	   What were these guys thinking? And what's with poet Rod McKuen's
frenetic version of ``Mule Train''? Isn't there a federal statute
that bars anyone but Boxcar Willie from doing that?
	   ``With some of them, you really have people who thought they
were doing something profound. Shatner is one of those. Others did
it because the producer told them to,'' says Barry Hansen, the rock
folklorist better known as novelty-record advocate Dr. Demento.
	   The vocal train wrecks get more reality-defying _ like a
playlist from Radio Free Hades:
	   _Jack Palance huffing ``The Green, Green Grass of Home.''
	   _Mae West wheezing through ``Day Tripper.''
	   _Phyllis Diller sassing out ``(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction''
with a few one-liners thrown in between verses.
	   ``Clearly somebody said, `Oh, Phyllis, you should do some rock
'n' roll,''' Dr. Demento says.
	   Ervin, the just-folks North Carolina lawmaker whose Senate
Watergate Committee helped bring Nixon down, was sent into the
studio by Columbia Records to capitalize on his ``profile as a
feed-store philosopher.'' What emerged was ``Senator Sam at Home,''
an unholy amalgam of harmonica music, monologues about patriotism
and, yes, his spoken cover of Simon and Garfunkel's ``Bridge Over
Troubled Water'':
	   ``When yo' weary.
	   ``Feelin' smawl.
	   ``When teahs are in yo' eyes.
	   ``I will dry 'dem awl.''
	   Granted, some selections aren't awful. The erstwhile Cassius
Clay does a palatable ``Stand By Me.'' Telly Savalas' rendition of
``I Walk the Line'' isn't utterly unlistenable (if you forget it's
Kojak singing).
	   Not that these anomalies debuted as chart-toppers. When
Shatner's 1968 album, ``The Transformed Man,'' emerged ignobly from
Decca's studios, it wasn't exactly greeted kindly. One critic said
it ``displays a blissful exuberance ... unfathomable to the
befuddled listener.'' Lamented another: Shatner ``sounds in dire
need of padded restraints.''
	   There's a reason. ``It was a pretty cheap thing to do _ lease a
couple tunes and bring the guy in,'' says Paul Mawhinney, operator
of Record-Rama Sound Archives in Pittsburgh, a staggeringly
comprehensive store and music library.
	   So why are these things popular now? They're funny, yes, but
they're also vaguely subversive _ toward both music and performer.
	   ``It's sort of a rebellious act,'' says Marvin Pippert, who
teaches a course on popular culture and rock 'n' roll at Roanoke
College in Virginia. ``It tears down celebrity.''
	   Peterson and Sierchio began with a poor-taste contest in 1987,
when Rhino was but a 10-employee operation. They'd try to outdo
each other.
	   ``We went to garage sales, and we kept finding more and more of
these records. They were 25, 50 cents,'' says Sierchio, now an
independent producer.
	   ``They were just trying to expand their celebrity,'' Peterson
says. ``I'm sure they were dead serious. For the most part, the
appeal is in the unintentional humor.''
	   Adds Sierchio: ``Our big sorrow here is that Shatner stopped at
one album. He should have taken the cue from Nimoy and done three
or four.''
	   Understandably, it has required some careful explaining on
Rhino's part to secure artists' permission. Merv Griffin and
Theodore Bikel were pleased to be part of the irony; on the other
hand, Peterson says, ``I don't think Wink Martindale really
understood the whole thing.''
	   In these days of boomer nostalgia, ironic Gen-X retrocool and
``Nick at Nite'' predominance, the series sells well _ ``enough to
keep on doing them,'' Peterson says. The latest: this year's
``Golden Throats 4: Celebrities Butcher the Beatles.''
	   And who can tell which of today's chaff will be tomorrow's
inadvertent wheat? Will it be a David Hasselhoff? A John Tesh? Or
something even more obscure lurking just beneath taste's surface,
as yet undiscovered by the maestros of musical miscasting?
	   ``This is something that's not done as much today. Modern
celebrities may be a little more savvy,'' Dr. Demento says. But
he's certain of one thing: ``In 2010, some of this stuff that's
being made now will sound funny to somebody.''

 &UR; Secret Prey. By John Sandford. Putnam. dlrs 24.95
 &UR; By Waka Tsunoda &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Pulitzer-prize winning journalist John Sanford
debuted as a thriller writer nine years ago with his riveting
``Rules of Prey.''
	   Seven somewhat lackluster ``Prey'' novels followed, but now the
author is back in top form with his latest, ``Secret Prey.''
	   The novel, of course, stars Lucas Davenport, a Porsche-driving
Minneapolis cop, who has made a fortune from his sideline business,
a computer software company.
	   His case this time begins when Daniel Kresge, the CEO of a
midwestern bank, is shot to death while deer hunting with his top
executives: Susan O'Dell, James T. Bone, Wilson McDonald and
Terrance Robles.
	   Practically everyone around him is a suspect because Kresge, for
one thing, was in the middle of merger talks with a bigger bank,
which would have resulted in the loss of jobs for some executives.
He was also about to divorce his wife, so Mrs. Kresge may have had
a motive, too, not to mention Bone, who is having an affair with
her.
	   Lucas tries to catch the murderer as Bone, O'Dell and McDonald
and their supporters plot and scheme against each other to get
Kresge's job.
	   He gets briefly distracted from the case when his former lover
inexplicably gets her house firebombed, and his long-time friend, a
nun, is bludgeoned by an unknown assailant, but he soon finds a
connection with those attacks and Kresge's murder, and zeroes in on
the killer.
	   Unlike some of the previous ``Prey'' novels, which seemed
contrived and forced, ``Secret Prey'' develops naturally and
suspensefully with lively dialogue. Sandford even manages to weave
Lucas' personal life smoothly into the general plot with a touch of
humor. As a result, Lucas comes through as the most appealing of
all ``Prey'' novels.
	   By far the best ``Prey'' book so far.

	   ``Adore,'' (Virgin) _ The Smashing Pumpkins
	   ``Ava Adore,'' the first single on The Smashing Pumpkins' new
CD, is a great song, the kind that helped propel the group into one
of alternative rock's biggest acts.
	   It's a gothic tale of obsession set to pounding synthesizer
beats. Surprisingly, though, it's nothing like the rest of
``Adore,'' which includes some of the group's prettiest tunes ever.
	   Lead singer and songwriter Billy Corgan decided to slow the
tempo for the trio's follow-up to the 1995 double CD ``Mellon
Collie and the Infinite Sadness.''
	   It mattered little that the Pumpkins produced ``Adore'' without
drummer Jimmy Chamberlin, fired two years ago for using heroin with
backup keyboardist Jonathan Melvoin, who died of a drug overdose.
	   ``Adore'' may not have the epic scope of ``Mellon Collie,'' but
its mellow feel _ especially ``Perfect,'' ``Once Upon a Time'' and
``Annie-Dog'' _ makes the work just as powerful.
	   _ By David Kligman, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Mya'' (University/Interscope Records) _ Mya
	   Eighteen-year-old Mya, a singer-dancer from Washington, D.C.,
shines on her self-entitled debut despite being bogged down
occasionally with some run-of-the mill material.
	   The album's first hit, ``It's All About Me'' (with Sisqo from
Dru Hill) is one of the CD's high points. It's a sultry tune in
which a woman demands total devotion from her man, if only for one
night.
	   She also does well on the funky ``We're Gonna Make You Dance,''
and the mid-tempo ``Movin' On,'' which she co-wrote.
	   But there are a couple of misses, like the uninspiring dance
track ``What Cha Say,'' written by Mya, and ``If You Died I
Wouldn't Cry 'Cause You Never Loved Me Anyway,'' a song that would
be forgettable if it weren't so vicious. It's worth listening to
just to hear Mya's angelic voice sing lyrics like, ``You can get
struck by lightning, washed away by the sea, burned in a fire, just
don't bring it back to me.''
	   Fans looking for Mya's other hit, ``Ghetto Superstar,'' with
Wyclef, Pras and ODB of the Wu-Tang Clan shouldn't look here; it's
on the ``Bulworth'' soundtrack.
	   _ By Nekesa Mumbi Moody, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Ozomatli'' (Almo Sounds) _ Ozomatli
	   The band says Ozomatli is the Aztec god of dance, about whom one
learns more in the details of their debut CD.
	   Ozomatli mixes rap, funk, hip-hop, ska and several styles of
Latin music, which isn't surprising in a band with blacks, whites,
Mexicans, Cubans and a Japanese percussionist. Their musical and
ethnic diversity reflects their home: Los Angeles, where Ozomatli's
energetic live shows have earned them a loyal following.
	   An 11-piece band that plays in so many styles could sound
contrived and top-heavy, but each of the 12 songs is tight and
rich. Most of the tracks get up and dare you to not dance.
	   Chali 2na's raps augment the scene and fit in perfectly with
Ozomatli's world of sound, especially on ``Superbowl Sundae,''
which begins with a ponderous sitar solo.
	   Although the band describes itself as ``heavily politicized,''
only one track, ``Coming War,'' seems heavy-handed. This album is
worth checking out.
	   _ By Brian Bergstein, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Missing Man Formation'' (Grateful Dead Records) _ Vince
Welnick
	   Keyboard man Vince Welnick will be the first to admit that the
death of Jerry Garcia in August 1995 hit him hard. So hard, the
then-keyboardist for the Grateful Dead went into a deep depression.
	   ``Missing Man Formation'' is the therapy session that helped
Welnick find the light again as well as a paean to his friend and
inspiration. The former keyboardist for the Tubes had a hand in
writing all the songs.
	   The disc has a Dead feel to it: loose production, jams and
variety. A single listen won't do it for this intensely personal
disc but it's worth the extra time to cultivate the grooves tucked
away here.
	   _ By James Reindl, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Blues After Sunset'' (Black Top) -- Henry Butler
	   New Orleans pianist Henry Butler has a deep voice, a powerful
left hand and a rollicking right one. The combination on ``Blues
After Sunset'' is rhythm 'n' blues stride at its best.
	   Butler keeps a back room feel to his music on this disc with the
help of guitarist Snooks Eaglin and harmonica man Mark Kazanoff.
Butler, a self-proclaimed ``work in progress,'' already has earned
his jazz credentials. Turning to blues, he finds himself at home
with his New Orleans heritage.
	   _ By James Reindl, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Turn Up the Heat'' (Alligator Records) _ Shemekia Copeland
	   Comparisons with reigning blues queen and Alligator label mate
Koko Taylor will be inevitable for Shemekia Copeland. But the
daughter of the late, great Johnny Clyde Copeland can stand on her
own, even at 19. The voice is big, the passion deep.
	   But where Taylor is a true product of the South, Copeland
learned the blues from her Texan father though she grew up in
Harlem. The result is soul with an urban edge on her debut disc.
	   Copeland proves she's adept at a variety of styles, rocking to
ballads, although she's best on the up-tempo numbers. That Copeland
is another strong female voice in the blues chorus is the best
thing about her arrival.
	   _ By James Reindl, Associated Press Writer.

	   ``Afro-Latino'' (Putumayo) _ various
	   Once again, we find that some of the best Cuban music coming out
these days isn't from Cuba. Just pop on ``Me Vuelvo Guajiro'' by
the Cape Verdean band Tam 2000, featured on the new Putumayo
release ``Afro-Latino.'' It is Cuban to the core.
	   An electric guitar picks out the groove that modern salsa bands
handle with a piano or tres. And despite the liner notes'
description of a ``searing Cameroonean horn section'' there are no
horns to be heard; a somewhat cheesy synthesizer responds to the
vocals instead. But despite the instrumentation, the result sounds
as Cuban as anything out there.
	   The rest of the disc keeps pace, from Ricardo Lemvo and Makina
Loka's ``Mambo Yo'' (from their excellent disc also just out on
Putumayo) to Julian Avalos and Afro-Andes' soothing ``Mujer
Magica.'' There are classic tracks _ Orchestre Baobab's ``El Son de
Llama'' _ and predictable ones: Africando's ``Yay Boy.''
	   There are songs from Africa, the United States, Cuba and other
parts of Latin America. The overall result is a wonderful
collection of Cuban sounds absorbed and perfected by groups across
the globe.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``The Music of Brazil: The Rough Guide'' (World Music Network) _
various
	   There are hundreds of Brazilian music compilations available in
the United States, and there should be; Brazilian music is
incredible. This one distinguishes itself, however, by staying away
from the conventional favorites _ Tom Jobim, Caetano Veloso,
Daniela Mercury. Maybe that's because it is designed to accompany a
travel guide to Brazil. It's also available in music stores, and is
well worth checking out.
	   The disc is diverse. There is some traditional music like Ivan
Lins' ``Provei,'' Renato Braz's ``Anabela'' and Leny Andrade's
``Voce Vai Ver''; some samba _ Thobias da Vai-Vai's ``Caymmi Mostra
ao Mundo o Que a Bahia e Mangueira Tem,'' Ze Paulo's ``Batom
Vermelho''; forro music like Dominguinhos and Convidados' ``A Volta
da Asa Branca''; Amazon Indian-flavored music, Marlui Miranda and
Uakti's ``Tchori Tchori''; and even a Brazilian country song, Pena
Branca and Xavantinho's ``Santo Reis.''
	   Stealing the show, however, is the rap cover of Jorge Benjor's
``Charles Ango 45'' by the Bahian group Muzenza _ a real party hit.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Double Barrel'' (Hannibal) _ Jazz Jamaica
	   This is the second disc by a group of London-based Jamaicans who
meld jazz with ska, the precursor to reggae. And it is the second
great one.
	   With a driving reggae bass line that would make even the most
timid move, the band belts out mostly instrumental jazz and ska
classics in a style all its own. Impressive horn and piano solos
break up the long grooves, which themselves are pretty rocking.
	   There are ska standards like ``Confucius'' and ``Monkey Man,''
jazz tunes like ``Butterfly'' and ``Dewey Square,'' and even a
couple of pop tunes: ``I Heard It Through the Grapevine'' and
``Walk on By.'' Only the latter fail, coming out sounding like
souped-up Muzak.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Galo Negro'' (Putumayo) _ Sam Mangwana
	   Putumayo presents this disc as an Afro-Latin fusion, but there's
really little of a Latin element any more than there is in African
music in general. If anything, this disc by Congolese Sam Mangwana
is pan-African, incorporating elements from across the continent.
	   ``Galo Negro'' sounds more Angolan than anything else;
``Manjani'' and ``Ghetto'' are unmistakably South African, though
sung in Lingala; ``Cara Mabanzo'' is distinctly Zairian. The
closest thing to a Latin reference is ``Elima,'' whose accordion
riffs sound like they could come from northern Brazil. ``Maloba''
even has echoes of Celtic music. Overall, Mangwana hits with a disc
that is good _ but nowhere near as great as his groundbreaking
recordings of the 1970s.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Supralingua'' (Ryko) _ Mickey Hart and Planet Drum
	   Sampling vocals from Tibet, Africa, the Middle East and Latin
America, Mickey Hart has woven an extraordinarily global sound into
downright funky tracks. Almost exclusively drumming _ with vocal
samples and bass and occasionally a little synthesizer thrown in _
this music is richly textured, as it should be with a cast of
musicians like this. In addition to Hart, the band is made up of
master drummers from almost every continent. The rhythms themselves
include traditional African and Brazilian grooves as well as more
modern funk. The result is a techno-dance feel that is rootsy and
industrial at the same time.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``The Discoteca Collection'' (Ryko) _ various
	   One of the most acoustically astounding discs to come out in a
while is this scratchy collection pulled from a series of acetate
discs recorded by Brazilian folklorists during a trip across the
northern part of the country in 1938.
	   The disc itself is the work of the Library of Congress'
Endangered Music Project. Despite the sound quality _ even with
intense restoration it sounds really old _ these songs sound very
much alive and vibrant.
	   Mostly percussion and call-and-response vocals, or just singers
without any accompaniment at all, these songs evoke the faith and
desolation of Brazil's dirt-poor north and northeast. The music may
sound a bit strange at first, but it quickly grows on you, and it's
easy to forget it's more than half a century old.

At the Movies: `Armageddon'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: film opened Wednesday &QL; 
 &UR; By TED ANTHONY &QC; 
 &UR; AP National Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ There's Oscar, the vaguely out-of-it surfer dude
with the heart of gold. There's Rockhound, the iconoclast and
compulsive womanizer with the heart of gold. There's A.J., the
brasher-than-thou young man with the heart of gold. And there's
Harry, their fearless leader, the coarse roughneck with _ you
guessed it _ the heart of gold.
	   They're all roll-up-your-sleeves, get-down-and-dirty oil
drillers, drilling away their lives on a rig somewhere in the
Pacific. That is, until destiny calls. Then they step forward,
unified, to save civilization as we know it ... from an asteroid
the size of Texas.
	   Thus the premise of the frantic and portentous ``Armageddon,''
which isn't so much an apocalyptic sci-fi epic as it is a buddy
flick: Call it ``The B-Team'' _ Stephen J. Cannell meets Irwin
Allen meets Isaac Asimov.
	   It's not wonderful. But it's a lot better than it could be _
crisp, fast-paced, visual without being effects-obsessed, and saved
from summer-blockbuster mediocrity in large part by the manic
ministrations of the always twisted Steve Buscemi.
	   The first question you might be asking is understandable: Is
Summer Asteroid Movie No. 2 (``Armageddon'') any different than
Summer Asteroid Movie No. 1 (``Deep Impact'')? The answer is a
resounding yes. And each of them is worthy in its own way.
	   While ``Impact'' had the threaded-storyline feel of an
apocalyptic ``All My Children,'' ``Armageddon'' is tightly focused
on the, er, drill team charged with going up on a souped-up space
shuttle, landing on the speeding asteroid, drilling 800 feet (240
meters) down and dropping a nuclear bomb in the hole. If all goes
well, asteroid explodes and splits, hurtling away harmlessly, and
Earth is saved for another Hollywood disaster movie.
	   Bruce Willis, his performance approaching acting more than usual
for the genre, plays Harry Stamper, the leader of the baker's dozen
or so of old friends. Stamper is a prematurely craggy former Marine
who's good at what he does and knows it. He trusts only himself,
which is his character's major _ and apparently only _ internal
conflict.
	   His daughter, Grace (the endlessly fascinating Liv Tyler, her
father's gratuitous appearance on the movie soundtrack
notwithstanding), who grew up on oil rigs around the world, is in
love with A.J. (Ben Affleck), a younger, angrier version of Harry
who's constantly clashing with the older man. The young lovers want
to get married, but the asteroid and the mission come between them.
	   Buscemi plays Rockhound, doing what Buscemi did so well in
``Fargo'' and ``Reservoir Dogs'' _ whatever exactly that is; he's
one weird dude. And a restrained Billy Bob Thornton rises above the
material to portray the head of NASA as a quiet hero determined to
overcome the bureaucracy.
	   Rounding out the cast are solid performances from Peter Stormare
(``Fargo'') as a disheveled cosmonaut who finds himself caught up
in the mission; Will Patton as the long-irresponsible Chick,
determined to show his young son he's a hero; William Fichtner as
the nails-tough REAL astronaut on the mission; and, most
delightfully, Michael Clarke Duncan as Bear, a gigantic man who
with Buscemi is handed some of the best lines of the movie.
	   As utterly charming as Liv Tyler is, and as affable as Affleck
is, their romance just doesn't work. The scenes between them are
the most excruciating of the film _ except for some of the corny
lines that burst forth from the Willis maw ( ``The United States
government just asked us to save the world _ anybody want to say
no?'').
	   Still, this is a laugh-out-loud-and-go-along-for-the-ride movie,
a picture-show type of experience. It's schlock, sure, but it's fun
schlock with good performances and good special effects and a
reasonably brisk script. It pushes all the right buttons in two
formulas _ action-comedy and adventure.
	   It's a lot more for your eight bucks than ``Godzilla'' ever
could be _ and does a much better job of destroying the Chrysler
Building to boot.
	   ``Armageddon'' is directed by Michael Bay and produced by Jerry
Bruckheimer, Gale Anne Hurd and Bay from a screenplay by Jonathan
Hensleigh and J.J. Abrams.

	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Raul Mondesi singled twice, doubled,
tripled and drove in three runs as the Los Angeles Dodgers, who
traded for All-Star reliever Jeff Shaw during the game, won 9-5
Saturday over the San Francisco Giants.
	   Mondesi, hitting .480 with eight RBIs in his last six games
since moving to the third spot in the lineup, had a two-run triple
in the first, doubled in the third and added a run-scoring single
in the fifth off Giants starter Mark Gardner (7-4).
	   Mondesi also popped out in the sixth and then had a single in
the ninth that scooted past left fielder Barry Bonds for a two-base
error, allowing a run to score.
	   Dave Mlicki (4-4) allowed four runs on six hits in five innings
for the victory.
 &UR; Reds 5, Cardinals 4 &QC; 
	   CINCINNATI (AP) _ Bret Boone drove in the winning run with a
bases-loaded ground out for Cincinnati.
	   The Reds loaded the bases in the ninth off Rick Croushore (0-1)
before Boone's RBI gave the Reds their eighth victory in nine
games. Danny Graves (2-0) got the final out in the ninth for the
win.
	   Mark McGwire walked three times and went 0-for-2 on a pair of
grounders, leaving him tied with Reggie Jackson for most homers
before the All-Star break with 37.
	   The Cardinals lost for the ninth time in 11 games.
 &UR; Cubs 5, Pirates 4 &QC; 
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Mickey Morandini homered to tie the game and

homered to right to tie the game at 3-3. It was his third hit of
the game.
	   Sammy Sosa walked off Jason Schmidt (8-5) and Mark Grace greeted
reliever Jason Christiansen with a single and both runners advances
on an error by Jose Guillen and scored on Rodriguez's hit.
	   Mark Pisciotta (1-2) got the win and Rod Beck picked up his 22nd

 &UR; Braves 4, Mets 1 &QC; 
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Kevin Millwood pitched eight shutout innings to
become Atlanta's third 10-game winner.
	   Millwood (10-4) allowed four hits and two walks as he joined

double-digit winners. Denny Neagle goes for his 10th victory
Sunday, a mark only four other NL pitchers have reached.
	   Mets catcher Mike Piazza left the game in the second inning with
a bruised left ear after being hit in the head by the
follow-through of Gerald Williams' swing.
	   Masato Yoshii (4-4) took the loss.

home runs, gave up nine hits and two runs in seven innings.
Stinnett hit his seventh homer in the fifth inning, a solo shot.
	   Mike Hampton (8-4), in his first start since coming off the
15-day disabled list, allowed six runs _ only three earned _ on 10
hits and three walks in 4 1-3 innings. He was sidelined by a
strained groin.

Japan's Mars probe completes first day in orbit without a snag
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's first interplanetary spacecraft completed
its first day in orbit around Earth and the moon Sunday, gaining
momentum for its 10-month, 700 million kilometer (440 million mile)
journey to Mars.
	   The unmanned probe, named Nozomi or ``Hope,'' is to begin
sending pictures and data from orbit around the Red Planet in
October 1999.
	   The mission is designed to search for signs of water under the
Mars surface and could turn up clues about whether life might once
have existed there.
	   A 31-meter, four-stage rocket lit a streak of light in the
predawn sky Saturday as it carried the craft into orbit from
Kagoshima Space Center in southern Japan.
	   Engineers at the launch site received data from the spacecraft
late Saturday night, confirming the probe was functioning normally,
a spokeswoman for the project said Sunday.
	   The engineers also made routine adjustments to the crafts
orbiting path early Sunday morning, said the spokeswoman.
	   The 450-kilo (half-ton) craft will swing around Earth twice to
pick up speed before its sent on a slingshot trajectory toward Mars
in December.
	   Once there, the 11 billion yen (dlrs 80 million) probe will
orbit high above the planet to study how the Martian atmosphere
reacts to solar winds and measure the rate at which oxygen escapes
into space.
	   The craft will photograph the planet's massive sand storms and
use high-frequency pulses to search for traces of water beneath its
surface.
	   Photographs from the United States' Mars Pathfinder mission have
shown dark patches on the planet that could be ice, raising
speculation that Mars may have once supported life.
	   The July 4 liftoff date coincided with the first anniversary of
the U.S. mission, but unlike the Pathfinder, which sent back images
from the Martian surface, the Japanese probe won't touch down on
Martian soil.
	   The probe carries 14 scientific instruments jointly developed by
Canada, Germany, Sweden and the United States.
	   Japan is only the third nation after the United States and
Russia to attempt an interplanetary mission. Europe's space
consortium cooperated with the U.S.-launched Cassini probe to
Saturn but has not conducted its own mission.

Seoul hints at retaliation against Russia's expulsion of diplomat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea expressed regret Sunday
over Russia's decision to expel one of its diplomats in Moscow on
suspicion of spying and hinted at retaliation.
	   ``It's regrettable that Russia, as a friendly country, has
decided to expel councilor Cho Sung Woo without prior
consultations,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Lee Ho-jin said in a
statement.
	   ``The government will announce due action after investigating
the case after Cho returns home this week,'' he said.
	   The spokesman refused to elaborate but one ministry official,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said his government would not
rule out the possibility of retaliatory action.
	   The spokesman identified Cho as a councilor at the South Korean
Embassy in Moscow but other ministry officials said he works for
South Korea's main government spy organization, the Agency for
National Security Planning.
	   Cho was ordered expelled within three days after being detained
overnight Friday on suspicion of spying.
	   The South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman said that Cho was
declared ``persona non grata for unlawful activities incompatible
with his diplomatic status.''
	   Cho was taken into custody as he met with an alleged Russian
contact Friday, according to a statement from the Federal Security
Service, a successor to the Soviet-era KGB.
	   The contact, an employee of Russia's Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, was also detained for investigation, the statement said.
	   The Russian was accused of ``providing confidential information
to South Korean security services that was damaging to Russia's
political and economic interests,'' the statement said.
	   Russia's Federal Security Service, or FSB, is responsible for
counterintelligence.
