<HEADLINE> Russian Ambassador Comes Back to London after Iraq Rift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian ambassador to Britain
Yuri Fokin, who was recalled last week for consultation over
U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq, is to come back to London
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
His return would end the worst setback in relations between
Russia and Britain for years.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Ministry said on Saturday they were confirmed
of Fokin's return but adding it was not known yet whether he is
back in London.
</P>
<P>
Fokin was recalled on December 18, along with Russia's
ambassador to Washington, in a protest against the air-strikes on
Iraq launched by the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Moscow's decision to recall the ambassadors was a step
unprecedented since the Cold War. Russia insists the attacks
violated U.N. rules and pose a serious threat to international
stability.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Foreign Ministry announced earlier in Moscow that
Fokin would return to London. It was not confirmed yet by Russia's
Embassy in London whether the Ambassador has arrived in his
residence.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
held talks Saturday with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who
arrived here in the day for a one-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The talks were going on during an iftar banquet Mubarak
offered to Arafat, Egypt's Middle East Middle News Agency (MENA)
reported, without giving the details of the talks.
</P>
<P>
They will be joined later by their senior aides in a plenary
session of talks, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Ambassador in Cairo Zohdi el Qedra told MENA Friday
that the two leaders would discuss the Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks after Israel suspended the implementation of the Wye River
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said it will not go on with the implementation of
the agreement signed last October on further Israeli withdrawal
from the West Bank if the Palestinians do not satisfy its demands,
including the cancellation of a plan to declare a Palestinian
state next May.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel's possible early elections will put off for
months the implementation of the accord, under which Israel has
carried out the first phase of the troop pullback.
</P>
<P>
El Qedra said the talks between Mubarak and Arafat are expected
also to cover the recent U.S.-British military strikes against
Iraq and Yemen's call for an urgent Arab summit in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain launched a four-day missile
attack on Iraq last week in what U.S. said a retaliation for
Baghdad's defiance of the United Nations weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Yemen has called for an Arab summit to discuss the impact of
the attack on Iraq and the Arab world as a whole and seek Arab
solidarity. The Arab League and some of its members, including
Egypt, Algeria and Morocco, have welcomed the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Arafat frequently visits Egypt to coordinate with Mubarak
stances on the Middle East peace process and other key issues in
the region.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Ruling Party Kicks off Local Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba kicked off here Saturday his ruling party's campaign for
local elections to be held on December 30 by urging voters to
vote for his party.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba called upon the electorate to vote for the candidates
from the ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) when he
was addressing thousands of his supporters gathering at Kanyama
township, south of capital Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The president said that "people should vote for the MMD
councillors so that they can articulate MMD policies with the
contemporary needs of people."
</P>
<P>
He urged people not to choose wrong councillors because they
will derail the good intentions and policies that the government
has put in place to address the needs of the people at the
grassroots.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba instructed councillors to visit their respective
communities, get familia with the needs in the communities and
work with the local people so as to turn the local government
policies into reality.
</P>
<P>
"The work of councillors is to see to it that people are
provided with essentials," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba also appealed to his fellow countrymen to give his
government a little more time to improve their welfare as the
rampant poverty in the country could not be solved overnight.
</P>
<P>
He directed government ministers to fire any officials
misusing constituency funds.
</P>
<P>
Government ministers should visit the constituencies to find
out how the funds are being used and expose any officials found
guilty of misappropriating the funds, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the government has created a
democratic political system in which politicians should feel free
to conduct their politics peacefully.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that those who break the law will be dealt
with according to the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of his supporters were singing, dancing and holding
up pictures of MMD candidates, showering praises at the ruling
party at the rally.
</P>
<P>
A number of government ministers and MMD officials attended
the rally.

HARARE, December 26 (Xinhua) -- A total of 120 road accidents
were recorded in Zimbabwe on Christmas day, a police spokesman

</P>
<P>
Police superintendent Wayne Bvudzijena said that in the 24

About 10 people were arrested for drunken driving, 21 vehicles
were impounded for defects and 1,997 tickets were issued for
various offenses.

However, Bvudzijena said that he was encouraged by the
presence of the Vehicle Inspection Department which was on the
roads checking vehicles' road worthiness.

He called on the police to concentrate more on the core areas
of policing.

<HEADLINE> Protests Across UK at Boxing Day Hunts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Anti-hunt campaigners staged a
series of protests at traditional Boxing Day meetings on Saturday
throughout Britain.
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest fox hunting days of the year started with a
handful of campaigners from the Protect Our Wild Animals group
gathering at Chequers, the prime minister's official country
residence.
</P>
<P>
They handed a model of a human backbone and video footage of
fox cub hunting over to police officers at the gate, before going
on to protest against a hunt at Bicester, Oxfordshire.
</P>
<P>
Up to 400 anti-hunt campaigners gathered in the center of
Maldon, Essex, as about 30 riders from the Essex Farmers and Union
Foxhounds passed through, according to a spokesman for the League
Against Cruel Sports.
</P>
<P>
Around 200 pro-hunting supporters were also present, but the
event passed off peacefully, he added.
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 hunt supporters were expected to take part in
or watch 300 events on Boxing Day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Mori poll commissioned by the International Fund
for Animal Welfare (IFAW) has found that 66 percent of the public
in the UK favour a ban on hunting with hounds, with the figure up
to 74 percent among Labor supporters.
</P>
<P>
UK Director of IFAW Mike Baker said: "As we approach a new
year, momentum and morale in the anti-hunting campaign is high,
and we will now redouble our efforts to secure a government
commitment by the year 2000 to end this cruel and barbaric
practice."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, a government Minister appeared to back the
idea of local referendums on whether fox hunting should be banned
in specific areas.
</P>
<P>
Junior Environment Minister Michael Meacher told BBC Radio 4's
Today program: "Fox hunting is a matter which I think is not going
to go away. "

<HEADLINE> Rebels, Peace-keepers Fight for Northern S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Rebels and the west African
peacekeeping force ECOMOG in Sierra Leone fought Saturday for
control of the northern town of Makeni, said reports from
Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Sam Bockarie, a rebel leader, was quoted as saying that his
troops had captured the strategically-important town, which is
about 100 kilometers northeast of the capital, and are battling
for Kenema, a diamond town to the southeast.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leonean Defense Ministry confirmed that the rebels
have entered part of Makeni.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 5,000 residents in Freetown Saturday
demonstrated to express support for elected President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah, who was ousted in a military coup in May 1997 but was
re-installed by the ECOMOG in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators carried placards reading "let peace prevail
in Sierra Leone" or "We are fed up with fighting and talking
about war."
</P>
<P>
Since it was chased out of Freetown last February, forces of
the ousted military junta had joined hands with the Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) rebels, who have been against successive
Sierra Leonean governments since early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The RUF rebels have been active in north and east parts of the
country, fighting a guerilla warfare against the ECOMOG who have
not been able to mop up the rebels because of logistic
difficulties and shortage of troops.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the rebels have pushed their activities to
areas much nearer to the capital, causing a panic in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The rebels launched a hit-and-run attack on Waterloo, 30
kilometers to the east of Freetown Tuesday and started an
offensive in Makeni Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said that the rebels have already captured
Waterloo, with the mayor killed in fighting.
</P>
<P>
Faced with renewed rebel threats, the ECOMOG had called in
1,000 reinforcement troops from Nigeria earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
In the heat of the tension, the United States and Britain had
evacuated their nationals from Freetown, while the United Nations
also evacuated part of its staff to neighboring Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Bockarie, who was the No.2 leader of the RUF, said that the
RUF wanted direct talks with the government and the immediate
release of No.1 RUF leader Foday Sankoh, who had been sentenced
to death in connection with the 1997 coup and is now in jail.
</P>
<P>
Bockarie threatened that unless the government agreed to the
rebels' terms, they would continue their offensive.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to march into Freetown on New Year's Day... We
have the will and the way," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Kabbah has refused the rebels' demand.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministers of west African countries are expected to
meet in Cote d'Ivoire Monday to discuss the escalating tension in
Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Two of Sextuplets in Northeast China Die of Lung Hemorrhage (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Two of the sextuplets born
Wednesday in this capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province
have died of lung hemorrhages, hospital sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We've lost one baby boy and one baby girl. They were the
lightest ones of the six," said Dr. Mao Jian from the New-Born
Intensive Care Department of the No. 2 Hospital Attached to the
China Medical University.
</P>
<P>
The sextuplets, who were born at around 7:30 on the evening of
December 23, included four boys and two girls.
</P>
<P>
The boy who died 70 hours after his birth was the lightest of
the six, weighing only 495 grams. Efforts to save his life lasted
more than an hour but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
The girl, who weighed 610 grams at birth, died Saturday despite
a successful blood transfusion and the use of a respirator.
</P>
<P>
"It's not surprising to me. The two babies were too small when
born," said Li Quanyou, father of the sextuplets, after a moment
of silence when he learned the bad news.
</P>
<P>
Hospital authorities say that at present, the conditions of the
other four babies are relatively stable, but it's still too early
to say that they are already out of the critical period.
</P>
<P>
"Conditions of prematurely born babies change extremely
rapidly. Though the rest of the babies have overcome respiratory
difficulties, there could possibly be other problems," explained
Dr. Mao.

<P>
The babies were delivered by Caesarean section when their
mother, Yao Hong, a 33-year-old woman living in the suburbs of
Shenyang, had delivery problems on the afternoon of December 23.
</P>
<P>
The mother was pregnant for only 28 weeks, and the heaviest
infant had a birth weight of only 1.17 kilograms, according to
Dr. Mao.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the hospital began feeding milk to the babies with a
special pump, and they were fed once every two hours with only two
milliliters of milk each time, he added.
</P>
<P>
The sextuplets were naturally conceived rather than as a result
of artificial insemination, and medical experts noted that the
chance of a woman giving birth to sextuplets is one in 400 billion.
</P>
<P>
The hospital mobilized some 30 doctors and nurses to monitor
the conditions of the babies day and night, and hospital authorities
required all monitors to remain at their posts at all times.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time in our hospital's 116-year history that
sextuplets have been born here. And for us, it's the chance of
a lifetime," said Dr. Mao.
</P>
<P>
Yao and her husband Li, who himself was a twin, already have a
12-year-old daughter.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Riots over the killing of a
young boy, which left at least four dead, were followed Sunday by
the imposition of curfew in Bannu, 275 km south of Peshawar,
capital of North West Frontier Province.
</P>
<P>
Violent mobs were reported to have gone on rampage. They set
ablaze police checkpoints, besides attacking the Bannu police
station in the day-long rioting.
</P>
<P>
Police officials in Peshawar said violence started after the
news spread that a police constable gunned down a teenaged boy.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of local residents gathered at the venue of the
occurrence and efforts by the Bannu district administration to
pacify them ended in futile.
</P>
<P>
One source said that "there were armed people among the crowed
and the police had to abandon the main city police station."
</P>
<P>
Following the failure of the district administration to control
the rioters, army was called in from Bannu's cantonment in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Things went beyond our control," conceded one official from in
the Bannu district administration.
</P>
<P>
It has been confirmed that four people were killed and seven
others wounded during the day long rioting.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here Sunday night from Peshawar said that
sporadic gunfire continued to reverberate in Bannu. All business
and commercial centers and markets in Bannu remained closed.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Island Providing Services for Taiwanese Fishermen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANYA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Taiwanese boats fishing around
Sanya, on southern China's island province of Hainan, are getting
good service and supplies with the help of the local government.
</P>
<P>
Sanya is crowded with Taiwanese and mainland fishing boats when
the fishing season begins and Taiwanese fishermen can go to
Taiwanese-style tea houses, bars, and entertainment centers to
enjoy themselves with local fishermen.
</P>
<P>
Taiwanese were allowed to fish or do 50,000 yuan (6,000
U.S.dollars) or less worth of business in Sanya as of 1985, then
it became one of three trading areas on Hainan Island open to
Taiwan. Fishermen come mainly from Keelung, Suao, Taipei, and
Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
One 52-year-old Taiwanese whose ancestors moved to Taiwan from
Fujian five or six generations ago, says that he comes to Sanya
every August and returns to Taiwan the following March and has
good relations with local fishermen.
</P>
<P>
He started fishing with his father when he was 12 and has
fished at Sanya for six years and is quite satisfied with the
services. One reason for coming here, even if it is more than 100
kilometers from where they fish is that it has developed very fast
here and the local government provides good services.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Bid Farewell to "Family Class Status" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, December 27 (Xinhua) -- "Had the Third Plenum of the
11th Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee not been
convened, we wouldn't have been able to lead such a happy life as
today's," Zhang Ruqu, a farmer in central China's Henan Province,
tells his family repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, now 51, now runs a private farm with assets of some
half-million yuan, and this summer his youngest daughter passed
the college entrance exam to become her village's first-ever
university student.
</P>
<P>
Only 20 years ago, however, Zhang was a "citizen of the lowest
class" in his village. While other villagers could get ten credits
for a day's labor, he could only get seven; he always got the
smallest and worst portion of any public distribution of property;
and there was no girl who wanted to marry him.
</P>
<P>
There was only one reason for all this suffering Zhang had
to endure: his parents had been landlords in the village and he
had inherited their "class status."
</P>
<P>
In China, "family class status" used to be something powerful
enough to decide an individual's fate. It could decide everything
in your life, from education and employment to marriage and
promotion. You were required to show your "family class status"
first, even when seeking hospital treatment.
</P>
<P>
For every Chinese now aged around 40 or over, the "Five Dark
Categories" is a very familiar and extremely frightening
phrase. Two decades ago, everyone was afraid of having any
connection with this term, which referred to five kinds of people,
namely, landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, bad
elements and Rightists.
</P>
<P>
Once you were born into a family in one of the "Five Dark
Categories," you were doomed to remain at the bottom of society,
no matter how hard you tried.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Bid Farewell to "Family Class Status" (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because his father fled to Taiwan before the New China was
founded in 1949, Zha Ruichuan, a postgraduate from prestigious
Qinghua University, never got a chance to serve his motherland
with his knowledge during the prime of his life.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, there was no escape for people like us whenever a
political movement was launched in China. The slightest penalty
would be job suspension for self retrospection, and in worse
cases, we could be detained for investigation, or be subject to
public denunciation," recalled Zha, now a professor with the
Demography Research Institute of the People's University of China
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Zha, now 73, said that the ridiculous idea of judging a
person's nature by his family background was the result of an
ultra-Left ideology, which advocated nothing but class struggle.
</P>
<P>
"The concept of 'family class status,' which in fact tried to
stamp a political brand on every Chinese citizen, made China's
political environment extremely tense and depressing, and
this directly hindered the country's economic and cultural
development," he added.
</P>
<P>
In January of 1979, shortly after the Third Plenum of the 11th
CPC Central Committee, the Chinese authorities made a decision to
annul the term "Five Dark Categories" and grant these five kinds of
people equal social status with others.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there could be no more discrimination against the
children of the so-called 'Five Dark Categories,' and in areas
such as education, employment and army recruitment, their fate was
now to be decided according to their own performance and personal
qualities, this decision said.

In the same year, Zha was sent abroad to Britain, France and
the United States as a visiting scholar. "Starting then, I feel
that I have been treated as a respected expert, and I no longer
feel inferior to others," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zha is now deputy director of his research institute, and was a
Standing Committee member of the Beijing Municipal People's
Congress, the local legislature, for two consecutive terms.
</P>
<P>
According to Er Yue He, a noted writer of historical novels,
the abolition of the concept of "family class status" has brought
a sense of security to the Chinese people and created a peaceful
and equal environment for social competition, thus greatly
emancipating China's productive forces.
</P>
<P>
In the years when China stressed "family class status," Er Yue
He could hardly publish anything just because one of his aunts
belonged to a "landlord's family."
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Er Yue He, then in his late 30s, published his
first novel "Emperor Kangxi," about an emperor of China's last feudal
dynasty -- the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), and he has now published
many more books.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Terms Israel's Failure to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
Sunday termed as "dangerous" Israel's suspension of the peace
process with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Saeb Erekat, chief Palestinian negotiator, told Egyptian TV
that Israel's move to halt the implementation of the Wye River
accord is rejected by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He warned that Israel's acts will not only wreck peace on the
Palestinian-Israeli track but also destabilize the Middle East and
plunge the region into violence and bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian side has carried out its commitments in full
under the Wye River accord. the U.S. has attested to this
enforcement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Erekat is accompanying Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who
arrived here Saturday for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Israel's early elections, expected next April, the
Palestinian official demanded the Israeli government fulfill its
commitments, regardless of the elections, to the Wye River accord
brokered by the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We maintain direct contact with the U.S. administration, which
has issued a number of statements that the Palestinian side has
met its commitments and the Israelis have to follow suit," Erekat
said.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the Egypt's stand that the peace pacts
should be implemented accurately and honestly, stressing that
Israel's possible early elections should not become an excuse for
the Israeli government to evade its obligations.
</P>
<P>
Terming Egypt as a key sponsor of the peace process, Erekat
said that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Egypt's diplomacy
would do the utmost in a bid to keep the peace process on track
"by getting Israel to carry out its obligations."
</P>
<P>
Under the Wye River accord signed between the Palestinians and
the Israelis in Washington last October, Israel should pull back
troops from a further 13.1 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
After finishing the first phase of troop withdrawal, Israel
announced to suspend the second phase of the withdrawal due to
what it called Palestinians' anti-Israeli rhetorics and failure to
cancel the plan to declare an independent state next May.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Regent Calls for APU Consensus on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan
Ibn Talal on Sunday called on the emergency meeting of the Arab
Parliamentary Union (APU) to reach a consensus on Iraq, and
guarantee basic living rights of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The regent said in his opening speech that the APU meeting
should speak in one voice in supporting the Iraqi people, adding
that basic rights of any people from any Arab country which
suffered from aggression should be protected and maintained.
</P>
<P>
Hassan said all Arab countries should stand up against any
efforts or conspiracies to divide Iraq or to set up any
independent state in northern Iraq, where the U.S. and Britain are
imposing a no-fly zone since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Apparently referring to the U.S.-British air attacks on Iraq
more than a week ago, Hassan stressed that military actions can
only be the last means to solve international crisis, as
stipulated in the United Nations charter.
</P>
<P>
Peaceful and diplomatic means should be first tried in solving
any international disputes before military actions are employed,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that arms inspections on Iraq must be carried out in
accordance with U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain launched four consecutive nights
of air raids on Iraq earlier this month for its reported
non-cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The APU meeting, called for by the Jordanian House of Deputies
(lower house) in the wake of the U.S.-led air attacks, is expected
to close later Sunday with a resolution urging a lifting of the
U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and Mauritania did not take
part in the Amman meeting of the 17-member Arab parliamentary
organization.

<HEADLINE> New Pension System Benefiting Farmers in Eastern Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- A new pension system in east
China's Jiangsu Province had some seven million farmers involved by
September, with about 42,000 receiving a pension every month.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu began to be faced with an aging population in the
1980s, especially in rural areas. To deal with the problem, local
authorities decided to put a pension system high on the agenda of
the provincial development strategy.
</P>
<P>
The new pension system was launched in 1992, based on
government guidance and individual initiative. Most of the funds
came from individual payments, but collectively-owned township
enterprises provide a considerable part of their annual profits as
a supplement.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government supports the fund by allowing
enterprises to use part of their annual pre-tax profit for it. In
the economically developed southern part of the province, 40
percent of the pension funds come from enterprise subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 28 percent of the population here is covered by the
system and the province has 2.51 billion yuan in pension funds.
</P>
<P>
According to a local official in charge of the system, the
pension system has given employees more enthusiasm at work and
some farmers have given up the idea of having a second child.

<HEADLINE> Property Market Sluggish in Vietnam's Largest City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Despite the increasing demand
for housing, the real estate market in Ho Chi Minh City,
Vietnam's largest economic hub, is slowing down or grinding to a
halt, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Due to the impact of the regional financial crisis, the real
estate market probably faces more difficulties," VNA quoted
Nguyen An Binh, director of the Saigon Real Estate Corporation
(RESCO), as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the high demand for residential housing had
resulted in the development of low-cost real estate deals, but the
level was still not as high as in previous years.
</P>
<P>
The director said foreign investment would increase when the
financial crisis was over. Therefore, there would be high demand
for housing of international standards.
</P>
<P>
Houses priced at less than 50 taels of gold (240 million VN
dong) were currently the biggest sellers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an official of the Housing Department Bank said that
between August 1996, when the bank launched its real estate
transaction services, and the end of November this year,
transaction payments through the bank had reached 44,500 taels of
gold (214 billion VN dong).
</P>
<P>
Some 22,500 taels had changed hands in the first 11 months of
the year, which he believed were the first rumblings of an
enormous underground market.
</P>
<P>
Ho Chi Minh City currently has about 24 million square meters
of housing. An additional 48 million square meters of housing is
expected to be built by 2010.

<HEADLINE> Millions of Farmers in Northeastern China Now Have Better Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Five million farmers in the
grain producing province of Liaoning, northeastern China, are
living better than other parts of the country, Provincial Governor
Zhang Guoguang told a recent conference on rural work.
</P>
<P>
The province's 8 percent growth goal for this year is just
around the corner because of the contribution of agriculture, he
said. In the past two decades, profound changes have taken place
in rural parts of Liaoning and the provincial government has made
an effort to improve agriculture infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Farmers have been the immediate beneficiaries of the rapid
development of agriculture. Zhang Weiman, a farmer of Liaozhong
County, made a small fortune with contracts on 53 hectares of rice
paddies. Last year, he installed a telephone, built a five-room
brick house, and bought two tractors.
</P>
<P>
His annual income is above 100,000 yuan (about 12,500 U.S.
dollars), he says, and because he has no worries about food and
clothing, he has time and energy to concentrate on doing a good
job in farming.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers' annual per capita net income is expected to
reach 2,600 yuan this year, an increase of 370 percent over 1978
and per capita housing space is 21 square meters, twice the 1978
figure.
</P>
<P>
Zhang explains that electric appliances and color televisions,
washing machines, refrigerators, and telephones are now common
items for rural families, and some villages even have cable TV.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 27 (Xinhua) -- A woman from rural Shenyang,
capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province, gave birth to
sextuplets through Caesarean section over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Both the mother and infants are in good condition and are under

</P>
<P>
The six babies weigh from 0.495 kilograms to 1.17 kilograms,
and they were able to breathe by themselves at birth. The mother
had been pregnant for 28 weeks. Doctors say they could be the
first sextuplets born in China to survive.
</P>
<P>
Yao Hong, the new mother, already has a 12-year-old girl. Yao's
husband, Li Quanyou, who is one of twins, was surprised at the
birth of the sextuplets, calling it "an unexpected thing" to have
six babies at one time, instead of one.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 doctors and nurses gathered in the delivery room
in case of emergency.
</P>
<P>
Sun Jianchun, president of the hospital, said that this was the

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Pumps 12.6 Million Tons of Crude Oil in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam pumped up 12.6 million
tons of crude oil and brought ashore one billion cubic meters of
associated gas in 1998, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This is an increase of 300,000 tons of crude oil over the
yearly plan and increases of 2.6 million tons of crude oil and 500
million cubic meters of gas over last year.
</P>
<P>
This year, Vietnam exported more than 12 million tons of crude
oil, earning 1.2 billion U.S. dollars, or 13 percent of the
country's total export turnover.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam now ranks fourth among oil-exporting countries in
Southeast Asia and 44th in the world.
</P>
<P>
In addition to traditional customers like Japan, the Republic
of Korea, China and Thailand, Vietnam has expanded its oil markets
to the United States and northern European countries.
</P>
<P>
VNA said crude oil is now being pumped from Bach Ho (white
tiger), Dai Hung (big bear), Bunga Kekwa, Hong Ngoc (ruby) and
Rang Dong (dawn) oil fields.
</P>
<P>
Apart from crude oil, about three million cubic meters of
associated gas are brought ashore per day from the Bach Ho oil
field to fuel power plants in the southern coastal province of Ba
Ria-Vung Tau.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that between four and five million cubic meters
of associated gas will be brought ashore daily from this field
next year, VNA said.
</P>
<P>
A project to build Vietnam's first oil refinery with an annual
capacity of 6.5 million tons at the Dung Quat Industrial Zone in
the central province of Quang Ngai is awaiting for license from
the Ministry of Planning and Investment.
</P>
<P>
The refinery, a joint venture between Petrovietnam and Russia's
Zarubeznheft Company, has an investment capital of 1.3 billion
U.S. dollars, equally shared by the two partners. It is expected
to start operation by 2002.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam plans to pump 14.5 million tons of crude oil and 1.4
billion cubic meters of associated gas in 1999, said the official
news agency.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Asian Games
sprint champions Damayanthi Dharsha and Sudath Tillekeratne will
train in Australia next year, according to the Sunday Times
quoted officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Dharsha, the gold medalist of women's 200m and 400m at the
Asian Games in Bangkok, and men's 400m champion Tillekeratne are
to leave in January for a three-month training program at the
invitation of the Melbourne Track Club, according to the Sunday
Times.
</P>
<P>
Controversial sprint star Susanthika Jayasinghe, who was a
last-minute scratch from the women's 200m final, has also
announced her intention to shift her training base away from Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Jayasinghe, who withdrew from the 200m after injuring a
hamstring in a qualifier, upset the Sri Lankan contingent at this
month's Asian Games and left the goal honor for Dharsha's
surprise victory.
</P>
<P>
Jayasinghe, the world 200m silver medalist and Sri Lanka's
best hope for Olympic glory, said last week she wants to escape
"harassment" by local athletic and sports ministry officials
following her withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of discrimination against me at the Asian
Games," Jayasinghe said.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old became an overnight national heroine last year
when she won the first world athletics medal for Sri Lanka, a
island nation of 18.3 million people.
</P>
<P>
But soon after her victory, she was first reported to be an
army deserter and then went public with claims that a Sri Lankan
government minister sexually harassed her.
</P>
<P>
Then followed a positive test for an anabolic steroid and she
struggled to make ends meet after losing her sponsors.
</P>
<P>
In August, the tide turned in her favor when an independent
Sri Lankan appeals panel cleared her of drugs abuse.
</P>
<P>
Unhappy with the appeals panel's decision, the International
Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) have set up a new board to
re-examine the case.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Step Up Poverty Alleviation in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State, General
Abdulsalam Abubakar, has pledged that his government will step up
efforts to alleviate poverty in the oil-rich country in the
coming 1999 as the nation now enjoys some degree of stability,
local press reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In his New Year message to the country Saturday, Abubakar said
"the government is determined to pursue policies and programs
that will alleviate poverty, restore self-respect and promote
initiative."
</P>
<P>
"Every segment of the Nigerian society will be positively
touched by the programs which the 1999 budget will initiate, as a
first step in pursuing an ideal as enshrined in Vision 2010," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Vision 2010 is a long-term development plan worked out by the
former government of late General Sani Abacha. It aims to build
Nigeria into a country of political stability and economic
prosperity by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar urged his people to cooperate with the government to
ensure social stability, saying that economy cannot grow unless
the polity enjoys some stability.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his government's determination to pursue the
democratization process, which would lead to the military's
handover to an elected civilian government by May 29, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar repeated his belief that military rule runs contrary
to the norms and practice of democracy, adding that the military
force itself is the worst victim of military rule, under which
the professionalism of the military is vigorously challenged.
</P>
<P>
He commended the Nigerian people and the Independent National
Electoral Commission for the success of the just-concluded local
government elections and urged both the civilians and the
military to "join hands in making the remaining elections
transparently free, fair and peaceful."
</P>
<P>
"Together, we must build a peaceful and prosperous
Nigeria...The opportunity now knocks and we cannot afford to
fail," he concluded.

DAR ES SALAAM, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania needs some
145.13 million U.S. Dollars to repair the roads heavily hit by
the El Nino rains, press reports here Sunday quoted a document by
the Ministry of Works as saying.
</P>
<P>
Most roads, both paved and unpaved, in all the 20 regions of
mainland have never been repaired after they were battered by the
El Nino weather phenomenon, said the document.
</P>
<P>
It said Tanzania expects donors to release 145 million U.S.
Dollars for repairing the roads while the government will spend
another 120 million U.S. Dollars on normal maintenance for the
coming three years.
</P>
<P>
The document, entitled Managing and Financing Road Networks in
Tanzania, said normal routine maintenance is set at 2,000 Dollars
per kilometer.
</P>
<P>
Roads account for more than 60 percent of total internal
traffic flows in Tanzania. However, only 15 percent of the trunk
roads and 10 percent of rural roads have been in good condition
since early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
With foreign donations, the Ministry of Works intends to have
all the regional headquarters connected by tarmac roads, and
district headquarters by gravel roads by 2025.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Northern China's largest port
city Tianjin plans to spend more than 15 billion yuan on
infrastructure construction in 1999, with 10 billion yuan to be
used for housing, according to Vice-Mayor Wang Dehui.
</P>
<P>
The city will place importance on affordable housing and make
it possible for real estate developers to make a profit of three
percent. The city wants to complete four million square meters of
housing and sell three million square meters next year.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, housing and other basic construction
projects like highways and bridges is expected to contribute three
to four percentage points of the city's estimated nine percent
economic growth this year.
</P>
<P>
In the first ten months this year, the city sold 2.6 million
square meters of housing. The growth rate of the real estate
industry this year is predicted at more than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Real estate here has always been a profitable market,
attracting investors from Hong Kong and elsewhere, but as a result
of the financial crisis, Southeast Asian investment in the city is
declining. Under such circumstances, the new investment in
infrastructure construction next year will mainly be loans granted
by the state and banks.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Attract More Japanese, S. Korean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian has come up
with a strategic plan to attract more tourists from Japan and the
Republic of Korea (ROK) through regular promotional visits and
publicity campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Peter Mwenguo, acting managing director of the Tanzania
Tourist Board (TTB), was quoted by Sunday News as saying that
thousands of people from the two strong Asian economies visited
Tanzania last year.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists from Japan and ROK to Tanzania have
increased significantly in recent years although it was a mere
fraction of those from western Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said that Tanzania received 7,700 tourists from Japan and
1,000 from ROK last year.
</P>
<P>
Japan, with 17 million people traveling abroad each year, had
200,000 of them visiting Africa in 1997, mostly to northern and
southern Africa. Meanwhile, five million South Koreans travel
overseas every year, he said.
</P>
<P>
TTB and other stakeholders in Tanzania's tourism industry are
considering to participate regularly in major tourism exhibitions
in Asia as they do in Europe, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa visited Malaysia, Japan and
ROK earlier this month. One of the major purposes of the trip
was to attract tourists.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the Tanzanian delegation, including the TTB
acting managing director, and the Minister of Natural Resources
and Tourism Zakia Meghji, organized several seminars in Tokyo,
Osaka and Seoul on the country's tourism potential.
</P>
<P>
The seminars attracted 198 tour operators, travel agents,
airline executives and media personnel, Mwenguo said.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is one of the major foreign exchange earners in
Tanzania and has much potential to tap. In 1997, tourists
visiting the east African country increased by 10.1 percent from
326,188 in 1996 to 360,000, earning the country more than 393.4
million U.S. Dollars, according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
The increase is a result of efforts made by the government and
private tour operators to advertise Tanzania's tourist potentials
in recent years, Bank of Tanzania said in an economic review
report.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Waiting for the Birth of the Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Etienne Reuter, head of the
Office of the European Commission in Hong Kong, expressed his
support for Hong Kong Financial Secretary Donald Tsang's proposal
to use Hong Kong as a clearance center for the euro in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The idea developed by the financial secretary must be studied,
Reuter said during an interview with Xinhua. "I think that is
logical for Hong Kong's ambition to remain an international
financial service center," he added.
</P>
<P>
Days ago, Tsang said during an interview with a local newspaper
that in order to internationalize the euro, which is to be
launched on the new year's day, ways have to be found to trade the
euro in non-European countries.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said he had seriously asked the Europeans to make use of
Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo to allow trading and clearances of
the euro in non-European trading hours and that could be done most
effectively in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In response, Reuter said that with the combination of the
information technology and the situation where the market is more
and more global it's interesting to consider that idea.
</P>
<P>
The euro is created for the needs of the European Union, Reuter
said. That is to say to adopt the single currency for the single
European market, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, that doesn't mean the euro will become an instrument
of protectionism, Reuter noted. The euro zone will be an open
market, he said.
</P>
<P>
The market in Europe will become much more transparent. There
will no longer be exchange risks between those 11 countries. "All
these will add to a more favorable business environment in
Europe," Reuter said.
</P>
<P>
As for Asia, there is a very important role the euro can play
to stabilize the financial situation and it's very important to
have monetary stability when people in Asia want to rebuild their
economies that have suffered from the Asian financial crisis,
Reuter said.
</P>
<P>
"We very much want to see the euro as a stability factor of the
international monetary situation," Reuter said. "We want the
relationship between the U.S. dollar and the euro to be a stable
one and we don't want to have volatility, which is bad especially
when you try to rebuild the economy in this region," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The euro will become a strong and solid currency, Reuter said.
It will be backed up by more than 325 billion U.S. dollars in
reserves in the 11 member states of the European single currency,
Reuter said.
</P>
<P>
The attacks upon Italian lira, German marks and other European
currencies in the past will no longer happen in the future.
</P>
<P>
What is new now is that if one country of the 11 has problems,
they can no longer, like in the past, devalue their currency and
do a quick fix, Reuter said.
</P>
<P>
They will have to adopt genuine policies addressing the
structural weakness of their economies to get back to the road of
prosperity, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The monetary policy will be decided by the independent European
Central Bank and no national government can stimulate their
economies through spending as they did in the past, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of China has already announced they will
increase the part of their reserves in the euro.
</P>
<P>
That is understandable because China wants to take advantage of
the fact that the euro will be a stable currency and the trade
between China and the EU is very important, Reuter said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to Hong Kong, Reuter said that he found both the
banking sector and the government have been well prepared for the
euro.
</P>
<P>
However, Hong Kong is special because of the peg between the HK
dollar and the U.S. dollar, Reuter said. Hong Kong holds more
than 90 percent of its reserves in U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The peg is basically the backbone of the Hong Kong economy and
it plays an important role in underscoring the "one country, two
systems." "We are not pressing the Hong Kong government to take
more euros in its reserves because I don't think we would do
anything that will cause questions on the peg," Reuter said.
</P>
<P>
But the euro will offer convenience for settling transactions
between companies of Hong Kong and Europe. The EU plays an
important role in the world trade and the total gross domestic
products of the 11 countries in the euro zone accounts for 20
percent of the GDP of the world.

<HEADLINE> Security at HK International Airport Praised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Officials of the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) of the United States have commented
the aviation security at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) as
"excellent" after an inspection of HKIA.
</P>
<P>
The FAA said that the security arrangement and practices at
HKIA exceeded guidelines set by the United Nations' International
Civil Aviation Organization, a press release by the Hong Kong
Airport Authority (HKAA) said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Security at HKIA is handled by more than 2,000 staff of the
Aviation Security Company, a subsidiary of the HKAA. In addition,
more than 400 members of the Hong Kong Police are stationed at the
Airport Police Station.
</P>
<P>
FAA officials said that the access control of the passenger
terminal and airfield perimeter is among the best of the world.
</P>
<P>
These officials were also impressed by passenger screening
arrangements, especially the large number of screening stations
and the high proficiency of security operators.
</P>
<P>
Documentation for all Airport Security Programs were well
written, comprehensive and had been effectively disseminated to
airlines, they said.
</P>
<P>
HKIA employs some of the world's most comprehensive baggage
screening. Every single item of baggage destined for the hold of
an aircraft undergoes an automated security screening called Hold
Baggage Screening, which analyses all bags as they pass through
automated smart X-ray machines, known as the Machine Automated
Explosive Detection System.

<HEADLINE> New Sea Channel Helps Economic Growth in Southern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, which used to be an economic backwater, has witnessed
economic growth with the opening of a new sea channel to the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of this year, the southern region
reported a GDP of 149.55 billion yuan, up 9.7 percent from the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Its backward transportation and vast hilly and mountainous
areas were a bottleneck, and its subtropical agricultural and
forestry resources, abundant minerals, and hydraulic potential
remain untouched for centuries.
</P>
<P>
To deal with this problem, local authorities developed a
strategic program in 1992 that focused on expressways and
highways, handling capacity at ports, and a river channel between
Nanning, the region's capital, and Guangzhou, capital of
neighboring prosperous Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
With an investment of 10 billion yuan in the past six years,
the new transportation network has basically taken shape and 869
km of expressways are open connecting 99.3 percent of the region's
townships.
</P>
<P>
Three railways and the highway network have connected Nanning
with all major ports, local economic centers, and hubs outside the
region, like Kunming, capital of its western neighbor Yunnan
Province.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- An emergency meeting of the Arab
Parliamentary Union (APU) opened here on Sunday to discuss the
recent U.S.-British air attacks on Baghdad and economic sanctions
on the country.
</P>
<P>
APU President Ahmad Fathi Sorour said he hopes the emergency
meeting will finally reflect a pan-Arab position on the Iraqi
issue, and find a course to preserve national interests of Arab
countries and guarantee their respect for international legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
Sorour, who is also a member of the Egyptian National Assembly,
expressed hopes that the Amman meeting, called by the Jordanian
House of Deputies (lower house ), will be a step toward convening
an Arab summit on the Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
He also praised Jordan for its stand of achieving Arab unity
and solidarity on the Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the meeting were parliamentary delegations
from Jordan, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt,
Syria, Tunisia, Algeria, Djibouti, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco,
Mauritania, Yemen, and the Palestinians.

</P>
<P>
Hammadi said upon his arrival in Amman Saturday evening he
will call upon the APU meeting to adopt a resolution,
condemning UN sanctions on Iraq and also committing Arab
governments to break the economic embargo on his country.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Warns to Fire on Enemy Planes in Its Air Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice President Taha
Yassin Ramadan has warned that Iraq will open fire on enemy
planes that violate its air space.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan made the warning in a night interview with a
Qatar-based Arab television Jazirah on Saturday, the Iraqi News
Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan said Iraqi air defense forces will fire on enemy
planes that fly over its territorial sky.
</P>
<P>
After the 1991 Gulf War, sparked by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait,
the U.S. and Britain set up no-fly zones in northern and southern
Iraq with a declared aim of protecting the north's Kurdish
minorities and south's Shiite Muslims from the oppression of the
central government. But U.S. and British jet fighters have been
flying observing missions over the zones to enforce their
decision.
</P>
<P>
The agency said since the U.S.-British air strikes on Iraq last
week, many enemy war planes have violated Iraqi air space in
various forms and some of them launched missiles at Iraqi
anti-aircraft positions.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Issue Bonds for Agricultural Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
announced Sunday that it has authorized the National Development
Corp. to issue 50 billion pesos (1.25 billion U.S. dollars) of
bonds to tap the support of private banks in modernizing the
agriculture sector.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued here, the presidential office said
that President Joseph Estrada has approved the issuance of these
tax-exempt bonds.
</P>
<P>
The office said that the bonds will serve as an alternative for
the banking sector to comply with a government requirement for
them to earmark a portion of their funds for agricultural credit.
</P>
<P>
Under the Presidential Decree No.717, private banks in the
Philippines are required to set aside 25 percent of their loanable
funds for rural credit. But the banking sector has failed to fully
comply with these requirements.
</P>
<P>
To check this lapse, the office said, President Estrada ordered
the central bank to step up its campaign to ensure the full
implementation of the order, and institute the necessary penalties
against banks which fail to comply with the law.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Finance Minister
Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda is seeking cabinet approval to extend
implementation of austerity measures for control of government
spending on personnel for another two years.
</P>
<P>
Thai News Agency reported Sunday that Tarrin's proposal will be
tabled for cabinet consideration next Tuesday. The cabinet on
February 3 approved a resolution on the austerity measures for
implementation during the years of 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
The measures, after nearly a year of implementation, proved
effective and helped the government save about 8.160 billion baht
(226 million U.S. dollars). Tarrin, therefore, wants to extend the
measures to the year 2001, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The measures include:
</P>
<P>
-- Until the year 2001 there will be no expansion of existing
agencies or establishment of new agencies, except establishments
and mergers as required by the constitution;
</P>
<P>
-- There will be no changes in salary structures, position
allowances or welfare benefits;
</P>
<P>
-- Expenses on personnel administration will be limited to
only as allowed in the plan on increase of efficiency and spending
cuts; and
</P>
<P>
-- Consideration of requests for new slots with position
allowances will be delayed.

<HEADLINE> No Time for Playing Politics: Myanmar Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 27 (Xinhua) -- "Much work remains ahead of us
and this is no time for playing politics," a government statement
said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government is working hard to develop the country
and guide it through the current regional economic crisis, an
official Information Sheet said.
</P>
<P>
The Information Sheet stressed the need to work together to
develop strong policies on economic development,
counter-narcotics, national security.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the NLD (National League for Democracy) will
contribute in a positive and meaningful way to achieving a better,
fuller life for the people of Myanmar and take a more responsible,
constructive cooperation rather than resorting to whimsical and
symbolic gestures designed merely to attract attention and create
seasonal and sensational headline," it added.
</P>
<P>
The Information Sheet charged that the NLD is playing politics
by issuing last week a statement that party members should not
worry of the rumor that Aung San Suu Kyi (NLD general secretary)
would be deported after new year.
</P>
<P>
A long series of government-organized nationwide "mass
rallies", which began in September, called for deportation of Aung
San Suu Kyi and dissolving the NLD.
</P>
<P>
However, the Myanmar government has so far not yet taken any
action against her.
</P>
<P>
The NLD, a winning party in the 1990 General Election,
unilaterally formed a ten-member Committee Representing the
People's Parliament Elected in the Election and set up the
People's Parliament on September 16.
</P>
<P>
The NLD's move angered the government which said it constitutes
threat to the national security.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Foreign Reserves Up One Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's gross foreign
currency reserves rose by 1 percent or 300 million U.S. dollars to
reach 30 billion dollars in the week to December 18, Thai News
Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the increase to the country's persistent
current account surpluses and inflows of foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time since October 1997 that Thailand's
foreign reserves reached 30 billion dollars. In October last year,
the country's foreign currency reserves stood at 31.4 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has posted a current account surplus each month since
September 1997. Before that, no monthly surplus had been
registered since 1986. Surpluses this year have averaged about 1
billion dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
The turnaround results from a currency devaluation in July 1997
and a recession, both of which have crimped demand for imports.
</P>
<P>
Still, the central bank owes 7.3 billion dollars mostly to
domestic commercial banks, in forward swap loans taken out last
year in a vain attempt to defend the baht from devaluation.
</P>
<P>
It also owes about 12 billion dollars to the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), several governments and international
development banks for a bailout credit arranged by the IMF in
August 1997. The credit was set up after Thailand spent more than
90 percent of its reserves in the failed baht defense.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's reserves will get another 500 million dollars this
month, as the IMF last week approved the next tranche of the
bailout program, which totals 17.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Thailand reports its foreign reserves every Friday as a
condition of the program. Before then, it announced foreign
reserves every month.
</P>
<P>
The central bank only gives the value in dollar terms, though
part of its reserves are in other currencies and gold. Thailand
won't reveal the composition of its reserves, though analysts said
about three-quarters is in U.S. dollars, with most of the
remainder in Japanese yen, Deutsche marks and British pounds.
</P>
<P>
The central bank spent more than 35 billion dollars of its
reserves to support its currency in the year leading up to July
1997, when it scrapped a system that closely pegged the baht to
the dollar. Thailand's peak reserves were 39.9 billion dollars in
October 1996.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Asian Economies Seek Recovery Through Reforms (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The financial crisis that
ravaged Asia in mid-1997 has spread out and worsened in 1998,
causing continued fluctuation in international financial market
and severe damage to the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the active measures taken by major Asian countries
to curb the crisis and revitalize their economies, analysts are
striking an optimistic note that the Asian economy would somewhat
recover in 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, considering uncertainties in the Asian economy, some
analysts noted that Asia may have a long way to go before
realizing a complete economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, leading Asian economies, which were the first to fall
victim to the crisis, sank deeper into the economic mire. Japan,
South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia all experienced a
tremendous turmoil in financial market and sharp slide in
economy. Even worse, economic deterioration triggered social
chaos and unrests in some countries.
</P>
<P>
To step out of the crisis, the above-mentioned countries have
introduced a series of intense reform and adjustment to their
financial systems, economic management mechanisms and policies.
Some of the measures have paid off.
</P>
<P>
Japan's economy, which contracted for the first time in 23
years in 1997, further deteriorated in fiscal 1998, with gross
domestic product (GDP) expected to post a negative growth for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
Facing the worst economic recession since World War II, the
new Japanese cabinet has put top priority on economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
To stabilize its financial system and spur the economy, it
adopted a series of counter-crisis measures, including a 60
trillion yen (about 517.2 billion dollars) financial
stabilization package and a 24 trillion yen (about 206.9 billion
dollars) emergency economic stimulus package.
</P>
<P>
The measures, to a certain extent, eased the country's credit
crunch, injected vigor into enterprises, expanded domestic demand
and helped people restore confidence in the Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
As long as Japan further speeds up its economic structural
reform and relaxes restrictions on economic activities, analysts
believe the Japanese economy will get on a recovery track in
1999.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's economy is expected to have a minus six percent
growth this year, due to the bitter impact of the financial
crisis caused by corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
To curb the drastic downturn in economy, the government
conducted intense restructuring and readjustment in financial and
corporate sectors, and has made considerable achievement as these
sectors have shown signs of improvement.
</P>
<P>
The government has restructured debt-laden financial
institutions by forced shut-down and mergers, thus pushing ahead
the readjustment of the industrial structures of corporations.
</P>
<P>
The Seoul stock and foreign exchange currency markets have
shown continued upturn since the fourth quarter of 1998, and the
nation's foreign exchange reserves rose to 50 billion U.S.
dollars. Economists predicted that the South Korean economy will g
 radually recover in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Current Account Heads into Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The current account of Egypt
showed a deficit of 2,122 million U.S. dollars in the 1997-98
fiscal year mainly as a result of increased imports and a fall in
tourism income, an economic weekly has said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt also had a 135-million-dollar deficit on the overall
balance of payments because of a sharp reduction in portfolio
investment, the latest issue of the Middle East Economic Digest
said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's current account and overall balance of payments showed
substantial surpluses in the last few years, said the London-based
weekly, which specifically covers Middle East countries' economic
and business activities.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's exports increased by 8 percent to 5,331 million
dollars, despite lower oil prices. However, the trade deficit
still increased to 11,221 million dollars because of a 12 percent
rise in imports to 16,552 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The current account was also hit by a fall in services income.
</P>
<P>
Suez Canal dues brought in 1,776 million dollars, slightly down
from the last year, and tourism income dropped to 2,940.5 million
dollars from 3,646 million dollars as a result of the November
1997 massacre of 58 foreign tourists in Luxor, a resort of 520
kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The largest source of foreign currency for Egypt is remittances
from workers abroad, which stood at 3,518 million dollars in the
1997-98 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
But economists said that remittances are likely to be affected
in 1998-99 and 1999-2000 by the impact on Gulf economies of the
crash in oil prices. The latest reports said the oil prices
slumped to about 10 dollars a barrel in the world markets.
</P>
<P>
This could mean that Egypt faces current account deficits of
3,000 million-5,000 million dollars in each of the next two years,
the economists said.
</P>
<P>
However, they anticipated a continued surplus in the capital
account, but some shrinkage of the Central Bank of Egypt's 20,000
million dollars foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
In 1997-98, the capital account showed a surplus of over 3,000
million dollars. Foreign direct investment rose to 1,028 million
dollars from 770 million dollars, but there was a 248 million
dollars net outflow of portfolio investment compared with a net
inflow of 1,463 million dollars in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's fiscal years run from July 1 to June 30.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Might Set Up Court to Curb "Sky Rage" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The South African Civil
Aviation Authority (CAA) is considering setting up an
aviation-dedicated court to deal with unruly behaviors of flight
passengers, or "sky rage".
</P>
<P>
Passengers found guilty of unruly behavior could face a
life-long ban on flying with South African airlines, Sunday Times
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The move comes in the wake of a growing number of incidents of
"sky rage", in which passengers verbally and physically abused
cabin attendants and even cockpit crews, in some cases
endangering the flight.
</P>
<P>
The six big airlines in the country have all experienced an
increasing number of incidents of unruliness by passengers, from
sexual harassment to threats of assault and dangerous invasions
of cockpits.
</P>
<P>
Of particular concern to the airlines is that although all
serious incidents are reported to police, far too few
prosecutions follow and those that do are often accompanied by
suspended sentences or light fines.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors apparently do not perceive rowdy behavior on
aircraft, caused mainly by drunkenness, as dangerous compared
with the capital crimes they deal with daily, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
However, the newly appointed CAA Commissioner Trevor Abrahams
said bad behavior could endanger an aircraft and its occupants.
</P>
<P>
"Looking for a fight on the ground is one thing, but looking
for a fight at 30,000 feet is another altogether," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the paper failed to say when Abrahams made the remarks.
</P>
<P>
Abrahams said the CAA was considering a special court for "sky
rage".
</P>
<P>
He said discussions would begin with interested parties in
January. The court should be ready for action within six months.
</P>
<P>
"Too many passengers are getting away with contraventions of
the Civil Aviation Offenses Act because prosecutors are not
sensitive to the dangers a drunken belligerent passenger poses to
the safety of a flight," said Abrahams.
</P>
<P>
He believed the court would be the ideal way to enforce
aviation regulations. It would also be capable of handing down
sentences that include the banning of a convicted passenger from
flying for a certain period, or life.
</P>
<P>
The court could also deal with disputes and with cases of
malpractice, fraud and corruption.
</P>
<P>
Many airlines bosses are in favor of banning troublesome
passengers, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In another article, the paper said more than 40 incidents of
"sky rage" have been experienced by South Africa's six major
carriers in the past year.
</P>
<P>
The offenses included refusing to buckle up seat belts on
landing, lighting up cigarettes, talking on cellphones, harassing
female cabin staff, invading cockpits and threatening to shoot
crew and blow up an aircraft.

BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- No one was killed or injured
in a commercial center fire in China's capital of Beijing today.

<P>
The fire broke out at 13:25. in Xidan's "Time Square", and was

</P>
<P>
"It has caused no severe property loss because the fire brigade
got here very fast," said Liu Changsheng, project manager of the

</P>
<P>
The fire brigade sources gathered that the fire was caused by a
kind of burning plate which led to the explosion of a fire
extinguisher, but the real cause of the fire is still under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
As one of Beijing's major projects, the "square" is expected to

to pass the Swaziland Administration Order of 1998, an
unidentified source was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The strict ordinance provides chiefs with sweeping new powers
over their subjects. However, it also takes away some of their
rights.
</P>
<P>
Chiefs who do not run their territories in accordance with the
new law will face severe penalties. They can be deposed by the
king if found guilty of neglecting their duties, or face fines of
up to 5,000 Rand (about 834 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
But Swaziland's chiefs now have the power to arrest anyone,
particularly a subject who is suspected "of conducting himself in
a manner which might cause a riot, disturbance or breach of the
peace".
</P>
<P>
Legal sources in the kingdom believed that the new legislation
was specifically aimed at political meetings.
</P>
<P>
If a chief allows what might be seen by the king as a
disturbance of the peace in particular area, "the king may
instruct the home affairs minister to issue an order to move a
chief, or his dependents living with him, from one Swazi area to
another."
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, a chief may be fined or deposed.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland's political sources said the king's power to expel a
chief from his position and his territory will become a
contentious matter among the people of Swaziland because by
tradition the king has no right to decide who should or should
not be a chief.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland, which has been ruled by royal decree since 1973
when King Mswati's father, King Sobhuza II, banned political
parties and repealed the constitution he inherited from Britain
at independence in 1968, is now more firmly under the thumb of
the king.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Asian Economies Seek Recovery Through Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The financial crisis that
ravaged Asia in mid-1997 has spread out and worsened in 1998,
causing continued fluctuation in international financial market
and severe damage to the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the active measures taken by major Asian countries
to curb the crisis and revitalize their economies, analysts are
striking an optimistic note that the Asian economy would somewhat
recover in 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, considering uncertainties in the Asian economy, some
analysts noted that Asia may have a long way to go before
realizing a complete economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, leading Asian economies, which were the first to fall
victim to the crisis, sank deeper into the economic mire. Japan,
South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia all experienced a
tremendous turmoil in financial market and sharp slide in
economy. Even worse, economic deterioration triggered social
chaos and unrests in some countries.
</P>
<P>
To step out of the crisis, the above-mentioned countries have
introduced a series of intense reform and adjustment to their
financial systems, economic management mechanisms and policies.
Some of the measures have paid off.
</P>
<P>
Japan's economy, which contracted for the first time in 23
years in 1997, further deteriorated in fiscal 1998, with gross
domestic product (GDP) expected to post a negative growth for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
Facing the worst economic recession since World War II, the
new Japanese cabinet has put top priority on economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
To stabilize its financial system and spur the economy, it
adopted a series of counter-crisis measures, including a 60
trillion yen (about 517.2 billion dollars) financial
stabilization package and a 24 trillion yen (about 206.9 billion
dollars) emergency economic stimulus package.
</P>
<P>
The measures, to a certain extent, eased the country's credit
crunch, injected vigor into enterprises, expanded domestic demand
and helped people restore confidence in the Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
As long as Japan further speeds up its economic structural
reform and relaxes restrictions on economic activities, analysts
believe the Japanese economy will get on a recovery track in
1999.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's economy is expected to have a minus six percent
growth this year, due to the bitter impact of the financial
crisis caused by corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
To curb the drastic downturn in economy, the government
conducted intense restructuring and readjustment in financial and
corporate sectors, and has made considerable achievement as these
sectors have shown signs of improvement.
</P>
<P>
The government has restructured debt-laden financial
institutions by forced shut-down and mergers, thus pushing ahead
the readjustment of the industrial structures of corporations.
</P>
<P>
The Seoul stock and foreign exchange currency markets have
shown continued upturn since the fourth quarter of 1998, and the
nation's foreign exchange reserves rose to 50 billion U.S.
dollars. Economists predicted that the South Korean economy will g
radually recover in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, another victim of the Asian economic crisis, has
basically succeeded in curbing the impact of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Focusing its reforms on the financial sector, it closed down
56 debt-ridden financial institutions, amended or passed a number
of laws to streamline the financial sector, cooled the real
estate development fever and adjusted deposit and lending rates
to ease the liquidity crunch.
</P>
<P>
The reforms have greatly helped ease the crisis. Some
international organizations, including the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), maintained that Thailand could be the first Southeast
Asian country to get out of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government, while predicting a minus 7 percent
economic growth for 1998, believed the economy would bottom out
next year and reach a 1 percent growth by year's end.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia got into an economic recession in 1998 with its real
GDP estimated to contract by 6.2 percent, a "severe and
unprecedented" contraction compared with an average growth rate
of 8 percent during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Facing the sharp contraction, the government made a turnaround
change in macro-economic policy, abandoning tight fiscal and
monetary policies and to provide funds to major productive
sectors to stimulate domestic consumption and economic
activities.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the National Economic Action Council unveiled a
National Economic Recovery Plan in July, which focused on
stabilizing currency and capital market and consolidating
economic foundations.
</P>
<P>
The government announced on September 1 to impose controls on
selective exchange and peg its local currency, the ringgit, at a
rate of 3.8 to the U.S. dollar, a bid to insulate itself from
"predatory speculators."
</P>
<P>
With the recovery measures, Malaysia's domestic investment and
demand are expected to expand and its businesses and consumer
confidence are expected to become stable next year. The
government has projected a positive real GDP growth for 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' economic growth this year has been affected
both by regional financial crisis and natural disasters. However,
the country's economic performance is better than that of its
neighbors such as Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
While the economies of its neighbors were contracting, the
Philippines' GDP could still grow by at least 1 percent, thanks
to a series of adjustment policies taken by the government to
prevent an economic recession.
</P>
<P>
The country's exports registered an 18 percent increase in the
first 10 months this year, and its 4.5 million overseas workers
have brought in 6 billion U.S. dollars so far.
</P>
<P>
The continuous export growth and high revenues from overseas
labor market have played an important role in stabilizing the
country's financial market, and have paved the way for an
economic recovery in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's economy, described as one of the "tiger economies"
in Asia before 1997, has plunged into a deep recession in 1998
following a prolonged monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
Its currency the rupiah has devalued by 60 percent against the
U.S. dollar. Government officials foresee a GDP shrinkage of
about 14 percent, compared with a positive growth of 6 percent a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
The deepening economic crisis also led to a grave political
crisis which forced former President Soeharto to step down.
</P>
<P>
To check the crisis, the Indonesian government under President
B.J. Habibie has taken important measures to stabilize the
exchange rate of the rupiah against foreign currencies and shift
development priority from heavy industry to small and medium-size
d enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Besides inputting money to boost national businesses and the
ailing banking sector, the Indonesian government is also vying
for assistance from international monetary bodies such as the
IMF, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
However, most analysts predicted that Indonesia' economic
growth in 1999 would be negative between 6 percent to 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
They also added that the country's economic recovery will
largely depend on the political stability in the country, where a
general election was scheduled for June.

<HEADLINE> 100 Somali Refugees Missing on Homeward Voyage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 27 (Xinhua) -- A boat with about 100 Somali
refugees, which left Kenya's Indian Ocean port Mombasa Wednesday
for Kismayu, southern Somalia, has been missing.
</P>
<P>
The dhow, the mv Tawfiq, had left port with two other vessels
which arrived in Kismayu Friday with a total of some 300
refugees, the East African Standard newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
They are among some 1,000 Somali refugees who were stranded in
Mombasa after the nearby Jomvu Refugee Camp was demolished by the
Kenyan government about two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 600 refugees were to sail home Saturday but were
forced to delay the trip as the boats were being loaded with 36
tons of relief food for them.
</P>
<P>
The mv Tawfiq, which was reportedly overloaded, and smaller
than the other vessels and with weak communication equipment, was
lost somewhere off the Kilifi coast, north of Mombasa, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the dhow was to return Mombasa by Saturday to
avoid the rough sea between Mombasa and Lamu, but officials at
the Kenya Ports Authority said they have not received any
communications from the dhow.
</P>
<P>
"Now we do not know whether the captain (of the missing dhow)
decided to sail ahead to Kismayu instead of returning to
Mombasa," the source said, adding that the whereabouts of the
dhow were a total mystery.
</P>
<P>
The other two dhows which reached Kismayu communicated with
Mombasa Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Jomvu camp, which originally hosted more than 100,000 Somali
refugees, closed earlier this month, four years after Kenyan
President Daniel arap Moi ordered all refugees to leave Coast
Province.
</P>
<P>
Kenya shelters 188,000 refugees in the northeastern Dadaab and
northwestern Kakuma refugee camps, down from a maximum of 420,000
persons in 1992 following large scale repatriation to Somalia and
Ethiopia and the resettlement of more than 35,000 refugees to
third countries.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu Becomes Major Medicine Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province
has become a leading producer of medicines and medical equipment,
official figures show.
</P>
<P>
Total industrial output and sales of the pharmaceutical sector
will reach 17.5 billion yuan and 10.5 billion yuan, respectively,
this year, according to Mao Jilin, Director of the Jiangsu
Provincial Medical Administration. Mao said that medicine-related
industrial and commercial taxes are expected to hit 1.8 billion
yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
Mao attributed the rapid growth of the sector to China's
market-oriented reforms in the past 20 years. He said that Jiangsu
implemented a total of 131 key technical renovation projects in
the sector in the last two decades, with investment exceeding five
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu's medicine sector is especially strong in the
production of both Chinese and western medicines, medical
equipment, packaging, and biological medicines, Mao said. He added
that 60 pharmeceutical products of Jiangsu had a domestic market
share of more than 50 percent each in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu has developed and imported more than 1,000 items of
medical technology since the late 1970s and has been given
approval to produce 247 new medicines since 1987, the year when a
new set of medical standards was introduced, according to Mao.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Jiangsu's medicine exports are expected to
reach two billion yuan this year, about 45 folds of the figure of
1978. Currently Jiangsu has approved 380 Sino-overseas joint
ventures specializing in medicines.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban to Import Gas From Turkmenistan: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Taliban
militia have signed an agreement with Turkmenistan on the import
of 600 tons of liquefied natural gas, the Frontier Post reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The English daily quoted Afghan sources as saying Saturday in
Peshawar, Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, that the
agreement was signed recently by the two sides and the Turkmen gas
would be supplied to energy-deficient areas of war-torn
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Afghanistan and Turkmenistan has grown by 11
percent in the past year despite the near international isolation
of the Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
Turkmenistan is the third country in the world after Pakistan
and the United Arab Emirates, with which the Taliban enjoy normal
relations and are involved in considerable two-way trade.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the Taliban also signed an agreement
with Turkmenistan in September on the import of petrol, diesel and
jet fuel.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan has been dependent entirely on fuel imports from
neighboring Iran before the Taliban signed the agreements with
Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
Besides fuel, Afghanistan is also importing electricity, cloth,
wheat, fertilizer and machinery from Turkmenistan while its
exports to its central Asian neighbor include rice, carpets and
dry fruits.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Partially Privatize Phone Networks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
decided to partially privatize the Posts and Telecommunications
Corporation's fixed telecom network and the country's largest
mobile phone operator, NetOne, by the end of next March.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chimutengwende, Minister of Information, Posts and
Telecommunications, told The Sunday Mail that the government will
privatize up to 40 percent in these areas. The government would
advertize nationally and internationally so as to attract the
best possible offers.
</P>
<P>
"Partial privatization will be pursued as a logical step
following the commercialization of the corporation. The fixed
telecommunications business and the cellular business lend
themselves well to early partial privatization," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, there is need to inject private
sector funding in the corporation to sustain growth and survive
the onslaught of competition.
</P>
<P>
"This will be done by acquiring a strategic partner and by
involving local investors in the initial sale of equity," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the postal operation would not be privatized in
the foreseeable future. It was actually expected to become more
profitable so that it could sustain itself without subsidies.

<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The unprecedented active
exchanges with other major world powers have been the most
eye-catching part in China's diplomacy in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of China and a big number of other major world powers
have exchanged visits this year. Through the visits, they have
coordinated their stance and enhanced cooperation on major
international issues, and this has played a positive role in
promoting a new kind of international relationship for world peace
and common development.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited important neighboring
countries of Russia and Japan from November 22 to 30. In Russia,
Jiang held his first "no-tie" meeting with his Russian
counterpart, Boris Yeltson. They exchanged views on the
development tendency of international relations, and reached
common understanding on the strategy of developing bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang's visit to Japan is the first of its kind in
history. A guideline for cross-century Sino-Japanese relations
has been formulated. The two sides, proceeding from the spirit of
drawing lessons from history and facing up to the future, have
agreed to establish a friendly and cooperative partnership devoted
to peace and development.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, leaders of many important countries in the
world have also visited China, including US President Bill
Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, French Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin, Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, Portuguese
Prime Minister Antonio Guterres, Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc
Dehaene and Chairman of the European Commission Jacques
Santer. The newly-elected German Prime Minister, Gerhard
Schroeder, also expressed the wish to visit China early next year.
</P>
<P>
As the result of these visits, China has set up partnerships
with such countries like the United States, Russia, Britain,
France and Japan. This new kind of partnership which features
"non-confrontation, non-alignment, and not targeting at the third
country" has enabled China to play a positive role in
international affairs, and helped with the balanced development of
 international relations.

<TEXT>
<P>
As Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan pointed out recently
multi-polarization has been the most outstanding feature in the
international situation.
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances of world multi-polarization and
economic globalization, Tang said, China has stuck to its foreign
policy of peace and independence. Its image as a major responsible
power in safeguarding peace and promoting has been widely hailed
by the international community.
</P>
<P>
However, the establishment of a new international political and
economic order, which will undoubtedly affect the old pattern of
interest, requires all the countries, especially the few developed
ones, to genuinely take up their responsibility in safeguarding
world peace and promoting common development of the mankind,
rather than putting self-interest on top of all other things and
pursuing hegemony and power politics.
</P>
<P>
Some 10 days ago, the United States and Britain launched a
surprise military attack on Iraq without the authorization of the
Security Council of the United Nations, and this obviously
violated the UN Charter and the basic principles of international
relations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin noted on the same day that the
military attack will possibly cause "severe consequences" to the
situation of the Gulf region and to international relations.
</P>
<P>
He called on the United States and Britain to stop the military
strike immediately and create conditions for the relevant parties
to seek a solution through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Diplomacy is undoubtedly based on national strength. It's
hardly possible for an economically poor and backward, and
politically unstable country to conduct successful
diplomacy. Thus, the improvement of China's international
importance is, in addition to its correct foreign policy, the
result of its national stability and sustained economic
development, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Citrus Fruits In Southern China Facing Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- In spite of a drop in output,
citrus fruits in Guangdong Province are selling at extremely low
prices because of inadequate marketing sources.
</P>
<P>
This year, Guangdong expects to harvest 750,000 tons of citrus
fruits, 120,000 tons fewer than last year. Citrus is the leading
fruit of the southern Chinese province, which has 66,666 hectares
under citrus fruits. It only consumes about 50 percent of the
output itself.
</P>
<P>
Citrus fruits maturing in December accounted for over 80
percent of the output, meaning that it will be hard for the market
to absorb the fruit all at once. And, there is no wholesale market
in most citrus fruit growing areas, so the growers have to sell
the fruits to private business people at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
If the farmers hold the fruit until January or February, they
can strike a better bargain, but the lack of information prevents
them from doing so.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in the province have suggested that output be cut of
fruit that matures around December, and that the wholesale market
be improved as a way of solving the selling problem.

<HEADLINE> China to Use More Overseas Investment for Railway Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- China plans to utilize
10-billion-yuan worth of overseas investment in five years for
railway construction, an official from the Ministry of Railways
said.
</P>
<P>
The funding will be used to build railway networks, upgrade
communications equipment and improve environment protection
facilites. With the lifting of train travelling speed and the
constrution of the Beijing-Shanghai express railway, more funds
will be needed. New railways will be built and old ones upgraded.
</P>
<P>
Some 250 billion yuan will be allocated in five years for
railway construction, and a total of 350 billion yuan is needed if
the development of related industries is taken in consideration,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
China began to utilize overseas investment for railway
constrution in the 1980s, and by the end of 1997, a total of 5.17
billion U.S. dollars had been utilized. However, foreign
investment accounted for only 4 percent of the total investment
for the corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
Most of the overseas funding were loans extended by the World
Bank, the Asian Development Bank, commercial banks or
inter-governmental loans.
</P>
<P>
To attract overseas direct investment, the Ministry of Railways
has offered a number of construction projects to foreign
investors, which demand smaller input while promising sound
economic returns.
</P>
<P>
Because foreign investors will bring advanced technology and
management expertise to China, they will also help promote the
export of railway-related products.

<HEADLINE> Old Elephant on Feet Again After 81 Hours of Rescue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, December 27 (Xinhua) -- A 24-year-old female
elephant was on its feet again with the help of more than 30
people after it dropped with acute diseases for 81 hours in
Zhengzhou Zoo in central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
The 4.5-ton elephant is still supported by five thick ropes and
three suspended chains.
</P>
<P>
Veterinarians here said it is a miracle that so heavy an
elephant stand up again after it was down for three days because
its heavy weight could bring excessive burdens to the heart and
lying down on ground usually means death to an elephant.
</P>
<P>
In the past decades, only one housed elephant survived after
being down for 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The elephant contracted acute pancreatitis and septicemia on
December 20. The death toll of the diseases stand for over 85
percent for human beings.
</P>
<P>
Over a dozen veterinarians from Shanghai, Wuhan and Beijing
participated in the rescue of the elephant. They injected each day
270 bottles of sugar-salt water and gave 40 antiphlogistic
injections made in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
So far, the body temperature of the elephant has become normal
and the number of the white blood cells are approaching the normal
level.

<HEADLINE> Pyongyang Urges US to Stop Muddling in Its Internal Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, December 27 (Xinhua) -- A leading newspaper in the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Monday urged the
United States to stop pressuring DPRK in its choice of political
system and economic administrative model, warning that the U.S.
move would only destroy peace and stability on the Korean
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Rodong Sinmun said in a commentary that it was
up to the people of each individual country to choose their
political systems and economic administrative models.
</P>
<P>
It said that the U.S. claim of "missile threats" and
"inspections" was grave violation of DPRK's sovereignty and
interference in its internal affairs, which was aimed to touch
off a war.
</P>
<P>
The commentary demanded the United States stop making
indiscreet remarks at the DPRK's political system. It pointed out
at the same time that peace and stability on the Korean peninsula
would be guaranteed only if the DPRK's socialist system was
respected and the unjustified sanctions on it were lifted.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. troops in South Korea posed a most brutal ravage of
DPRK's sovereignty, the commentary said. The military
confrontation and the pall of war on the Korean peninsula would
not be eliminated until the U.S. forces were pulled out.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK had very clear stance, the commentary noted. That
was, only if the United States respected its sovereignty and did
not intervene in its internal affairs or exert pressure on it,
would DPRK act accordingly. Otherwise, DPRK would take
countermeasures.

<P>
COLOMBO, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga is scheduled to leave here Sunday for New Delhi for a
three-day visit to India.
</P>
<P>
During her visit, Kumaratunga will meet Indian Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee for wide-ranging talks on a number of
bilateral issues, possibly including the Tamil rebels' latest
peace offer, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
The visit is also likely to witness the signing of a landmark
trade agreement between the two countries, although officials from
both sides are still working hard to finalize the draft text.
</P>
<P>
Trade, investment and joint ventures of the small and medium
scale businesses are said to be among the highlights of the
agreement. New areas such as biotechnology, electronics,
information technology and atmospheric sciences are also to be
covered.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said President Kumaratunga would brief the
Indian leader on the recent offer by the Tamil rebels' leader
Prabhakaran to conduct peace talks, and the government's own
response to it.
</P>
<P>
"As close neighbors, it is natural for the Sri Lankan President
to keep India informed of an issue that extends across the Palk
Straits," said a Sri Lankan official who refused to be named.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga will also call on Indian president K.R. Narayanan
and the opposition Congress leader Sonia Gandhi.

<HEADLINE> Peaceful Co-existence or Tribal Killings (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 27 (Xinhua) -- A tiny landlocked
country in the Great Lakes Region in central Africa, Burundi
witnessed an exceptional year of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The seven million war-torn residents in a territory of 26,338
square kilometers made the first and decisive step this year
toward the goal of national reconciliation and peaceful
co-existence.
</P>
<P>
Mediated by Tanzanian founder, former president Julius
Nyerere, the government, political parties and armed rebels
attended the first round of peace talks in the Tanzanian northern
town of Arusha in June.
</P>
<P>
In the following July and October, all the factions met again
in the Arusha International Conference Center for two more rounds
of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Positive results were brought about from the talks as the
factions agreed to cease fire, set up rules of procedures for
future talks, trace the root of conflicts, and form five
committees specialized in security, democracy, construction,
governance and etc.
</P>
<P>
As the fourth round of talks was scheduled in January next
year, all the participants expressed such a desire that the
long-term bloody tribal conflicts should come to an end to pave
the way for a peaceful democratic state by way of national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The international community was encouraged by this milestone
progress in Burundi, which has since its independence in 1962
experienced five military coups and suffered a forceful change of
seven presidents.
</P>
<P>
One of the two assassinated presidents was Melchior Ndadaye,
the first freely elected head of state in 1993 when a multi-party
system was introduced to Burundi.
</P>
<P>
His death in a coup staged by a group of Tutsi army officers
sparked off large scale tribal conflicts which have claimed an
estimated 150,000 civilians so far and forced millions to flee to
neighboring countries, thus inflicting turmoil on the region.
</P>
<P>
The endless conflicts in Burundi rooted deeply in the colonial
rules during which the westerners propped up minority Tutsis to
reign in the army and government while the majority Hutus could
only have a second-class status.
</P>
<P>
Such situation has continued since independence and reached a
peak in July 25, 1996 when the Tutsi-dominated army deposed
another ethnic Hutu president Sylvestre Ntibantunganya and
re-throned retired Major Pierre Buyoya, who was defeated by
Melchior Ndadaye in the 1993 presidential elections.

<TEXT>
<P>
However, Buyoya, a Tutsi, was boycotted by the majority Hutus,
especially the armed extremists, and was immediately slapped on
the economic sanctions by neighboring Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia,
Uganda, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
More than two years have passed and the hardship suffered by
the boycotted Burundians forced the Buyoya government to accept
the neighbors' preconditions for lifting the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
It has taken positive steps toward reconciliation by releasing
opposition leaders from house arrest, accepting some Hutus into
parliament and the cabinet, even naming one to be vice-president
of the country.
</P>
<P>
After that, Buyoya finally sat at a negotiation table in
Arusha with the opposition Hutus.
</P>
<P>
The Hutu rebels have been since waging a guerrilla war against
the Tutsi-dominated army by attacking government strongholds and
killing villagers.
</P>
<P>
But they also try to get something from the peace talks that
they can't get in the battlefields.
</P>
<P>
What's more important is that the people of Burundi are
becoming tired of the endless tribal conflicts, and they hope a
national reconciliation could prevent tribal killings like those
happened in Rwanda which had claimed over 500,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Though a breakthrough has been achieved toward such a
reconciliation, more work remains to be done, both by the
Burundians and by the mediators in the forthcoming year.
</P>
<P>
The core of the Burundi conflicts lies in power-sharing
between the Tutsis and the Hutus. A realistic vision is that by
casting aside the colonial concepts, either tribe can enjoy an
equal and reasonable right in the governance.
</P>
<P>
Some of the thorny but inevitable tasks are to transform the
Tutsi-controlled army into one that belongs to the whole nation,
and to develop the past production mode characterized by a single
tribe into one that both tribes share the interests and the
risks.
</P>
<P>
The international community, especially its neighbors, should
respect the choice made by the Burundian people themselves and
refrain from backing any party in the bloody conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Observers here hold that the sanctions, which also backfire on
the imposers, should be gradually relaxed and finally lifted in
line with the Burundi reconciliation process.
</P>
<P>
As the new year is drawing nearer, preparations for the fourth
round of peace talks are well under way in Arusha while the
rebels' gunfires are still echoing in the hills overlooking the
capital of Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
To live a peaceful life and enjoy common development or to get
bogged down deeper and deeper into a Rwanda-type massacres is a
problem of life and death to the Burundians.
</P>
<P>
The world is waiting for a decision to be made by the people
of Burundi during the January meeting next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Plans by the rebel Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) to carry out fresh attacks on
economic targets have been unearthed by Sri Lankan detectives, the
Sunday Times reported.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Directorate of Internal Intelligence (DII)
told the newspaper that the plans were revealed when they
questioned five LTTE suspects who were arrested recently.
</P>
<P>
The targets include Ceylon Electricity Board transformers,
power stations and bank vehicles, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the suspects arrested in several parts of
the country were now being interrogated by detectives of the DII
which was set up recently to oversee all internal intelligence
work.
</P>
<P>
The DII official said police and institutions concerned had
been alerted to take extra precautions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, several economic targets, mainly
transformers, were attacked by the LTTE. But the attacks were
scaled down, reportedly because of the arrests of several
suspects.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been waging a 15-year-old war against the
government for a separate Tamil state in the north and east of the
island country.

GUIYANG, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guizhou
Province plans to spend 50 million yuan to turn Hailongtun,

Through various wars, dynastic changes, and other vicissitudes,
Hailongtun has lost some of its original architectural
characteristics.

<P>
Zunyi city has spent 6.85 million yuan building roads to the
castle from three directions.

YANTAI, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The city of Yantai in east
China's Shandong Province has introduced advanced foreign
technology and fine fruit species to help agricultural development
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
A city government official says that Yantai has introduced
about 360 varieties of fruits from Japan, the United States, New
Zealand, Italy, and the Netherlands over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1980's, Yantai has introduced over 100 foreign
apple varieties that have helped improve local apple quality. The
Red Fuji apple cultivation area in Yantai accounts for a seventh
of the country's total, making Yantai the largest Fuji apple
producer.
</P>
<P>
Yantai also imported agriculture techniques for mulching, water
saving, and fruit processing. The mulching technique has raised
per hectare peanut output by 225 kilograms, and water-saving
irrigation has saved 400 million cubic meters of water annually,
meaning direct profits of more than 300 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The city has invited over agronomists from over twenty
countries, and has sent people to foreign countries to study
agriculture production and processing techniques.

<HEADLINE> Keane Contract Talks on Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United captain Roy
Keane is stalling over a new pay deal that could keep him at Old
Trafford for the rest of his career.
</P>
<P>
The Irish midfielder was thought to be close to signing an 8
million pound five-year deal last week
</P>
<P>
But the Sun newspaper quoted the player's adviser Michael
Kennedy as saying that there were "too many uncertainties at the
club for Roy to be discussing a new contract at this stage."
</P>
<P>
It is thought that Keane, 27, might want to hold on until the
future of manager Alex Ferguson has been settled.
</P>
<P>
He is also likely to want to wait to see if the proposed 623m
takeover over the club by BSkyB is concluded.
</P>
<P>
This could mean a delay of several months as the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission is not due to rule on whether the deal can
go ahead until March.

<HEADLINE> McManaman: I'm Totally Committed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Liverpool's Steve McManaman
has sent a Christmas message to reassure fans that he will not be
taking it easy with the possibility of a big-money move to Spain
or Italy.
</P>
<P>
The England international, who could leave on a free transfer
when his contract expires, insists he is fully committed to the
club.
</P>
<P>
"I know there is a lot of frustration about my contract and I
can understand some of the anger about it... But to say I don't
care about the club is totally untrue. Every second of every game
I play for Liverpool I am totally committed.
</P>
<P>
"I can't sey yet if I will be definitely going because the
decision is not finalised. But what I can say is that even if I
knew I was going at the end of the season, I would never go out
in a red shirt and not try."
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old is back to full fitness after being sidelined
by an Achilles tendon problem, an injury which he first suffered
during the World Cup finals in France.
</P>
<P>
McManaman, who was linked with Barcelona last year, wants to
play in the Champions' League but rejects suggestions that he
could give less than 100 per cent for the rest of the season in a
bid to avoid another injury, which could jeopardise his chances
of a move.
</P>
<P>
"I have always said I would love the chance to play abroad and
now that chance has come along. When you have a chance to join
clubs who are involved in the Champions' League every season, you
have to consider it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure everyone must see the logic in that. The accusations
that I am not trying really hurt. My demeanour may not be right
for some of the fans because I am a laid-back sort of player. But
believe me, I'm trying alright," he said.

<HEADLINE> Young Football Fans 'Priced Out' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Many children will be denied a
Christmas trip to see their favourite football team over the next
few days because of the high price of tickets, according to a new
report.
</P>
<P>
In the survey of 2,000 fans, nearly two-thirds of those with
young children said the cost of admission sometimes prevented
them from taking their families to games.
</P>
<P>
The average cost of Premiership tickets for two adults and two
children is 56. The cost at Chelsea is 88.
</P>
<P>
Alison Pilling of the Football Task Force, which ordered the
survey, said: "This Boxing Day, there will be many families
across the country who would like to be taking their children to
the match but can no longer afford to do so.
</P>
<P>
"Our survey provides startling new evidence of the extent to
which children are being shut out of our football grounds. The
game must act now if it is to save the fans of the future."
</P>
<P>
The Task Force's next commercial report will focus on the
pricing of children's tickets. Recommendations could include
Premiership clubs offering a fixed percentage of tickets to
children at a standard discount.
</P>
<P>
In May Sports Minister Tony Banks urged the Football Task
Force to investigate season ticket prices after 17 of the 20
Premiership clubs increased their cost by more than the 4% rate
of inflation.
</P>
<P>
Aston Villa put up the price of its most expensive season
ticket by 22%.
</P>
<P>
Derby County has frozen season ticket prices as an incentive
to fans to buy them early, but Arsenal and Blackburn have matched
Chelsea with a 15% rise.
</P>
<P>
Many fans say football is changing beyond recognition as high
wage demands from players, large television fees and major
merchandising deals make the game more money orientated.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United and Leeds United have been among the first
to set up their own television channels to reap the potential
rewards of pay-per-view.
</P>
<P>
Many clubs have also been criticised for the prices of replica
team strips.
</P>
<P>
However, the 20 Premiership clubs made a combined pre-tax loss
of 9.4 million pounds last year, despite increased turnover and
sharing a 50 million pounds advance payment from satellite
broadcaster BSkyB.

SAO PAULO, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's Palmeiras claimed
the second victory by beating sluggish Cruzeiro 3-1 in the first

<P>
The third game will be held on Tuesday before Palmeiras'

Prior to the match, Cruzeiro, which won the first-leg game
2-1, needed only a tie to capture the title, while Palmeiras had

Cruzeiro lost to the Corinthians 2-0 in the third leg at the

JAKARTA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Fire ravaged at least 25
houses in the populous subdistrict of Sawah Basar, Central
Jakarta, on Saturday, police said.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters had difficulty extinguishing the blaze because of

There was no immediate report of casualties and damage caused
by the blaze which started at 13:30 local time.

HEFEI, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Dredging operation with a total

</P>
<P>
The whole project will be completed within five years and will
benefit 1.5 million people, as well as helping to irrigate 200,000
hectares of fields, thus increasing the annual grain output by 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
A branch of the Huaihe River, the Kuisui river drains into
nearly 3,000 square kilometers of Anhui province, passing the main

<HEADLINE> Agricultural Growth to Slow Down in North China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural production
will maintain steady growth throughout 1999 in north China's Hebei
Province although the actual growth rate of its gross output will
be smaller than this year, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
During the January-September period of this year, the
traditional agricultural giant achieved over 100 billion yuan in
total agricultural output, up 6.5 percent over 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, the experts pointed out that because of limited
resources, lower investment and a sluggish market, next year's
growth rate will be slower.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the grain sowing acreage in Hebei is expected to be
seven million hectares. With the improvement of water control
facilities, the total grain output is therefore expected to beat
this year's 28.9 million tons. They explained that vegetable
cultivation and animal husbandry will expand though at a slow
growth rate.
</P>
<P>
They also pointed out that the slow-down of agricultural growth
will not affect the growth of peasants' income, which is expected
to be up eight percent in 1999.

LONDON, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Gales gusting up to 100mph (160
kph) were battering the British Isles on Saturday, with one man
confirmed dead and two more feared lost.
</P>
<P>
Conditions had deteriorated during the day with Northern
Ireland and the Irish Republic the worst affected, according to
BBC report.
</P>
<P>
A 23-year-old man died in the Republic when a falling tree
crushed his car. His girlfriend who was with him escaped
uninjured.
</P>
<P>
A 27-year-old man enjoying a Boxing Day walk on the beach with
his girlfriend and son was feared dead on Saturday night after
being swept out to sea near the Palace pier at Brighton in East
Sussex by a 30ft wave.
</P>
<P>
All three were swept into the sea, but as the woman and child
scrambled to safety the man was dragged out.
</P>
<P>
He was spotted momentarily by coastguards using an infrared
camera on board a helicopter but the dangerous conditions made it
impossible to winch him to safety.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, thousands of homes were thrown into darkness when
trees and power lines in the Northern Ireland and the Republic
were brought down.
</P>
<P>
Power lines have been damaged or have come down in Wales,
Scotland, Northern Ireland and north-west England and repair work
is being hampered by poor driving conditions.
</P>
<P>
In the south-west of England, the Environment Agency issued 50
flood warnings after 70mph (112 kph) winds and heavy rainfall
lashed the area throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
The high winds are expected to have blown themselves out by
midnight, but there will be more rain on Sunday morning.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denies British Planes Draws Fire from Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Saturday denied an Iraqi report that two British planes drew Iraqi
anti-aircraft fire after attacking an Iraqi outpost.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has reportedly said its air defenses fired at U.S.-British
coalition planes striking a post in southern Iraq. It was the
first reported clash since a U.S.-British air campaign against
Iraq ended one week ago.
</P>
<P>
"There was no attack," said P.J. Crowley, spokesman for the U.S.
National Security Council. "We had planes up enforcing the no-fly
zone" over Iraq, which is part of normal operations, Crowley
added.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman U.S. Army Maj. Paul Phillips said in a
statement that at about 3:15 a.m. EST (8:15 GMT) "two British
Tornadoes patrolling the southern no-fly zone in Iraq were fired
upon by Iraqi forces using anti-aircraft artillery."
</P>
<P>
"The pilots reported seeing bursts approximately five miles to
their rear and they exited the no-fly zone," he said.
</P>
<P>
Phillips said no U.S. forces were involved in the incident, and
that the British air crews safely returned to their staging base.
</P>
<P>
"Iraqi claims that an aircraft was shot down are false,"
Phillips said. "The Southern watch forces continue to enforce
the no-fly zone in southern Iraq in accordance with United
Nations' resolutions and directives."

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Lavishes Praise on Primakov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
on Saturday praised Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov as "the most
efficient and most reliable premier" but stopped short of naming a
successor.
</P>
<P>
He said Primakov "enjoys the support of the president, the
support of the government, the support of the State Duma (lower
house of parliament), and the support of local regional
authorities."
</P>
<P>
However, Yeltsin, appearing on the Vremia program of the ORT
television, stopped short of naming a successor when his term
expires in 2000.
</P>
<P>
"I will not say it now," Yeltsin said. "I will have my say when
I leave."
</P>
<P>
Primakov, currently the most popular politician in Russia, has
repeatedly denied that he harbors any presidential ambitions.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin praised Primakov's "sharp intuition" to seek successful
compromises, an attribute honed by his former diplomatic career.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, when he and I...are having a discussion, I just
enjoy seeing him find such solutions."
</P>
<P>
"Practically all" political groups in the Duma supported
Primakov's nomination for prime minister in September, which is
evidence that "we are approaching a civilized way of dealing with
problems in a democratic society," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia experienced a very trying and difficult year in
1998 in the wake of a work financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"But what is most important is the fact that we have preserved
political stability," Yeltsin said.

<HEADLINE> Arab League, Senegal Discuss Afro-Arab Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Arab League chief Esmat
Abdel-Meguid Saturday held talks with Senegalese Trade Minister
Khalifa Ababakar Salla on boosting Afro-Arab economic ties.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Salla told reporters that the talks focused
on economic issues because economic underdevelopment lies behind
some political problems in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The discussions also dealt with the preparation for the fourth
Afro-Arab Exhibition due to be opened in Dakar on April 15-25, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Senegal hopes that the planned exhibition, which is
co-sponsored by the Arab League and the Organization of African
Unity, will be rendered successful, said the trade minister.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, hosted by Arab and African countries in turn,
has previously been staged in Tunisia, South Africa and the United
Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Salla briefed Abdel-Meguid on his on-going
tour of Arab countries which has taken him to Kuwait, Syria, Libya
and Saudi Arabia. Egypt is the last stop of his trip.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid underlined the importance of the Afro-Arab
exhibition for boosting cooperation and economic ties between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Egypt Slams Israel for Freezing Wye Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Saturday criticized
Israel's suspension of troop pullback from the West Bank as a
violation of the Wye River peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Israel's decision not to further withdraw troops from the West
Bank for the time being is "illegal," said Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa after Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak held
talks with visiting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that during the talks, Arafat briefed Mubarak on
the current situation regarding the implementation of the Wye
River accord, which Arafat said is frozen at present.
</P>
<P>
Israel has threatened to suspend the implementation of the
agreement, signed last October on further Israeli withdrawal from
the West Bank, if the Palestinians do not meet its demands,
including the cancellation of a plan to declare a Palestinian
state next May.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel's possible early elections will put off for
months the implementation of the accord, under which Israel has
carried out the first phase of troop pullback.
</P>
<P>
Moussa urged the United States, which brokered the agreement,
to press Israel to honor the deal, expressing the hope that the
U.S. would compel Israel to be committed to what it has signed.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the Mideast peace process would be severely
damaged if Israel fails to respect the accord.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. should insist that Israel fulfill its obligations
regardless of the possible early elections as the government led
by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is still in power, he added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, a frequent visitor to Egypt, arrived here earlier
Saturday to coordinate stance with Mubarak on the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Removing Breast Cancer With Lasers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Researchers from the
University of Arkansas said that their new technique may make it
possible to remove cancerous breast tumors with a laser instead of
surgery, said the Washington Post recently.
</P>
<P>
Currently doctors use surgical lumpectomy to remove a breast
tumor. The new technique developed by Steven Harms and his
colleagues at the University could be used in place of the
surgical lumpectomy.
</P>
<P>
Harms said that their new technique don't make an incision,
hence there is no scar and virtually no evidence of surgery.
</P>
<P>
The process involves the use of interactive magnetic resonance
imaging through which the doctor guides a needle into the tumor. A
fiber optic wire threaded through the needle is then used to
direct laser heat at the tumor for 10 minutes, destroying the
tumor.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Not to Weaken His "Powerful Supreme Authority" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 26 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin said
Saturday he is against proposals to cut his powers and reiterated
that he will serve out his term until 2000.
</P>
<P>
"There has always been powerful supreme authority in Russia and
all people have somehow learned to adjust to this," Yeltsin said
in an interview with the ORT television.
</P>
<P>
"If we now try to turn (Russia) into a parliamentary republic,
we'll simply lose Russia," Yeltsin said. "That mustn't be allowed
to happen."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who is staging more public appearances following his
recovery from a series of illnesses that prompted calls for early
presidential elections, said he see no reason for an early
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
"No, and once again no," said Yeltsin, whose doctors recently
lifted a ban on his overseas travel after his recovery from the
latest bout of pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
It is a mistake "that some are pressing for elections," he said
in reference to some politicians poised to run for the Kremlin
seat.
</P>
<P>
"It's a bit early," Yeltsin said. "First of all, an election
campaign has not yet been declared. Secondly, people will
immediately be taking a closer look at them. And they will be
looking for weak points rather than strong points."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has refrained from naming names in attacking the
presidential aspirants, but observers believe he is apparently
referring to Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov, who recently launched a
"Fatherland" party.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's former press secretary, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, who was
believed to fired for his leaning toward Luzhkov, is now working
for the mayor.
