<HEADLINE> Israel Marks First Anniversary of Rabin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Memorial observances were
held all around Israel Thursday to mark the Hebrew date of the
first anniversary of the death of the late Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin.
</P>
<P>
A state memorial service took place Thursday afternoon at the
late prime minister's grave site at Mount Herzl in Jerusalem,
which was broadcast live on both channels of Israel Television.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, throughout Israel, the entire school day was
devoted to Rabin's memory and discussions about freedom of
expression, tolerance and democracy,
</P>
<P>
Memorial ceremonies were also held at all schools, while the
Education Ministry opened a special Internet site for the
general public with information about Rabin.
</P>
<P>
Later in the evening, the Knesset (Israel's parliament) held
a special session devoted to the memory of Rabin, who was shot
and killed by a Jewish extremist on November 4 of last year.
</P>
<P>
Knesset Speaker Dan Tichon told the plenum that the killer of
Rabin had not only murdered a man, but had tried to destroy
Israel's democracy and all its values.
</P>
<P>
"How did we reach such a situation? Do we have a common
faith? " Tichon asked.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the political situation now in this country is
even worse than that prior to Rabin's assassination, calling for
an end to political violence.
</P>
<P>
President Ezer Weizman said that Israel's whole nation was
wounded by the murder of the late prime minister, and yet to
recover from what had happened.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Weizman said the society must use all its
legal means to fight against those who want to destroy the
democracy of this country.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli president also praised Rabin as "an outstanding
soldier and a peace maker of his time."
</P>
<P>
During his speech to the Knesset, Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu said that all Israelis had lost something with the
death of Rabin, who contributed so much to the state of Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We have political differences in this country," said
Netanyahu, "but political violence is forbidden."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli premier added that a small group of extremists
who still exist and continue threatening to attack on public
personnel in Israel, will be opposed by law.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu stressed that Rabin will be remembered as a great
fighter and leader of the Jewish people around the world.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leader Shimon Peres memorized the last moment of
Rabin's life, when they sang together "A Song for Peace," saying
it was the only song he ever heard Rabin sing in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
"It was a rare moment of happiness for the late prime
minister", Peres recalled, "Rabin was happy that there were tens
of thousands of people who knew the decision for peace was a
tough one, but a true one."
</P>
<P>
But peace is not just a matter of singing songs, said Peres,
the former prime minister, adding there is no peace for granted.
</P>
<P>
In the Gaza Strip, Palestinian National Authority President
Yasser Arafat told reporters that he very much missed his peace
partner Rabin, with whom he had signed the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
"Shalom Chavar, good-bye friend," the Palestinian leader said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, throughout the day, thousands of people visited
the Rabin Square in Tel Aviv, where the late premier spent his
final hours of his life to attend a massive peace rally.
</P>
<P>
Although the shock of the assassination has by now long been
subsided, the profound sense of tragic lose was still evident on
the faces of most young people who came to the square.
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by the calligraphy-lined walls in memory of Rabin,
Israeli youths sat quietly at the side and sang the song of peace
which became so connected to the death of Rabin. Some of them
were unable to hold their tears.
</P>
<P>
Like a year ago, people lighted memorial candles and laid
flowers at the spot where Rabin was shot, or just simply came to
remember the man who fought for peace with their hope of the
future.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Pledges No Poach of Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 25 (Xinhua) -- South Africa had placed
a moratorium on registering doctors from other African countries#,
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the World Medical Association's Conference in
Johannesburg, Mbeki said about 700 doctors with foreign
qualifications, many of them working in neighbouring countries,
sought registration in South Africa within the first six months
after the 1994 general election.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said it was not appropriate for South Africa to deprive
its neighbours in the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) of their doctors because they were a valuable resource in
any country.
</P>
<P>
However, Mbeki disclosed that for many years and various
reasons, South African doctors had been leaving the country to
work in other countries, and this situation was getting even
worse by aggressive recruiting campaigns by organizations in
relatively wealthy countries.
</P>
<P>
He challenged the World Medical Association to develop an
international declaration on the issue of medical migration.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, South Africa recruited hundreds of Cuban
doctors to meet the shortage of doctors.

VIENTIANE, October 25 (Xinhua) -- President of the Lao Front of

Chinese official here today that his party would work to
strengthen cooperation between Laos and China.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman of the National

Noting that China and Laos are close neighbors and have similar

<HEADLINE> French Bank Employees Protest Against Privatization Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of employees of the
state-owned banking group of Credit Industriel et Commercial (CIC)
demonstrated in Paris today, protesting against the government's
privatization plan for the banking group.
</P>
<P>
Protesters, holding banners which read: "CIC group, let us
live," and thousands of balloons with similar slogans, gathered at
the Place de Opera at noon. They were joined by the employees of
the group from around the country, before marching towards the
office building of Prime Minister Alain Juppe.
</P>
<P>
The union called the demonstration a "historic mobilization"
and said that the protest will continue in the following weeks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of the employees of the money-losing bank
Credit Lyonnais also demonstrated in Paris to protest a plan by
the board of directors of the bank to lay off 5,000 employees in
the next few years.
</P>
<P>
The CIC, which belongs to the public insurance group of
Groupement des Assurances Generales (GAN), is specialized in
providing banking service to local and decentralized economies
across the country.
</P>
<P>
The privatization process, launched by Juppe for reducing
public deficit and raising economic competitiveness, has triggered
a political storm in France, especially over his plan to sell the
Thomson SA electronics group to the Matra Defense Espace and the
South Korean Daewoo Electronics group.
</P>
<P>
The deputies of the Socialist Party in the National Assembly
have "solemnly" asked the government to stop the privatization of
Thomson SA, accusing the government of resorting to a policy of
"opacity" when making deals with private enterprises in its
selling of state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The president of the socialist group in the National Assembly,
Laurent Fabius, has called for a parliamentary inquiry into the
deals the government had made in selling out Thomson SA.
</P>
<P>
The socialists, assisted by the French Communist Party, have
accused the government of "savagely privatizing the industrial
groups which are indispensable tissues of the French economy and
its influence in the world."
</P>
<P>
The minister-delegate in charge of budget, Alain Lamassoure,
said today that the government will continue the privatization
process.

CAIRO, October 24 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
is holding talks with his Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak
immediately after he set foot here for an lightning official visit
at the end of his six-leg Middle East tour this evening.
</P>
<P>
The Chirac-Mubarak talks, taking place in the closed-door
presidential lounge at the Cairo International Airport, are
expected to focus on the two countries' drive to save the
faltering peace process.
</P>
<P>
The on-and-off Palestinian-Israeli peace talks failed to make
tangible progress late last night due to the Israeli demands for
greater security for the 450 Jewish settlers living among some
100,000 Palestinians in the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who is on his seven-day official visit to the Middle
East region to salvage the stalled peace process, is trying to
carve out an effective French and European role in the
peace-making.
</P>
<P>
The trip has taken him to Syria, Israel, the Palestinian
self-rule areas, Jordan and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to leave for home later today after attending a
press conference with his Egyptian counterpart.

<HEADLINE> Chirac: Middle East Peace Process Advancing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 25 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
stressed here this afternoon that the peace process in the
Middle East "is advancing with all the difficulties surrounding
it."
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Bristol Hotel in Ras Beirut, Chirac
emphasized the necessity to continue the peace process in the
region, and reiterated his country's support for this process.
</P>
<P>
He noted that France would continue offering support for all
proposals which will push the peace process forward, adding that
during his current Mideast tour, he has been trying to
take part in a "new dynamism" for a re-launching of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Chirac pointed out that all the parties to this process,
including France and the European Union, should try together to
advance the stalled peace march.
</P>
<P>
The French president refused a subordinate European role in the
peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He added that he came to the region as a "man of peace," and
he would continue to play this role.
</P>
<P>
The press conference was held following a 75-minute meeting
between the French president and Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri in the latter's Beirut residence, and a luncheon the
Lebanese billionaire premier hosted in Chirac's honor.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in the Lebanese capital Thursday evening,
Chirac held a meeting with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, and a
meeting this morning with Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that Lebanon is a "land having future and history,"
and all the Lebanese should have full confidence in the state
and invest in it.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about the links between France and the
Lebanese Christians, Chirac said that there would not be Lebanon

to participate in the country's reconstruction process.
</P>
<P>
"My message to the (Lebanese) Christians is to be confident
in their country, and to stay in it and that the migrants return
to their homeland to invest in it," the French president said.
</P>
<P>
After the press conference, Chirac, accompanied by Hariri and
other Lebanese senior officials, visited the Monument of Peace
in front of the Lebanese Defense Ministry on a hill overlooking
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The French president left the Lebanese capital at 4:00
p.m. (14:00 GMT) for Cairo, the last leg of his Middle East tour,
which has already taken him to Syria, Israel, the Palestinian
self-rule areas and Jordan.

<P>
VIENTIANE, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Lao Front for National
Reconstruction (LFNR) will further increase exchanges and
cooperation with the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), said LFNR Chairman Oudom Khatthiya here today.
</P>
<P>
The Lao-Chinese friendship boasts a long history and Laos
treasures China's assistance to the nation in reform, said Oudom,
when meeting with visiting CPPCC Vice-Chairman Wang Zhaoguo.
</P>
<P>
Wang arrived here today for a four-day goodwill visit as head
of a CPPCC delegation.
</P>
<P>
The LFNR chairman said Wang's visit would promote the
friendship and relations between Laos and China.
</P>
<P>
Wang said China highly valued the development of friendship
between China and Laos, as they were close neighbors sharing
similarities in many fields. They could also learn from each other
in the process of their economic reform, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Enhancing the harmonious Chinese-Lao relationship would benefit
not only the economic development of the two nations, but also the
peace and development in the Asian-Pacific region and the world,

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government's new macro-economic plan forms the foundation to
accelerate the Reconstruction and Development Program (RDP)
delivery, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel said here today.
</P>
<P>
Manuel told about 80 international business people at a trade
conference that there was no conflict between the RDP and the
Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR) strategy.
</P>
<P>
The RDP was issued two years ago when the first social and
economic development plan was launched by the government of new
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Manuel said the RDP was alive and well and in the long run
its successful implementation was the pre-condition for sustained
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Recent press reports said the GEAR is somehow in conflict with
the RDP. Some reports even claimed that the RDP is dead, which
were refuted by the finance minister who said the GEAR emphasised
growth and employment creation, together with training, and
improved productivity and wages.
</P>
<P>
He said the plan also emphasized budgetary restructuring to
ensure efficient and equitable public spending, adding that the
implementation of the strategy was firmly on track.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the target to reduce the country's budget
deficit to four percent next year "is not in question."
</P>
<P>
And the government would protect expenditure for education,
health, welfare, housing and infrastructure to ensure the
improvement of service delivery to the poor and the
disadvantaged, he added.
</P>
<P>
Manuel was also optimistic on the future of the South African
economy, noting the country was still on track for three percent
GDP growth this year, and above 2.5 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
The GEAR was issued by the government three months ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto said today that she would not resign under
pressure.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a large public gathering in the capital's twin city
of Rawalpindi, the prime minister said, "if anyone thinks that by
resort to pressure tactics, one could bow Benazir down, he is
sadly mistaken."
</P>
<P>
"I shall not do so, in the best interest of the country," she
asserted.
</P>
<P>
Certain leaders, she said, are talking of dissolution of the
elected institutions. "I call upon them not to play with the
destiny of the motherland," Benazir said.
</P>
<P>
"Don't play with the federation," she warned.
</P>
<P>
Benazir nowadays is facing growing pressure from the
opposition, who demanded her resignation and elections under a
neutral caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
The opposition accused the government of corruption and failure
in economic policies.
</P>
<P>
However, she said "only masses could elect governments and only
they could change the government through ballot."
</P>
<P>
It is a happy omen, she stated, that the armed forces are
professional and neutral.
</P>
<P>
In Pakistan, it is believed that the army and the president
play a vital role in deciding the fate of a government.

ANKARA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Acting President

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- China says it hopes that
the United Nations and the governments of its member states will
be able to listen to more voices of parliamentarians to reflect
the wishes of all peoples in a more comprehensive manner.
</P>
<P>
China' Deputy Permanent Representative to the U.N. Wang Xuexian
made the statement here this morning while addressing a U.N.
General Assembly meeting on the cooperation between the United
Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU).
</P>
<P>
The IPU held its 96th session in Beijing in September, the
first ever held in China. During the meeting, parliamentarians
talked on issues concerning the international political situation,
economic development in the world as well as social progress, and
adopted relevant resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that it was generally agreed at the Beijing session
that peace and development remain the two major issues in today's
world. Countries, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, are
equal members of the international community and entitled to
participate in international affairs on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
He said it was also agreed that respect for human rights should
first of all ensure the right to subsistence and development.
</P>
<P>
Many representatives also condemned hegemonism and power
politics at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The IPU is committed to strengthening cooperation with the
United Nations while playing a positive role in safeguarding world
peace and promoting inter-parliamentary cooperation, according to
the Chinese ambassador.
</P>
<P>
He said the IPU is expected to "bring into better play of its
influence and role to translate more requests and desires into
practice."
</P>
<P>
As the largest developing country in the world, a permanent
member of the U.N. Security Council and an active participant in
the IPU activities, China is ready to contribute its share to
this end, Wang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chiefs Association of
Zambia (CAZ) and the Democratic Governance Association of Zambia
(DGAZ) today made an appeal to President Frederick Chiluba to
urgently convene a meeting with opposition parties and iron out
contentious clauses in the constitution and the electoral
process.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia News Agency quoted a statement issued by CAZ and
DGAZ President David Mukumbuta in Lusaka today as saying that the
country did not need chaos that could be caused by bad laws but
needed peace and development. He added that this could only be
achieved through dialogue with all stakeholders.
</P>
<P>
Mukumbuta noted that it was the duty of the government to
ensure that there was peace in the nation by having a dialogue
with all the stakeholders in the country to ensure good
democratic governance.
</P>
<P>
He called on President Chiluba to urgently meet the
opposition, non-governmental organizations and the churches for a
concrete dialogue on the amended controversial clauses in the
1996 constitution and electoral process.
</P>
<P>
Lack of consensus on the 1996 constitution contentious clauses
and the electoral process contributed to the decision of Kenneth
Kaunda, former president of the country and current leader of the
opposition United National Independence Party, to pull out from
participating in this year's local government, parliamentary and
presidential elections scheduled for November 18, Mukumbuta said.

<HEADLINE> Hunger Must Be Addressed in Multi-Dimensions: UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The problem of hunger
and food insecurity is not simply about finding ways of increasing
agricultural production, but needs to be addressed as a
multi-dimensional issue, the president of the U.N. General
Assembly said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting observing World Food Day at the U.N.
headquarters, Razali Ismail, president of the U.N. General
Assembly, said that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
pronounced freedom from hunger as one of the "inalienable and
inviolable rights of all members of the human family."
</P>
<P>
However, a staggering 800 million people are chronically
undernourished though the world now produces enough food for all
its inhabitants, he said.
</P>
<P>
On dealing with the issue, he said that the huge dimensions of
hunger and food insecurity are closely linked to poverty and land
tenure issues, to unsustainable production and consumption
patterns, to property rights regimes that erode the diversity of
genetic resources, to the impact of technology on small producers,
the role of women in agrarian communities, and the multiple guises
of power politics which commodify food as political and economic
weapons in the globalized market place.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations must always be on the side of equity and
social justice, and protect the interests of the marginalized and
the poor. To do so in the case of food security and in the pursuit
of eliminating hunger would mean finding the political ways and
economic means to protect the interests, rights and traditional
skills of farmers and those that `cannot sleep because of
hunger,'" he said.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Diouf, director-general of the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization, said at today's conference that the
potential of the Green Revolution technology has not been fully
realized -- far from it.
</P>
<P>
"There is still a vast difference between what small farmers
can harvest and what researchers can obtain at their experimental
stations, where output is on average three times higher. A similar
difference exists within countries between the yields obtained by
farmers with access to modern technology and those obtained by
poor farmers," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed heavy investment in agriculture, such as water
management, road links, storage facilities and other
infrastructure that is essential for production and market supply
as well as for the well-being of the rural population.
</P>
<P>
Another challenge is to secure access for all to an adequate,
healthy and balanced diet, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it is necessary to promote an equitable system of
international trade in food and agriculture that will at the same
time protect the consumer, he added.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Provide Financial Aid to Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The German government said
today it will release more than 13 million U.S. Dollars to
finance the second phase of Zimbabwe's market reforms once
agreement is reached with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
German Ambassador to Zimbabwe Norwin Graf Leutrum said the
funds were part of a two-year aid package worth 52.5 million U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We will follow closely discussions between Zimbabwe and the
IMF. Once agreement is reached, we will be prepared to release
the money to finance the reforms," he said.
</P>
<P>
An IMF/World Bank mission is expected to arrive in Zimbabwe
next week for crucial talks aimed at outlining the country's
second phase of the economic reform program which is expected to
be launched early in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Leutrum said the German support for the reform would be mainly
balance-of-payment support, and would be in addition to about
38.6 million U.S. Dollar financial and technical aid to be
disbursed over a two-year period.

<HEADLINE> WHO Rings Alarm Over False Medicine Ravaging World Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) and some French humanitarian groups have rung the alarm over
the spread of huge quantities of false medicines in the world
markets each year, especially in the markets of developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
The local daily Le Monde today quoted WTO officials and
humanitarian groups as saying that in Africa, 60 percent of the
medicines and nutritional drinks being sold could be false
medicines bearing the trade-marks of European and North American
producers.
</P>
<P>
In Nigeria, 109 children died in 1990 after drinking syrup
which was actually motor anti-freeze. In Bangladesh, nearly 250
children died in 1993 for similar reasons, Le Monde quoted WHO
officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The French humanitarian group Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF)
said that its staff discovered in 1995 that false vaccines against
the meningitis were circulating in Niger, West Africa.
</P>
<P>
The WHO also said that 7 percent of the medicines sold each
year in the world medical market are counterfeits, and 30 percent
of medicines sold in Brazil each year are false products.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. organization attributed the phenomenon to corruption
of officials, who have a share in the illegal business, and lack
of a sound structure of health service to resist counterfeiters in
many countries.
</P>
<P>
"In nearly all countries, the under-dosed, degraded and
falsified pharmaceutical and medical-nutritional products
proliferate. The local supply of medicines is so much filled with
counterfeits (in some countries) that the MSF cannot manage to use
local medical supply without risk," said the MSF.
</P>
<P>
The WHO estimates that the annual sales figures of the black
medicine products market is about 80 billion francs (16 billion
U.S. dollars) around the world.
</P>
<P>
The World Federation of Medical Industry and the WHO are
planning to carry out a relaying campaign of awareness from
country to country to mobilize all countries against medical
counterfeiting.

HARARE, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe today commissioned eight cadet pilots to the air force,
according to a report from the News Agency of Zimbabwe today.
</P>
<P>
Among the cadets was 23-year-old Chipo Matimba, Zimbabwe's
first woman pilot in the air force, said the report, adding that
the commissioning ceremony was held at Thornkill Air Base in
central Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said Matimba's achievements should serve as source of
inspiration to other young women who might want to share with her
the pride of defending the sovereignty of this country.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to extend my personal congratulations to the
first woman pilot in our air force. I congratulate her on her
courage and determination to break into this male dominated
profession," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
He said Matimba herself encouraged other women to come and "help
serve our country by defending it."
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing better than defending my country and what
better way to do it than flying, which has always been my
dream," said Matimba.
</P>
<P>
The president promised that funds would soon be available to
replace some of out-dated equipment which hampered the operations
of the air force.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committe's evaluation commission, which arrived here Thursday,
started its three-day evaluation work today in Athens.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference this afternoon, the president of the
evaluation commission, Thomas Bach, outlined the procedure for the
evaluation of candidate cities but gave no hint of the
commission's first impressions of Athens.
</P>
<P>
"We are honored to be in the country which gave birth to the
Olympic games," Bach said. "The Olympic spirit is present more
than ever before and the Olympic spirit is one of the criteria for
a candidate city."
</P>
<P>
He said that the commission needed three full days to evaluate
the bid and draw conclusions. At the final press conference
Sunday, he added, "we will talk about our first impressions but
not about our conclusions."
</P>
<P>
"We will give a fair and objective report. We ask 600 questions
to each city and evaluate 19 criteria, including the Olympic
village, transport, protection of the environment and security.
Our visit has two aspects: the first half involves the discussions
with the candidate committee and the second is the visits to
installations", he said.
</P>
<P>
Greece is determined to win the bid for the 2004 Olympic games
and the leaders of the country, including Prime Minister Costas
Simitis and President Kostis Stephanopoulos, said the country is
ready for the games.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting today with the evaluation committee,
Stephanopoulos said, "The entire Greek people support Athens's
candidacy to host the Olympics."
</P>
<P>
Stressing Athens' great anticipation for the committee's
decision, the president said, "In the case Athens does not win the
Olympics, it should never be a candidate city again."

<HEADLINE> Kohl's Envoy Mediating Swap of Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Berand Schmidbauer, German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's top intelligence adviser who brokered in
July a swap of prisoners between Lebanon and Israel, is currently
in Beirut for mediating a second deal between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Schmidbauer, minister of state for security affairs in
Germany, held meetings in Beirut today with Lebanese Deputy Prime
Minister and Interior Minister Michel Al-Murr and Sheikh Hassan
Nasrallah, secretary general of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or
Party of God.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with the German envoy, Al-Murr said that
Schmidbauer's two-day visit to Lebanon was aimed at continuing
contacts with the parties concerned for the release of Lebanese
prisoners in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
"Today the German minister is following up his contacts in a
purpose to seek the release of other prisoners," the Lebanese
official said.
</P>
<P>
He announced that Schmidbauer brought with him letters from
some prisoners in the Israeli jails to their families in Lebanon,
and that the German envoy would conduct contacts in Lebanon
"through complete coordination with the Lebanese authority."
</P>
<P>
Al-Murr hoped that the new humanitarian mission would lead to
"positive results."
</P>
<P>
He denied that the Lebanese government knows the whereabout of
Ron Arad, an Israeli air force navigator who went missing in
southern Lebanon in 1986, noting that "if we had the information
we would have taken steps which we must take."
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah announced that its secretary general Nasrallah
met with Schmidbauer in his office on the southern suburbs of
Beirut today.
</P>
<P>
It said that the talks dealt mainly with the efforts to find a
final solution for all the Lebanese prisoners and detainees in
Israeli prisons.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed official sources here said that the German
mediator arrived in Beirut Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah, which spearheads a guerrrilla warfare against
the Israeli occupation in southern Lebanon, asserted that there
were still more than 200 Lebanese jailed by the Jewish state in
the hilltop prison of Khiam in southern Lebanon and prisons
inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
Most prisoners jailed by the Jewish state were Shiite Moslem
militants, including two top Hezbollah officials, Sheikh Abdu
Ai-Karim Obeid and Mostafa Dirani.
</P>
<P>
Under the German-mediated deal in July, The Hezbollah handed
over to Israel remains of two Israeli soldiers in exchange for
the bodies of 123 Moslem guerrilas and 45 prisoners from
Khiam.

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Says He'd Step Down if Democrats Take House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Newt Gingrich, speaker of
the U.S. House of Representatives, has said that he would resign
his leadership position if Democrats took control of Congress in
the November 5 elections.
</P>
<P>
"I would not run for minority leader," The Associated Press
today quoted Gingrich as saying Thursday at a fund-raiser for
Republican congressional candidate Danny Covington, in Jackson,
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
"Look, if the liberals are in charge, it is going to be so
bad," he said. "You need somebody with a tremendous amount of
energy just to focus on stopping them, and it's going to be a very
narrow job, and it's not something I'd feel very good about
doing."
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said he relished his role as a supervisor rather than
a challenger.
</P>
<P>
"You'd need somebody who is willing to go out there every day
and just take them head-on, and that's a very focused, opposition
leader job, and I don't think that's frankly my strength," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said he had been noticeably absent from campaign
appearances with Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole because
he is "keeping the House," campaigning for Republican candidates
so as to maintain Republican majority in Congress.

<HEADLINE> Grave Robbery Shocks Whole Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkish leaders, politicians
and businessmen unanimously condemned today the theft of the
remains of late Vehbi Koc, Turkey's No. 1 business magnate.
</P>
<P>
Unknown robbers Thursday dug the grave of the late
industrialist who died in February at the age of 95, and
disappeared with his remains.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu
Ciller condemned the robbery, saying that it was difficult to
fathom the reasons for the act which opposes the beliefs and
traditions of Turks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Suleyman Demirel, now in Moscow for a
Black Sea economic summit, voiced similar shock over the incident.
</P>
<P>
Opposition party leaders also voiced their condemnation and
protest.
</P>
<P>
Sakip Sabanci, Koc's main business rival, said that he was
aggrieved as he was when terrorists murdered his brother in
January. "This, too, is something unacceptable, something
incomprehensible," said Sabanci.
</P>
<P>
The shocking event was revealed by a citizen who was visiting
Koc's tomb. He was surprised to find out that the tomb was open.
</P>
<P>
A person calling the police said they had stolen the corpse in
order to ask for a ransom of over 5 million U.S. dollars from the
Koc family.

<HEADLINE> African Nations Urged to Put More Efforts on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 25 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa
today urged African countries to put more efforts on educating
women as this is the most critical component in helping African
women.
</P>
<P>
The President made the call while opening a session of the
second regional conference of African women ministers and
parliamentarians at the Karimjee Hall in the city today.
</P>
<P>
He said although poverty is a great setback in the fight for
women emancipation, education of women is the basis and beginning
of development and poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
"Education increases people's choices in their struggle to
improve the quality of their lives. It opens an entirely new
world of opportunities for women. All people should therefore
have equal access to education," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa stressed that any strategies set to help women
cannot be fruitful unless women have the necessary education and
knowledge to make good use of them.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said education will also improve their status and
increase access to information on fertility and help them reduce
family sizes which affect equal accessibility to education.
</P>
<P>
The President urged african nations to improve women's access
to both formal an informal education, vocational training as well
as science and technology.
</P>
<P>
He said women parliamentarians and ministers have a special
responsibility in making sure that discriminatory laws as well as
cultural practices against women are abandoned.
</P>
<P>
The president assured the participants that Tanzania is
determined to ensure that more and more women get into parliament
and the goal is to meet the U.N. target of 30 percent by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the conference is to make African women in top
positions more capable of networking and lobbying through their
positions for the betterment of women in society through national
decisions by their governments.
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference, whose theme is "Facing the Challenges
of Resources Mobilization", is aimed at reviewing the Cairo and
Beijing conferences in order to better implement strategies of
the national and regional platforms for action.
</P>
<P>
The first African women's conference was held in Ouagadougou,
Burkina Faso, in July last year.

<HEADLINE> UNDP on Nigeria's Lack of Data for Planning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) today expressed concern over the non-use of
correct statistical data in planning development programs in
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Lawal Tsauri, UNDP program monitoring adviser in
Katsina State, north Nigeria, said that over the years, most
development planning in the country has been done without
"correct statistical indices".
</P>
<P>
The planning process is largely based on "intuition and
guesswork", which has resulted in the waste of human and material
resources, he said at a workshop on national statistical
information system in the state.
</P>
<P>
And the waste is evident in the number of uncompleted and
abandoned project around the country, as well as over-expenditure
and disrespect for budget control mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, with its abundant human and material resources, is
ranked among the 10 poorest nations of the world because of the
country's inability to harness the available resources through
coordinated planning with useful statistical data, according to
UNDP.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Further Tighten Monetary Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The South African Reserve
Bank (SARB) is prepared to raise interest rates should the credit
extended to the private sector and money supply continue to grow,
SARB Governor Chris Stals said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing about 80 international traders at an investment
conference in Johannesburg, Stals said South African monetary
authorities has up to now been tolerant of the relatively high
rates of increase in credit and money supply.
</P>
<P>
Stals said SARB, central bank of the country, is eagerly
awaiting confirmation that the rates of increase in bank credit
and in money supply are indeed slowing down.
</P>
<P>
According to figures given by Stals in his speech, the rate of
increase in money supply accelerated from seven percent in 1993
to 15 percent last year, and remained at that level throughout
1996. While bank credit extended to the private sector had
likewise shot up from 9.7 percent in 1993 to 17.6 percent in 1995
and the first three quarters of this year.
</P>
<P>
The bank rate currently stands at 16 percent, with prime
lending rate at a high 19.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Stals was also concerned by the continued high
money market shortage of the banking sector, saying the shortage
jumped from 6.1 billion Rand (about 1.33 billion US Dollars) in
late February this year to 10.9 billion Rand (about 2.38 billion
Dollars) at the end of April, and has remained at around 1.65
billion Dollars since then.
</P>
<P>
However, Stals stressed that the SARB is independent and
therefore under no pressure from the government to artificially
reduce interest rates, adding he would continue to advise the
government to stick to its policy of gradually relaxing exchange
controls.
</P>
<P>
From mid-February, South Africa's local currency Rand has been
depreciated by more than 20 percent, dropping steadily from 3.65
Rands against one US Dollar in the financial market.

WASHINGTON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Friday tried to whip up support for Democrats' hopes of
recapturing Congress and his own front-runner's campaign for a
second-term in Atlanta, Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Clinton appeared with retiring Senator Sam and the
Democrats' nominee to succeed him, Max Cleland. Coretta Scott
King, widow of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King,
joined Clinton on stage.
</P>
<P>
It also was youth day on the campaign, a national
turn-out-the-vote drive aimed at people 25 to 35 years old. "This
is your election and we need you," news reports quoted Clinton as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would ask Congress to assign 100,000 college
work-study students as reading tutors for elementary students --
part of his plan to ensure that every 8-year-old can read.
</P>
<P>
Clinton narrowly carried Georgia in 1992. But this time his
campaign claimed he is ahead in the polls. Clinton and Republican
challenger Bob Dole both are spending heavily on ads in the state.
From Atlanta, Clinton headed for Macon.
</P>
<P>
Also campaigning in the South, Dole stepped up his attacks on
Clinton's character Friday. "Where is the outrage in America?
Where is the outrage in America? Where has the media gone in
America?" Dole raised the questions at a rally in Houston.
</P>
<P>
Reform Party nominee Ross Perot, who turned down Dole's
entreaty to quit the presidential race, has harsh words for
Clinton, alleging Clinton faced "huge moral, ethical and criminal
problems."
</P>
<P>
Rather than responding, Clinton has for weeks stressed economic
and family-values themes.
</P>
<P>
"I have run a campaign of ideas, not insults, to give you the
ideas of what I will do in the next four years if my contract is
renewed in less than two weeks from today," Clinton told an
airport rally Thursday outside a Northrup Grumman hangar at Lake
Charles.

<P>
Hospitals in the Great Toronto region canceled non-essential
surgery, and many day-care centers were closed.
</P>
<P>
However, no problems were reported at Pearson International
airport. And the city's highways were little interrupted, but with
lighter traffic than usual.
</P>
<P>
Protest organizers -- unions and social groups -- said the
protests was intended to give residents a first-hand feel for the
service cuts that will be commonplace as the ruling Conservative
provincial government cut about 7 billion U.S. dollars from its
budget.
</P>
<P>
The government has already announced a 22-percent cut in
welfare for most recipients, and is closing hospitals, eliminating
thousands of civil service jobs.
</P>
<P>
The one-day work stoppage was timed to coincide with a
provincial Conservative convention being held throughout the
weekend.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Says US Role Indispensable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said here today Europe could play a positive role in the Middle
East politics but the U.S. major part is "indispensable."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak made the statement at a joint press conference at the
airport with French President Jacques Chirac, who left here for
home at the end of his six-leg Middle East tour this evening.
</P>
<P>
"Europe has a special role to play in the Middle East peace
process in light of its geological affinity and historical links
with the region", said the Egyptian president, fresh from his
two-hour tete-a-tete talks with his French counterpart arranged in
the VIP lounge at the Cairo International Airport.
</P>
<P>
However, that cannot replace the U.S. leading role in mediating
peace in the region, even when the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli
talks face serious difficulties, Mubarak added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has played a major part in brokering peace agreements
involving Israel, the Palestinians and Jordan in the past few
years
</P>
<P>
The on-and-off Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have failed so
far to make tangible progress over the long-delayed Israeli troops
redeployment from Hebron, the last West Bank town still under
Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak joined Chirac in urging Israel to honor the 1995
Palestinian-Israeli peace accords on the Israeli troops withdrawal
from Hebron.
</P>
<P>
"Peace means stability and development," he said. But "the
failure of Israel to implement the signed agreements would be
catastrophic," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak pledged Egypt's utmost efforts in order to reach a just
and comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on the peace prospects in the region, Chirac showed
his cautious optimism. "In the first place I am an optimist, and
then as far as I know, peace has not run into a blind alley."
</P>
<P>
However, he said he is following the latest development in the
region with deep concern.
</P>
<P>
Describing the French president as a dear friend of Egypt,
Mubarak said their personal friendship dated back to 1975 when
they used to meet each other a lot in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, in his turn, said that he never felt like in a foreign
country in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The French leader flew in from Beirut this afternoon. His
seven-day official visit to the Middle East region was designed to
carve out an effective French and European role in the
peace-making.
</P>
<P>
The trip has already taken him to Syria, Israel, the
Palestinian self-rule areas, Israel, Jordan and Lebanon.

WUHAN, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Daye Special Steel Company from
central China's Hubei Province, with history of 106 years, has
been granted an international ISO9002 certificate.
</P>
<P>
It means that the company's products have reached a quality

cases, an ISO9002 certificate is vital to enter markets.
</P>
<P>
It has taken the company four years to standardize its routine
operations, in order to meet the requirements of the standard.

<HEADLINE> Positive Developments in Bosnia Hailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Peace Implementation
Council today described the successful meeting of the Bosnian
presidency and the signing of a Muslim-Croat agreement as
"positive developments at the level of leadership".
</P>
<P>
The remark was made by Colum Murphy, spokesman for Peace
Implementation Council representative, Carl Bildt. He was
commenting on Friday's meeting in Lukavica attended by the three
members of the Bosnian presidency, and on the agreement signed
between Muslim and Croat officials on improving their federation.
</P>
<P>
The federation agreement, which deals with the controlling
structure in Sarajevo and joint police in Mostar, was an important
step forward and opened the way for other federation joint
institutions, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the meeting had "moved beyond the merely
ceremonial and had got down to the real business of rebuilding the
country's political institutions".
</P>
<P>
"Above all, this meeting shows that common institutions can
work only if their leaders hear the demands of their people for
jobs, better housing and better living standards," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Murphy expressed regret over explosions detonated in
abandoned houses, and harassment of refugees in Prijedor, Sanski
Most and Mostar.
</P>
<P>
"That reminds us that for two entities to live side-by-side,
there has to be a knitting-together of the country not only from
the top down, but from the bottom up," He said.

<HEADLINE> Report: U.S., NATO to Keep Force in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States and NATO
officials are planning to keep a force of 15,000 to 30,000 troops
in Bosnia at least through 1997, The New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The new force would have essentially the same mission as the
nearly 60,000 troops, including 15,000 Americans, who have
patrolled Bosnia for nearly a year as part of the peace accords
achieved last fall to end the four-year conflicts, the newspaper
quoted U.S. and European officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials intend to keep at least 5,000 American troops in
the new force, but are reluctant to make a formal decision until
after the U.S. presidential election earlier next month, it said.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Europe told the paper that in recent meetings, the
countries that now have troops in Bosnia unanimously agreed that a
sizable ground force would continue to be necessary to insure
Bosnia's tenuous stability and prevent a resumption of fighting
between the Muslims and Serbs.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton pledged that U.S. troops would be
home by the end of the year. But Britain and France insist that
they will not field troops if the Americans do not.
</P>
<P>
However, NATO officials said they have received the U.S.
commitment signals last week from U.S. officials including Defense
Secretary William J. Perry.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon announced Friday that 500 reservists will go to
Bosnia to replace similar units aiding American forces acting as
NATO peacekeepers.

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriots Stages Weekend Protest to Stop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- About 50 Greek Cypriots
staged today a peaceful sit-in protest at the Ledra Palace
checkpoint, near the U.N.-controlled buffer zone, for the second
consecutive weekend to stop tourists who try to cross into the
northern areas under the Turkish control on this eastern
Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
The event is initiated by Democratic Party MP Marios Matsakis
and attended by the president of the Cyprus Motorcycle
Federation and relatives of Greek Cypriots recently killed along
the cease-fire line.
</P>
<P>
The organizers have put up two huge photographs nearby that
show the recent killings of unarmed Greek Cypriots by Turkish
troops. They also distributed leaflets to tourists about the
situation on the island as a result of Turkish occupation.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that tourists have turned back after
protesters' persuasion.
</P>
<P>
The Ledra Palace checkpoint in Nicosia is the only place
through which anyone, but the Greek Cypriots, can cross into the
northern part of the island since the Turkish intervention in
1974.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government and the U.N. have expressed objections
to the move which stops tourists crossing the checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said Thursday that
the government is not encouraging the initiative by Matsakis.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to criticize because they have every right to
do so but, having weighed up the pros and cons, our opinion is
that this shouldn't happen," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretary-General's resident representative in
Cyprus, Gustave Feissel, said today that the peaceful protest by
Greek Cypriots at the Ledra Palace checkpoint "is not conducive
to an atmosphere of trust and friendship" and hinted that such
protests should be avoided not to "exacerbate the situation."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has threatened
retaliatory measures including closing the "border" from the
north and turning his back on the current Cyprus peace
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops to
take control of the northern third of the island following a
short-lived coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Discord Over Textile Trade Delays Report for WTO Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Bickerings over textile trade
among members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) has delayed
their compiling of a report for the first WTO ministerial meeting,
Japanese trade officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, to be convened December in Singapore, is ready to
adopt a report detailing specific actions to be taken in coming
years toward freer global trade.
</P>
<P>
The officials with the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry (MITI) said a conflict has been simmering between
industrialized countries, which want to keep their privilege of
curbing developing countries' low-priced textile imports, and
developing countries, which demand the privilege be removed.
</P>
<P>
Currently, developed countries have the right to resort to
emergency "safeguard" measures on imports of textiles from
developing countries whenever such imports could hurt their
domestic textile industries.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, developing countries have also been opposed to
an investment proposal put forward by Japan and Canada for the WTO
report, in an indicator of their dissatisfaction over the textile
row.
</P>
<P>
The tentative deadline for compiling the report has been set at
November 7.

<HEADLINE> China's Reform and Opening up Policy Remains Unchanged: Wu Yi (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Wu Yi, minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation, told a delegation today from the
Professional Women and Entrepreneurs Association of Hong Kong,
that they can be assured that China's reform and opening to the
outside policy will remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Wu said Hong Kong is an international
financial, trade and shipping center. This special position has
been formed over the past dozens of years, and can be neither
changed by anybody, nor replaced by any city.
</P>
<P>
Wu said as the day for the return of Hong Kong to the
motherland approaches, the relationship between China's inland
areas and Hong Kong is becoming closer.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong serves as a "bridge" for the inland areas to enter the
world, while China's reform and opening up provides a guarantee
for Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, she said.
</P>
<P>
The key to continuing to implement a policy depends on whether
the people will support it or not.
</P>
<P>
Those who change rashly the policy that the people support will
be definitely abandoned by history, she said.
</P>
<P>
On China joining the World Trade Organization, Wu said that it
was reported that the United States hopes for a settlement of the
issue before Hong Kong's return.
</P>
<P>
As an old Chinese saying goes, it is imperative to listen to
what a person says, and watch what he does, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
She said China takes an active attitude toward this issue,
because China's economy is inter-mixed with the world economy. It
will be a great blemish to exclude China, a major trading country
in the world, from the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"We clearly know that to join the WTO, China should hand an
"entrance free", but this should conform to China's actual
situation, and accorded with its economic development level," Wu
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
invited leading US businesses to make massive investment in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The invitation was made by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Friday
when she met with more than 100 leading executives of
multinational companies in the US. Hasina is currently in the
United States for a visit.
</P>
<P>
"The most unexplored opportunities are the best place for
investment and Bangladesh has never been lacking in natural or

</P>
<P>
She said her country is willing and able to assert its ability
to match and beat the best investment opportunities available

<HEADLINE> China's Reform and Opening Up Policy Remains Unchanged: Wu Yi (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We take a positive attitude towards a meeting of the Chinese
working group on the country joining the WTO, to be held in
Geneva," she said.
</P>
<P>
China needs the WTO, while the WTO needs China. China's policy
of reform and opening up remains unchanged, irrespective of if, or
when it can join the WTO, she stressed.
</P>
<P>
This morning, Jing Shuping, president of the All-China
Federation of Industry and Commerce, also met the delegation.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the development of a socialist market economy
on the mainland, the competition is becoming acute. How to raise
the quality of enterprises, and their managers, including women
entrepreneurs, is a very important task.
</P>
<P>
Jing expressed the hope that the Friendship Association of
Women Entrepreneurs of the All-China Federation of Industry and
Commerce, should conduct exchanges and cooperation with the
Professional Women and Entrepreneurs Association of Hong Kong, in
raising personnel quality, strengthening the development of
manpower resources, as well as the morality of professionals,
society and family, he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, "we should learn from Hong Kong's successful
experience in management, finance, accounting and marketing".
</P>
<P>
Jing said after Hong Kong returns to the motherland, the
economic relations between the inland areas and Hong Kong will
become closer.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the women entrepreneurs of Hong Kong will play a
more important role in expanding economic cooperation between the
inland areas and Hong Kong, and promoting the peaceful
reunification of the motherland," he said.
</P>
<P>
 The delegation led by Annie Suk Ching Wu, honorary president
of the association, and member of the National Committee of the

<HEADLINE> China's Reform and Opening up Policy Remains Unchanged: Wu Yi (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Wu Yi, minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation, told a delegation today from the
Professional Women and Entrepreneurs Association of Hong Kong,
that they can be assured that China's reform and opening to the
outside policy will remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Wu said Hong Kong is an international
financial, trade and shipping center. This special position has
been formed over the past dozens of years, and can be neither
changed by anybody, nor replaced by any city.
</P>
<P>
Wu said as the day for the return of Hong Kong to the
motherland approaches, the relationship between China's inland
areas and Hong Kong is becoming closer.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong serves as a "bridge" for the inland areas to enter the
world, while China's reform and opening up provides a guarantee
for Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, she said.
</P>
<P>
The key to continuing to implement a policy depends on whether
the people will support it or not.
</P>
<P>
Those who change rashly the policy that the people support will
be definitely abandoned by history, she said.
</P>
<P>
On China joining the World Trade Organization, Wu said that it
was reported that the United States hopes for a settlement of the
issue before Hong Kong's return.
</P>
<P>
As an old Chinese saying goes, it is imperative to listen to
what a person says, and watch what he does, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
She said China takes an active attitude toward this issue,
because China's economy is inter-mixed with the world economy. It
will be a great blemish to exclude China, a major trading country
in the world, from the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"We clearly know that to join the WTO, China should hand an
"entrance free", but this should conform to China's actual
situation, and accorded with its economic development level," Wu
said.

<HEADLINE> Democratic Fund-Raiser Expected to Appear for Subpoena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A fund-raiser for the
Democratic National Committee is expected to make himself
available to receive a subpoena by Monday at the latest.
</P>
<P>
Judicial Watch, a conservative advocacy group, wants to
question John Huang about his political contributions made to the
Democrats. But U.S. Marshals have been unable to locate Huang to
serve a subpoena for the deposition.
</P>
<P>
In response to U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth's request
on Friday, DNC chairman Don Fowler wrote to Huang, through his
attorney, asking him to "report for work on Monday... here at the
DNC."
</P>
<P>
The attorney, John C. Keeney Jr., responded, "Our client will
be in the District of Columbia on Monday morning."
</P>
<P>
Another court session is scheduled for Monday morning to
determine the limits of what Huang may be asked. Keeney wants no
questions about anything unrelated to Huang's former job at the
Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
Judicial Watch and its counsel, Larry Klayman, accused the
Commerce Department two years ago of not furnishing documents
required under the Freedom of Information Act. The group is trying
to determine whether the department used government-sponsored
missions to raise money for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Huang reportedly raised four million to five million dollars
for the Democrats from Asian-Americans this year. The DNC has
returned some of the contested donations and stripped Huang of his
fund-raising duties on October 18.

TAIYUAN, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A new highway bridge over the
Yellow River, connecting Jiaxian County in Shaanxi Province with
Linxian County of Shanxi Province, opened to traffic earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
The 782-m-long, 12-m-wide, and 25-m-high bridge cost 33 million
yuan to build.
</P>
<P>
The two counties are poverty-striken areas, especially Jiaxian,
which has poor natural conditions, and the new bridge is expected
to help economic development of the two, which are famous in china
for their dates.
</P>
<P>
The day the bridge opened, officials from both counties agreed
to build 80,000 hectares of date orchards within five years,
36,000 hectares of farmland, and to build 170 km of highways along
the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
By the turn of the century, the two counties may have 350 km in
per capita grain and 1,500 yuan in per capita income, allowing
rural farmers to have sufficient food and clothing.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: Malaysian Economy on Healthier Growth Path </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's rocketing
economic growth has begun to slow down to a more sustainable pace
while its worrisome balance of payments deficit is on the decline,
indicating the economy is on a healthier development path,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth rate is projected to moderate to 8.2
percent this year and eight percent next year against 9.5 percent
in 1995, according to the Finance Ministry's 1996/97 economic
report released Friday.
</P>
<P>
The projected growth rates are more sustainable and the trend
will prevent a recurrence of "overheating," the analysts said,
noting that the fear for a Mexican-style economic slump to occur
in Malaysia is also being dispelled.
</P>
<P>
The moderation of growth is accompanied by improvements in the
nation's resource position and a narrowing of the external
payments current account deficit, as statistics contained in the
report show.
</P>
<P>
The current account is envisaged to record a lower deficit of
14.8 billion ringgit (about 5.92 billion US dollars) or 6.3
percent of the gross national product (GNP) this year.
</P>
<P>
The figures compare with a deficit of 18.7 billion ringgit
(about 7.48 billion US dollars) or nine percent of the GNP last
year and are further expected to narrow to 11.5 billion ringgit
(about 4.6 billion US dollars) or 4.4 percent of the GNP in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Although Malaysia's economic success in recent years has
attracted much attention, its economy still has weaknesses and
faces challenges.
</P>
<P>
Its economic growth is still investment-driven, which needs to
be shifted to productivity-driven, and there is a need to
undertake strategic shifts to industries that are knowledge-based
and technology-intensive to overcome the problem of labor
shortage.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the problem of the balance of payments is still a
headache for the government.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to ensure more sustainable economic development, the
government Friday unveiled its 1997 national budget with a
three-prong strategy -- achieve sustainable growth through
enhanced productivity, strengthen the balance of payments position
with improvements in the services sector and higher domestic
production, and strengthen the agenda for social development.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the budget in Parliament, Finance Minister Anwar
Ibrahim said the manufacturing sector, which grew at double-digit
rates in the last few years, would remain as important, although
the new stimulus are to come from services and information-based
industries.
</P>
<P>
The budget also contains new tax and financial measures aimed
at strengthening the foundations of the economy and ensuring the
well-being of Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
Economists here said the 1997 budget proposals are highly
development oriented as they are aimed at sustaining growth by
emphasizing productivity and addressing the structural weaknesses
of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The budget envisages a strengthening of an already strong
foundation for the Malaysian economy to propel itself into the
next millennium, they said.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Chunyun Calls for Reducing Farmers' Burden (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Chinese vice premier Jiang
Chunyun said today in Beijing that the State Council, China's
cabinet, is determined to reduce the heavy burden on the country's
peasant households. He promised the government's unremitting
efforts to help the farmers.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the commitment in a report to the 22nd session of
the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress
(NPC), China's legislature, convening in a plenary session today.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid 1980s, and especially in the 1990s, some places
and departments across China have seriously violated the interests
of farmers, by collecting illicit fees, illegal fund-raising, and
the imposition of arbitrary fines and quotas.
</P>
<P>
Reports from relevant departments said that the proportion of
the money a Chinese farmer has to pay each year for the
accumulation of common funds by collectives, to his net income in
the previous year, reached 5.2 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The figure dropped to 4.92 percent last year, due to the joint
efforts of central and local governments, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that the heavy weight of the economic
burden was still one of the problems causing great concern among
the Chinese farmers.
</P>
<P>
"This problem has not yet been basically solved, and remains
quite serious in some areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, it is mainly because some local governments
have drifted from reality, and set unrealistic targets for
economic development and social progress, and some departments
have been obsessed with seeking their own benefits. These factors
have stopped the resolving of the problems for a long time.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized some leading officials for not being mindful
of the general masses of people, and adopting simple and crude
work styles. Jiang also placed part of the blame on incomplete
relevant laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the State Council has set a general
target for the coming period for reducing the farmers' burden.
</P>
<P>
"The amount of accumulated common funds, and labor assignments
for the farmers, must be kept under the limits of the state, while
any illicit charging of service fees, or illegal fund-raising and
price hikes, and any imposition of arbitrary fines and quotas,
must be strictly banned," he said.

<HEADLINE> 'Tintin' Wins Century Prize for Comic Strips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The world-famous comic strip,
"Tintin", in a series depicting a young journalist fighting the
Japanese army in Shanghai, China, won the "Comic Strip of the
Century" award here today.
</P>
<P>
The award, given by the French government, was created to mark
the 100th anniversary of the birth of the first comic strips in
New York.
</P>
<P>
Fifi Chang, the daughter of a life-long friend of Tintin's
creator, Belgian artist George Remi Herge, received the prize from
French Minister of Culture Philippe Douste-Blazy.
</P>
<P>
Fifi Chang's father was a fictional hero in the "Blue Lotus" of
the Tintin series, which set Tintin in Shanghai in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
The prize was awarded on the basis of 113,506 votes cast by the
readers of comic strips around Europe, as well as on decisions by
three panels consisting of journalists, professors of
communications, and historians specializing in comic strips.
</P>
<P>
Two other comic strips, the "Asterix", in a series about the
adventures of pilots by French artist Albert Uderzo, and "Corto
Maltese," a series of sea-faring stories by the late Italian
artist, Hugo Pratt, also won the same prize.
</P>
<P>
The first modern comic strip series, "Yellow Kid", appeared on
the New York World prayers' book in 1896. Its hero was a young
rascal wearing a yellow shirt.

ISLAMABAD, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Jet fighters of Afghan
northern warlord Rashid Dostum bombed the Taliban militia's
positions northeast of Kabul twice today, said reports from
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Dostum's jets dropped bombs on Taliban positions in the
strategic Deh Sabz pass, scene of heavy fighting over the last few
days, according to a spokesman for former government military
commander Ahmad Shah Masood, whose troops are fighting the Taliban
along with Dostum's.

Masood's soldiers said they had been warned in advance by radio
not to open fire on the jets.
</P>
<P>
A Taliban tank was destroyed in the raids, they said.

<P>
TOKYO, October 26 (Xinhua) -- KDD plans to make Japan the Asian
center for Internet, linking surfers and information providers in
Asian nations with their U.S. and European counterparts, Kyodo
News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that KDD would build a large-capacity
telecommunications network to handle data sent to and dispatched
from computer users in Asia, Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
As the number of Internet users in Asia is growing, anxieties
have risen that huge construction costs and higher Internet
connection fees will result, if each country's telecom company
seeks to link up with the United States by laying down their own
lines.
</P>
<P>
KDD will seek cooperation with on-line service companies in
Asian countries and provide them access to U.S. lines via KDD.
</P>
<P>
On-line service firms in Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea and
India are expected to join the new KDD network by the end of
fiscal year of 1996, while those in Indonesia, Malaysia and China
are also expected to follow suit in 1997.
</P>
<P>
So far, KDD has been operating only one transmission line with
a capacity of 45 megabits per second, while the new KDD program
will add two such lines by the summer of 1997.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani police today
detained a staff member of the Indian Embassy in Islamabad, at a
local market here on charges of conducting espionage activities.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Associated Press of Pakistan (APP),
the staff member, A.K. Wahi, "Was caught red-handed while
purchasing information of a sensitive nature from his local

Wahi told police that he was an Indian intelligence operator
working as an agent handler under the cover of the Indian Embassy,
said the APP.
</P>
<P>
Wahi confessed that he had been enticing his local contacts
with offers of lucrative rewards in exchange for sensitive
information.
</P>
<P>
The Indian official, whose identity was not revealed, was later
released and handed over to a representative of the Indian High
Commission by the Pakistani police.

<P>
The APP quoted reliable sources as saying that Wahi has been
asked to leave Pakistan within seven days for indulging in
activities incompatible with his official status.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Chunyun Calls for Reducing Farmers' Burden (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese vice premier Jiang
Chunyun said today in Beijing that the State Council, China's
cabinet, is determined to reduce the heavy burden on the country's
peasant households. He promised the government's unremitting
efforts to help the farmers.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the commitment in a report to the 22nd session of
the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress
(NPC), China's legislature, convening in a plenary session today.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid 1980s, and especially in the 1990s, some places
and departments across China have seriously violated the interests
of farmers, by collecting illicit fees, illegal fund-raising, and
the imposition of arbitrary fines and quotas.
</P>
<P>
Reports from relevant departments said that the proportion of
the money a Chinese farmer has to pay each year for the
accumulation of common funds by collectives, to his net income in
the previous year, reached 5.2 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The figure dropped to 4.92 percent last year, due to the joint
efforts of central and local governments, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that the heavy weight of the economic
burden was still one of the problems causing great concern among
the Chinese farmers.
</P>
<P>
"This problem has not yet been basically solved, and remains
quite serious in some areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, it is mainly because some local governments
have drifted from reality, and set unrealistic targets for
economic development and social progress, and some departments
have been obsessed with seeking their own benefits. These factors
have stopped the resolving of the problems for a long time.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized some leading officials for not being mindful
of the general masses of people, and adopting simple and crude
work styles. Jiang also placed part of the blame on incomplete
relevant laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the State Council has set a general
target for the coming period for reducing the farmers' burden.
</P>
<P>
"The amount of accumulated common funds, and labor assignments
for the farmers, must be kept under the limits of the state, while
any illicit charging of service fees, or illegal fund-raising and
price hikes, and any imposition of arbitrary fines and quotas,
must be strictly banned," he said.

Meanwhile, fighting between Zairean troops and the
Banyamurenges is continuing today around Bukavu, the capital of

<HEADLINE> Iran Frees 150 Iraqi Prisoners of War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced here today that
it freed 150 Iraqi prisoners who were captured during its
eight-year war with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the release
was made today with the approval of Iran's Supreme Leader and
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
POWs Commission Spokesman Mohammad Balar said that
representatives from Iraq and the International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) were also present at a ceremony held at Khosrawi
border point, western Iran.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the release of the Iraqi POWS is a
humanitarian measure and a sign of Tehran's good intention.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the move could be interpreted as a
positive response to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
rapprochement bid.
</P>
<P>
President Saddam has recently sent a message to his Iranian
counterpart Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, voicing Iraq's strong
desire for good neighborly relations with Iran and for expansion
of bilateral ties, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said at a
press conference that Iran welcomes Saddam Hussein's
rapprochement proposal.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the message by the Iraqi leader was positive.
Baghdad wants to have good ties (with) us and we welcome that
gesture."
</P>
<P>
"Many of our prominent problems such as (the) return of
prisoners of war and those missing in action have been
resolved," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to go into details about the message.
</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein's special envoy delivered the message to
Rafsanjani on October 15. Neither side had revealed the identity
of the Iraqi envoy.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq were locked in a prolonged Gulf war from 1980 to
1988. Such big problems like the prisoners of war, have
blocked the way for improvement of the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Although the two countries have agreed and maintained a
cease-fire since August 1988, there is no real peace between the
two rivals. During the past years, both sides reported violations
on the cease-fire by the other party to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In the border areas, there exists a "no war and no peace"
state. The two countries still keep a large number of their
armed forces along the borders.
</P>
<P>
Both sides criticized the other for the lack of trust and
sincerity in talks.

<HEADLINE> Attackers Rocket Police Outpost in Corsica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Attackers fired a rocket into a
newly built barracks for the French paramilitary police in
Porto-Vecchio, southern Corsica, early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The rocket, which was not carrying an explosive warhead,
pierced through the wall of a dormitory. It did not kill or injure
anyone, but two members of the paramilitary police, the
gendarmerie, in the dormitory suffered severe shock.
</P>
<P>
It was the second attack in two days targeting police on the
island. No one immediately claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Police said that the rocket used in the latest attack was
carried by Corsican militants during a rally on the island last
January.
</P>
<P>
Two similar attacks with unloaded rockets were launched in
November and December 1995 by Corsican militants against police
and government targets in Corsica, police said.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's attack happened amid a nationwide hunt for suspects
in a bomb attack on the city hall of Bordeaux, where Prime
Minister Alain Juppe is mayor. Police detained and arrested at
least 14 people this week.
</P>
<P>
The bomb attack was claimed by the National Liberation Front of
Corsica, or FLNC-Canal Historique. But the militants threatened
to retaliate if any member of the FLNC-Canal was subjected to
"physical elimination" by the government.
</P>
<P>
Several days later, on Thursday, the police station in
Bonifacio, South Corsica, was attacked. The attackers, armed with
machine guns, sprayed the office building with bullets, but no one
was killed or injured.
</P>
<P>
The FLNC-Canal Historique has maintained an independence
movement on the French island for more than 20 years.

<HEADLINE> Hop Over to A Shop With A Difference in Hangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 26 (Xinhua) -- China has taken a giant leap
forward in providing an unusual range of luxury goods for shoppers.
</P>
<P>
A shop has opened in relatively wealthy Hangzhou, capital city
of Zhejiang Province, specializing in items made from kangaroo
skins.
</P>
<P>
Australia's favorite, hop, skip and jump animals are being
turned into clothing, handbags and purses, as well as other goods.
</P>
<P>
The shop's owners are now trying to persuade customers to dig
deep into their pouches - or rather wallets - to snap up goods
from their shelves.
</P>
<P>
For the Australians it is a new and profitable way of disposing
of their surplus kangaroos.
</P>
<P>
The K.C. Pacific Property Company has opened its first
exclusive kangaroo leather shop in the city.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jiangming, general manager of the shop, persuades locals
to buy the exotic goods, saying, "the leather clothing and bags
are all professionally crafted from the skins of surplus
kangaroos. You can absolutely feel comfortable wearing our 'mouse
skin' garments."
</P>
<P>
The Kangaroo, known by the Chinese as "a mouse with a bag", is
considered a type of mouse in the minds of ordinary Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Kangaroos, a national treasure in Australia and one of its
major symbols, are the biggest mammals with pouches in the world.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, due to the favourable natural environment and
efficient protective measures, kangaroos have multiplied so much
that they have become dangerous competitor to cows and sheep for
grass.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the Australian government decided to cull a set level
kangaroos every year, to keep ecology balanced, and restore
harmony to the country's vast prairies.

<P>
NAIROBI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese People's
Liberation Movement (SPLM) said on Friday that it was ready to
discuss peace with the Khartoum government through the brokering
of Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi.
</P>
<P>
The SPLM made the remarks when the Secretary General of the
Supreme Council for Peace in the Sudan, Mohamed Elamin Khalifa,
yesterday presented a special message from President Omar El
Bashir of Sudan at the State House in Nakuru, about 160
kilometers northwest of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The "East African Standard" newspaper today quoted a SPLM
official as saying that only the Inter-Governmental Authority on
Development (IGAD) which is chaired by President Moi has the
official mandate to broker peace among Sudanese people.
</P>
<P>
SPLM Secretary for Information Pa'gan Amum Okiech told the
paper that "only IGAD has acceptable international support for
peace in the Sudan".
</P>
<P>
"We shall not negotiate with the Sudan government outside
IGAD," said Okiech, adding that "if the Sudan government is
ready to talk peace, they should approach IGAD Chairman President
Moi."

<HEADLINE> Tourism Industry in Macao Shows Steady Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The tourism industry, a leading
income maker in Macao, saw a steady growth in the first eight
months of this year, following the opening of an international
airport at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourist arrivals to Macao from January to August
reached 5.52 million, up 4.7 percent from the same period of last
year, according to latest figures released by the Macao Census and
 Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the increase of tourists, hotels in Macao have
seen a better business. A total of 105 hotels, inns and guest
houses in Macao received about 1.79 million guests during the
period, up 8.1 percent over the same period of last year. The
average room occupancy rate rose to 59.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The dominant source of tourists was from Hong Kong, although
the number of Hong Kong tourists dropped by 6.5 percent. The
number of Taiwan travelers jumped by the largest margin of 142.8
percent over the corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the growth of tourism largely to the new
airport. A total of 238,724 passengers arrived in Macao via the
airport during the first eight months.
</P>
<P>
Quasi-direct flights across the Taiwan Straits via Macao have
attracted a large number of Taiwan businessmen and travelers who
intended to leave for Beijing, Shanghai and Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, travelers from Japan, the Republic of Korea, the
United States, Britain and China's inland areas also increased in
the period of this year.

<HEADLINE> Investment in China's Education Remains Low: Legislator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Central and local governments
have achieved great progress in ensuring that more funds are
spent on education.
</P>
<P>
But the current level of investment remains small to some
extent, a senior Chinese legislator said today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Some regulations in the Education Law, concerning guarantees
for investment in education, have not been fully implemented, said
Fei Xiaotong, vice-chairman of the Eighth National People's
Congress (NPC) Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Fei made the remarks in his report to the committee's ongoing
22nd session, shortly after leading an inspection team to look into
the implementation of the law.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1995, total educational expenditure
increased by 26.14 percent over the previous year, with the part
of the state's fiscal educational expenditure rising 20.16 percent
over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The budgetary appropriation for education in 1995 increased
by 16.34 percent over 1994.
</P>
<P>
Between 1995 and 2000, the central and local governments will
set aside more than ten billion yuan (1.2 billion US dollars) to
help with compulsory education in impoverished counties. The sum
will be the biggest ever in special funding for the country's
education.
</P>
<P>
The legislator noted that the percentage of fiscal educational
expenditure in the country's GDP has tended to decrease, with the
growth rate of fiscal appropriation in education slower than the
growth of fiscal revenues.
</P>
<P>
But the Education Law states that the percentage should "rise
gradually", and that the growth rate of educational appropriation
should be higher than the growth rate of fiscal revenues, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fiscal educational expenditure accounted for 2.77 percent of
the country's GDP in 1993, the percentage was 2.52 percent in 1994
and 2.46 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Educational outlay accounted for 16.05 percent of China's total
fiscal expenditure, but the figure in 1994 was 16.07 percent.
</P>
<P>
Also in 1995, the growth rate of budgetary educational
appropriation was 2.24 percentage points lower than the growth rate
of fiscal revenues.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the number of dangerous classrooms in primary and
secondary schools are on the increase. In addition some teachers
do not receive their salaries on time, Fei said.
</P>
<P>
To revitalize the country by relying on science and education,
Fei suggested that the state should guarantee the increase in
proportion of educational expenditure in in the country's GDP,
single out the budget for educational funds, and enhance the
supervision over the appropriation, and use of educational funds.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Advances to Stuttgart Tennis Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 26 (Xinhua) -- World number one Pete Sampras
stretched his unbeaten run to 21 matches with a comfortable 6-3,
6-4 victory over unseeded Dutchman Jan Siemerink in the Stuttgart
Open tennis tournament semifinals on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The triple Wimbledon champion, who has won his last three
tournaments including the U.S. Open and is unbeaten indoors this
year, took 79 minutes to clinch his place in Sunday's final of
the 2.2 million U.S. dollar indoor event.
</P>
<P>
The winning streak is the second longest of his career. In
1994 the 25-year-old American won 29 consecutive matches.
</P>
<P>
Sampras's serve-and-volley game is perfectly suited to the
swift indoor courts, although the Stuttgart surface is not one of
the fastest on the circuit.
</P>
<P>
The American made a key break of serve in the sixth game to
lead 4-2 before taking the first set in 32 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Although the world number one dropped his serve at the start
of the second set, he soon bounced back with breaks in the third
and seventh games on his way to the easy win.

<HEADLINE> Probe into Iraqi Attack on Kuwaitis Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Investigations into an
Iraqi attack on a Kuwaiti fishing boat are underway amid fears the
bilateral relations might worsen.
</P>
<P>
Some armed Iraqis attacked the Kuwaiti fishing boat Thursday in
the north of the Gulf, leaving two persons wounded on board, one
of whom later died in hospital because of heavy internal
bleeding.
</P>
<P>
Public Relations Director in Kuwait's Interior Ministry Adel
Al-Ibrahim told Xinhua that so far investigations are still going
on by the police authorities to decide whether it was only a
piratic crime.
</P>
<P>
Another official said that he thought the incident would
unlikely worsen the already hostile relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility, the unidentified official said:
"I don't think so."
</P>
<P>
The two neighboring countries have been locked in deep
antagonism ever since the Gulf War in 1991 when the West-led
allied forces helped drive the Iraqi troops out of Kuwait after
seven- month occupation.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the issue of missing Prisoners of
War remained a bone of contention between Kuwait and Iraq and it
still hurts the feelings of the Kuwaiti people.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait insists that more than 600 Kuwaiti POWs were still
locked up in Iraqi jails.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ibrahim said the attack Thursday on the boat with six
Kuwaiti nationals on board, occurred in a northern spot called
"Aqwaa 60" beyond the Kuwaiti territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Abdullah Al-Qattan, one of the wounded who survived
the attack, said the bullets used by the Iraqis in their attack
were fired from a Klashinkov rifle.
</P>
<P>
The bullets had gone through his leg and hit his deceased
friend Imad Shisstar, resulting in internal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the incident, al-Qattan said he and his friends were
surprised to see a boat approaching from the northern side, but
did not expect that the people on board had ill intentions.
</P>
<P>
He said: "when the boat was only 25 meters away from us, one
of the Iraqi people on board starting firing bullets (toward)
our way from a klashnikov automatic rifle."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis boarded the Kuwaiti vessel, looted its contents
and knocked out one of its motors before fleeing northward,
Al-Aqttan said.
</P>
<P>
He said Kuwaiti coast guards had located the assaulted boat
near the Island of Failaka, helped the fishermen to reach shore
and transported the wounded to hospital.
</P>
<P>
No official Iraqi comment was available so far.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Colleges Among Country's Top Business Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Universities and colleges in
China have learned a powerful lesson as the country's economic
reforms take shape.
</P>
<P>
They are running money-spinning enterprises, reaping massive
earnings of almost 20 billion yuan in the past year.
</P>
<P>
A group of powerful enterprises have emerged in Chinese
colleges, a conference in Shanghai heard today.
</P>
<P>
Many college-run enterprises have been in the vanguard in
China's technological developments. Beijing University's Fangzheng
Group, Xi'an Communications University's Kaiyuan Group, Qinghua
University's Ziguang Group, and Fudan University's Fuhua, have
been listed among the country's top 100 hi-tech enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's Fangzheng Group, which made a great contribution to
the development of photo typesetting systems, made a profit of 170
million yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
At neighboring Qinghua University, fixed assets of its
enterprises have surpassed 200 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chinese colleges have established 8,182 enterprises, earning a
total income of 19.68 billion yuan in 1995 (about 2.38 billion US
dollars) from technological developments, industrial production
and trade, 11.2 times more than five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Last year the enterprises run by universities and colleges made
1.54 billion yuan in profits, 5.3 times of 1991's figure.
</P>
<P>
College-run enterprises in Beijing, Shanghai, and Jiangsu,
Liaoning and Zhejiang provinces, have developed faster than
others, turning out half of the country's college income from
technological development, industrial production and trade.
</P>
<P>
More and more areas have put college-run enterprises into their
overall development plans. The government in Tianjin Municipality
has vowed to develop 10 projects, each with an annual production
value of one billion yuan. Six of the ten projects will be joined
by college-run enterprises.
</P>
<P>
College-run enterprises have promoted educational reforms,
provided more educational funds, and offered vocational sites for
students to practise.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Mt. Merapi's Danger Status Upgraded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Authorities have raised the
danger status of Mountain Merapi in central Java, Indonesia,
following signs of increased activity of the killer volcano,
Antara news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mas Atje Purbawinata, head of the volcanology office in
Yogjakarta 30 km south of Mt. Merapi, said on Friday that the
status had been raised late Thursday from "alert" to
"preparedness."
</P>
<P>
"The energy supply from the inside of the Merapi to the surface
through the crater has increased and surface tremors have also
increased," Mas Atje was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The "preparedness" level is only one signal down from actual
eruption.
</P>
<P>
People living near the foot of the mountain had been asked to
remain on alert, he said.
</P>
<P>
He estimated the volume of active lava dome has reached around
900,000 cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The Merapi, which dominates the flat plain of southern Java,
last erupted in 1993, killing more than 60 people and forcing more
than 6,000 to be evacuated to safer ground.
</P>
<P>
There are 127 volcanoes classified as active in Indonesia,
which has a total of 500 volcanoes.

<HEADLINE> Top Legislature Puts New and Draft Laws Under Microscope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislative body,
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC),
held a plenary meeting in Beijing today to hear reports on issues
covering farmers, labor disputes, and education. The committee
also discussed proposals for new laws.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, attended the
meeting, which was presided over by Vice-Chairman Wang Hanbin.
</P>
<P>
Vice premier Jiang Chunyun said in a report on reducing the
heavy economic burdens on Chinese farmers, that fees collected
from farmers by local governments must be controlled with the
quota set by the state. All forms of illicit fees, illegal
fund-raising, and imposition of arbitrary fines and quotas must be
prohibited, he added
</P>
<P>
With intense attention, and efforts by the central authorities
and governments at various levels, much has been done to alleviate
the unfair and illegal economic burden on farmers. But it is still
an issue of great concern among many farmers in the country, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
Two senior legislators, Ni Zhifu and Fei Xiaotong,
vice-chairmen of the NPC Standing Committee, reported on
inspections on the labor law and the education law.
</P>
<P>
China has achieved initial progress in carrying out the Labor
Law, which was put into effect on January 1, 1995, Ni said.
</P>
<P>
Fei said that the central and local governments have made
efforts, and achieved great progress to ensure more investment in
education. But the investment remains small to some extent.
</P>
<P>
According to reports on the deliberation of draft bills
submitted by NPC deputies in March this year, the formulation of
many new laws is well under way.
</P>
<P>
A number of NPC deputies suggested that the country should
revise its current marriage law to cater for new problems that
have appeared in recent years, as a market system is expanded.
</P>
<P>
A new anti-corruption law will also include measures to punish
people who retaliate against informers in corruption cases.
</P>
<P>
A press law, the government procurement law, and many others
will also be drafted according to opinions of the NPC deputies.

<P>
LAGOS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Cameroun has pledged to accept
the decision of the International Court of Justice over the
disputed oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Cameroun, because of the repeated clashes with Nigeria over
the disputed Bakassi peninsula since 1994, has taken the case to
the court.
</P>
<P>
Camerounian President Paul Biya told the United Nations
General Assembly Thursday that his country was committed to a
peaceful settlement of the dispute.
</P>

"From the beginning, we have given precedence to the approach
of dialogue and a peaceful settlement of the dispute by bringing
the matter before the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the
Security Council and the International Court of Justice,"
President Biya said while addressing the assembly in New York.

<P>
President Biya, who is also chairman of the OAU, said the
numerous conflicts in Africa -- Somalia, Sudan, Liberia, Angola
and Burundi, among others -- were having devastating consequences
on the continent.
</P>
<P>
"Facing so many acute problems today, Africa has to see peace
as an absolute requirement," he said, quoted by press reports.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chairman also listed a number of measures for the
economic development of the poorest continent of the world,

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the 18 member
economies of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum
will wear barong tagalog, colorful shirts in the Filipino style,
at their biggest photo session when they meet in Subic in
November, the Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The barong, which will be a gift to the APEC leaders from
Philippine President Fidel Ramos as host of the APEC meeting, is
designed by Filipino fashion designer Jean Goulbourn.
</P>
<P>
They will be hand-woven with 50 percent Philippine silk and 50
percent Philippine fiber and will have special embroidery
hand-made by Filipino artisans.
</P>
<P>
While each leader's barong will be unique in design, all the
shirts will share an inspiration taken from the intricate window
patterns of the Filipino ancestral homes in Ilocos Sur province in
the north of the country, and will feature a motif of wheat fields
ready for harvest.
</P>
<P>
"They are symbolic," said Goulbourn, noting that "APEC is a
window to the world's bountiful harvest."

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Economically prosperous
Guangdong Province has developed a kind of multi-purpose
management system for over 30,000 communities.
</P>
<P>
The province, which has been in the vanguard of China's opening
up, has seen rapid economic progress in the past decade. Although
its 15 million transient workers have contributed quite a bit to
Guangdong's economic miracle, they have also caused quite a few
problems in public security.
</P>
<P>
The traditional mode of household registration could not really
cope with the new situation, so the "safety community", a new
style of management, handling not only public order, but also
population shifts, the environment, and other affairs, emerged.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the provincial government, within
the same residential area, the average crime rate fell some 30
percent after the safety community was established.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the first nine months of the year, the
total number of crimes dropped some 12 percent, from the
corresponding period last year. The achievements should been
partly attributed to the establishment of "safety communities".

<HEADLINE> Implementation of Labor Law Well Under Way: Legislator (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The governments have also pushed forward the labor contract
system to clarify the rights and duties in labor-capital relations.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June this year, more than almost 99 million
workers had signed contracts with their employing enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the reform of social security systems is well under
way to expand the number of people covered under the social
insurance.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 87.5 million workers, and 22.5 million retired
workers have participated in a comprehensive form of pension
insurance, which means individuals, enterprises, and the
government jointly shoulder pensions for the old.
</P>
<P>
Local people's congresses and governments have organized
various forms of law-enforcement inspections to ensure that the
Labor Law is carried out well.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, 29 labor supervising organs at
provincial level had been established, and 2,800 labor supervising
organs at the prefectural and county levels had been founded.
</P>
<P>
However, Ni noted that some localities have some difficulties
and problems in carrying out the law.
</P>
<P>
With a large population, a fast growing labor force, and the
readjustment of economic structure, the task of employment and
re-employment of laid-off workers is very tough, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that some overseas-funded ventures, and township and
private enterprises have been slow in signing contracts with their
employees. In addition, the legal rights of laborers are sometimes
violated.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, Ni suggested that people's congresses and
governments at various levels step up formulating laws and
regulations which beef up the Labor Law, and at the same time
strengthen law-enforcement.

<HEADLINE> Dozens of Mogadishu Children Die in Suspension of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 26 (Xinhua) -- At least 35 children under
five years have died and nearly 12,000 others are perishing in
the Somali capital Mogadishu, following the suspension of the
humanitarian activities by the international relief agencies.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest press statement issued by the Joint
Health Authority in the capital, the children have died for lack
of immunization from the six main killer diseases and due to
malnourishment.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy occured after five of the only eight feeding
centers in the capital were closed down amid reports of the
captivity of a Somali aid worker, Hilal Mohamed Aden.
</P>
<P>
The 12,000 children in eight feeding camps have been living on
food supplied by the French Aid Agency, ACF and UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
The international aid agencies have evacuated their
international expatriates and fixed a notice paper on their gates
informing the public that all kinds of humanitarian operations
were suspended until further notice.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the measles disease has revived in the
capital and its surrounding districts since early this month.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of the relief supplies is now seriously
affecting the civilians, the statement said, calling on the
relief agencies to restore the two vital programs of immunization
and the supplementary feeding.
</P>
<P>
The international community is punishing innocent children and
civilians, the statement warned.
</P>
<P>
The Somali Aid Coordination Body (SACS) issued a statement
urging the relief agencies to suspend their humanitarian
activities in the country following the kidnapping of Aden by
Somali gunmen in north Mogadishu on September 19 this year.
</P>
<P>
Aden had been serving the Swedish Institute of Life and Peace
as a representative of his country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The implementation of China's
labor laws in the past two years has been hailed as a success at a
top-level meeting today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The country has achieved initial progress in carrying out the
new law, which was put into effect on January 1, 1995, a senior
Chinese legislator reported.
</P>
<P>
The central legislative and administrative departments and
localities have made efforts to publicize the law, formulate
supporting laws and regulations, reform labor system, carry out
labor standards, solve labor disputes and boost related
law-enforcement, the legislator said.
</P>
<P>
Ni Zhifu, vice-chairman of the Eighth National People's
Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, reported the successes to the
ongoing 22nd session of the committee in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In September this year, five inspection groups, consisting of
members of the Standing Committee, toured five of China's
provinces and autonomous regions to look into the implementation
of the Labor Law.
</P>
<P>
Other localities also made their own investigations into
related law-enforcement in their own territories, and submitted
written reports to the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure the overall implementation of the Labor Law,
people's congresses, governments and relevant departments at
various levels have stepped up the formulation of laws and
regulations to back up the Labor Law," Ni said.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, the NPC Standing Committee adopted the
Professional Education Law. The State Council has put into effect
a regulation on working hours. The drafting of four laws on social
security, labor contract, employment promotion, and working safety
and health is nearing completion.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Ministry of Labor has issued 47 regulations on
payments of salaries, and collective contracts, among other
subjects.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have taken measures to promote employment and
replacement of laid-off workers, such as nurturing labor markets,
establishing labor recommendation centers, and training laid-off
workers to raise their professional skills, according to Ni.

KUNMING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- China's Yunnan Province has
recently honored 15 departments and 20 individuals for their
achievements in developing the private economy over the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan, privately-owned enterprises
had total output value of 7.5 billion yuan (about 900 million US
dollars) and paid 2.7 billion yuan in taxes, while providing jobs
for 1.1 million people, or 5.2 percent of the province's workforce.
</P>
<P>
Private enterprises have not only promoted local economy, but
also increased Yunnan's overall strength. The development of
private economy has pushed state-owned and collectively-owned
enterprises to set up a new operation mechanism, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
He Zhijiang, governor of the province, said that over the next
five years Yunnan will continue to increase the proportion of
private economy in the local economy.

CAIRO, October 26 (Xinhua)-- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- A group of U.S. businessmen are prepared to
purchase EL AL, Israel's national carrier, without the airline
operating on Shabbat, Transport Minister Yitzhak Levy said.
</P>
<P>
Levy, who would not identify the prospective investors, said
that he had held meetings over the last two months with the
Israeli representatives of these religious Jewish businessmen.
</P>
<P>
However, Levy said he still favors a public flotation of El Al
rather than a single sale of the controlling share in the
company.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt's Investment Authority said that France ranks
third among European Union countries after U.K. and Germany in
terms of investment in Egypt. French investments are in 67
ventures, while 13 French banks including three joint venter banks
now operating in this north African country.
</P>
<P>
-- The German aid volume to Egypt hit 7.2 billion DM this year and
Bonn has decided to drop 5 percent, or 2.4 billion DM, of Egyptian
debt to Germany, according to the local daily Akhbar el-Yom today.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- 240 million flowers were exported by Israeli
flower growers in Negev, south Israel, to markets in Europe
and the U.S. during the flower exporting season which has just
ended, reported bi-weekly Israel Business Today.
</P>
<P>
Itzik Simman, manager of the Mevuim Corporation based in Negev,
said that his corporation's packing facilities handle 37 million
dollars of flowers for export to markets in Britain, Scandinavia,
Germany and Netherlands, as well as the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israel diamond industry will reach out to new
Southeast Asian markets with seminars to be held for diamond
buyers and jewelers in the Philippines and Indonesia in

Israel Diamond Institute (IDI) Chairman Moshe Schnitzer is
scheduled to head a delegation consisting of more than 50 Israeli
diamond executives to the projected seminars.

CAIRO -- A delegation of Iraqi businessmen will visit Cairo in
mid-November for talks with Egyptian counterparts in a bid to
promote industrial and commercial cooperation between the two
countries, the local daily Al-Gomhuria reported today.

JERUSALEM -- Kibbutz Eylon-based Eshet Eylon announced
it has signed a new agreement with Egyptian company Almajarabi
Farm involving the supply of more transportation systems for
grape-packing houses.
</P>
<P>
The latest move follows the installation of such equipment at
the Egyptian company's plant earlier this year under a
100,000-dollar agreement. Almajarabi Farm would purchase three
more systems from Eshet Eylon in 1997 at a cost of 250,000
dollars.
</P>

CANBERRA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Several hundred Australian
students held a peaceful rally at the University of Sydney today
to voice their opposition to the federal government's funding cut
program.
</P>
<P>
The rally drew a number of protest groups including the
National Union of Students (NUS), National Tertiary Education
Union (NTEU) and Adult Migrant English Service Teachers
Association, the Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
New South Wales President of the NUS, John Nolan-Neylan said at
the rally that voters must tell the government that the funding
cuts in education and some other areas were not acceptable in a
civilized society.
</P>
<P>
Talking about Friday's event in which Prime Minister John
Howard was besieged by student protesters when he attended a
ceremony at the University of Sydney, a spokesman for the NTEU
said Howard had no right to "show his face" on university grounds
following the cuts and broken promises he has made to higher
education.
</P>
<P>
"The government has betrayed staff and students on all campuses
by breaking its promise not to slash universities' operating
grants and not to increase the level of Higher Education
Contribution Scheme fees for students," he said.

LONDON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke
warned Tory candidates on Friday that opposing a single
European currency in their general election addresses would
"give comfort to their enemies."
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- After official figures showed on Friday that economic growth
in the UK has accelerated to its fastest rate since 1994, Eddie
George, governor of the Bank of England, is expected to step up
his call for higher interest rates next week.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- At least 12 more jails will be needed to accommodate
the increased prison population expected to follow tough
sentencing laws announced on Friday by British Home
Secretary Michael Howard. The cost of building and running
them is likely to reach three billion pounds (about 4.5
billion U.S. dollars) but will be spread over many years.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- Scottish nationalists on Friday called for an
independent inquiry into safety at the Dounreay nuclear
plant amid allegations that radioactive chemicals have been
dumped in the sea.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Fears of a looming teacher shortage have prompted the
Government to clamp down on the flood of early retirement
deals for burnt-out staff. Tighter rules on ill health
retirement packages, which have more than doubled since

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Yeltsin Tries to End Fighting Within Kremlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 26 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin, who is
preparing for next month's heart surgery, on Friday made clear he
planned to stay in office for his full four-year term and urged
Russian politicians to stop fighting for power.
</P>
<P>
In a radio address to the nation, Yeltsin said that after the
June presidential election Russia has made its choice for the next
four years, and it is time to cool off from the election race.
</P>
<P>
There have been enough struggles for influence, for posts, and
it is time to work, the president added in the address which was
clearly designed to show that he is still in control of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here also noticed that Yeltsin's address came after
the increasing power struggles in the Kremlin spilled out into the
public last week when Interior Minister Anatoly Kuliov accused
national security chief Alexander Lebed of planning a military
coup.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin sacked Lebed, who scornfully denied Kuliov's
accusation, from the posts of security council secretary,
presidential national security adviser and presidential special
envoy in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
In three months, Chubais, the 41-year-old former first deputy
prime minister in charge of privatization, has succeeded in
collecting enormous power in his hands.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, for his part, said earlier this week that Chubais was
behind his dismissal.
</P>
<P>
"He was the only person who can have access to the president.
He is the person who has created isolation of not only me but also
other state figures from the president," Lebed complained.
</P>
<P>
He even predicted that Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin would
be the next victim of Chubais' ambition. The cabinet chief would
be sacked by the middle of November, he said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Kommersant shared his view by saying in a report
that Chernomyrdin, to whom Yeltsin has given control over the
"power ministries" while he is hospitalized, may be unseated among
the country's growing financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a report in the Moscow Times said on Friday that
Chernomyrdin seemed reluctant to be seen seeking the limelight.
</P>
<P>
But few doubt that the premier is deeply embroiled in Kremlin
intrigues, and he may be seeking allies, the report said, adding
that relations between Chernomyrdin and the Communist opposition
seemed to be warming up.
</P>
<P>
The communists and their allies occupy over half of the seats
in the State Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda on
Tuesday, former chief of presidential administration Nikolai
Yegorov also accused his successor, Chubais, of hiding evidence
about Yeltsin's ill health.
</P>
<P>
Yegorov, along with his close associates, former top
presidential bodyguard Alexander Korzhakov and former First Deputy
Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, was ousted from the Kremlin after
Korzhakov failed a power struggle with Chubais during the period
between the first and second rounds of this summer's presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
Chubais' friendship with Yeltsin's 36-year-old daughter Tatyana
Dyachenko was the only reason for Chubais to win so much power,
Yegorov said, adding that Dyachenko is the "the only person
Yeltsin listens to."
</P>
<P>
According to Yegorov, Dyachenko, the young mother of two,
played an important role in her father's campaign team in the
just-concluded presidential election, and the role, Yegorov noted,
was to talk the president into doing Chubais' bidding.
</P>
<P>
The already powerful Chubais received a boost earlier this week
when Yeltsin asked the Kremlin chief of staff to deputize him in a
new consultative body which is to comprise the president, the
prime minister and the heads of both houses of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The "Big Four" group is to run Russia while Yeltsin is
recovering from his heart problem.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who continues his stay in the Barvikha spa near
Moscow, vowed to secure an agreement between Russia's power
structures.
</P>
<P>
"We must stop dividing ourselves into red and white, us and
them," Yeltsin said, threatening to fire those officials who
continue the power struggle in or outside the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his call for everyone -- parliament, the
government, the presidential administration, regional leaders and
representatives of various political parties and social movements
-- to work together and to make people's life better.

<P>
OHRID, Macedonia, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The first stage of a
multinational military exercise, code-named "Rescuer 96,"
concluded here today in southern Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The six-day exercise, jointly organized by Macedonia and the
United States, is the first held on the territory of Macedonia
since the country joined NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP)
program in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
Another three NATO member states -- Italy, Turkey and Greece --
and four PfP member states -- Albania, Slovenia, Bulgaria and
Romania -- participated in the maneuver which focused on
earthquake rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation duing the exercise would help enhance trust among
countries in southern Balkan, said Trajce Krestevski, chief of the
general staff of Macedonian army.
</P>
<P>
He also made clear Macedonia's hope for the admission into a
European security system, especially the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).

The second stage of the exercise is expected to be held in the

PARIS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The people in France will have one more hour to sleep this
weekend by turning back the time by 60 minutes at three o'clock
Sunday morning. Since its establishment 20 years ago, the
daylight saving time system in Europe no longer has unanimous
support among European countries due to economic, medical and
ecological reasons, with France deciding to return to the natural
time system first.
</P>
<P>
-- Since her return to power in 1993, Pakistani Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto has never met a situation as risky as it is now.
The League of Muslim led by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif,
the main opposition party of Pakistan, will organize a nationwide
industrial and commercial strike today to protest the falling of
the national economy and the raising of taxes by the government in
its 1997 budget plan.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The tour of the Middle East by Jacques Chirac which ended
Friday marked the difficult return of France to this region which is
dominated by the United States, as well as a lack of unity among
European Union members over a common stand on the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who failed to persuade his European partners to accept
his idea of "co-sponsorship" by Europe and the United States for
Middle East peace, repeated in Beirut on Friday that he was
bringing "extra confidence which is the most needed" for the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
-- French cattle farmers Friday staged a protest named "Dead
Massif Central" in the Massif Central -- the mountain range in
Central France, to call for the awareness of the loss inflicted on
them by the mad cow crisis. The protest was staged on the eve of
the holding of the European Union Agriculture Minister's meeting
in Luxembourg early next week.

ISLAMABAD, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Kabul International
Airport, less than one kilometer from the Afghan capital, was

a.m. (local time) today.
</P>

<P>
Dostum had joined his troops with the ousted government forces
led by Ahmad Shah Masood against the Taliban near Kabul.

<HEADLINE>   Philippine Banks Unable to Corner Remittances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine commercial banks have
not been able to corner the remittances of overseas Filipinos,
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said here today.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that only 58 percent of remittances of
overseas Filipinos are coursed through banks while 42 percent
still go through door-to-door couriers.
</P>
<P>
Remittances by overseas Filipinos are projected to amount to 7
billion U.S. dollars this year, a 42-percent increase over the 4.9
billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The 7 billion dollar projection is based on the remittances of
3.479 billion dollars in the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Singson said the use of door-to-door couriers prevents the
government from accurately monitoring the inflow of remittances
even though the funds pass through the banking system.
</P>
<P>
Because remittances through door-to-door couriers are posted as
foreign currency deposits, such inflows are logged in the errors
and omissions column of the balance of payments, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to government estimates, there are at least 4.2
million overseas Filipino workers earning 18 billion dollars
annually, and about 50 percent of their earnings are sent back.
</P>
<P>
Singson urged commercial banks in the country to take actions
to attract remittances by overseas Filipinos.

<HEADLINE> Iran Responses Coldly to U.S. Call for Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government has made
a cold response to U.S. government's call for a dialogue with
Tehran, describing U.S. words and deeds as different.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Vaezi, deputy foreign minister for Europe and
American Affairs, said: "The recent U.S. statement regarding a
dialogue with Iran does not coincide with Washington's policies
and actions so far."
</P>
<P>
He was responding to the remarks by U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State Robert Pelletreau, who said in Dubai, the United Arab
Emirate, Thursday that he was hopeful the United States would
begin a dialogue with Iran within the next four years to mend the
strained ties between the two countries if U.S. President Bill
Clinton is re-elected in November.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, U.S. State Department spokesman NIcholas Burns
reaffirmed that Washington has long-standing willingness to begin
a dialogue with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Vaezi's response came out today on the front page of Iran's
official daily Iran.
</P>
<P>
He accused the United States of pursuing a hostile policy
toward Iran, believing Pelletreau's statement does not tally with
U.S. actions.
</P>
<P>
Referring to U.S. sanctions and policy designed to contain the
Islamic state, he said: "Naturally, if the Americans consider
this region's realities, they will realize that a revision is
in order. But we have as yet seen no sign of such U.S. policy
changes that would indicate any sincerity on their part."
</P>
<P>
"If Washington learns and understands the realities and the
true nature of Iran's Islamic revolution and decides to deal with
Iran on the basis of mutual and equal respect, then, and only
then we can say that America's words and deeds are one and the
same," the Iranian official added.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the rapprochement between Iran and
the United States seemed impossible in the next few years since
the two countries are very hostile to each other and there is no
fundamental change in each other's policy.
</P>
<P>
The United States accuses Iran of supporting and sponsoring
terrorism, even threatened to launch military strikes against
Iranian targets in addition to stepped-up sanctions.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani called the
United States "a wolf playing shepherd's role" in the region.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said Wednesday that Iran
had no favorites in the U.S. presidential race. "Both parties
have demonstrated their stance toward Iran over the years.
Therefore, it makes no difference to Iran whichever party
wins in the elections," he added.
</P>
<P>
Vaezi asserted that due to the failure of its policies in the
Middle East, including the crises in Iraq and Afghanistan as well
as political changes in Russia, Washington has reached the
conclusion that Iran's regional role can no longer be ignored.
</P>
<P>
On the stalled Arab-Israeli peace process, the Iranian
official said: "It has also been proven in practice that
Iran was right in saying all along that a one-sided unjust peace
between the Arabs and the Zionists is doomed to failure."

<HEADLINE> Three Aerial Cables Set Up on Famous Tourist Attraction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JI'NAN, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Three aerial cables, which can
carry 7.65 million tourists a year, have been built on China's
Mount Tai, the famous mountain in east China's Shandong province.
</P>
<P>
The first cable car system, from Zhongtianmen (half-way gate
to heaven) to Nantianmen (south gate to heaven), has carried some
12.8 million tourists, since its was put into use 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Passengers can reach the top of the mountain within seven
minutes by cable, without having to climb the 3,000 stairs on the
"shibapan (eighteen bands)."
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, two more aerial cables, with the main facilities
imported from Austria, were built at the northern foot of the
mountain, making it more convenient for tourists.
</P>
<P>
With an elevation of 1,545 meters above sea level, Mount Tai
has attracted tens of thousands of tourists from home and overseas
each year. Many disabled tourists can now easily get to the top of
the mountain by the aerial cables.

<HEADLINE> WFP Warns of Looming Food Crisis in Eastern Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program
(WFP) warned today that a cut-off in humanitarian supplies caused
by intensified fighting and the worsening security situation in
eastern Zaire could result in a major hunger crisis.
</P>
<P>
The food crisis will affect over one million Rwandan and
Burundian refugees, the WFP added in a press release issued here
today.
</P>
<P>
WFP chief spokesman Trevor Rowe said: "Unless supply lines to
the refugee camps are opened immediately, the humanitarian
consequences in coming weeks could be devastating."
</P>
<P>
"We appeal to the international community to exert maximum
pressure to ensure the free movement of humanitarian relief,"
Rowe stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the WFP has the capacity to
deliver food stocks from neighboring Uganda and Tanzania for the
refugees in eastern Zaire for the next two months.
</P>
<P>
However, delivering the food to the camps has become virtually
impossible because of worsening security conditions, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Until we can move the food into eastern Zaire, we face a
situation that is daily growing more tense and more desperate,"
Rowe said, adding that "the situation is made more difficult by
the fact thousands of refugees are now on the move and we are
unable to reach them."
</P>
<P>
Since the weekend, 75 WFP trucks with more than 2,200 metric
tons of food destined for Goma and Bukayu have been halted at the
Zaire/ Uganda border for security reasons by Zairean authorities.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the WFP is monitoring the situation closely
in cooperation with other aid agencies.
</P>
<P>
The WFP is the largest international food agency. Last year it
fed more than 50 million people, including half of the world's
refugees and internally displaced people.

YANTAI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Life in the east China coastal
city of Yantai goes on and on and on.
</P>
<P>
A survey of the Shandong province city has revealed that there
are at least 56 people who have passed their 100th birthdays.
</P>
<P>
A committee in charge of the elderly ordered the survey to
discover the number of old people in local communities.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted in 12 counties and districts in Yantai,
found 56 elders above 100 years old. Only 11 are male, while the
other 45 are female, a four-to-one ration.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 29 of the 56 centenarians are 100 years
old, 25 are between 101 and 105, one is 106, and the oldest is 107.
</P>
<P>
The investigators said the actual number of people with ages
running into three numbers may be larger, because the survey was
not conducted among all the elderly people in the city.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, four
censuses of population have been conducted in Yantai. The 1990
survey discovered only 23 people above 100 years old.
</P>
<P>
The investigators also said the increase in the number of
long-life people in number is related to the improvement in living
standard and medical care facilities.
</P>
<P>
Yantai currently has a population of more than 6.3 million.

<HEADLINE> One More Province Reports Good Autumn Grain Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Hebei, one of China's
grain-producing provinces, has reaped a good autumn grain harvest
despite of floods, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the province's grain output is about the
same or somewhat lower than last year's record output of 16.7
billion kilograms.
</P>
<P>
A provincial official attributed the good harvest to the
government's increase of grain purchase prices, which has
stimulated farmers' enthusiasm for farming.
</P>
<P>
Other major Chinese grain-producing provinces have reported
good autumn harvests, such as Shandong, Zhejiang, Liaoning,
Jiangsu, Ningxia, Jilin, Gansu and Shaanxi, according to earlier
reports.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urged to Ensure Peace in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has the
responsibility of preserving global peace, especially in Africa,
a Zimbabwean minister said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony to mark the end of a two-week Southern Africa
Development Community (SADC) peace-keeping course held at the
Zimbabwe Staff College in Harare, Foreign Affairs Minister Stan
Mudenge said the u.n. still had the mandate to enforce peace in
the world including Africa.
</P>
<P>
Besides military officers from within the region, the course
also had participants from Uganda, Ghana and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has in the past been blamed for slow reaction when it
comes to problems afflicting African countries, yet the world
body is quick to attend to problems in the west.
</P>
<P>
"It is our view that the United Nations is the only
organization which is uniquely charged with the global mandate to
maintain international peace and security, and this means
therefore that regional peace efforts can only compliment and not
substitute for the leading role of the united nations," said
Mudenge.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern over the delay in achieving total peace
in Angola where the former rebel UNITA had promised to comply to
the Lusaka accord of 1994.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the long drawn conflict in Angola was a
threat to the stability and economic development of southern
Africa.

<HEADLINE> S. African Rand Drops to Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's local
currency Rand yesterday plunged to a record low of 4.6620 against
the Dollar in the financial market, a local daily "The Citizen"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The market was reacting to downbeat comments by South African
Reserve Bank (SARB) Governor Chris Stals on the possiblity of
further tightening monetary policy if there was no slowdown in
money supply, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an investment conference in Johannesburg on Friday,
Stals said the SARB would be prepared to further raise interest
rates should the credit extended to the private sector and money
supply continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
Stals said the SARB was under no pressure from the government to
give up its present policy of gradually relaxing the remaining
exchange controls.
</P>
<P>
Stals's remarks took its roll on the government bond market to
its lowest level in nearly five months and prompted heavy
speculative selling of the currency, particularly by foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
The SARB stepped in around midday to steady the Rand, but it
remained on the ropes, touching a low of 4.6150/6200 against the
Dollar from 4.5840/5890 one day before.
</P>
<P>
The Rand has lost more than 25 percent of its values against
the Dollar since mid-February, and some 20 percent versus a
basket of currencies of South Africa's major trading partners.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on CPO, Rubber &AMP; Tin Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 in Malaysia
</P>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's crude palm
oil (CPO), rubber and tin markets closed the week mixed with CPO
unchanged, rubber mixed and tin higher.
</P>
<P>
The CPO physicals price for October South closed the week
unchanged at 1,145 ringgit (about 458 U.S. dollars) per ton, as
players were sidelined ahead of the release of the October 1-25
exports data.
</P>
<P>
Players also awaited the 1997 national budget proposals to see
whether there would be any new development in the palm oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
The crude palm oil physical opened the week lower at 1,130
ringgit (about 452 dollars) per ton following unfavorable stock
figure for October released by private forecaster Ivan Wong which
estimated the figure at 965,000 tons compared with Palm Oil
Registration and Licensing Authority (PORLA)'s revised stock of
894,030 tons registered for the end of September.
</P>
<P>
The market, however, rebounded in the middle of the week at
1,140 ringgit (about 456 dollars) per ton on technical covering
activities and the upward trend continued toward the weekend
following reports that China bought 20,000 tons of palm oil for
November shipment and on news that Pakistan will issue a fresh
tender.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian rubber market closed mixed for the week amidst
the absence of fresh leads and poor market sentiment with November
RSS One dropping 1.5 sen to close at 308.5 sen (about 123.4 U.S.
cents) per kg from 310 sen (about 124 cents) per kg and SMR 20
rising 0.5 sen to 307 sen (about 122.8 cents) per kg from 306.5
sen the previous close.
</P>
<P>
The weak performance of the Singapore and Tokyo rubber futures
also dampened market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
However, price on the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) ended the
week higher on strong buying interest.
</P>
<P>
The metal closed at 14.75 ringgit (about 5.9 dollars) per kg,
13 sen higher compared with last week's close of 14.62 ringgit
(about 5.85 dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The week's accumulated turnover rose to 405 lots from 376 lots
the previous week with mostly European, Japanese and local buyers.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh's Tourist Capital, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
And this is Cox's Bazar, the tourist capital of Bangladesh.
Located in the country's southeast, it is 414 kilometers from the
capital, Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Boasting the world's longest, 120-kilometer unbroken beach,
which slopes gently down to the blue waters of the Bay of Bengal
against the picturesque background of a chain of hills covered
with deep green forests, Cox's Bazar is one of the most attractive
tourist spots in the country.
</P>
<P>
Miles of golden sands, towering cliffs, surfing waves, rare
conch shells, colorful pagodas, Buddhist temples and tribes and
delightful sea have made the small market town the Bangladeshi
Riviera.
</P>
<P>
Besides the most attractive sea beach, other main attractions
in Cox's Bazar include the Sonadia Island and Teknaf, which are
distinguished by their respective charms.
</P>
<P>
Only seven kilometers away from Cox's Bazar city, the Sonadia
Island with about 2,000 inhabitants is attractive for its wide
virgin sand beaches with a shark-free sea, which is good for
bathing and swimming.
</P>
<P>
As the southernmost tip of Bangladesh, Teknaf is a tourist spot
on the river Naf at its estuary, which is 85 kilometers away from
Cox's Bazar city. The wide open flat beach, the low hill range of
Arakan across the river Naf in Myanmar in the distance and the
sleepy villages nearby have made Teknaf an ideal place for
leave-me-alone leisurely type of tourism.
</P>
<P>
But the infrastructure in the tourist capital leaves much to be
desired. For example, it takes at least four hours for tourists to
get to Teknaf by bus along a pockmarked and bumpy road from
Chittagong, the country's largest sea port which is only about 152
kilometers away from Cox's Bazar.
</P>
<P>
The city of Cox's Bazar itself appears dirty and messy and like
in many other Bangladeshi cities and towns, rickshaws and
auto-rickshaws rush around at high speed along the bumpy streets
and kiosks on both sides of the streets seem in want of a good
scrub. When night falls, the city is enveloped in darkness.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it (the city) is poor, the big problem is money," a hotel
manager admitted. "But, don't you think there is great potential
for the development of the tourist capital? Don't you think the
sea beach here is fascinating?"
</P>
<P>
In fact, the problem has drawn attention from the government,
which is trying to make Cox's Bazar more attractive. The road
between Chittagon and Cox's Bazar is being repaired or built.
Construction of hotels, motels and cottages with modern
facilities, indoor and outdoor sporting facilities including
modern golf facilities, a typical tribal village and health and
night clubs is under consideration.
</P>
<P>
"But tourism is closely connected with investment. We have
appealed to all investors, both domestic and overseas, to invest
in Bangladeshi tourism," an official of the state-run Bangladesh
Tourism Corporation said, pointing at a tourist handbook
explaining investment opportunities in Bangladeshi tourism.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Bangladesh is known as the poet's golden Bengal, which
evokes in people's mind meandering rivers, lush green countryside,
colorful tribal life and the world's longest unbroken sea beach,
single largest tea garden and biggest mangrove forest, which is
the home of the royal Bengal tiger.
</P>
<P>
"As long as we continue our efforts to increase investments in
tourism, Cox's Bazar can surely be developed into a tourist
capital worthy of the name," said a Bangladeshi University
student, who is looking at the setting sun while walking along the
beach in the city, full of hope.

BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Rural Beijing areas expect to
provide 210 million kilograms of Chinese cabbage for the urban
citizens in winter, today's Beijing Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
It has been a tradition for urban people in Beijing and other
northern cities to store the cheap Chinese cabbage for
consumption in winter. Though the reliance is significantly
reduced as a result of a diversified vegetable supply, the cabbage
is still the most important winter variety in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Usually, the state-run stores are mobilized to concentrate on
selling the vegetable for a few days, and this year's supply is
expected to begin on Nov. 1 and ends in Nov. 7, the Daily says.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, though the Chinese cabbage output
in Beijing expects to drop by 20 percent this year owing to
various natural calamities, the supply will be ensured since the
growing areas was increased.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Jing people, one of the
smallest ethnic groups in China, are delighted when their home
islets were linked up with the continent by a Second-grade new
highway recently.
</P>
<P>
The Wanwei, Wutou and Shanxin islets under Dongxing City in
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are the only home
to the over 10,000 Jing people in China.
</P>
<P>
An offshore dam built in the 1970s not only linked the islets
with the continent, but also provided roads for the Jing people.
</P>
<P>
With the growth of trade between the islets, which are on
the Sino-Vietnamese border, and the rest of the world, the
previous roads along the dam were too narrow to cater
to the present need.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the autonomous regional authorities, over 40
million yuan (about 4.8 million US dollars) of funds were raised,
enabling the building of a 15.6-kilometer-long highway linking the
islets with Jiangping Township of Dongxing in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the highway, it now takes only over three hours for
the Jing people to transport goods to Nanning, the regional
capital.

<HEADLINE> Samsung of S. Korea Develops New Computer Memory Device </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Samsung Electronics Corporation
based in South Korea has developed a computer memory device that
combines the high capacity of dynamic random access memory (DRAM)
chips with the high speed of synchronous DRAMs.
</P>
<P>
The new device, known as ferroelectric random access memory
(FRAM), could replace DRAM devices in personal computers (PCs) and
serve as a key part in the in-operation data storage and
processing of the machines.
</P>
<P>
Like flash memory cards, or plug-in memory devices bearing the
size of a credit card, FRAM preserves data even after power
switch-off, thus having all the positive characteristics of
existing chips, said a Samsung official here today.
</P>
<P>
The FRAM chips incorporate capacitors and transistors, which
enable them to realize the data processing capacity of DRAMs and
the data preserving characteristics of flash memory cards.
</P>
<P>
"Unlike the DRAM, the FRAM does not require the periodical
injection of electric current to preserve data and thus consume
less electric power," the Samsung researcher explained.
</P>
<P>
Ramtron, a U.S. firm, has already been successful in
commercializing the FRAM, while leading Japanese manufacturers
like NEC and Hitachi are also briskly engaging in the development
of the new memory device.
</P>
<P>
However, the official said, unlike the Ramtron device, which
uses a combination of two transistors and two capacitors, Samsung
is the world's first to use only one transistor and one capacitor
for the same functioning.

<HEADLINE> Sino-US Memorandum On Family Planning Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- China's Family Planning
Commission signed a understanding memorandum about cooperation in
scientific research of family planning with the US Pharmacia &AMP;
Upjohn Co. Friday at the Beijing-based Shangri-La Hotel.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at expanding the cooperation in scientific
research, education, product and marketing in family planning
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn started cooperation with China as early as
the late 1980s. In 1993, it built a joint venture in China and
introduced the contraceptive injection, Depo-Provera, which is the
most popular contraceptive injection in the world, and was
approved by the US FDA and the China's Ministry of Public
Health. The trial use of the injection in China began in the late
1995 and now is still going on.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, FPC vice-minister Peng Yu said as
China has the biggest population in the world and the increase of
population in the country has now a directly influence on the
improvement of people's life, it is necessary to practice family
planning and effective and safe contraceptives are the objective
her commission has pursued for a long time.
</P>
<P>
She expressed her satisfaction with the signing of a
understanding memorandum, saying that both parties are able to
enhance cooperation in the field and be active in exploring
contraceptive methods with Chinese characteristics and providing
contraceptives of the best quality for Chinese women.
</P>
<P>
Lars Birgerson, vice-president of women's health product of the
US Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, said that China's Family Planning
Commission is not only the largest, but also the most advanced
organization in family planning in the world. His company plans to
invest 100 million US dollars to develop new contraceptives with
this organization.
</P>
<P>
He said the signing of the understanding memorandum will
further promote cooperation in the field between the two sides. At
the signing ceremony, he donated the FPC with 5,000 Depo-Provera,
expressing his hope that the contraceptive provides a new choice
for the Chinese women.

<HEADLINE> SKorean Prosecution Seeks Arrest Warrant for Ex-Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean prosecution
today sought an arrest warrant for former Defense Minister Lee
Yang-ho on graft charges.
</P>
<P>
Lee, 59, is charged with accepting 187,000 U.S. dollars in
bribes from Daewoo Heavy Industries Company through an arms dealer
in April last year regarding an army light helicopter project.
</P>
<P>
"Lee admitted last night that he received a bag containing
187,000 U.S. dollars through the arms dealer, Kwon Pyong-ho. He
also confessed that the money was provided by Daewoo which asked
for a state license to participate in the arms buildup program," a
prosecutor said here.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution is also considering charging Lee with leaking
secrets while in office by writing a memo in English regarding the
Defense Ministry's plan to purchase F-16 fighter automatic
inspection equipment. Lee allegedly gave the memo to Kwon.
</P>
<P>
However, the prosecution failed to prove the allegation that
Lee received an additional 1.62 million dollars from Daewoo in
November last year.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution today also sought arrest warrant for Sok
Jin-cho, former president of Daewoo Heavy Industries Company, on
charges of giving bribes to the ex-defense minister.
</P>
<P>
The bribery scandal involving Lee was exposed by the main
opposition National Congress for New Politics (NCNP), tipped by
Kwon, on October 17, hours after Lee was relieved of his
ministerial post.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Shares on Malaysia's Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) market closed slightly lower this
week as players took to the sidelines towards the end of the week
amid the announcement of the next year's national budget.
</P>
<P>
The Composite Index (CI) shed 2.65 points to 1,172.95 this
week, the EMAS Index gained 1.20 points to 338.78 while the

</P>
<P>
During the week, the second-board index touched a new high of

</P>
<P>
The absence of the much envisaged cut in corporate tax in the

described a disappointment to many involved in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
Players had been active in the market early in the week on
expectations of a friendly Budget with interest on stocks of
selected industries such as information technology, shipping and
transportation which tend to benefit from concessions from the
budget.
</P>
<P>
While bluechips saw thin interest which restricted the movement
of the CI to a very tight range, second-boarders continued to lead
the trade with focus on laggards, especially those within the five
to 10 ringgit pricing range.
</P>
<P>
On the market, the main board volume this week was 741.420
million shares worth 5.194 billion ringgit (about 2.0776 billion
US dollars) compared with 674.189 million shares valued at 5.005
billion ringgit (2.002 billion dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
The second board turnover stood at 587.186 million shares
valued at 6.417 billion ringgit (2.5668 billion dollars) against
511.908 million shares worth 5.927 billion ringgit (2.3708 billion
dollars) previously.
</P>
<P>
Off market deals amounted to 82.987 million shares worth
605.597 million ringgit (242.2388 million dollars) compared with
97.356 million shares valued at 931.469 million ringgit (372.5876
million dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
Only one counter, Johor Port BHd, made its debut on the main
board on Friday with an impressive premium over its offer price of
2.30 ringgit (92 US cents) before ending the week at 4.94 ringgit
(1.97 dollars).

<HEADLINE> Latin America Again Condemns Helms-Burton Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Latin American Council,
the supreme organ of the Latin American Economic System (SELA),
reaffirmed today its rejection of the Helms-Burton law of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The council adopted the position at a regular meeting which
ended here today.
</P>
<P>
The council said the U.S. legislation ignored the principle of
respect for the sovereignty of other states and violated the
coexistence norms among states.
</P>
<P>
This law meant to impose unilateral sanctions with an
extraterritorial character and constituted a flagrant violation of
international law and of the principles and norms governing
international trade, a statement of the council said.
</P>
<P>
The council urged Washington to nullify the so-called
"Helms-Burton Act" and immediately lift its decades-old economic
blockade against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The council also asked the permanent secretariat of the SELA to
follow and report the development of the issue.
</P>
<P>
The SELA, which groups 27 Latin American countries, aimed to
coordinate trade policies of the Latin American countries and to
promote economic integration in the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, October 25 (Xinhua) -- A meeting of the Council of
the Latin American Economic System (SELA) was closed here today,
adopting a working agenda for 1997 and a condemnation of the
U.S. Helms-Burton law.
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the meeting agreed to restructure and modernize
the organization to make it adaptable to today's world.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to make the World Trade Organization meeting
scheduled for December in Singapore to concentrate on the
implementation of the commitments that member countries have made
in the Uruguay Round talks.
</P>
<P>
The meeting evaluated the SELA's role in trade and pointed out
that it was a valuable instrument of support for its member
countries in multilateral trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The participants also decided to strengthen links with Central
America and to enhance cooperation with other regional
institutions, such as the Latin American Integration Association.
</P>
<P>
The meeting mandated the SELA secretariat to start talks with
several countries for their possible membership in the
organization.
</P>
<P>
Those countries include Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, the
Dominican Republic, St Cristobal and Nevis, St Lucia, and St
Vincent and the Grenadines.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also adopted a resolution to condemn the
U.S. blockade and the Helms-Burton law against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Washington imposed economic sanctions on the Caribbean island
in the 1960s. Recently it implemented the so-called Helms-Burton
Act to punish foreign companies that do business with Cuba after
the Cuban Air Force downed two light planes piloted by U.S-based
anti-Cuban groups.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Develop Traditional Handicrafts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A five-day exhibition of
handicrafts started to be held here on Thursday in a bid to foster
Sri Lanka's traditional handicrafts representing the nation's
cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua on Friday, Director of the National
Crafts Council J. Jayasundara said that the NCC organized the
exhibition as an important measure to preserve and develop Sri
Lanka's national traditional handicrafts.
</P>
<P>
Handicrafts have existed in Sri Lanka for many centuries dating
back to the pre-historic era.
</P>
<P>
Specific skills of Sri Lankan craftsmen have been passed down
from generation to generation and most of them are proud of their
family traditions and maintain technical secrets of their
professions which are shared only by family members, the director
said.
</P>
<P>
Handicrafts have always been recognized as an important part of
Sri Lanka's society as they represent the culture of their
forefathers.
</P>
<P>
Jayasundara noted that the industry has been badly affected due
to the decrease of tourist arrivals which has visibly affected all
those employed as craftsmen and reduced their earning capacities
considerably.
</P>
<P>
He said that the NCC had always encouraged the craftsmen to
improve quality of their products in order to make them being
competitive both on the domestic and export markets.
</P>
<P>
The NCC organizes the national handicrafts exhibition annually.
 The winners in each category of handicraft from the exhibition
will receive presidential awards at a ceremony to be held in
November this year.

<HEADLINE> WFP to Airlift Food to Eastern Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ROME, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. World Food Program (WFP)
will airlift food to eastern Zaire this weekend to support
on-going relief operations in the strife-torn region.
</P>
<P>
A WFP-chartered C-130 transport plane, which is scheduled to
arrive in Entebbe in Uganda on Saturday, will take essential
supplies to Bukavu and Goma in eastern Zaire, the Rome-based
agency said in a news release today.
</P>
<P>
"The limited airlift has been prompted because supply routes
from the north and south to refugee camps in Goma and Bukavu
remain closed due to mounting fighting in the area," it said.
</P>
<P>
The world biggest food aid agency said it was also discussing
with other agencies the possibility of transporting relief items
such as fuel and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Due to the closure of northern axis to all commercial and
humanitarian traffic, some 75 WFP trucks, loaded with over 2,000
tons of food, remained blocked at the Zaire and Uganda border and
were unable to go to Goma, where about 517,000 refugees were held
up in three camps.
</P>
<P>
The WFP was continuing talks with the Zairian government on
possible shipment of aid by land, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Security conditions were worsening and tensions were rising
at Bukavu amid fears of an impending rebel attack, it said.
</P>
<P>
In view of the possible major influx of refugees into Bukavu,
the WFP has begun to reduce food rations to individuals by half to
extend supplies to as many people as possible. However, it had six
days of supplies left.
</P>
<P>
Reports say some 40,000 refugees are moving from camps south
of Bukavu town and additionally, 40,000 refugees from Uvira camps
and some 20,000 Zairian nationals are heading for the refugee
camps west of Bukavu.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Zaire has been set to explode in ethnic violence since
genocide and civil war in Rwanda in 1994 sent more than a million
Hutu refugees streaming in, stoking local rivalries.
</P>
<P>
But fighting had widened in the last six weeks since Zairian
troops reportedly joined ethnic clashes between native Zairians
and Tutsis, who have lived in Zaire for generations and are known
as Banyamulenge.

<HEADLINE> Group Said to Plot Ramos Assassination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A vigilante group in the
southern Philippines is reportedly plotting to assassinate
President Fidel Ramos and other government officials who supported
the creation of the Southern Philippines Council for Peace and
Development (SPCPD).
</P>
<P>
The National Intelligence Coordinating Agency was quoted today
by the Manila Chronicle as saying that although the reports are
yet to be verified, it is better for those the group had marked
for killing to take necessary precaution.
</P>
<P>
The group, identified as Kusog Kristiano Kamindanawan (KKK)
with some 200 armed regulars, is said to have vowed to assassinate
those who are responsible for what they called "Islamization of
Mindanao" by supporting the establishment of the SPCPD.
</P>
<P>
On the KKK's list are President Fidel Ramos, Governor Nur
Misuari of the autonomous region in Muslim Mindanao, Senate
President Ernesto Maceda, Speaker Jose de Venecia, Executive
Secretary Ruben Torres and Armed Forces Chief of Staff General
Arturo Enrile.
</P>
<P>
The creation of the SPCPD is an important part of the peace
agreement signed last month by the government and the Moro
National Liberation Front (MNLF). Ramos had appointed Misuari as
chairman of the council which will oversee special projects of the
government in 14 provinces and nine cities in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
However, the proposed SPCPD gave rise to widespread opposition
among the residents, especially the Christian majority in
Mindanao. Dozens of vigilante groups have reportedly been set up
in the area immediately after the agreement was signed.
</P>
<P>
The peace agreement was also opposed by other rebel groups like
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in the country. The groups,
which seek Muslim independence in Mindanao, have often clashed
with government troops in the southern part of the country.

<HEADLINE> China Urged to Develop Direct Financing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- China should attach greater
importance to direct financing instruments to promote development
of the capital market and improve capital efficiency, a Chinese
scholar has urged.
</P>
<P>
"There are still too few direct financing channels in China and
the size of direct financing is still too small," Li Yang,
director of the Financial Research Center of the Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences told Xinhua Friday.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that indirect financing, like bank
loans, accounts for 90 percent of China's capital operation and
direct financing, like stocks and corporate bonds, makes up only
ten percent.
</P>
<P>
Stock capitalization, a major gauge of direct financing, is
less than ten percent of China's gross domestic product, far below
the rates in developed countries and rising economies, statistics
show.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that indirect financing plays an important role in
ensuring the effectiveness of macro economic control and
guaranteeing funding for key construction projects.
</P>
<P>
But indirect financing has added enterprises' interest payment
burden and made them excessively dependent on banks, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
This, in turn, has harmed the efforts of state-owned banks to
turn themselves into real commercial entities and resulted in an
irrational capital distribution mechanism and poor capital
efficiency, they said.
</P>
<P>
Official sources have said that the asset-to-liability ratio of
state-owned industrial enterprises is as high as 70 percent, and
overdue, bad and dead loans account for 20 percent of the total
lendings of the four state-owned banks -- the Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, the Bank
of China and the China Construction Bank,
</P>
<P>
In the long run, indirect financing is not conducive to the
sustainable growth of enterprises, as it increases their operating
capital but fails to help build up their capital stock, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Direct financing can help relieve the financial burden of both
the enterprises and banks, he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the bank deposits outgrew lendings in both 1994
and 1995 and personal savings deposits have come to more than
three trillion yuan (about 361.4 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
"This indicates that we have abundant financial resources for
direct financing activities," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say that direct financing is a strict market
behavior without the involvement of banks as guarantors between
the investor and the fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, market rules and the social supervision system must
be improved and the use of capital raised with direct financing
instruments must be standardized, so as to prevent credit crises,
observers say.

<HEADLINE> World Champ Kong Linghui Edged out in World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- World champion and 1995 World Cup
winner Kong Linghui of China on Friday suffered a shocking exit in
the World Cup table tennis tournament in Nimes, France.
</P>
<P>
Less fancied Brazilian Hugo Hoyama, ranked 58th in the world,
came one set down to deny the world top player a quarter-final
spot with a 16-21, 21-13, 21-17 victory.
</P>
<P>
Kong, who could hardly find form after his quarter-final loss
to South Korean Kim Taek Soo in the Atlanta Olmpics, lost
composure as the Brazilian pulled off a string of forehand shots
in the later stage of the match.
</P>
<P>
With one win against two losses, Koyama failed to reach the
quarter-finals. Sweden's 1992 Olympic champion Jan-Ove Waldner
and Frenchman Patrick Chila clinched the top two spots in Group A
to qualify.
</P>
<P>
Waldner, who lost to Chila in group matches last year, took a
sweet revenge with a 21-14, 20-22, 21-17 triumph.
</P>
<P>
China's Olympic champion Liu routed New Zealand's Peter Jackson
21-15, 21-8 to get his third straight win to top Group B.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Vladimir Samsonov of Belarus, who won the
European Masters title last month, downed Zoran Primorac of
Croatia 21-19, 13-21, 21-17 to advance.
</P>
<P>
Former world number one Jean-Michael Saive of Belgium and
China's world top defender Ding Song both qualified from Group C.
</P>
<P>
Ding, who had beaten Saive and 1991 world champion Jorgen
Persson of Sweden in the 1995 world championships, nipped both of
his rivals again.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Ding edged out Persson 23-21, 21-19 in a close
game after outlasting Saive 21-10, 8-21, 21-19.
</P>
<P>
Saive defeated American Cheng Yinghua 24-22, 21-18 for a record
of two wins against one loss.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Germany's Jorg Rosskopf reached the last eight with a
16-21, 21-18, 21-10 group D victory over South Korean Kim Taek Soo
in a game reminiscent of their Olympic encounter.
</P>
<P>
In the quarter-finals of the Olympic Games, Rosskopf was fully
extended by Kim and won the deciding set just by two points.
</P>
<P>
Rosskopf went on to beat Nigerian Segun Toriola 19-21, 21-14,
21-12 for his third straight win to top the group.
</P>
<P>
France's 1994 world champion Jean-Philippe Gatien defeated
world number 142 Segun Toriola of Nigeria 21-12, 21-11, but lost
to Kim 21-18, 21-16.
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's quarter-finals, Waldner plays Kim while Vladimir
Samsonov meets Ding Song.
</P>
<P>
Rosskopf takes on Jean-Michael Saive and Patrick Chila
confronts with Liu Guoliang.

COPENHAGEN, October 25 (Xinhua) -- International Olympic
Committee (IOC) president Juan Antonio Samaranch said here on
Friday that the world sports governing body will continue the war
against performance enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
"The war against doping is not over but the IOC has won some
battles," said Samaranch during his visit to the Danish capital.
</P>
<P>
"We are both pleased and proud to have been the first and, at
the time, the only ones to lead the crusade against drugs --
starting as early as '68 in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy to see national and international federations now
joining in the IOC's combat, particularly in Seoul in 1988 where
the most important competitor in those games was disqualified --
Ben Johnson the 100m champion."

<P>
ROME, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Cagliari defender Giuseppe Pancaro
apologised to Inter Milan's Gianluca Pagliuca on Friday for
spitting in the former international goalkeeper's face during
their Italian Cup tie on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We both insulted each other, I reacted and I want to
apologise to Pagliuca for that," Pancaro told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Pancaro was sent off in the 2-2 draw after the altercation in
which the keeper appeared to butt him.
</P>
<P>
Seconds earlier Pancaro had pulled a goal back for Cagliari
with an 85th-minute penalty.
</P>
<P>
Cagliari's coach Carlo Mazzone said he had accepted Pancaro's
apology but also pointed the finger at Pagliuca.
</P>
<P>
"Both (Pancaro and Pagliuca) were guilty of poorly representing
this sport on television. I hope nothing like this happens
again," the former Roma trainer told reporters. "They are ugly
incidents that hurt soccer's image.
</P>
<P>
Pagliuca said on Friday he had been in the wrong as well.
</P>
<P>
"My reaction was definitely improper," he told reporters in
Milan. "But nothing like that had ever happened to me. I think I
would have preferred a punch in the face."

<P>
PANAMA CITY, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Panama has thanked the
United Nations for its support to an international conference on
the Panama Canal to be held September 7-10, 1997 in Panama City.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian Ambassador to the U.N. Jorge Illueca described the
U.N. support to Panama Canal Universal Congress as "positive."
</P>
<P>
He said the fundamental purpose of the congress is to do
whatever necessary to assure that the Panama Canal "continues to
be an instrument and a vital resource of international commerce,
of maritime transportation, and economic development."
</P>
<P>
The congress will provide shipping companies, port authorities,
and maritime associations of the world with "an opportunity to
examine in a detailed way the process of transition of the
interoceanic waterway," he said.
</P>
<P>
Illueca said Panamanians are interested in receiving genuine
technological training to administer the waterway after its return
to his country in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The congress was an initiative of the Panamanian government to
commemorate the 20th anniversary of the signing of the
Torrijos-Carter treaties that stipulated the return of the canal
to Panama from U.S. rule.

<HEADLINE> Young Returned Scholars Encouraged to Play Full Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Young Chinese scholars
returning from working or studying abroad can make a greater
contribution to China's economic development, today's China Daily
quotes a top official of the Western Returned Scholars Association
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jieping, Director of the Association yesterday called for
more efforts by the association to attract younger returned
scholars.
</P>
<P>
"We should focus on expanding our organization and extending
our influence among middle-aged and young returned scholars", Wu
said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, there are only 1,000 scholars aged below 45
among the association's 7,700 members, even though most scholars
who have returned in recent years are middle-aged or young.
</P>
<P>
The Association, set up in 1913, had been non-official until it
was placed under the leadership of the United Front Work
Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who is also vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, said that the change "greatly
facilitates development of overseas scholars' work."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Association acts as a bridge between the
government and overseas Chinese scholars both at home and abroad,
and has played an important role in the country's economic
development by introducing advanced foreign technology.

PANAMA CITY, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Panamanian Chiriqui
Land Company, a banana transporting enterprise, lost one million
U.S. dollars after a labor strike prevented the shipment of
250,000 boxes of bananas abroad for three days.
</P>
<P>
Company executives said some 2,000 banana laborers in 19

The labor unions called a general assembly of 75 labor
representatives to study the situation.
</P>
<P>
Panama port authorities said that a ship weighed anchor
Thursday with three empty holds, which meant that some 60,000
boxes of bananas were not loaded. Another ship bound to depart
with 200,000 boxes of bananas will cancel its trip.

SHENYANG, October 26 (Xinhua) -- When a leading Chinese
distiller offered a one-million-yuan (about 125,000 US dollars)
award for a trademark design, the deal was too good to resist and
about 30,000 designs were submitted from all over the country by
July 20, the deadline for entries.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang-based Taikong (Space) Industry Holdings Ltd. wanted a
new trademark for its new alcoholic drink that uses a kind of pure
water from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The panel of experts reduced the avalanche of designs to 100
finalists, which were shown on television, and then selected ten
of them, each of which was given 10,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
One million yuan is to be given the final winner after the
trademark is registered with the Sate Administration for Industry
and Commerce, the state's trademark authority.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts say that the unprecedented amount for a
trademark reflects the growing awareness of the value of

LONDON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Swedish international Tomas
Brolin said Friday he would return to English soccer club Leeds
and he wanted fresh talks with manager George Graham, according to
local reports.
</P>
<P>
Brolin's last meeting with his new boss broke up with the club
claiming the player did not want to return to Leeds, but now the
Swede insists he never said this.
</P>
<P>
"I never closed the door on Leeds," he told the Yorkshire
Evening Post. "You never know the wind can change direction.
</P>
<P>
"I never said I wouldn't play for Leeds again. What I did say
was that it would be hard for me to come back at the moment
because I am not fit enough to do myself or the club justice.
</P>
<P>
"I need to play football and I need to speak to Leeds again to
see if we can find a solution to this situation."

<P>
Brolin was signed by former Leeds boss Howard Wilkinson last

<HEADLINE> Genetic Method Helps Determine Fatherhood of Giant Panda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Scientists in southwest China's
Yunnan Province have developed an effective genetic technique to
determine the fatherhood of giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
Unlike traditional blood testing, scientists with the Kunming
Animal Research Institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
are able to get the answer they need, with just a lock of hair from
the animal.
</P>
<P>
The genetic method, based on hair and stool examination, will
not harm the giant pandas unlike blood testing, and will be of great
help to boost the population of giant pandas in captivity and in
the wild, according to Zhang Yaping, head of the research group.
</P>
<P>
The giant Panda has been very popular around the world, but
their life is endangered because they are too sensitive to their
living environments.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that only 1,000 pandas inhabit the three
provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan and Shaanxi, including 100 living in
zoos.
</P>
<P>
China has set aside nature reserves for the giant panda living
in the wild. For those in zoos, one female usually has more than
one male partner to increase the possibility of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
In this way, the true father of the baby panda remains
unclear. As soon as the young pandas reached adulthood and become
sexually mature, the matter is important because of the need to
avoid inbreeding.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Urges Parties to Stop Fighting in East Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council
expresses on Friday grave concern over the humanitarian emergency
in the Great Lakes region, particularly the development in east
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Council President Martinez Blanco,
appealed to all parties to urgently stop fighting and start
necessary political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
He said the council supports the idea of appointing a special
representative of the Secretary-General and the possibility of
sending high-level mission for monitoring the situation and
preparing of a peace conference in close cooperation with the
European Union and African Countries.
</P>
<P>
The council was briefed by Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali on the situation in Eastern Zaire. According to
Boutros-Ghali, there are three categories of problems.
</P>
<P>
"The first one is the war, the war is a civil war between Tutsi
and Hutu. And it moves from a civil war to a regional war," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the second one is that refugees have left their camps
and spread in the region. "And it will created new problems. We have
100,000 refugees," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And the third problem is that, because of the war, the roads
have been blocked, and you're not able to offer humanitarian
assistance to the refugees," he said.
</P>
<P>
Saying that he had sent a second mission to the region, he
expressed the hope that the Security Council may adopt a
resolution, which can help the U.N. to begin to act seriously on
the ground.

NEW YORK, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar hit a new

1994.

<HEADLINE> Christopher: Force and Diplomacy Back U.S. Interests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher said today the U.S. interests are more global
than ever and the national security requires the combination of
force and diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the West Point Military Academy, Christopher
said that foreign policy must be mixture and a seamless mesh of
both effective diplomacy and the ability to use force when
necessary.
</P>
<P>
"The lesson of time is that we must combine force and diplomacy
when our important interests are at stake," he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, "We must field and fund a world-class
military. But we must also field and fund world-class diplomacy."
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state mentioned the role of U.S. force
including that in the Gulf War against Iraq in 1991, the intensive
NATO airstrikes in Bosnia in 1995, and the U.S. deployment of
troops in various regions.
</P>
<P>
But Christopher said that funds to conduct U.S. diplomacy had
been cut to the bone and called on the new Congress taking office
in January to face up to the problem.
</P>
<P>
"Simply put, we cannot sustain our diplomacy on the cheap --
unless we want to shortchange the American people," Christopher
said. "But that is just what is happening."
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. international affairs budget had fallen
by 51 percent since 1984, and he had had to close 30 embassies and
consulates. "We have long since cut through fat to muscle and
bone. We cannot advance American interests by lowering the
American flag."
</P>
<P>
Christopher said Americans understood the need for a strong
military, but if the United States relied on armed strength alone
it would be using its military all the time at too high a cost, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that whatever the composition of the new Congress
taking office next January and no matter who was elected
president, the U.S. must renew the support for American diplomacy.

GENEVA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The International Federation of
Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies announced Friday that it will
established an air bridge to bring food and other relief goods to
refugees fleeing ethnic fighting in Uvira region of eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva-based Federation said cargo aircraft would be sent

medicines, starting from Saturday. The move is expected to last
for several days.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
Friday reported shortage of food in Bukavu area in eastern Zaire,
where 60,000 refugees and 10,000 displaced Zaireans have arrived
fleeing the intensified ethnic fighting in Uvira. Food stocks
there could only last two more weeks.
</P>
<P>
In Goma, north to Bukavu, food stocks would run out in two
days, UNHCR said.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Programme is also considering establishing an
air bridge to bring relief goods to eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Rome-based UN food agency warned that the
cut-off in humanitarian supplies due to the worsening security
situation in eastern Zaire would result in a major hunger crisis
affecting over one million refugees.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- China is calling for
greater assistance to women across the world, those in poverty in
particular.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Zhang Fengkun, a representative from the
Chinese mission to the United Nations, while speaking at a General
Assembly meeting on the follow-up action of the Fourth World
Conference on Women.
</P>
<P>
Zhang called the particular attention to the poverty issue of
women. "We must undertake the pressing task of eradicating
poverty," she said. Poverty is the one that calls for most urgent
action. Women account for two-third of the world's poor. They lack
the basic conditions for survival, she noted.
</P>
<P>
"Only when their poverty has been eradicated can we speak of
the improvement of their situation and the advancement of their
status," she added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese representative urged rich countries to make
contributions by helping the poor.
</P>
<P>
She also called the United Nations to increase its input of
human and financial resources. "When having a cake, cut a slightly
bigger piece for the advancement of women," she said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang gave an account of the efforts of the Chinese government
in the implementation of the follow-up to the women's conference.
She listed some major tasks China plans in the next few years for
the advancement of women. They including women's cultural and
technical training in poor areas, enhancing their participation in
decision-making process, further improving women's health and
perfecting law for protecting women.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. officials have met with
a senior foreign ministry official of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) at the United Nations discussing a
variety of bilateral issues, the State Department said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
But State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns would not
disclose in detail the contents of Thursday's talks between the
U.S. officials and Lee Hyong Chol, director of American affairs of
the DPRK foreign Ministry, only saying that, at U.S.-DPRK meetings
at the United Nations, the United States usually raises issues
such as U.S.-South Korea proposed peace negotiations on the Korean
Peninsula and its concerns over reports that DPRK might launch a
ballistic missile test.
</P>
<P>
He also refused to name the U.S. representatives at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
But some other U.S. officials said the two countries have
failed to make significant headway toward the U.S.-South Korea
proposed four-nation peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"They were not running around with new ideas" at the latest
meeting, one official said. "No breakthroughs at this one," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Another official said the United States used the meeting
largely to press the DPRK to free Carl Hunziker, a 26-year-old
American citizen who was arrested when entering the DPRK territory
on spy charges.
</P>
<P>
the DPRK on Thursday demanded an apology from the United States
for Hunziker's spy mission, but was rejected by Washington on the
ground that Hunziker is a missionary, not a spy.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: France Leading European Role in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 25 (Xinhua) -- France may have a real chance to
reassert its significance abreast with the U.S. on the Middle East
arena, as President Jacques Chirac wound up his high-profile
week-long sweep across the region to Arab applause that peace with
an European perspective could be in the making.
</P>
<P>
Alarmed at the snowballing peace crisis between Arabs and
Israelis, Chirac rushed to embark on his week-long tour to salvage
the faltering peace process, trying to carve out a bigger European
role in the peacemaking in the oil-rich region.
</P>
<P>
A European peace initiative in hand, Chirac assured the Arab
states within his itinerary that France is committed to the vision
developed around an exchange of land for peace.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, like his Arab neighbors,
appreciated the initiative by saying that Europe has a special
role to play in the Middle East politics.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Syrian President Hafez Assad in Damascus, Chirac
said that Europe must join Washington in sponsoring negotiations,
contributing proposals not just money, when Middle East peace has
"run out of breath."
</P>
<P>
Israel's peace talks with Syria and its ally Lebanon are at a
standstill. Israel, under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, shows
few signs of moving to accommodate Syria's demand for an Israeli
withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
But France, Syria's former colonial ruler, hopes to play a role
alongside the United States in bringing the two sides to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Israel Monday, Chirac urged the Jewish state to
accept an independent Palestinian state and return the Golan
Heights to Syria.
</P>
<P>
"A recognized Palestinian state would provide Israel with a
true partner and the security it needs," he said in a speech at the
Technion university in Israel's northern city of Haifa.
</P>
<P>
"The principle of land for peace remains the basis for any
agreement," Chirac said, urging Israel to ease the blockade of the
Palestinians, withdraw from Hebron as agreed upon, get on with the
final status talks and restart negotiations on other peace tracks.
</P>
<P>
Praising Washington's key role in peace-making, Chirac said
Europe, the biggest source of financial aid for the Palestinians,
is keen to be a third sponsor of the peace process along with
Washington and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The European Union is the biggest aid donor to the fledgling
Palestinian Authority and has strong trade ties with Israel and
the Arab world. But it has largely been left out of the peace
process, with the United States taking the lead in mediation.
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the message goes down well with all his Arab
hosts, Syria, Palestinian self-rule areas, Jordan, Lebanon and
Egypt, which in one way or another are tucked in some discord with
Israel. They expected the French participation could balance the
tilted U.S. position and reactivate the faltering peace march.
</P>
<P>
"We need you and we look up to Your Excellency president Chirac
to help us in this critical and sensitive stage," Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat told Chirac in Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
The hero's welcome and 21-gun salute accorded on Chirac by
Syria and Jordan, however, contrasted sharply with the
undiplomatic distaste even before he set foot on Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel has repeatedly rejected the idea of more peace partners
and the appointment of a EU envoy to the region.
</P>
<P>
U.S., a key ally of Israel, also opposes such a role by Europe,
saying that Europe should limit its activities to helping the
Palestinians financially.
</P>
<P>
Even Britain has reportedly rebuffed Chirac's idea as
"romantic."
</P>
<P>
Despite all the outcries, France, a time-reverenced ally of
Arabs, seems determined to get across its message.
</P>
<P>
The French diplomatic feat in brokering a ceasefire in Lebanon
in April now mirrors the futility of the U.S.-sponsored 15-day
talks to broker a deal between the Israelis and Palestinians over
the Israeli troops withdrawal from the last West Bank town of
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
So far, the negotiations seemed deadlocked due to the Israeli
push for better security guarantees for the 450 Jewish settlers
among the 100,000 Arabs in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have categorically rejected any attempt to
renegotiate the binding agreements.
</P>
<P>
With the Israeli troops redeployment from Hebron seven monthsoverdue, one que
stion remains unanswered: when will the Israelis
pull out?
</P>
<P>
After all the diplomatic shuttles, Chirac remained reservedly
upbeat. "I am an optimist in the first place, and then peace did
not run into blind alley," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thus he is holding out a hope: the French initiative may cement
the European influence and give peace a real chance in a region
torn apart by four decades of political strife and bloody
clashes.

<HEADLINE> Lilic: Yugoslavia's International Position Grows Stronger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic
said Friday that thanks to its principled policy, Yugoslavia has
succeeded in enhancing its international position despite
difficult situation in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia was rapidly restoring old economic ties and
establishing new ones throughout the world, not only with
traditionally friendly countries, but also with those which had
had a hostile attitude towards Yugoslavia until recently.
</P>
<P>
"Yugoslavia has officially established relations with 163
countries and that over 138 inter-state agreements have been
signed, and 65 countries presently have embassies in Belgrade,
with 45 of them at ambassadorial level, which is an expression of
recognition to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia," the Yugoslav
president said in a statement at the celebration of the 150th
anniversary of Negotin library in eastern Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Regarding relations with neighboring countries, Lilic said his
country wishes to develop good neighborly relations and
cooperation with all former Yugoslav republics on the basis of
partnership and common interests.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has normalized relations with three of the four
former Yugoslav republics -- Macedonia, Croatia and Bosnia, which
is a key contribution to the consolidation of peace and cooperation
in the region. Normalization of diplomatic relations with Slovenia
was also underway.
</P>
<P>
Lilic said Yugoslavia was presently promoting relations with
the European Union, considering it as a task of highest political
importance and a strategic component of its foreign policy, since
Yugoslavia is economically, culturally and civilizationally
inseparable from Europe.
</P>
<P>
"Yugoslavia wishes to promote its relations with EU as soon as
possible on the basis of its earlier status of associate member
and to initiate immediately afterwards a new phase of cooperation
at a higher level with the aim of becoming a full member in a
foreseeable future, which is in the interest of both Yugoslavia
and EU," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia also expects immediate reintegration in the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as any
further postponements would be detrimental to the acceleration of
the process of full stabilization in the Balkans, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lilic indicated that Yugoslavia was well on the way to fully
normalizing relations with the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank as it had been their member since their founding.
