<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Team to Attract More Voters to Runoff: Aide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The campaign team of Russian
President Boris Yeltsin will now focus on encouraging more
supporters to vote in the runoff elections, a senior presidential
aide said today.
</P>
<P>
Grigory Satarov, political assistant of Yeltsin, told the press
that "the maximum mobilization of voters who can vote for Yeltsin"
remains the main task for the president and his campaign team.
</P>
<P>
As the second round of presidential elections is drawing close,
both Yeltsin and his archrival, Communist Party leader Gennady
Zyuganov, are wooing supporters of other presidential candidates
who failed to make it to the one-on-one showdown.
</P>
<P>
Satarov admitted that one of the mistakes Yeltsin and his
campaign team had committed prior to Sunday's poll was expecting a
high turnout.
</P>
<P>
"We were lulled by the sociologists and there was no special
program of mobilization within the framework of our campaign,"
Satarov said. "That mistake will now be corrected."
</P>
<P>
The first round of voting did not give "complete satisfaction"
to the presidential team as only 70 percent of the more than 106
million registered voters went to cast their ballots on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The lower-than-expected turnout was believed to have helped
Zyuganov who finished a close second behind Yeltsin in the polling.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin led the first round with 35.06 percent of votes while
Zyuganov got 31.96 percent, with retired general Alexander Lebed
in the third place on 14.7 percent of votes.
</P>
<P>
Lebed has thrown his weight behind Yeltsin on Monday after he
was nominated by Yeltsin as head of the State Security Council and
presidential aide for national security.
</P>
<P>
Lebed's supporters are expected to follow the general and vote
for Yeltsin in the runoff.
</P>
<P>
The Yeltsin camp, however, would not err again by taking things
for granted.
</P>
<P>
Satarov said that though the presidential appointments are
expected to meet with the understanding on the part of voters,
more needs to be done to ensure the voters turn out to cast their
ballots.
</P>
<P>
The presidential aide said that the Yeltsin-Lebed alliance is
attractive to voters who see it as signs of "participation at the
top" and political stabilization.
</P>
<P>
Satarov predicted that Yeltsin would draw more voters in the
runoff not only because of the addition of Lebed's electorate but
also because of the attraction of the alliance to others.
</P>
<P>
But Yeltsin has little hope for attracting any of Liberal
Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky's supporters, whereas
the voters of Yabloko chief Grigory Yavlinsky largely wait for his
switch which is expected to be made public soon, local observers
say.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky was fourth in Sunday's poll with 7.41 percent of
votes while Zhirinovsky was fifth on 5.76 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some pollsters believe that Yavlinsky may turn over his
electorate to Yeltsin after some bargaining with the incumbent
president.

<HEADLINE> Greece's Tourist Industry Faces Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Greece's tourist industry, hurt
last year by a slump in visitors, is bracing itself for another
bad year.
</P>
<P>
Figures so far suggest that even fewer tourists will take their
holidays in Greece in 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Statistics Service (NSS) today, a
total of 1,645,996 hotel reservations were made nationwide in May
this year, down 12,66 percent from the corresponding figure in
1995 of 1,884,507.
</P>
<P>
In April and May this year, the NSS recorded a total of
2,692,370 overnight stays, compared to 3,114,594 in the same
two-month period of 1995, marking a drop of 13.56 percent.
</P>
<P>
The effects on Greece's already strained economy could be
immense. Last year, according to Chairman of the Union of Greek
Travel Agents Takis Antoniou, Greece lost 1 billion U.S. dollars
from the slump and cost the state millions of dollars in tax
revenue.
</P>
<P>
A total of 10,500,000 tourists visited Greece last year, down
10 percent from 1994.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict a further decline of between 10 and 12 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
They attribute the plummet to a lack of organization and
marketing abroad, poor service and increasing competitions from
other countries.

<HEADLINE> EC Proposes Reduction in Set-aside Rate of Arable Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) has
proposed to reduce the set-aside rate of arable land to 5 percent
for the 1997-98 marketing year from the present 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
If adopted by the European Council, the modification proposed
by the EC on Tuesday would allow about 1.7 million hectares of
land to be put back into arable production, which could lead to a
potential increase in cereal production of more than eight million
tons.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the proposal, European Agriculture Commissioner
Franz Fischler said that the set-aside rate is a market management
instrument that can be adjusted in either direction to take
account of market changes.
</P>
<P>
Due to complex circumstances, in particular climatic influence
inside and outside the European Union (EU), he said, cereal stocks
are declining and prices are substantially higher than the level
foreseen under the EU's Common Agriculture Policy reform decision.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, he added, it is appropriate to take action
aimed at increasing production to ensure adequate supplies at more
reasonable prices.

<HEADLINE> EC Puts Forth Vehicle Emission Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) has
agreed on standards for fuel quality and limits on car exhausts
intended to reduce road transport emissions by 70 percent by the
year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The standards, included in an Auto/Oil package, are expected to
help clean the air in cities of the 15 member countries of the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
The package was adopted late on Tuesday and included tighter
emission standards for passenger cars and quality standards for
gasoline and diesel fuels.
</P>
<P>
The standards will be in force by January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Similar standards for fuel quality and limits on car exhausts
will be worked out within 12 months for light commercial vehicles
and heavy trucks as well.
</P>
<P>
For carmakers, the package means that from 2000, new models of
cars will have to meet stricter limits on the amount of carbon
monoxide, unburnt fuel vapor, nitrogen oxides and soot which are
pumped out of their exhausts.
</P>
<P>
These gases and residue cause a range of human health hazards
and combine to form other gases which do damage to buildings and
plants.

<HEADLINE> No Early Lifting of Ban on British Beef Outside EU: Santer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) said
today that British beef exports to non-European Union (EU)
countries will not resume until the ban on beef exports to EU
members is lifted under the EC framework plan.
</P>
<P>
EC President Jacques Santer rejected a British demand to resume
beef exports to non-EU countries.
</P>
<P>
"It's an ethical problem," said Santer, referring to the fact
that it would be unfair to sell British beef to people in poorer
countries outside the EU when it was judged unfit for European
consumers.
</P>
<P>
The EC president told a press conference in Strasbourg that the
embargo on British beef exports to non-EU countries will be lifted
only when the ban is also lifted on exports to EU countries.
</P>
<P>
An early resumption of British beef exports to countries
outside the EU was the first priority of a British framework
proposal presented last week for a five-stage lifting of a global
ban on British beef imposed because of a health scare over mad cow
disease.
</P>
<P>
Santer stressed that the lifting of the ban on British beef
exports would have to be accompanied by eradication of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
EU sources said that in view of continued public wariness in
Germany, Austria and other EU member countries, a resumption of
British beef exports to EU members and non-EU countries was
unlikely for some time to come.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg is
hearing Britain's request for an interim ruling to suspend the
worldwide ban on its beef exports.

<HEADLINE> New Israeli PM Chairs First Cabinet Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu chairs this afternoon the first cabinet meeting of his
new coalition government, during which he announced the formation
of a national security council and a ministerial committee on
privatization.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Danny Naveh, new cabinet secretary,
told reporters that Netanyahu used his extended powers of the new
direct election law to move ahead the government's work quickly.
</P>
<P>
The first decision by the new premier, Naveh said, is to form a
national security council to be headed by David Ivri, who will
step down from his current post as director-general of the Defense
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also announced to the cabinet his intention to form
an economy advisory council to be headed by Ya'acov Frenkel,
governor of the Bank of Israel.
</P>
<P>
He told the cabinet that he wanted Frenkel, reportedly to be
considered by Netanyahu to become his new finance minister
earlier this week, to serve another term as the governor of the
Bank of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also formed a ministerial committee on
privatization with the participation of the prime minister, as
well as Minister of Justice Ya'acov Ne'eman and Minister of
Finance Dan Meridor.
</P>
<P>
Naveh said that Frenkel will be invited to all of the
committee meetings, adding that such a decision will be taken
officially at the cabinet's next session.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet also approved the first trip by a minister, a
trip by Transportation Minister Yitzhak Levy to Jordan on the
coming Sunday, in order to open the new line of El Al, Israel's
airline, between the Ben-Gurion Airport of Israel and the Queen
Alia Airport in Amman, capital of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Naveh said that there was no diplomatic deliberation or
security reviews at today's cabinet meeting, however, he stressed
that the redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron will be soon
decided upon by the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu decided to break the Sunday tradition to
hold cabinet meetings on Friday from now on, in order not to take
up Sunday mornings or any other days of the Sunday-Thursday work
week, and to allow the ministers to work five full days a week.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's new government was endorsed by the Knesset
(parliament) Tuesday night by a vote of 62 to 50, after the
premier reached an agreement at the last minute with his coalition
partners.
</P>
<P>
However, so far it is still not clear whether Likud hardliner
and former defense minister Ariel Sharon has accepted the notion
of becoming minister of national infrastructures, a new creation
custom-tailored for him by Foreign minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
Likud sources said they expected that Sharon would be sworn
some time next week, and that the now 16-member government would
in a few days number 18 ministers.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Needs More Indigenous, Small Tobacco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwe cabinet minister said
today there is need for more indigenous and smallholder farmers
to venture into tobacco farming and boost output of the lucrative
crop.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 1996 Annual Congress of the Zimbabwe Tobacco
Association (ZTA) in Harare, Agriculture Minister Dennis Norman
said smallholder tobacco farmers could play a vital part in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
While smallholders accounted for about half the total number
of flue cured tobacco producers, they produced only a small
proportion of the country's total annual output.
</P>
<P>
''In order to increase the contribution of smallholder growers
to total output, it will be necessary to rapidly expand their
numbers. We must look forward to many thousands of smallholders
sending an increasing volume of tobacco to the sales floors,''
said Norman.
</P>
<P>
At present zimbabwe has some 3,000 tobacco growers, and the
minister said the number could grow tenfold in a few years.
</P>
<P>
With a much improved 1996 season in both price and volume
terms, the total tobacco output had been valued at 800 million US
dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
''We can look forward to achieving a target output of 1
billion US dollars within the next year or so. This will
constitute a major part of the growth in our national economy as
a whole, which is urgently needed as the basis for all-round
improvement in living standards of our population,'' he said.

HONG KONG, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A successful closing-minute
three-pointer gave Hong Kong's Frankwell team a narrow-margined
victory over China at the final preliminary match at the Seventh
Commercial Henderson Cup International Men's Basketball

</P>
<P>
But the Chinese national team still obtained a semi-final berth

<P>
The Chinese led the first half 37-32. Frankwell was
represented by the Ukrainian national team.

<P>
China led Frankwell 77-76 when there were only 30 seconds for

In the other match today, Hong Kong's Energy team defeated
South Korea 108-78 after a 54-38 half-time lead in favor of the

<HEADLINE> Western Assistance to Developing Countries Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Aid from Western industrialized
countries has been on the decline for two years running, a report
by a committee of the OECD said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The developed countries among the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) provided 59 billion
U.S. dollars in aid to the developing countries in 1995, compared
with that of 59.2 billion in 1994, the OECD's Development
Assistance Committee said.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account of the depreciation of the U.S. dollar last
year, the real value of the Western aid was 53.7 billion dollars,
9.3 percent less than that of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The 1994 figure was already 8 percent less than that of 1993,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's total foreign aid amounted to 14.5 billion dollars last
year, the highest in all Western nations. It was followed by
France and Germany, which provided 8.4 billion dollars and 7.5
billion dollars, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The United States, offering only 7.3 billion dollars of aid
last year, made the deepest cut in its foreign aid program.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of the aid in the gross national product of
seven most developed Western countries has also declined.

<HEADLINE> EC Supports Ethiopia's Emergency Food Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Commission of the
European Union said today it is undertaking a large scale local
purchase of grain in four regions of Ethiopia to enhance the
country's food security reserve and support local cereal
production.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here, the commission said the
project will increase Ethiopia's emergency food security reserve
by 75,000 metric tonnes in addition to provide food for relief
and rehabilitatilon in Tigray Region amounting to 35,000 metric
tonnes at a total cost of about 29 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The commission said, the project launched following the appeal
made by the Ethiopian Disaster Prevention and Preparedness
Commission to the donor community to purchase grain on the
Ethiopian market, and 11,080 metric tonnes of grain have been
dispatched as of June 18 to the commission.
</P>
<P>
The purchase operation requires continued effort to raise
awareness and monitoring in order to ensure success since this is
a new experience to local traders, said the press release.
</P>
<P>
The press release said that the local purchase of grain in
large quantities became an alternative to the import of food aid
for the first time as the country produced marketable surplus of
grain estimated at 1,000,000 metric tonnes in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Japan's GDP Grows 2.3 Percent in Fiscal 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Japan's real gross domestic product
(GDP) grew an impressive 2.3 percent in fiscal 1995 ending on
March 31, reversing an almost zero growth in the previous three
years, the government said today.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese GDP rose 0.4 percent in fiscal 1992, 0.2 percent
in fiscal 1993 and 0.5 percent in fiscal 1994.
</P>
<P>
Japan's inflation-adjusted GDP grew 3 percent in the
January-March quarter from the previous quarter, the highest in 23
years since the January-March quarter of 1973, the Economic
Planning Agency (EPA) said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The 2.3 percent GDP growth, the highest since a 3.1 percent
increase in fiscal 1991, is much higher than the government's
target of 1.2 percent set for the year's growth, the report said.
</P>
<P>
EPA Vice Minister Makoto Kobayashi told reporters: "Japan's
economy is just crossing the threshold of a self-sustainable
recovery."
</P>
<P>
If the economy continues growing at the January-March rate, it
will be possible for the government to attain its real GDP growth
forecast of 2.5 percent for fiscal 1996 that started April 1, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The nation's real GDP for the reporting quarter totaled 478,413
billion yen (4,784.130 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Of the 3 percent GDP growth for the January-March period,
domestic demand contributed to an increase of 3.4 percentage
points while external demand pushed down the growth by 3 percent,
the EPA said.
</P>
<P>
The 3 percent growth follows an increase of 0.6 percent in the
April-June and July-September periods, and of 1.2 percent in the
October-December quarter.

<HEADLINE> Israel Army to Guard Peace and Security: New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli new Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai said today that Israeli army is committed to
guarding peace and security of the country by firmly fighting
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) are not only committed to
make every effort in moving along the path of peace, but
also to stand firmly to defend the country and ensure
security," Mordechai said in the hand-over ceremony held at
the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The new defense minister pledged that Israeli soldiers would play
a major role in guarding peace and security of the Israeli
people.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai inspected an honor guard made up of uniformed
soldiers before taking over office from his predecessor and former
Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israeli army would seek to expand relations
with allies and Arab neighbors. He also stressed the need to
"strengthen the long arms of the IDF to fight the threats
of today and tomorrow, and to strike the terrorists in any
possible way'.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, 52, is a retired major general who had served

<HEADLINE> New Israeli FM Criticizes Arab Leaders for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 19 (Xinhua) -- New Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy today accused Arab leaders of creating unnecessary
tension since Israel's May 29 elections.
</P>
<P>
This was his first public statement on Israel's relations with
its Arab neighbors since he was sworn in as foreign minister
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
An official ceremony was held on the Foreign Ministry lawn
here in which Ehud Barak handed over the office to his rightwing
successor, David Levy.
</P>
<P>
Levy said that he was using the opportunity to address Israel's
neighbors that the tension, which has been developing and which
Arab leaders have tried to produce since Israel's elections, is
completely unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
"It is not constructive and does not contribute to the peace
process, which is dear to all of us," he declared.
</P>
<P>
Levy said the tension must be lowered and this government
wants peace and would like to establish an atmosphere which
enables both dialogue and progress. But the rightwing minister
did not say how to carry out the peace process to prove the new
government's good will and therefore alleviate Arab concern over
its strongly-worded policy guidelines.
</P>
<P>
He said that the foundations for progress will be that each
side will fulfill its commitments. "If we can reach that point
and quickly, there would be no need for holding an emergency
(Arab) summit," he added.
</P>
<P>
Levy called the summit scheduled to take place in Cairo at the
weekend superfluous, adding that "I expect from the summit a warm
message of peace so that we can work together in cooperation to
correctly analyze the situation of what could happen if we do not
act responsibly together to advance the peace process."

<HEADLINE> World Grains Production Increases in 1996, IGC Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 18 (xinhua) -- Increased planted acreage and
average Yields will likely lead to production increases in 1996
for grains and oilseeds, according to a special report issued by
IGC (International Grains Council) Grains Conference here today.
</P>
<P>
This coupled with some decrease in consumption would keep
current tight stocks levels stable through next spring, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
However, it pointed out that the propensity for extreme weather
conditions so far in 1996 suggests smaller crops than expected are
a real probability. In this case, significant rationing and higher
prices are in store through mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
World production of wheat in 1996 is forecast at 572 MMT
compared to the 1995 world production of 536 MMT. There is a
greater likelihood for the 1996 estimate to decline rather than
increase due to expected weather related problems in North America
and former Soviet Union spring wheat areas.
</P>
<P>
World production of coarse grains is higher due to expected
increase in America and China corn and former Soviet Union
barley. In 1996 world coarses grain production is forecast at 847
MMT compared with the estimated production of 785 MMT in 1995,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
World soybean production is forecast to increase slightly in
1996 to 125 MMT from 122 MMT in 1995. While an increase is
expected from South America next season, weather related losses in
northern China and America will keep this years production small,
the report said.

UNITED NATIONS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Real income per capita is
rising this year in over 80 percent of the developing countries,
where 96 percent of the population of the developing world lives,
according to a survey prepared by the Department for Economic and
Social Information and Policy Analysis (DESIPA).
</P>
<P>
"The World Economic and Social Survey 1996" to be released by
DESIPA nest week states that gross domestic Product (GDP) per
capital rose in three quarters of the developing economies,
accounting for 90 percent of the developing world's population.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, little over half the developing economies had
rising per capita income in 1993, the Survey says.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the survey reports that strong economic growth
continuing in central and eastern Europe, stating that the Russian
Federation will record its first year of growth since the collapse
of the Soviet Union.
</P>

According to the Survey, developed economies will grow 2
percent in 1996, with only a modest improvement forecast for 1997
(2.5 percent).

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Reiterates Prerequisites for Resuming Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Reacting to Israel's call for a
resumption of peace negotiations, Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz reiterated here today the prerequisites for resuming the
peace talks and asked Israel to clarify its positions on the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
He reasserted that the resumption of the peace netotiations
should be only based on principles of the 1991 Madrid peace
conference, namely, the principles of exchanging land for peace
and the implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolutions 242,
338 and 425.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to Knesset Tuesday, Israeli new Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu appealed "especially to our close neighbors,
Syrian President Hafez Assad, Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, to
Saudi King Fahd, and to the rest of the Arab leaders" to renew
peace talks with his right-wing government.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on Netanyahu's remarks, the Lebanese
foreign minister pointed out that the presence of the Lebanese
and Arab delegates in Madrid in 1991 "followed several months
of talks and negotiations with the American side and was in
accordance with some bases."
</P>
<P>
"And these bases are at first the principle of exchanging
land for peace and the principle of implementing Resolutions
242, 338 and 425," Boueiz told a press conference in his
office this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Any invitation to the resumption of the peace negotiations
should be done according to these bases," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If it is demanded to review the bases of the peace
process, I don't think that anyone is ready to review this
process or its bases," the Lebanese official stressed.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the statement of the new Israeli government,
Boueiz said, "I think that the Israeli government, using a style
and a formula implying a softness, wanted to conceal the
inflexible essence and the essence constituting the bases of the
peace process."
</P>
<P>
He noted that any style, which involves a suggestion
evading the principle of a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights,
the principle of a full withdrawal from the West Bank, the
principle of setting up a Palestinian state and the principle
of finding out a settlement to Jerusalem's status, will only
be a "style of manoevers" concealing the bases of the peace
process.

<HEADLINE> Three Central Asian Countries Boost Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan, Kirghizia and
Uzbekistan are working together to integrate their economies and
increase military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the three Central Asian states are speeding up the
implementation of economic cooperation agreements and treaties
concluded in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The former Soviet republics, which gained independence late
1991, have a combined population of more than 40 million and wield
considerable economic and military power.
</P>
<P>
Growing cooperation among them will influence Central Asia as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
Their efforts at economic integration began in January 1994,
when Kirghizia agreed to join the economic zone established by
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan earlier that month.
</P>
<P>
In April 1995, the presidents of the three countries held a
summit in Chimken in southern Kazakhstan, where they agreed on a
program to integrate their economies by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The integration process entered a new stage of implementation
this year with a series of high-level meetings.
</P>
<P>
On April 5, prime ministers of the three countries met in the
Uzbek capital Tashkent, where they had high praise for the efforts
toward integration their countries have made in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the three countries then met in Alma
Ata, the capital of Kazakhstan, on April 30 and vowed to
strengthen economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial meeting was followed immediately by a
presidential summit on May 6 in the Kyrgyz capital Bishkek.
</P>
<P>
Economic, environmental and military cooperation were on the
agenda of the one-day summit which brought together Presidents
Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstanh, Askar Akayev of Kirghizia and
Islam Karimov of Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
The 53 cooperation agreements signed during the summit covered
almost every major sector of the economy in the three countries.
</P>
<P>
The Central Asian neighbors also agreed to create a joint
peacekeeping force by this summer.
</P>
<P>
The 500-strong force, to be based in southern Kazakhstan, will
be trained under NATO's Partnership for Peace program and the
three countries have requested official United Nations status as
blue-helmet peacekeepers.

(SABC), after the sponsor of the Channel Africa failed to renew
its budget.

communications and further feasibility studies to be done by the
sabc.
</P>
<P>
But he said no final decision had been made about which
department would absorb the service's budget.
</P>
<P>
The precise format and financing of the external broadcaster
will be determined by a subcommittee chaired by Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki, including Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo, Arts,
and Culture Minister Ben Ngubane, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel
and Naidoo.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is the only african country which broadcasts into

The southern African Development Community (SADC) Executive
Secretary Keire Mbuende said the SADC and its staff supported the
uninterrupted transmission of the service which he described as
an invaluable medium for promoting the ideals and objectives of
the SADC.

people of southern Africa, as well as to the entire African
continent.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, U.S. to Launch Joint Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Jordan announced here today that it
will start a 10-day joint military exercises with the United
States in Gulf Aqaba of the Red Sea from June 25 to July 5.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Jordan News Agency Petra, the war
games will be attended by Jordan's army and U.S. marine troops
which will arrive at the south port city of Aqaba on June 21.
</P>
<P>
It is not immediately known how many Jordanian and U.S. troops
will participate in the joint military exercises, which is the
second this year but the first to be attended by U.S. marine.
</P>
<P>
The two countries launched a two-month joint military exercises
codenamed "Eager Tiger" in the kingdom in April, which is aimed at
training the Jordanian pilots the necessary skills to use the
U.S.-made F-16s warplanes.
</P>
<P>
The 16 F-16s fighters, part of U.S. military assistance to
Jordan, will be delivered to the kingdom by the end of next month.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believed that the joint military exercises might
have been decided during King Hussein's visit to Washington last
week.
</P>
<P>
The military exercises as well as the U.S. decision to
deliver the warplanes to Jordan this year rather than next
year, they said, will be part of U.S. effort to support
Jordan to play a role in the future Middle East peace
process, since Jordan has shown some confidence in the new
Israeli right-wing leader Benjamin Netanyahu and the king was
the first Arab leader to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton
after the Israeli elections on May 29.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Chief: Arabs Want Peace without Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdul-Meguid has said that the peace which the Arabs want is the
one without surrender though they are peace advocates.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the weekly Al-Mussawar, which will be
published Friday, Abdul-Meguid said that the upcoming Arab summit
is a message that the Arabs will not accept anything but the
principle of land-for-peace.
</P>
<P>
"The principle of peace-for-peace is refused," he said in the
interview carried by the Egyptian Middle East News Agency today.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was sworn in
Tuesday, has called on Israel's Arab neighbors to renew peace
talks with Israel but expressed his opposition to returning
captured Arab land for peace.
</P>
<P>
But the Arab League chief said that the Arab summit, due to be
held in Cairo Saturday and Sunday, is not an action directed
against anyone.
</P>
<P>
The Arab summit, which will draw 21 of the Arab League's 22
members, aims to close Arab ranks and forge a unified Arab stance
to support the Middle East peace process based on the principle of
land-for-peace, according to Arab officials.
</P>
<P>
On Iraq's absence from the summit, Abdul-Meguid said it is
aimed at avoiding any tension during the largest gathering of Arab
leaders in six years.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, whose invasion of Kuwait in 1990 split the Arab world,
was not invited to the summit.
</P>
<P>
On reports that some Arab heads of state will not attend the
summit, he said that the level of representation will not lessen
Arab countries' commitment to the resolutions to be passed at the
summit.

DAR ES SALAAM, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar government is

killer disease in the isles.
</P>
<P>
Tabling his ministry's estimates for the 1996/97 financial

<HEADLINE> Israel Limits Press Activity in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel has imposed a restriction on
activities of journalists in the southern Lebanese buffer zone and
taken measures preventing reports on fightings and Israeli
casualties from spreading to outside.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources in the Israeli-client militia in south
Lebanon said that the Israeli forces issued a series of
orders and instructions recently banning reporters and
photographers from approaching sites where fightings between
Israeli troops and Lebanese guerrillas take place.
</P>
<P>
The anonymous sources in the South Lebanon Army (SLA) said that
the orders and instructions were issued by the North Command of
the Israeli Defense Force and its intelligence office to the
Israeli occupation forces and the South Lebanese Army militia
patrolling the 850-square-kilometer "security zone" in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The move was aimed at prohibiting reports on place and time of
a fighting inside the border strip and casualties the Israelis
suffer before they are referred to the Israeli occupation
authority and the army's north command, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Anyone violating the limitation would be imprisoned, the
orders warned.
</P>
<P>
Reports by the Lebanese press and international news agencies
on military operations of Shiite guerrillas of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, in the occupied border strip,
especially the recent attacks at Marjayoun and Dabsheh, have
annoyed Israel and its client militia.
</P>
<P>
The May 30 attack on Marjayoun where four Israeli soldiers
were killed and seven wounded, and the June 10 attack at
Dabsheh in which five Israeli soldiers were killed and eight
injured, were the bloodiest operations Hezbollah carried out
since the Jewish state and Lebanon reached a cease-fire
understanding on April 26.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli occupation authority and the SLA militia blamed
each other for leaking information on the Israeli casualties in
the two attacks, and this has negatively affected the relations
between the two sides, according to the SLA sources.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the arrest of a Lebanese journalist, Ali Daya,
by the Israeli occupation forces last week came as part of an
Israeli campaign to curb the press activities in the occupied
border strip.
</P>
<P>
Daya, correspondent of the Agence France-Presse and reporter of
the Beirut-based Safir daily, has been sent to Israel for
interrogations and was accused of offering help to Hezbollah
militants, according an anonymous spokesman of the Israeli army
in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz stressed that his government
"strongly denounces the abduction of Ali Daya by the Israeli
occupation army."
</P>
<P>
"We are demanding the help of all international and
humanitarian authorities for his immediate release," he
underlined.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen Israeli soldiers have been killed by Hezbollah
guerrillas in south Lebanon since the beginning this year,
including nine killed in the past month.

<HEADLINE> UK-EU Deal Over Beef Row Remains Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
has strongly indicated that he did not know whether the beef row
between Britain and the European Union (EU) would be settled at
the EU summit due to be held in Florence, Italy, later this week.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference on the future of Europe in London
earlier today, Major said, "I don't know if we will be able to
resolve this dispute at Florence, but we are getting back to a
more rational discussion."
</P>
<P>
"Any common sense suggests that rational discussion will draw
us all towards a practical situation," he added.
</P>
<P>
The British prime minister made the statement hours after the
EU Commission announced that a broad agreement has been reached on
a phased lifting of the EU beef ban on British beef products
exports to be tabled at this week's EU summit.
</P>
<P>
But a EU Commission spokesman reportedly warned that the
proposal would be presented to the EU summit only if there was a
clear commitment from the British government that Britain would
end its non-cooperation policy with the EU.
</P>
<P>
"Presentation of the paper in Florence presupposes that the
(non-cooperation) policy of the UK government will cease
immediately," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the EU proposal, Britain would have to slaughter some
20,000 to 30,000 more cattle in its efforts to eradicate the BSE
or mad cow disease than the 80,000 it had previously proposed to
slaughter
</P>
<P>
However, British government officials told a press briefing
here this afternoon that Prime Minister Major was not preparing
substantial concessions and was ready to to continue a policy of
obstruction at the two-day EU summit beginning this Friday until
he won agreement for a step-for-step lifing of the global ban on
British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
"We said there would be no lifing of our policy until a
framework had been reached by everybody" and the EU proposal meant
that the non-cooperation policy should be ended before any
discussion of the beef issue at the Florence summit, a minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Major has repeatedly made it clear that unless the ban on beef
derivatives was lifted, and agreement was reached on a clear
framework for lifting the worldwide ban, the issue of BSE or mad
cow disease would dominate the EU summit.
</P>
<P>
The British government has blocked quite a number of measures
since Prime Minister Major announced the non-cooperation campaign
in a desperate effort to get rid of the worldwide ban on British
beef exports but Britain has recently showed some flexibility by
giving the green light to some limited EU measures.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the global ban on March 27 when the British
government admitted that there were possible links between BSE or
mad cow disease and its human equivalent Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the EU Commission decided to lift the ban
on the exports of three British beef by-products --gelatine,
tallow and bull semen, but the British government refused to end
its non-cooperation policy, saying it would give up the policy
when the EU announced a clear timetable to lift the total ban on
British beef exports.

will eventually contain a data base on crime and criminals
throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
The facility, at a cost of 300,000 Rand (about 70,000 US
Dollars), was funded through the Business Against Crime
Initiative by South African businesses that are keen to enhance
police capability to combat illegal weapons, drugs and stolen
goods across national boundaries.
</P>
<P>
Fivaz said he will meet his counterparts in Lesotho on
Thursday and the first E-mail facility will be installed in his
office shortly afterwards. Installation in all countries will be
completed by July 26.
</P>
<P>
Besides South Africa and Lesotho, the other countries which
form the Southern African Regional Police Chiefs Cooperation
Organization that will be linked by E-mail are Angola, Botswana,
Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Kenya To Close Rwandese Embassy In Nairobi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has decided
to close the Rwandese Embassy in Nairobi with effect from
Thursday following the Rwandese government's refusal to waive
diplomatic immunity on its diplomat on criminal charges here.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement, Kenyan Ministry for Foreign Affairs and
International Co-operation said the Kenyan government has all
along given the government of Rwanda the option to either waive
the criminal embassy staff's diplomatic immunity or close the
Rwandese Embassy in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The statement said :"As the Rwandese government has
categorically refused to waive diplomatic immunity, the Kenya
government has now decided to close the Rwandese Embassy in
Nairobi with effect from Thursday."
</P>
<P>
"The closure of the Rwandese Embassy in Nairobi is to
underscore the seriousness of the matter but does not amount to
severance of diplomatic relations between Kenya and Rwanda," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Francis Mugabo who are on criminal charges here will travel
with his fellow diplomats to Rwanda, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Mugabo was among the suspects who on February 26, this year,
attempted to murder a Rwandese national and former minister in
the Rwandese government Seth Sendashonga, who is exiling in
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested with other suspects at the scene of the crime
and was then detained in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this decision, the Kenyan government reached the
decision to close the Rwandese Embassy on April 9, but held back
after a request from Kigali that the matter be solved through
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in its recent statement, the Rwandan government
said the arrest of Mugabo was wrong and accused the Kenyan
government of harboring Rwandese implicated in the genocide which
left about a million people dead.

<HEADLINE> Iran Announces Poverty Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian authorities today announced
a poverty line of 680,000 rials (about 170 U.S. dollars) for a
family in its capital city of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by Deputy Commerce Minister Noorekar
Shirazi at a seminar on elimination of poverty in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that based on the existing statistics, the poverty
line is 680,000 rials in Tehran, 450,000 rials (about 112 dollars)
for a family in other cities and 370,000 to 390,000 rials (less
than 100 dollars) for a family in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Due to the economic pressure and family planning policy in
Iran, there are on average four members in each family. That means
the poverty line of 42.5 dollars for one person in Tehran, 28
dollars for one person in other cities and 24 dollars in rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
Iran boats of 65 million population. Some government employees
re even living under the poverty line. Since most of women stay
at home, men have to support four or five member of the family
with limited income.
</P>
<P>
A specialist told Xinhua that each family has to spend half of
their income on housing and men have to do two or three jobs or
even five jobs to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
Naturally, economic hardship leads to the social problem of
theft and armed robberies. Residents have to build high walls and
steel fence to protect them from robberies.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners, who are considered to be the richest in the
country, easily become targets of the criminals. They have to
raise dog at home and dare not park cars outside in the
evening.

<HEADLINE> Kremlin Announces July 3 Day-Off for Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin signed a resolution today announcing July 3 a
day-off, with an aim to allow more people to vote in the second
round of presidential elections without interfering with their
week-end plans.
</P>
<P>
The move followed the State Duma's refusal to consider
President Boris Yeltsin's request to make July 3 a day-off.
</P>
<P>
Experts here believe that voting on Wednesday, July 3, may
increase the turnout as most people go to the countryside on
weekend. The disciplined communist voters are sure to come to the
polls on any day, while Yeltsin's electorate may miss the second
round if it is held on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Yeltsin agreed with Nikolai Ryabov, chairman of
the Central Electoral Commission, that July 3 should be made a
day-off to hold the second round of the elections, and ordered the
government to take appropriate steps.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Sergei Medvedev said that Ryabov, in his
letter to the president, pointed out that it would be an
"unjustified" decision to hold elections on a Sunday again, while
holding them on July 3 will allow more people to attend the polls.
</P>
<P>
The commission is prepared to hold the run-off elections at the
beginning of July and has already begun large-scale preparations,
Ryabov said.
</P>
<P>
Meeting reporters in the Kremlin earlier today, Yeltsin said
the Central Electoral Commission will announce the official
results of the first round of the polls on Thursday to allow the
candidates, Yeltsin and Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov,
to begin their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
As none of all the 10 candidates won over 50 percent of the
votes in June 16 polls, the top two candidates, Yeltsin with 35.06
percent of the votes and Zyuganov with 30.31.96 percent, should
race in the second round.
</P>
<P>
Characterizing the second round, Yeltsin stressed that it will
be important how those who did not support him or his arch rival
Zyuganov in the first round will vote in the second round.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said his alliance with retired General Alexander Lebed
is "a good step."
</P>
<P>
Soon after the first round, Yeltsin appointed Lebed, who took
third place with 14.70 percent of the votes in the first round and
who could play a decisive role in the second round, as head of the
National Security Council and his national security assistant.
</P>
<P>
In his turn, Lebed said most of his supporters will vote for
Yeltsin in another voting.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, Zyuganov agreed, during
his 90-minute meeting with Chernomyrdin earlier today, that the
second round will be held on July 3, and noted that the first
round has passed peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov put forward numerous ideas on cooperation or a
coalition and Chernomyrdin responded by saying that he has always
believed that cooperation is possible, especially when the gap
between the votes cast for the two candidates is that narrow,
Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> US Fed Survey Shows Modest Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
reported today that economic growth in the country remains modest
with little sign of inflation at the consumer level.
</P>
<P>
"Reports from the 12 Federal Reserve districts suggest economic
activity continued to advance at a moderate pace in May and early
June," according to a Fed survey of regional business conditions.
</P>
<P>
"Nearly all districts report expanding activity and several
indicate the pace of growth accelerated recently," the survey
said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the survey found little evidence of rising
retail prices, despite increases for raw and intermediate goods
spotted in some districts.
</P>
<P>
Most districts continued to report tight labor markets, but the
survey found only scattered instances of rising wages.
</P>
<P>
The survey was concluded on June 11 for use by Fed monetary
policy makers when they meet on July 2-3 to consider whether to
change short-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Analysts are divided at present on how the U.S. Fed will act
when its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets early next
month. Some believe that the FOMC will vote to raise rates to slow
the economic expansion and defuse any inflationary explosion.
Others, however, believe the committee will decide to await
further data depicting the direction of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The FOMC cut rates three times between last July and January to
stimulate the slow-moving U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. economy has rebounded quickly since then with a
2.3 percent increase rate in the first quarter of this year,
accelerating concerns about inflation. A stronger expansion in the
second quarter is expected by many economists.

<HEADLINE> IDB Approves 150 Mln Dlrs for Peru's Poverty-Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) today announced the approval of a 150 million U.S.
dollar loan to Peru to help financing 9,000 small community-based
poverty-reduction projects.
</P>
<P>
The 430 million dollar program will receive another 150 million
dollars in co-financing from the World Bank as well as 130 million
dollars in local counterpart funds.
</P>
<P>
The projects will have an average cost of about 40,000 dollars
each and the maximum cost per project will be 250,000 dollars. At
least half of the beneficiaries in each project will have incomes
below the poverty line. The communities must contribute toward the
projects' cost, up to 10 percent of the unskilled labor needed.
</P>
<P>
The program will consist of two types of projects: social
support and infrastructure, and community management and
institutional strengthening.
</P>
<P>
Social support projects will target education, health care and
sewerage. Infrastructure projects will focus on economic
infrastructure and include land rehabilitation, rural
electrification, small irrigation system and reforestation.

JOHANNESBURG, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A top-level commission of
inquiry into South Africa's labour market policy today
recommended that President Nelson Mandela urgently convene a jobs
summit which could be the starting point for a national
employment and growth accord.
</P>
<P>
According to the commission's report released in Cape Town,
the proposed summit would form the basis of further discussion
and investigation aimed at enabling Labour Minister Tito Mboweni
to make policy recommendations to the cabinet by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
The report said the aim of the jobs summit would be to
initiate a co-ordinated approach to job creation and to draw on
the authority of the president to firmly establish the urgency of
formulating a coherent tripartite response to the current
economic challenge.
</P>
<P>
the government should place before the summit a
clearly-formulated proposal on the process by which an accord
could be achieved to stimulate employment and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The commission also recommended that, wherever practicable,
government should insist that it speak to business and labour through
single representative voices.

<HEADLINE> Africa Has Largest Refugee Populatio, Says UNHCR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The African continent, with
a population of 6.7 million, has the largest number of refugees
in the world, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) Sadako Ogata said today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Cape Town to mark Africa Refugee Day
on Thursday, Ogata said the number of people displaced in their
own countries also continued to increase as it did worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Ogata said the theme "save the environment to safeguard
asylum" was appropriate as the UNHCR had been making an effort to
address environmental problems in communities hosting refugees.
</P>
<P>
The recent plight of Liberian asylum seekers aboard leaky
boats being turned away from port after port showed how much
pressure was being brought to the asylum administration as
refugee problems often continued to defy solutions, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Ogata said the UNHCR last year completed the voluntary
repatriation of 1.7 million Mozambican refugees, the largest
operation so far undertaken in Africa. And 300,000 Angolan
refugees would also be repatriated in the next two years, the
commissioner added.

<HEADLINE> UK Government Deficit at 3.2 Billion Pounds in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The British government is almost
certain to overshoot its public borrowing target after only two
months of the tax year, reflecting both weak income tax receipts
and stronger-than-forecast government spending.
</P>
<P>
This conclusion was based on figures which came out Tuesday
from the Treasury and the Office for National Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) in May was 3.2
billion pounds (4.8 billion U.S. dollars), more than the less than
3 billion pound (4.5 billion dollar) figure which the City had
expected in spite of being flattered by 1.1 billion pounds (1.65
billion dollars) of the privatization of Railtrack.
</P>
<P>
The April PSBR, originally reported as 3.2 billion pounds, was
revised up to 3.5 billion pounds (5.25 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Income tax receipts, which were about 5 percent lower than in
the same month last year, contributed to the overshoot, as did
higher-than-expected spending by government departments.
</P>
<P>
Spending by government departments grew by 3.2 percent in the
year to May, well in excess of the 1.5 percent increase for the
year as a whole forecast in last November's budget.
</P>
<P>
Excluding privatization money, the deficit in May was 4.3
billion pounds (6.45 billion dollars), worse than the total of
4.1 billion pounds (6.15 billion dollars) in May last year.
</P>
<P>
The government has borrowed 6.7 billion pounds (10.1 billion
dollars) in the first two months of the current financial year,
down from 7.8 billion pounds (11.7 billion dollars) in the same
period of 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
However, taking out privatization, it has borrowed 7.9 billion
pounds (11.85 billion dollars) in the first two months of 1996-97
compared with 7.8 billion pounds in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
On average, City economists expect the government to overshoot
its PSBR forecast for this year by 4-5 billion pounds (6-7.5
billion dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said today it would raise 12.9
million U.S. Dollars for the repatriation and integration of the
Malian and Nigerien refugees this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a UNHCR report reaching here today, the money is
needed to bring home some of the 104,000 Malian and 15,500
Nigerien refugees from several neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation of refugees to Niger and Mali is on top of
the UNHCR agenda this year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The UN body said of the required amount, 2.5 million U.S.
Dollars would cover transport costs while 1.9 million would be
for water supply, and the rest of the money for shelter, health
service and other projects.
</P>
<P>
The Malian refugees are mostly Tuaregs who fled an armed
conflict in the country between 1990 and 1994, the report said,
adding between 15,000 and 20,000 Tuaregs were forced to leave
Niger.
</P>
<P>
The Malian refugees are spread out in Mauritania, Burkina Faso,
Niger, Algeria and Senegal while the Nigerien refugees are in
Algeria and Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
The refugees are being returned to their countries following the
peace accord between the government and rebel groups in Mali in
1992 and in Niger in 1995.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Asks UN to Revive Mission in W. Sahara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) today appealed to the United Nations
Security Council to revive its mission in western Sahara.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by current Chairman of the regional body
of west Africa, President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana, in a letter to
the council which last month approved the temporary suspension of
the UN mission for the referendum in western Sahara, saying that
the parties to the plan lacked the will to implement it.
</P>
<P>
The referendum for the self-determination of the people of
western Sahara has already been agreed by the conflicting
parties, the Morocan government and the Polisario authorities,
the indigenous resistance movement.
</P>
<P>
However, disparities remain large as to the identification of
voters of the referendum. Both sides have their own lists of
voters.
</P>
<P>
In a similar letter last month, the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) also expressed concern that any relaxation of efforts
of the UN in the implementation of the plan could further
complicate the impasse.
</P>
<P>
Under the UN settlement plan, the identification process is a
crucial step toward the referendum for the self-determination of
the people of western Sahara.
</P>
<P>
Three ECOWAS members, including Nigeria, Ghana and Guinea,
have observers in the 288-strong military component of MINURSO,
the UN observers mission in west Sahara, whose strength has been
reduced to 230 by the Security Council.

<P>
BONN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
told visiting Namibian President Sam Nujoma today that "Africa was
not a forgotten continent."
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said the recent events in some African countries like
Rwanda, Burundi, Nigeria and Liberia, which have led to some
negative media reports, should not become a yardstick for judging
the African continent as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The peaceful development in South Africa and southern Africa
has brought about a "positive situation" on that continent, which
was marked by the elimination of racial apartheid, development of
regional cooperation, establishment of democracy and a mechanism
of a market economy, Kinkel said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking highly of Namibia's national reconciliation policy,
Kinkel noted that Namibia is one of the south African countries
which has sent a signal of hope for the entire African continent.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister announced he will visit South Africa,
Zimbabwe and Botswana in the near future.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl told Nujoma, who
arrived here on Monday for a five-day visit, that Namibia will
continue to be Germany's major cooperation partner in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Official Says Pakistan's 1996-97 Budget Realistic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government has
proposed a "realistic" federal budget for the fiscal year of
1996-97, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Shah Mehmud
Qureshi said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Some tough steps have to be taken to improve the economy of
the country," he said at a debate on the budget at the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Pakistani opposition leader Nawaz Sharif called
for a nationwide strike on Sunday to protest the budget.
</P>
<P>
Qureshi argued that shutdowns could not solve the economic ills
of the country.
</P>
<P>
"The opposition should come up with alternate proposals for the
solution of problems instead of resorting to protests and
strikes," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is inevitable to impose new taxes to the tune
of 41 billion rupees (about 1.17 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the budget deficit would have shot up to 5.5 percent
of the gross domestic product (GDP) and would have caused a
slowdown in the public sector development, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The new budget, issued on June 13, set a target of cutting the
budget deficit to four percent of the GDP in the fiscal year of
1996-97.
</P>
<P>
Qureshi called for national consensus on the issue to resolve
Pakistan's major economic problems.

<HEADLINE> Migrant Worker Elected to Municipal CPPCC Committee in Zhongshan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A young migrant worker has
become a member of the municipal committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference in Zhongshan City, in
the booming southeastern province of Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
Gu Wenping, a native of Meixian, Guangdong, was elected to the
committee on a full vote, when the 7th standing committee
of the municipal CPPCC committee of Zhongshan convened its 9th
session.
</P>
<P>
A junior middle school graduate, Gu arrived in Zhongshan in
1987, and now works in a local household electrical appliances
factory.
</P>
<P>
He was chosen last year as one of the "outstanding migrant
workers" and "top ten youth" of Zhongshan, and became the city's
sole winner of a "National Medal for Model Workers" on May Day
this year.
</P>
<P>
"This can help raise the social status of migrant workers in
Zhongshan, and let them have a say in the city's affairs," said a
spokesman for the municipal CPPCC committee of Gu's membership.
</P>
<P>
He said that before the June 17 vote, his committee held a
special meeting just to pass a resolution to add a migrant
worker member to the committee.
</P>
<P>
There are now 350,000 migrant workers in Zhongshan.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Wants U.S. to Reverse Stance on Re-election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali said here today that he hoped the United States
would reverse its stance and not to block his effort to seek
another term as head of the world body.
</P>
<P>
"I still hope that the United States will change its
position," Boutros-Ghali said while meeting with German President
Roman Herzog in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali, to be 74 in November, through a spokesman at the
U.N. headquarters in New York, announced late Wednesday that he
would run for a second five-year term. His current term expires at
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Boutros-Ghali has taken this decision in view of the
strong encouragement that he has received from member states,"
spokesman Ahmad Fawzi told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
However, just hours after the announcement, an American
official said Washington was more willing to have a new candidate
more intent to reform the world body.
</P>
<P>
The Republican-dominated U.S. Congress strongly opposes to the
United Nations and its head. It's also widely believed that the
Congress is not likely to pay the 1.5 billion U.S. dollar debt to
the U.N. no matter how deeply it carries out reforms.
</P>
<P>
Candidates for the top post of the world body will be nominated
by the 15-seat Security Council but the General Assembly will have
the final say on who will win the position.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that Boutros-Ghali is highly possible to gain
the backing of France and Russia.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, who accompanied
Boutros-Ghali to the committee meeting, told reporters that "the
German government will have to decide."
</P>
<P>
The first secretary-general from the African continent was once
a law professor and Egypt's former deputy prime minister and
acting foreign minister.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Names New Top Bodyguard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today named Yuri Krapivin, head of the Federal Bodyguard Service,
as his personal security chief to replace Alexander Korzhakov.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential decree, Yeltsin announced Krapivin was
appointed as acting head of his personal security service.
</P>
<P>
Korzhakov, together with Federal Security Service Mikhail
Barsukov and First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, was
dismissed by Yeltsin earlier today allegedly because of their
"hard-line" positions.
</P>
<P>
According to former First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly
Chubais, who is a key member of Yeltsin's election team, general
Alexander Lebed played a big role in the dismissal.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, who came third in the first round of the presidential
elections last Sunday only after Yeltsin and Yeltsin's archrival,
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, allied with Yeltsin
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin appointed Lebed as head of the powerful Security
Council and his national security assistant in exchange for
Lebed's support in the second round of the run-off elections.

<HEADLINE> Tarim Basin to Produce 20 Percent More Oil This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sinking of eight wells has been finished, and drilling of
many other wells has almost been completed, Liang said.
</P>
<P>
Liang said that exploration operations are being carried out in
eight promising blocks. Oil discovery will be made in at least two
blocks, and successes are expected in eight blocks.
</P>
<P>
"Finding more oil will be essential to oil development this
year, the first year of the Ninth Five-Year Plan period
(1996-2000)," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Tarim, located in a desert in westernmost China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region, is expected to become China's second
largest oilfield around 2005, after the Daqing Oilfield, Liang
said.
</P>
<P>
Huge amounts of oil resources in four blocks have been newly
discovered in the basin over the past year, he said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the basin had pumped out 7.7 million tons
of oil. China began to develop the basin on a large scale in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Several international oil giants are going to join in the tarim
development with Esso (China), an affiliation of Exxon, having
started exploration operations there.
</P>
<P>
The official also predicted that the annual production capacity
of the basin is expected to reach five million tons next year.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Makes Peace Overtures to Israeli Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Hamas military wing, Iz
al-Din al-Qassam, issued a statement today calling on the Israeli
authorities to engage in a dialogue on freezing its military work
against Israel.
</P>
<P>
The initiative, which was published in a leaflet distributed
in Jerusalem, said that the dialogue should be conducted through
the mediation of the Palestinian Authority (PA), according to a
report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in east
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
It is the first ever proposal put forward by the Islamic
Resistance Movement to Israel since the right-wing Likud
government came to power.
</P>
<P>
Al-Qassam listed a string of conditions for its
reconciliation. They include an end of what it called "Zionist
terrorism" in all its forms against Hamas and al-Qassam Brigades;
an end of all offensives and attacks, official or public, against
Palestinian civilians in the occupied territories; release of all
Hamas prisoners from Israeli prisons and detention camps,
particular the Hamas spiritual leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin; and
termination of forms of collective punishment against the
Palestinian people, such as security closure and military siege
around the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Al-Qassam also maintains the absolute right of suitable
responses, at the suitable time according to its special
evaluation, to any crime conducted by the Israeli or settlers
against Palestinians or any Israeli violation of the
above-mentioned conditions.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that al-Qassam emphasizes the important
role of the PA as a mediator between Hamas and the Israeli
government.

<HEADLINE> Local Officials Dismissed for Extravagant Funeral Arrangements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Several senior local officials in
China have been removed from their posts or punished otherwise for
arranging extravagant funerals.
</P>
<P>
A joint circular of the Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Ministry
of Supervision today announced punishments for six officials
involved in extravagant funeral arrangements, urging all Party
members, especially officials, to learn lessons from the cases and
reinforce self-discipline.
</P>
<P>
According to the circular, Chen Luxue and Yu Wenyou, deputy
directors in the Finance Bureau of Dehui City in Northeast China's
Jilin Province and Ning Yazhong, director of Dehui Tax Affairs
Bureau, were dismissed from their leading posts for using over
50,000 yuan (about 6,200 U.S. dollars), including an amount of
public funds, to arrange a grand funeral for Li Quanyou, late
director of Dehui City's Finance Bureau and Tax Affairs Bureau in
January 1995.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 people attended the funeral, riding in over 100
cars, which were mostly public-owned.
</P>
<P>
The three officials also were responsible for superstitious
activities related to the funeral, which aroused serious
resentment from the public.
</P>
<P>
In other cases, Zhou Peirong, ex-member of the CPC Guizhou
Provincial Committee, and Chen Guanghui, ex-deputy head of Lanxian
County in Shanxi Province, were dismissed from their posts for
arranging extravagant and superstitious funerals for their
parents, and taking money from those attending the event.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Fu Bingxin, alternate member of the Hainan
Provincial Committee received a severe warning from the Party,
along with a record of demerit for holding a seven-day extravagant
funeral for his father in 1994, when he served as head of
Changjiang County in Hainan.
</P>
<P>
The circular called the extravagant funerals, those with tints
of superstition in particular, a phenomenon of serious corruption
and equally serious violation of the Party's discipline, which
poison the social mood and damage the image of the Party and
government.

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Exchange System to Cover Overseas-funded Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- China will give equal treatment to
overseas-funded enterprises in regard to selling and buying
foreign exchange from July 1, the State Administration of Exchange
Control announced this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The administration said that from July 1, overseas-funded
enterprises can sell their hard currency earnings to, or buy
foreign exchange from authorized foreign exchange banks on a
voluntary basis, basically like their Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The only difference is that domestic Chinese enterprises are
mandated to sell all their foreign exchange earnings to the
authorized banks, while overseas-funded enterprises are free to
keep them in their settlement accounts if they wish to.
</P>
<P>
Also they can continue to buy or sell foreign exchange at the
swap market.
</P>
<P>
According to a regulation on selling and buying foreign
exchange and foreign exchange settlements issued by the People's
Bank of China today, overseas-funded enterprises can open either
at authorized banks, an foreign exchange settlement account for
their transactions under current accounts, or special accounts for
their transactions under the capital account.
</P>
<P>
SAEC will set a ceiling for the amount of foreign exchange an
overseas-funded enterprise can keep in its current account in line
with its actual capital investment and its normal need for foreign
exchange under the current account, the regulation states.
</P>
<P>
It also said that overseas banks or their branches, together
with Sino-overseas banks, can be authorized to be foreign exchange
banks that can buy from, or sell overseas-funded enterprises
foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Both SAEC officials and analysts cited the latest move to
integrate overseas-funded enterprises into China's system on
selling and buying foreign exchange as a significant step towards
current-account convertibility of the local currency, the RMB yuan.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, said
this morning that China will make the yuan convertible under the
current account by the end of this year, four years ahead of its
self-imposed deadline of 2000.
</P>
<P>
China's measures to achieve current-account convertibility of
the RMB yuan also includes lifting the ceiling for the amount of
foreign exchange for private use and removing restrictions on the
volume of foreign exchange for other non-trade purposes, deputy
governor of the central bank Chen Yuan told a news conference
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that including overseas-funded enterprises in China's
foreign exchange selling and buying system means an extension of
the settlement business of foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
"It does not mean allowing overseas banks to do local currency
business," Chen said, adding that strict controls on the capital
account will remain.
</P>
<P>
Chen confirmed that overseas banks will first be allowed to do
the RMB yuan business in the Pudong New Area of Shanghai, but
declined to offer a timetable.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Wildlife Park Prospers on Sand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINHUANGDAO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Russian National Circus
has made a wise choice in picking China's largest wildlife park as
their stage for next month's performance.
</P>
<P>
The park, located in the Qinhuangdao National Forest Park in
north China's Hebei Province, is now the largest in China with an
area of 334 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Just 40 years ago it was an area of rolling sand dunes. Now it
is home to 3,000 animals of 90 species, including giant panda,
Siberian tigers, Asian elephants, Yangtze alligators and crested
cranes.
</P>
<P>
Man-made hills, ponds, lakes, wooden shelters, heated rooms and
caves were built to create realistic habitats of the animals.
</P>
<P>
At the majority of the zoos in China, animals collected from
various localities are on display in cages, according to general
manager Feng Gengtian.
</P>
<P>
Zoos might indirectly damage wildlife resources, he fears,
because people might imitate the behavior of the zoo authorities.
</P>
<P>
Thus, at the Qinhuangdao Wildlife Park, animals are bred in a
simulated original environment, where animals can move about in a
relatively large area, and visitors can touch and pose for
pictures with mild-tempered animals.
</P>
<P>
Feng is also head of the Qinhuangdao Haibin (seaside) Forest
Farm and the national forest park.
</P>
<P>
Before the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949,
there was not a single village in an area of more than 1,000
hectares of sandy land, while the largest sand dune was 45 meters
high.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s shifting sand often buried farmland and blocked
roads. A film studio chose the site for a feature film set in the
desert.
</P>
<P>
After over 40 years of effort by the forestry department, a
forest park covering 1,145 ha has taken shape on the dunes. A
survey showed that it is the largest city forest park in China.
</P>
<P>
Feng disclosed that the third-phase project will start at the
end of this year, which will involve an investment of 20 million
yuan, and be completed in May 1997. By then 40 species of maritime
mammals will be added to the park.
</P>
<P>
Feng is optimistic about the future of the park. But he is now
faced with a minor problem: some herbivorous animals under state
protection, such as peacocks and deer, are propagating too fast,
and he has trouble dealing with the growing number.
</P>
<P>
There are now three wildlife parks in China, the other two
being in Shenzhen in south China and Shanghai in east China. They
have gained favor of many Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Qinhuangdao Wildlife Park received more than 400,000 visitors
within two months of opening to the public last July.

<HEADLINE> "Horseback Court" in China's Grasslands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Xining, June 20 (Xinhua) -- When Sonan Wangdui, a Tibetan
herdsman, was involved in a grazing land border dispute with his
neighbor, he refused to let a reputed living Buddha settle the
case.
</P>
<P>
"I want a `horseback court' to make a judgement," said the
49-year-old man from Maqen County of southern Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
"Horseback courts" are roving tribunals, increasingly popular
in recent years in China's vast, but sparsely inhabited pasture
lands in the western part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Maqen County said such courts have been organized
to hear cases quickly, and at the same time to educate herdsman on
legal knowledge to improve their awareness of the laws. The
herdsmen are always on the move and usually have little access to
information.
</P>
<P>
There is no more than one herdsman to each square kilometer of
land in Maqen County, so the judges ride on horseback to find
cases to handle.
</P>
<P>
Asked why he would rather have a horseback court to handle his
case, Sonan Wangdui said, "I have seen how they work myself. They
make judgements according to laws of the state, fair and
reasonable."
</P>
<P>
He added: "Moreover saying that if you don't agree, we can go
to court, is quite common among herdsmen."
</P>
<P>
Such a thing could not happen just a few years ago. Tibetan
herdsman believe in Tibetan Buddism, they used to resort to living
Buddhas to settle disputes, just like Sonan Wangdui's neighbor.
Others tried to find a mediator to settle their disputes in
private.
</P>
<P>
A dozen year ago, Sonan Wangdui even asked a living Buddha
whether he should send his daughter to school.
</P>
<P>
Besides "horseback courts," Maqen County also organizes Party
and government officials and judicial law enforcers to give
lectures on laws to herdsmen.
</P>
<P>
Officials say that 85 percent of the pasture land population
have received such an education.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts, the number of law-breakers who committed
crimes because of ignorance of the law has been dramatically
reduced.
</P>
<P>
The Jiangqian Herdsman Committee in an area once plagued by
thieves and robbers has had none of its 40,000 head of cattle,
sheep stolen in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In fact Maqen County is just one part of the country that has
been engaged in educating the public in laws in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
According to Justice Minister Xiao Yang, 700 million of the
country's 810 million population eligible for legal education have
received such education in different degrees.
</P>
<P>
A new five-year campaign is now underway with an ultimate goal
for a system of rule of law governing the whole country.
</P>
<P>
Sonan Wangdui's case has been accepted by the County People's
Court, and has been handed to a "horseback court" for trial, a
court official said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Issue of Hebron Tests Netanyahu's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 20 (Xinhua) -- New Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, who is specifically against the land-for-peace
formula in his political platform, is hard to find a way out of
the Hebron dilemma.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has repeatedly declared that he will carry on the
peace process with neighboring Arab countries and the Palestinian
Authority since his election victory late last month, but he
insisted that he will not touch on the issue of Hebron
redeployment until the new government is formed.
</P>
<P>
Now that he has assumed his post, he can not but handle the
issue left over by his predecessor Shimon Peres. The Palestinians
might judge whether his peace declaration proves to be true from
his action.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo peace agreement, Hebron is one of the seven West
Bank cities to be handed over to the Palestinian Authority for
self-rule. The other six cities had already been handed over to
the Palestinians. However, Peres postponed the original date for
the withdrawal, March 28, in the wake of a series of suicide bomb
attacks against Israelis in February and March this year which
claimed 59 lives and plunged the country into a temporary crisis.
</P>
<P>
The redeployment was supposed to have taken place on June 12,
but Netanyahu's victory in the May 29 elections prompted the
outgoing prime minister to shift the responsibility to his
successor.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military authorities have made it clear that the
army is ready to carry out the redeployment and able to complete
it in hours, once the political leadership issues an order.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians feel very disappointed and very dissatisfied with
Israel's continuing violation of the peace agreement. Palestinian
Planning Minister Nabil Shaath noted that the redeployment from
Hebron constitutes a real test for the new Israeli government.
Hebron Mayor Mustafa Natsheh stressed that Israel's refusal to
withdraw from Hebron will lead to what he called disaster and
Netanyahu's loss of the support by the international community.
</P>
<P>
The United States, broker of the Middle East peace process,
has called on the new Israeli leader to honor the peace agreement
and commitment to Hebron redeployment. The French Foreign Ministry
in a statement Wednesday also urged the newly-formed Israeli
government to do so, first and foremost, and pursue the
land-for-peace approach.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian Export Volume Down by 8.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's volume of exports
dropped by 8.4 percent in the first five months of the year as
compared with the same period last year, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Government News said that the country's exports
earned 169.9 million U.S. dollars, 15.6 million dollars less than
last year.
</P>
<P>
The drop was attributed to a price decline on the international
market where the falling prices for copper, molybdenum, wool and
casing for sausage cost Mongolia as much as 32.2 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Low returns from exports have forced up the exchange rate
between the Mongolian currency of tugrik and the dollar. After
hitting a high of one dollar for 600 tugriks, the exchange rate
has been hovering at 1:560 for the past week.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Issue of Hebron Tests Netanyahu's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under increasing pressure, Netanyahu is obliged to get down
with it. But according to the Israeli press, the rightwing prime
minister has very few options and has to weigh the pros and
cons before taking any decisions.
</P>
<P>
First, maintaining the status quo and keeping the military
presence in Hebron. This is advocated by the Jewish settlers in
the city and adjacent Kiryat Arba settlement and supporters of
continued Israeli control over the West bank. They argue that this
is the only way to prevent Hamas militants from using Hebron to
prepare terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Critics of this option note that in the long run, this policy
would endanger Israeli security, lead to resumption of the
intifada (uprising), cause immediate international isolation, and
create a sharp political conflict with the United States. A
confrontation would endanger U.S. financial and military aid to
Israel and Washington's vital political support.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, complete withdrawal. This would involve possibly
immediate security risk, but gain full support from the
international community and the United States. It would
demonstrate Netanyahu's commitment to the peace process, and
create a reservoir of political credit.
</P>
<P>
However, if this leads to renewed public bus suicide
bombings, the new government will lose its credibility among its
supporters, and internal disputes will surface inside the Likud
itself.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, partial withdrawal. This choice might provide a
middle road, indicating Netanyahu's intention to honor the peace
agreement, but linking Israel's further action to Palestinian
Authority's compliance.
</P>
<P>
But this would still be widely criticized as an abrogation of
the terms of the peace agreement and would cause significant
political costs. And it would only be viable if it receives at
least somewhat support from Washington.
</P>
<P>
As redeployment is dragging on, tensions between the 450
Jewish settlers and the vast majority of the Palestinian residents
in the city are mounting and a sparkle may spread to a big fire.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Bourses to Test Electronic Exchange System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Swiss bankers will carry out a
full-scale test of electronic exchange system on June 29, the
success of which will put an end to the traditional floor trading
of Swiss stocks, local press reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The test will re-run electronically the trading session of June
21. If successful, Swiss stock traders in Geneva, Zurich and Basel
will begin as early as on August 2 to work through computer
terminals in their banks without coming to the exchange.
</P>
<P>
Trading in foreign shares, which represents 8 percent of the
total volume, has been carried out with the Swiss Electronic
Exchange System since last December, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The project is aimed at enhancing the international
competitiveness of Switzerland as a key financial center for
particularly international asset management. The country now deals
with some 40 percent of global cross-border asset management for
private clients.
</P>
<P>
The electronic system is required to react to a trading order
in less than two seconds for at least 90 percent of the time and
be able to deal with up to six orders each second.
</P>
<P>
Due to technical problems, Swiss bankers failed to introduce
the system for all tradings last year. The delay has made the
Swiss Exchange lose some 1 million Swiss francs (800,000
U.S. dollars) per month over the past one and a half years.
</P>
<P>
Local press said that the total cost of the project is likely
to double the original estimate to reach 200 million Swiss francs,
or 160 million dollars at last.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Plays Duty-bound Role for HK Prosperity (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong and neighboring
Guangdong Province are set to integrate to become the most dynamic
economic hub throughout the Asia Pacific region, a senior Chinese
official said.
</P>
<P>
The economic development of south China's Guangdong Province
and neighboring Hong Kong will gradually integrate into a whole,
said Lu Ruihua, governor of Guangdong, in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong to China in 1997 provides a rare
historical opportunity for the development of both sides, said Lu.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong is incomparably superior to other Chinese provinces
in its economic cooperation with Hong Kong and Macao as the three
areas are close neighbors and share the same language and customs,
said Lu, a native of Chaozhou City and a post-graduate of
Zhongshan University.
</P>
<P>
It is a duty-bound responsibility for Guangdong to make fresh
contributions to the peaceful transition of power in Hong Kong,
and to its sustained stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Referring to economic cooperation between Hong Kong and
Guangdong, the governor said that his province introduced 53
billion US dollars-worth of investment from overseas last year.
</P>
<P>
About 39 billion US dollars, or 75 percent of the total
investment, came from Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80 percent of overseas-funded factories and 90 percent
of businesses engaged in production were started in Guangdong by
Hong Kong businesses.
</P>
<P>
The scope of cooperation between the two sides has expanded
from previous processing industries, to trade and commerce,
finance, securities, infrastructure, agriculture and high
technology.

<P>
The governor noted that the two regions have different social
systems, ideologies and ways of life. Therefore, Guangdong should
respect Hong Kong's right to enjoy a high degree of autonomy and
its special characteristics in economic, cultural and social
development.
</P>
<P>
It should act in accordance with the basic law and the
principle of "one country, two systems" and make local practice
compatible with international norms, he added.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the per capita Gross Domistic Product (GDP)
of Guangdong is expected to be three times the 1980 figure. This
is conducive to the development of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
On future development, Lu said that his province is to use 40
billion US dollars-worth of overseas investment in the next five
years. It offers bright prospects for Hong Kong to participate in
the key project construction and service trade developments in
Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's economy is now in a transition period which is
heading for hi-tech development, while Guangdong possesses a large
contingent of scientists and experienced technicians and a huge
market.
</P>
<P>
He called on both sides to supply each other's need and enhance
cooperation in the fields of finance, trade, information,
navigation and tourism.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Presents Lebed to National Security Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
presented general Alexander Lebed to the powerful national
Security Council as its new chief today, and outlined the main
concerns he expects Lebed and other council members to deal with.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, 46, was appointed by Yeltsin on Tuesday as the head of
the Security Council and his national security assistant after
polling a third with 14.70 percent of votes in the first round of
the Russian presidential elections held on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In return, Lebed promised that most of his supporters would
vote for Yeltsin in the forthcoming second round of voting to help
the president beat his archrival, Communist Party leader Gennady
Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
Chairing the meeting of the Security Council in the Kremlin,
Yeltsin said that Lebed will be personally in charge of
strengthening the security of the society and individual members,
as well as the political stability in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said it was not allowed to limit or stop the supplies
of fuel and energy resources to army units and other military
installations, including those which pose a high threat to the
environment.
</P>
<P>
The president told Lebed and Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, another key member of the council, to implement an
early-issued decree to ensure fuel supply to military units and
installations.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also stressed the need to deal severely with offenders
abusing the federal financial resources and called for making a
thrifty use of every rouble in the budget.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Consultations are Right Option in Settling Sino-US Differences: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman
Shen Guofang said here today that consultations on an equal
footing are the right option in settling differences between China
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement this afternoon at a routine press
conference in reply to a question concerning the recent Sino-US
agreement on Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) protection.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that protecting IPR and rigorously cracking down on
IPR infringements are the requirement of China's own reform and
opening up, its economic growth and scientific and technological
advancement. The tremendous efforts and remarkable achievement
China has made in this regard are universally acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
On the IPR issues between China and the US, he said, the
Chinese side, from the very beginning, has stood firmly opposed to
the US practice of exerting pressure on and imposing trade
retaliation against China under the pretext of IPR issues. During
this round of talks, the spokesman said, the Chinese delegation
upheld principles and safeguarded China's sovereignty and
interests.
</P>
<P>
With regard to those differences between the two countries,
Shen noted, China holds that they should be settled through
consultations on an equal footing with a constructive approach,
adding that exerting pressures and imposing sanctions or
retaliation are of no avail at all. "The fact that China and the
US reached agreement on IPR issues denotes that dialogue on an
equal footing and friendly consultations are the right option," he
continued.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that China does not want to see the
recurrence of such threat of sanctions and retaliation at will,
adding that a healthy and stable development of Sino-US relations
serves the interest of both sides.

<HEADLINE> PowerPC Union to Exploit China's Chip Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Two state-level computer research
and development bodies of China will cooperate with three US
multinational firms, Apple, IBM and Motorola, to develop domestic
computer hardware markets.
</P>
<P>
This week, the National Research Center for Intelligent
Computing Systems (NCICS) and the Institute of Software under the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), together with China's largest
computer company, Legend Group, publicly showed their support of
PowerPC chips as a standard computer platform, rather than the
widely-used Intel products.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the six partners launched a national association,
PowerPC Consortium, for China's PowerPC adherents.
</P>
<P>
Yan Yiyun, vice president of CAS, said that with the evolution
of RISC and multimedia and networking technologies, great changes
have affected some "elementary concepts" of the global computer
industry. Not confined by out-dated technologies, China can
more easily develop a computer industry on the basis of new
technical breakthroughs than western nations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the PowerPC chip jointly developed by Apple, IBM
and Motorola is compatible with China's desire to attain modern
computing technology.
</P>
<P>
The PowerPC Consortium will recruit members from domestic firms
for computer system manufacturing, application software developing
and system integrating, as well as computer users from all walks
of life. The goal of the association will be promoting the
use of PowerPC and enhancing the software developing on basis of
this chip.
</P>
<P>
Industrial analysts said that China's demand for computer chips
will quickly catch up with the double-digit growth of the whole
industry. Official statistics show that the number of personal
computers in China exceeded one million by the end of last year,
and will hit eight million in 2000. Of these, five million are for
household use.

<HEADLINE> Firefighting Monks in Monastery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 20 (Xinhua) -- For years, Baoguang Monastery in
southwest China's Sichuan province has eluded the threat of fire,
thanks to a voluntary fire brigade formed by the monastery's monks.
</P>
<P>
Located in the north of Xindu county, Baoguang Monastery was
first built in the East Han Dynasty (25-220) and was named
Baoguang (divine light) Monastery in the Tang Dynasty (618-907).
</P>
<P>
The monastery consists of one pagoda, five halls and 16 yards.
</P>
<P>
Historical relics in the monastery include the famous Stupa (a
dome-shaped Buddhist shrine), built during the Tang Dynasty, the
"Eight Hundred Buddha Hall" and many works by famous painters and
calligraphers from different Chinese dynasties.
</P>
<P>
The monastery receives five million domestic and overseas
visitors each year.
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to fireproof a monastery, as monks cook their
meals and about 100,000 people visit daily.
</P>
<P>
The monastery, where 130 monks live, formed a 80-member
firefighting brigade in 1989, the first and the only monk fire
brigade in the country.
</P>
<P>
The monastery's "Zhike," who is in charge of propaganda and
reception, said that each year the monastery spends more than
500,000 yuan from ticket sales on training firefighters and buying
new firefighting equipment.
</P>
<P>
A highway connects the interior roads of the monastery with
highways.
</P>
<P>
It has become a must for newly-recruited monks to learn fire
service knowledge, and professional firefighters are regularly
invited to the monastery to give lectures on firefighting.

<HEADLINE> Senior Propaganda Official Urges Further Drive of Education on Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior party propaganda official
urged various departments, sectors and localities to further the
country's national campaign on law education and to increase the
public awareness of law.
</P>
<P>
Xu Guangchun, deputy head of the Central Propaganda Department
of the Communist Party of China(CPC), made the request at the
conclusion of the four-day national conference on the educational
campaign that will extend through the next five years.
</P>
<P>
"To enhance the public awareness of law is more important than
teaching legal knowledge," he said, "for only after the general
level of awareness of law among all the citizens is improved
could the mood of thinking and codes of conduct of rule of law in
personal as well as in social and political affairs prevail in the
society."
</P>
<P>
"It must be made clear that our educational drive will not turn
everybody into a judge or a lawyer, but we must have the general
level of public awareness of law increased dramatically," he said.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that such educational efforts should also be stepped up
for party and government officials, and a supervisory mechanism
put in place to strengthen their efforts to administer state
affairs according to law.
</P>
<P>
Officials' awareness of law has improved, but there do exist
some officials who are still used to personal domination over the
law, or who abuse their power and distort the implementation of
the law, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
Such negative instances undermine the authority of law and
affect the public's desire to study law and make use of it, the
deputy head said.
</P>
<P>
"They have become a difficult problem in the educational
campaign on the knowledge of law," Xu said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to educating officials about law, the public should
also be organized to study such laws as the Administrative
Procedural Law, which supervises the conduct of officials who deal
with complex laws that affect society, he said.
</P>
<P>
Xu asked that all efforts be accelerated to improve the
mechanism for rule of law, and to let the public learn legal
concepts through practical application.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Justice Xiao Yang attended today's meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Remains of ancient dams, buildings
and drainages have been found at the site of the Pujin Ferry,
where the earliest floating bridge along the Yellow River was
built.
</P>
<P>
Located in Yongji County in north China's Shanxi Province,
the floating bridge was completed more than 2,500 years ago and
was used for about 1,900 years until 1369, in the Ming Dynasty
(1368-1644).
</P>
<P>
At the site, Chinese archaeologists found dam remains from the
Tang (618-907) and Ming dynasties, a 3.3-m-wide stone paved pass
from the Song Dynasty (960-1279), coins from Tang and Jin
(1115-1234) dynasties, and Jin building foundations.
</P>
<P>
The experts paid special attention to the Ming dam, which was
constructed with wooden pillars connected with iron ingots.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the discoveries will help them study the history
of construction methods.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Maintain Stable Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The economic growth of China's
leading industrial city Shanghai is expected to remain at a speed
of 12 to 13 percent in the second half this year, according to a
spokesman for Shanghai Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
He said the city's economy will develop at a stable speed on
the basis of rapid economic development in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The official believed that with the deepening of reform, the
management conditions of many enterprises in the second half of
this year will be improved.
</P>
<P>
In addition, real estate and commerce industries are to achieve
new developments, and many factories will make more effort to
develop new products in a bid to take over bigger share of market.
</P>
<P>
The main problems for Shanghai economic development now are
that as the sale of industrial products declines, the city lacks
social purchasing power, and the economic returns of a number
state-owned enterprises are reduced.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of this year, Shanghai realized 106.29
billion yuan (some 12.8 billion U.S. dollars) of domestic national
product, 11.6 percent up over last year's same period.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the industrial output value reached
198.32 billion yuan (about 24 billion dollars), 14.9 percent
higher over last year's same period.
</P>
<P>
At the same time Shanghai's export and contracted value of
foreign investment witnessed 11.3 percent and 26.8 percent of
increases.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Strengthens Control on Privately-Run Economic Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- China's leading industrial city
Shanghai has shut down and suspended operations of four
sub-standard privately-run economic zones in Shanghai's suburbs.
</P>
<P>
At the same time another 24 privately-run economic zones run in
10 Shanghai suburban districts and counties have amalgamated with
valid economic zones.
</P>
<P>
The number of economic zones in Shanghai has been reduced from 81
to 53 so far.
</P>
<P>
In a related development the operation licenses of nearly 1,100
privately-run enterprises in the 28 economic zones were cancelled
because of their alleged illegal management.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai suburbs had established too many privately-run
economic zones, which led to unfair and disordered competition.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to control the situation, Shanghai government
launched from the end of last year, a large-scale operation to
rectify the situation of privately-run economic zones.
</P>
<P>
The city now has standardized the registration of enterprises
in privately-run zones. Any individual who wants to establish
enterprises must have valid certifications to prove that they are
unemployed, and they are required to have enought funds.
</P>
<P>
The industrial and commercial departments and tax departments
also strengthened their administration over the privately-run
enterprises in the zones.

<HEADLINE> A More Open Yangtze River Delta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese Yaohan International
Group has moved its headquarters from Hong Kong to this China's
largest city, and has permission from the Chinese government to
undertake extensive retail business dealings in the Yangtze River
Delta.
</P>
<P>
Yaohan is the first overseas giant to be headquartered on the
Chinese mainland, and has opened in the delta about 27
jointly-funded shops, a manufacturing plant solely funded by
Yaohan, and some fast food restaurants.
</P>
<P>
This move indicates China's market has become more open to
overseas investors, with overseas investors permitted into the
commercial retail industry through establishing joint ventures,
economic analysts said.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 65 billion US dollars in overseas investment has
been poured into Shanghai's commercial and service industry, with
700 projects launched, and that investment increased by half in
the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors are also encouraged to become involved in
local infrastructure projects, such as building bridges, subways,
railways, power plants and ports. Overseas investment in such
fields in the delta has amounted to six billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
To date, overseas investment has expanded to pillar industries
in the delta region such as automobiles, telecommunications,
computers, household appliances, metallurgy, chemicals and
textiles.
</P>
<P>
The region has so far approved 55,000 overseas-funded
businesses, with 70 percent of them being industrial ones.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, agriculture, financial industry, real estate, and
the health and medicare industry are all opened to overseas
investors. Shanghai now leads the country in attracting overseas
banking cooperative partners by having 40 overseas banking
institutions and 119 overseas representative offices.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment has become a driving force in the local
economy, which totalled 88 billion US dollars in contractual
value, an industry source said.
</P>
<P>
Both overseas investors and their Chinese partners have
benefited from the opening of Yangtze River Delta, said Xu
Kuangdi, Shanghai's mayor.
</P>
<P>
And more than 80 percent of the 27,500 foreign-funded
enterprises in operation have entered into a "profit-gaining"
period, a local economic analyst said.
</P>
<P>
"Our company will be able to earn 300 million US dollars in
profits over the coming five years, and all of the profits will be
used as re-investment in China," said Yaohan's President Kazuo
Wada.

<HEADLINE> Artistic Carving on Leaves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese artist in east China's
Jiangsu Province has created a carving art which use the leaves of
trees as raw material.
</P>
<P>
Huang Taisheng, 46, a resident of Taizhou City in Jiangsu,
started leaf carving 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
On a summer's day in 1985, Huang happened to pick up a fallen
leaf on which worms had etched a piece of painting.
</P>
<P>
"What a striking similarity to a map of China," he thought with
excitement.
</P>
<P>
From then on, Huang began to carve paintings and calligraphic
works on the leaves of willow, elm, white poplar, Chinese
scholartree, and on the petals of yulan magnolia flowers.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the leaves from rotting, losing their color or
dehydrating, he developed a medical liquid to keep the leaves
vivid and sound.
</P>
<P>
He finished his first carving work on a piece of Chinese
parasol tree leaf in 1993, featuring a print-portrayal of Lu Xun,
a famous writer from the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
Leaf-carving often includes 64 complicated courses in
order. Tools consist of needles, scalpels, scissors, tweezers, oil
painting brushes, and magnifiers.
</P>
<P>
Huang usually draws paintings on the leaves before carving the
leaf blade or vein.
</P>
<P>
His leaf carvings range from figure portrays, Buddha pictures,
folk paintings, paper-cut works, and traditional Chinese paintings
and calligraphic works.
</P>
<P>
Huang has so far completed several hundred leaf-carvings, with
many of them collected by museums and art agencies nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 of his translucent and flexible art works have earned a
place in the Guinness Book of World Records, and at the same time,
Huang was honored as the world's first artist to create a unique
carving art on green leaves.
</P>
<P>
Huang has also used gold-plating technology on his works which
makes the leaf carving more glorious and beautiful.
</P>
<P>
Huang plans to hold exhibitions to display his carving works,
and set up business to develop this special art.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment in Tianjin to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, one of China's hottest
investment spots, ratified 570 foreign-funded enterprises during
the first five months this year, bringing the total to nearly
10,000.
</P>
<P>
The new enterprises approved this year involve more than 2.1
billion US dollars in contractual investments, 1.7 billion US
dollars of which are overseas funds, rising 13.7 percent over the
same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
And nearly 60 percent of the 570 enterprises are wholly owned
by overseas investors, with contractual investment reaching 867
million US dollars, nearly two times the figure reported in the
same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The number of foreign exclusively-owned enterprises is expected
to rise in the north China's largest port city.
</P>
<P>
During the January-May period, 64 Sino-foreign joint ventures
added a total of 383 million US dollars-worth of overseas
investment, in a bid to increase economic returns during their
profitable periods.
</P>
<P>
Among the newly-established enterprises this year, 72 cost more
than five million US dollars each.
</P>
<P>
The foreign-funded enterprises in Tianjin employ 200,000
people, and half of the local revenue comes from taxes levied on
the enterprises.

<HEADLINE> HK to Seize Assets of Notorious Drug Trafficker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong authorities are to
confiscate some 26 million HK dollars (3.3 million US dollars)
worth of assets belonging to one of the world's most notorious
drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
A report in today's Eastern Express said that detectives from
the police Financial Investigations Unit are expected to apply for
a seizure order later this year to confiscate 26 Million HK
dollars in property, cash, antiques and jewels belonging to
international fugitive Lee Chau-ping, dubbed the "Ice Queen".
</P>
<P>
The move comes after Canadian authorities confiscated assets
worth 1.4 million Canadian dollars (7.9 million HK dollars) from
Lee, believed to be still hiding in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Lee's assets in Hong Kong have been held under a restraining
order since September 1992.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who has been on the run since 1992, was the mastermind
behind a Hong Kong-based worldwide drug smuggling ring. Her
syndicate trafficked in the deadly drug "ice" and shipped it to
the Philippines in karaoke machines.

<HEADLINE> ICRC To End Food Distribution in S.Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN,JUNE 20 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) is to end its cross border food distribution
operations in Sierra Leone at the end of June, diplomatic sources
said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The international organisation was granted permission in March
by the Sierra Leonean authorities to deliver food to thousands of
starving civilians caught behind rebel lines in the Kailahun
district.
</P>
<P>
According to a western diplomat here, the reason for the
pending stoppage remains unclear and ''there is a risk that many
people will starve.''
</P>
<P>
An ICRC official confirmed that the organisation has been
notified but declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The food delivery had saved thousands of civilians who were on
the brink of starvation, says the Sierra Leone Red Cross
coordinator Samuel Ngombu.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC is continuing its relief assistance in Segbwema in
the east by distributing seeds to farmers while in Zimmi, near the
border with Liberia, it is distributing food items to 18,000
displaced people including recent arrivals who are fleeing
renewed fighting in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports reaching here early Thursday said local
militias have raided a rebel base near Yauyema in the south and
freed over 100 civilians and retrieving looted goods from the
camp.
</P>
<P>
According to Alimamy Jalloh, one of those freed by the
militias, the rebels has said the civilians will be used as human
shields if they are attacked.
</P>
<P>
He said they had been captured two days ago from outlying
towns in the Moyamba district. enditem

<HEADLINE> Credit Rating Reaffirmed for Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Standard and Poor's, one of the
major international credit rating agencies, today reaffirmed its
rating on the Philippines' long-term local currency debt and
foreign currency debt.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here this afternoon, the Philippine
Finance Department said the Philippines managed to maintain its
BBB+ rating on its long-term local currency debt.
</P>
<P>
A BBB+ rating means that a country can meet its long-term
obligation on time, but there is no assurance that the long-term
prospects will be maintained as sudden adverse changes in economic
conditions could disrupt the growth momentum.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Department said the rating on the Philippines'
long-term foreign currency debt was unchanged at BB, which means
that the ability of the country to service its long-term foreign
debt is still doubtful.
</P>
<P>
The Standard and Poor's also maintained its rating of A-2 on
the Philippines' short-term local currency debt, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The rating agency said in a statement that the Philippines
failed to get an upgrade due to its limited fiscal flexibility,
low savings and investment rates and vulnerability of the balance
of payments to international financial bodies.
</P>
<P>
As the fiscal sector is constrained by a complex tax code and
poor compliance, the Philippines' tax efforts remained at 16
percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), lower than other
Asian economies, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
"Public debt of 70 percent of the GDP and inflexible payroll
costs, which absorb nearly 40 percent of recurrent revenues, leave
insufficient resources to adequately address the country's
pressing infrastructure and social needs," it said.
</P>
<P>
The agency also said that the Philippines' low savings rate of
19 percent of the GDP and investment ratio of 22 percent of the
GDP were not enough to ensure a sustained economic growth.

rights to self-determination and to set up an independent state of
Palestine.
</P>

Vietnam welcomes the convening of the Middle East peace
conference and the Arab-Israeli talks on the basis of the U.N
Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, the Vietnamese leaders

<HEADLINE> US Businessmen See Bright Future for HK Beyond 1997 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will continue to be an
appealing place to do business beyond 1997, as viewed by most
American investors who have built up deep-rooted interest in Hong
Kong over the past half a century.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 American companies are now operating in the
region, with a total cumulative direct investment estimated at 12
billion US dollars, third behind China and Britain, according to
sources from the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong
(AmCham).
</P>
<P>
The US has been the second largest external investor in Hong
Kong's manufacturing industry since 1990. It is overtaken by Japan
and has come to the fourth in terms of direct investment in
non-manufacturing sectors.
</P>
<P>
Among all external investors, the United States has the largest
number of regional or sub-regional headquarters based in Hong
Kong, estimated at 400.
</P>
<P>
The US is Hong Kong's second largest trading partner, with
total trade of up to 21.2 billion US dollars in 1994; Hong Kong is
not only an important market for the US, but also serves as an
important re-export zone for Sino-US trade.
</P>
<P>
Based on the deep-rooted American interest here, the view of
the future of Hong Kong appears to be prospective, said Mark
Michelson, chairman of AmCham, who has been working in Hong Kong
for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
Michelson cited a latest annual confidence survey conducted by
the AmCham in November last year, which shows how American
businessmen see the future.
</P>
<P>
In an answer to a question -- what's your outlook for business
in Hong Kong over the next five years, 91 percent that have
replied said they are favorable or very favorable of Hong Kong.
More than half of AmCham members responded to the survey.
</P>
<P>
"It's reasonably a good evidence that there is confidence that
Hong Kong will be an appealing place to do business in a
foreseeable future," Michelson told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The overall prospective view was also reflected in statistics
provided by the AmCham -- the US direct investment in Hong Kong
grew at an average rate of 22 percent per year between 1989 and
1994, and during the same period American direct investment all
over the world rose by 13 percent annually.

<HEADLINE> US Businessmen See Bright Future for HK Beyond 1997 (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michelson said that in recent years the focus of US investment
has shifted in tandem with the change of Hong Kong's economic
structure from manufacturing to services industry.
</P>
<P>
Finance and insurance, petroleum, construction, air and water
transportation, communication, retail operations and wholesale
trading are the hot spots that the US investors have poured huge
amounts of money in.
</P>
<P>
The inflow in finance and insurance jumped by a whooping 93
percent in one year's time to three billion US dollars in 1994
after a continued surge since 1989. Big names in US securities
industry or investment funds sectors, like Solomon, Goldman Sachs,
Templeton, Fidelity and Banks Trust, have all clustered in Hong
Kong to capture high returns from the booming Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
What makes Hong Kong more attractive than other places in the
region is partly because of the availability of fast, efficient
and reliable information on a lot of subjects, not just about Hong
Kong and the Chinese mainland, but also about Asia or even the
whole world, said Michelson.
</P>
<P>
He believed that Hong Kong will continue to prosper up to 1997
and beyond if the key elements that have made Hong Kong a success
can be ensured, such as rule of law, free flow of information and
freedom of movement.
</P>
<P>
After July 1, 1997, Hong Kong will play an increasingly
important role as a middleman for Sino-US trade, predicted
Michelson. The free trade port handled two thirds of China's
exports to the US and one third US exports to China in 1993, and
the entrepot trade will prosper to an even greater extent in the
years to come.
</P>
<P>
The US has strong presence in Hong Kong not only in the aspect
of economic interest, but also in the number of US residents.
Michelson's family are among the estimated 34,000 permanent or
temporary US residents in Hong Kong. In comparison, there are
approximately 25,000 Canadian residents and even fewer British.
</P>
<P>
Michelson has two children, both born and educated in Hong
Kong. He hoped to become a permanent resident in Hong Kong after
July 1, 1997. "I will according to the Basic Law," he added. As a
consultant in a public affairs company, he helps multinationals to
gain access to the newly emerging markets in Asia.
</P>
<P>
He expected to see the smooth transition and continued
prosperity of Hong Kong, which he believed will benefit all and
can be achieved through joint efforts of all concerned.

Speaking to reporters after their talks in Cape Town, Mandela

There had been a time when the African National Congress stood
alone against the apartheid state, said the president, adding
Cuba was also assisting South Africa in the transformation
process by sending doctors to ease the shortage in some parts of
the country and through other forms of aid.
</P>
<P>
Robaina, arrived in South Africa on Wednesday, was paying a
five-day official visit to the country aimed at strengthening
bilateral relations between the two countries.

Robaina said despite diplomatic relations between the two
countries having been established only recently, relations
between Cuba and South Africa have had a long history.
</P>
<P>
He said Cuba had also experienced difficult times, but Africa
had always ''been with us''.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Dismisses Three Senior Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
dismissed three senior officials today after an incident described
by the new security supremo Alexander Lebed as a "mutiny" aimed at
disrupting another round of polls.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin sacked his personal security chief Alexander Korzhakov
and Federal Security Service director Mikhail Barsukov. First
Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, viewed as a close friend of
Korzhakov, was dismissed too.
</P>
<P>
"With the aim of strengthening and renewing the (presidential)
team I have relieved First Deputy Chairman of the government
Soskovets, head of the Federal Security Service Barsukov and head
of the security service of the president Korzhakov," Yeltsin told
reporters here.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "it is necessary to change the staff."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin decided to dismiss them after a brief meeting with
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin immediately after a meeting of
the Security Council this morning at which its new chief Lebed was
introduced.
</P>
<P>
"I have always been reproached for Barsukov, Korzhakov,
Soskovets. Should the president work for them? The power
structures should be replaced. They began to take too much on them
and to give too little," he added.
</P>
<P>
Experts here believe the dismissal was caused by the overnight
detention of two key members of Yeltsin's election team, Sergei
Lisovsky and Arkady Yevstafyev.
</P>
<P>
The arrest and release of the two men were reportedly carried
out on orders of Korzhakov and Barsukov.
</P>
<P>
They said the two men were arrested for taking out a large sum
of money in hard currency from the government building without
prior permission.
</P>
<P>
However, Yeltsin said today that the dismissal was not linked
to the incident, noting it was "a technical error."
</P>
<P>
Korzhakov, known as the "Grey Cardinal" in the Kremlin because
of his close links to the president, shocked the country when he
said a month ago that Russian presidential elections should be
postponed.
</P>
<P>
Lebed warned today that any attempts to disrupt presidential
elections would be dealt with without mercy.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin did not name the possible successors to the three key
posts.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong to Implement New Regulation on Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The provincial government of
Guangdong in south China is to implement a new regulation on
unemployment and pension insurance on July 1.
</P>
<P>
People working in joint ventures and private businesses will
enjoy the same treatment as state employees in unemployment
insurance, according to the new regulation.
</P>
<P>
Staff laid off will enjoy insurance payments, and a higher sum
has been set to ensure their basic living standards, said an
official.
</P>
<P>
For people working in governmental departments and institutions
a pension insurance system will be carried out, taking into
consideration people's working period, as well as price rises.
</P>
<P>
Economically booming Guangdong Province is a piloting province
to carry out social security measures.
</P>
<P>
Between 1991 and 1995 the province implemented eight rules and
regulations on social security.
</P>
<P>
With no national law on social security arrangements Guangdong
will work out more rules and regulations to legalize social
security, and raise people's awareness, said Zhong Qiquan, a
vice-governor in charge of social security affairs.
</P>
<P>
A good social security system plays the role of maintaining
social stability and hence boosts economic growth.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century the province will establish an
overall social security system covering all urban and rural
workers in various economic sectors, the vice-governor said.

BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin today met a
group of military personnel who won prizes for major achievements
in developing military technology.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission,
urged the prize winners to make greater contributions to the
modernization of the army and the country in general.
</P>
<P>
"Science and technology are leading productive forces", the
president quoted Deng Xiaoping as saying, calling this an
important point of Deng's theory.
</P>
<P>
For that, Jiang said, the Central Military Commission put
forward the strategy of strengthening the armed forces by
promoting science and technology, the same as that put forth by
the Party Central Committee to build up the nation by developing
science and education.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is imperative to resort to the progress of
science and technology as a way to quicken the pace of military
modernization, as well as the country's economic construction.
</P>
<P>
In future competition in the world, those mastering advanced
science and technology will easily gain advantage and initiative,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged military scientists to learn from the old
generation of scientists and make fresh achievements in developing
military science and technology, saying that the award-giving
system set up by the Central Military Commission is meant for just
that purpose. enditem

NEW DELHI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The personal computer (PC)
market in India has recorded a booming 80 percent growth in the
fiscal year of 1995-96 (April-March), the Indian Express reported
today.

<HEADLINE> Over Half of Pudong's Overseas Investment from HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Eight billion U.S.dollars - over
half of the total overseas investment - which has poured into
Shanghai's Pudong New Area since 1990 came from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Among the 55 countries and regions which have invested in
Pudong, the combined investments from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan
reached more than nine billion U.S.dollars, latest statistics have
shown.
</P>
<P>
It represents over 60 percent of the total money spent in the
boom area of China's largest city.
</P>
<P>
Experts in Shanghai attribute this to the fact that to Hong
Kong business people, Pudong is the best place in the world to
invest. This is because of its resources of talented people and
industrial advantage, in addition to the close cultural background
between Shanghai and the three areas.
</P>
<P>
Among the New Area's 2,000 projects involving investment from
HK, Macao and Taiwan, more than half of them have jointly been set
up with Shanghai's large or medium-sized state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Those co-operative projects usually begin to yield good
economic profits one year after the co-operation, thanks to
Shanghai enterprises' updated technology and extensive marketing
network, and Hong Kong's fund and management experience.
</P>
<P>
Real estate investment is another hot field for overseas
investors in Shanghai. So far they have set up more than 100 real
estate-oriented companies, with a total investment topping four
billion U.S.dollars.

<HEADLINE> Singapore External Trade Expands in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's external trade grew
by 10.2 percent in May on a three-month moving average basis, with
oil exports continuing its strong growth at 26.7 percent, the
Singapore Trade Development Board (TDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil domestic exports rose by 10.5 percent to about 5.36
billion US dollars, while re-exports increased by 9.2 percent to
reach 4.2 billion US dollars, it said.
</P>
<P>
On a monthly basis, non-oil domestic exports expanded by nine
percent in May and re-exports grew by 5.2 percent, it added.
</P>
<P>
The TDB said that strong demand for computer and
computer-related products continued to boost the growth in non-oil
domestic exports to the US and Japan, by 19.5 percent and 29.5
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, non-oil domestic exports to the EU market moderated
to 3.1 percent because of the weak economic conditions in major EU
member countries, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Domestic exports of oil expanded by 26.7 percent to reach one
billion US dollars in May, due mainly to the strong growth in oil
exports to Hong Kong, mostly for subsequent re-exports to China,
the TDB said.
</P>
<P>
In re-exports, the increase continued to come from computer
parts and peripherals, printers, integrated circuits, disk drives
and TVs and parts.
</P>
<P>
Imports rose by 9.1 percent to reach nearly 11 billion US
dollars in May, thanks largely to the growth in computer parts and
peripherals, disk drives, blank computer tapes and discs and color
TVs and parts, it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian International Trade
and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz today urged Malaysian companies
to set the world market as the ultimate target for their goods.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on "Current Export Market Challenges"
here, Rafidah said there were still many local companies which
merely concentrated on the domestic market and production of
import substitutes.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah told the seminar that Malaysia's exports increased
almost five-fold from 35.3 billion Malaysian Ringgit (about 14.12
billion US dollars) in 1986 to 185.3 billion Ringgit (about 74.12
billion dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said dependence on the domestic market could only be
seen as a short-term and restrictive measure, and Malaysian
companies should plan new strategies and measures to be aggressive
in taking advantage of available opportunities in the world
market.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's import and export volume in 1995 reached 150 billion
dollars, making Malaysia one of the leading importers and
exporters internationally.

<HEADLINE> Health Standard of Indigenous Australians Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The gap between the health
standards of Australia's indigenous and non-indigenous people was
widening, particularly for women, a major health report revealed
today.
</P>
<P>
Launching "The Australia's Health 1996" report, Federal Health
Minister Michael Wooldridge said the standard of health in the
indigenous community was the worst indictment of the nation's
health.
</P>
<P>
The report, produced by the Australian Institute of Health and
Welfare, said the death rate of all Australians decreased by about
10 percent between 1988 and 1994, but remained steady among
Aboriginal men and increased among Aboriginal women.
</P>
<P>
Rates of death from circulatory disease, infectious disease,
injury and poisoning, and mental disorders all dropped in
indigenous men during the same period, but not for indigenous
women.
</P>
<P>
Diabetes remained one of the greatest killers of indigenous
people, with Aboriginal and Islanders in Torres Strait (most
northeast of the country) death rates 12 times higher for men and
17 times higher for women than rates for other Australians.
</P>
<P>
And life expectancies for indigenous men and women remain about
15 to 20 years below those of other Australians.
</P>
<P>
While launching the report, Health Minister Wooldridge
reaffirmed his commitment to improving the health of Aborigines
and Torres Strait Islanders, but warned it would take the best
part of a generation and hard work.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand Cautious over Interest Rates Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is cautious in cutting
interest rates to prop up the country's slower exports amid
worries that the measure may re-feed inflation.
</P>
<P>
Thai Financial Minister Bodi Chunnannanda recently indicated
that all interest rates, in particular the lending rate, must be
lowered to energize local manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Lower lending rate may help Thai manufacturers to bring down
their production costs and make their products more competitive in
the world market, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister has asked the central bank to cut interest rates,
but he cautioned that the measure should be well-timed and other
measures should be prepared to ensure that it will not lead to
higher inflation.
</P>
<P>
The move is one of the measures planned by the government
recently to boost exports of Thai goods. It came at a time when
economists believed that the country's export growth target, set
at 18 percent for this year, could not be met owing to slower
exports in the first four months.
</P>
<P>
The Banharn government earlier has made a request to the
central bank to consider cutting interest rates, indicating high
interest rates have made manufacturing activities and private
investment slow down.
</P>
<P>
But the bank declined it, contending the country was being
under inflation pressure.
</P>
<P>
The central bank began its implementation of a tight monetary
policy in March 1995, maintaining high interest rates in an effort
to control inflation and high current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
The central bank earlier indicated that it would cut interest
rates only when inflation and deficit have improved in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Currently, leading local commercial banks, such as the Bangkok
Bank, Thai Farmers Bank, Krung Thai Bank, Siam Commercial Bank,
and Bank of Ayudhya, post a lending rate at a four-year high of
13.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bodi said inflation currently has declined remarkably and it
posted 6.1 percent in May against 7.4 percent in December last
year. The situation gives the central bank more room to cut
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Some opposition parliament members doubted the government's
motive for micro-economy readjustment, saying the government
should not interfere with the independence of the central bank,
and rates cut should be decided by the bank alone because it all
depends on market mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
The rates cut will solely help the export sector, but domestic
consumption is ignored, they said.
</P>
<P>
Some bankers also questioned the merits of pushing for interest
rates cut, saying that high interest rates contributed partly to
exporters' costs and they were not the main factor behind the
slower exports in the past months.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the central bank will have to make tough decisions as
the side-effects of possible rates cut remain unclear.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government has

the country, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>

TOKYO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Japan's major trading house may

<HEADLINE> Two Forces in Yeltsin's Campaign Team at Daggers Drawn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Tensions between two groups in
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's campaign team appeared rather
obvious after the arrest of his two aides.
</P>
<P>
General Alexander Lebed, the newly-appointed head of the
Russian Security Council and presidential national security
assistant, today confirmed that two key members were arrested
Wednesday night and released the next morning.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Lisovsky and Arkady Yevstafyev had been arrested on
orders from Yeltsin's Security Chief Alexander Korzhakov and
Federal Security Service Chief Mikhail Barsukov, said sources
close to the president's election team.
</P>
<P>
Lisovsky is a wealthy advertising and showbusiness magnate who
organized pop concerts for Yeltsin and a widely praised
advertising campaign aimed at capturing the youth vote under the
slogan "Vote or Lose."
</P>
<P>
Yevstafyev is known as a close aide to former economic reform
chief Anatoly Chubais, who acted as one of the main organizers of
the president's campaign.
</P>
<P>
Lebed said in comment on the incident that any mutiny to scrap
the second round of presidential polls, scheduled for early July,
will be crushed ruthlessly.
</P>
<P>
"Someone wanted to disrupt the second round -- that's how it
seemed... I will sort this out. Any mutiny will be crushed
cruelly," he said in an interview with local television.
</P>
<P>
Lebed stressed that he would "not allow any violation of the
Constitution and will decisively cut short any action by the
security agencies aimed at destabilizing the political situation
in the country and the second round of the presidential
elections."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chubais said today that Korzhakov and Barsukov
should be sacked for trying to stage a coup by disrupting the
runoff.
</P>
<P>
However, Interfax quoted Korzhakov and Barsukov, who both
insisted that Yeltsin should stay in power without an election, as
saying that they arrested the two men for smuggling money out of
the White House government building without any political motive.
</P>
<P>
Korzhakov said last month that he wanted the election cancelled
or postponed.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin is taking a narrow three-point lead over Communist
leader Zyuganov after the first round of polls and his appointemnt
of Lebed, who ranked third in the election, is seen as an attempt
to attract Lebed's 11 million voters.

<HEADLINE> Official: Detention of Yeltsin Aides No Political Undertones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian Security Service chief
Mikhail Barsukov denied today that the detainment of Yeltsin's two
important campaign aides had any political undertones.
</P>
<P>
Barsukov told reporters that the two men, Arkady Yevstafyev and
Sergei Lisovsky, were detained at the control post in the
government house overnight since they "had a large sum of money in
hard currency without appropriate authorities documents."
</P>
<P>
"These two people were leaving the Government House with a box,
full of hard currency, and this drew attention of policemen at the
control post," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As for attempts to whip up the public and to lend the incident
political coloring, this is a downright provocation. This will be
quite clear some time later," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Alexander Korzhakov, head of the president's
security service, who reportedly issued the detainment order along
with Barsuko, told the press today somebody "tried to draw
secretary of the Russian Security Council Alexander Lebed into
this incident."
</P>
<P>
Lebed, newly appointed by Yeltsin as chief of security council
and president's national security assistant, warned today that he
would crush any mutiny to disrupt the second round of presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Lebed obtained the present post after taking third place with
14.70 percent of votes in the first round of the presidential
elections held on June 16, just behind Yeltsin, who won 35.06
percent of the votes and Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov,
who won 31.96 of the votes.

<HEADLINE> Denmark Pledges More Aid to Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Denmark will give more
financial aid to Tanzania, and has pledged 150 billion Tanzania
shillings (about 242 million U.S. Dollars) in the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
According to local press today, Danish ambassador to Tanzania
Flemming Pederson said here on Wednesday that from July this year
to 1999, Denmark would be releasing 29.9 billion T. Shillings
(Shs.). (48 million Dollars) every year which in the year 2000
will rise to 31 billion T. Shs.
</P>
<P>
The grant, released through the Danish International
Development Agency (DANIDA), would be used to improve health,
roads, agriculture and private sectors in the country.
</P>
<P>
Pederson said, however, that Denmark would continue to support
its projects in primary schools, drinking water, power
transmission and telecommunication for a few more years.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador also commended government reforms in the civil
service which are expected to take off on July 1, this year.
</P>
<P>
"I hope this important reform will lead to a change of
practices whereby donors (DANIDA included) on occasion engage
themselves in topping up of the regular government salaries,"
ambassador Pederson said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on DANIDA support in the isles, the ambassador
reaffirmed his government's support in primary education and
primary health for the remaining part of this year but could not
comment on plans beyond this December.

<HEADLINE> Iran Targets 6 Billion Dollars of Non-Oil Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran has set an ambitious target of
earning six billion U.S. dollars from non-oil exports in the
current Iranian calendar year starting from March 20, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Minister Yahya al-Oshaq said that realization of the
six-billion-dollar export target would be a great leap forward
provided necessary help and cooperation are offered by the
government to exporters.
</P>
<P>
According to the Persian daily "Iran," the minister said
that Persian rug exporters can use as much as 30 percent of
their foreign exchange earnings to import steel products to help
them cut prices of such items in the local market.
</P>
<P>
However, local specialists doubt very much about the new
target set by the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
Iran projected to earn 5.4 billion U.S. dollars from
non-oil exports in the previous year. However, it had finally
earned 2.8 billion U.S. dollars because of the tightened foreign
exchange policy.
</P>
<P>
The country earned 4.5 billion U.S. dollars from non-oil
exports in 1994.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Jordan Not Optimistic over Outcome of Cairo Summit (by Wen Xinnian) (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian society is not
optimistic about the outcome of the pan-Arab summit due to be
held in Cairo, Egypt in terms of mending inter-Arab rifts and
solving inter-Arab differences.
</P>
<P>
Jordanians share the widespread feeling among fellow Arabs that
the Cairo summit will be the first real test of their leaders'
resolve to overcome their differences and put their house in order
after six years of serious divisions and political estrangement.
</P>
<P>
They believe that the summit will do little to end Arab
divisions, given the lack of attendance at the highest level and
each country's preconceived ideas.
</P>
<P>
The Arab summit, to be convened at the end of this week, will
be spotlighted since it comes after right-wing Likud leader
Benjamin Netanyahu was elected Israel's new prime minister in late
May.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, a number of Arab countries
have already expressed reservations about the convening of the
summit, its timing and the circumstances surrounding its set-up.
</P>
<P>
Only 14 heads of state out of the 21 countries have accepted
the invitation and are expected to attend, which reflects the
political mood in the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
It is clear that lack of attendance at the highest level will
undermine the significance of the summit in bringing
reconciliation and putting an end to the political consequences
of the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's exclusion from the meeting is also expected to cast
a shadow over the participants and their agenda.
</P>
<P>
Observers here held that Iraq's exclusion already means that
the Gulf War file will remain open and that Arab reconciliation is
not even an issue for debate.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian columnists expressed dismay over the absence of Iraq
at the meeting. Iraq, as a founding member of the Arab League,
had every right to attend, they argued.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq is an important country, it is difficult to solve any
issue without its presence," said Fakhri Kawar, general secretary
of the General Union Arab Writers.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said that the preconceived ideas of each country
attending the summit will also prevent the summit from reaching
what it expects.
</P>
<P>
"Arab leaders are going to this summit having preconceived
ideas, differences and contradictions," said Kawar. "So I don't
think there are reasons for optimism."

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Jordan Not Optimistic over Outcome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Egyptians will try to steer the summit into lending its
support to countries that are working to achieve a just and
lasting peace in the region, and ask the Arabs to revive the
Arab League institutions, while the Palestinians, on their side,
will push the summit to recognize a Palestinian state with
Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
The Syrians hope to get the summit's approval for setting up a
trilateral committee of Syria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, to follow
up on the peace process and to prevent unilateral agreements with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, analysts here predicted that inter-Arab differences,
 especially the tense relations between Syrians and Palestinians,
Syria and Jordan, Syria and Bahrain will also surface at the
summit, which is described here as "Summit for Damascus."
</P>
<P>
Syria has reportedly demanded an official apology from Jordan
and the Palestinians for making peace individually with Israel,
but Jordan and the Palestinians rejected the request.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Jordan and Syria have become more
tense, especially as Jordanian security forces allegedly arrested
armed members of a group coming through the Syrian border.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian side will present these accusations to the
summit, well-informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
Syrian officials claimed recently that Jordan was making
contacts with Gulf states in a bid to put pressure on
Damascus to explain its alliance with Iran, which Bahrain
accused of being involved in subversion activities in the Gulf
emirate.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian sources confirmed that recent visits by a number of
senior Jordanian officials abroad were aimed at ensuring that
there is a core group of Arab states who want to see the Cairo
summit succeed in bridging Arab differences. They will try to see
that the summit will not be "hijacked" by Syria.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe other problems which will burden the agenda
of the summit are border conflicts between the Gulf states, and
between Saudi Arabia and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Jordanians voiced worry that the outcome of the summit will
prove the assertions of Israelis that "the summit will be
another honeymoon to sing the praises of Arab unity which will
be lost soon after."

<P>
XINING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The first bridge built over the
Yellow River has collapsed after falling into disrepair for years.
</P>
<P>
The bridge, 80 meters in length and 4.6 meters in width, was
opened in 1970 in northwest China's Qinghai Province, at the
source of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
With 18 stone piers, the bridge, eight tons in deadweight, is
located at the Gyaring Lake Township at Madoi County in Tibetan
Autonomous Prefecture of Golog.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities reinforced it in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The bridge collapsed when two heavy industrial trucks loaded
with salt crossed it. The collapse of the bridge has caused
disruption to local industry and the lives of the local
population. Rebuilding of the bridge is already well underway.

<HEADLINE> Order Returns to Multi-level Direct Selling Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Order has returned to China's once
disordered direct selling market, now that 41 Chinese and overseas
enterprises have been re-approved for business and even more firms
have been closed.
</P>
<P>
Under present government policies, these authorized
enterprises, including State-run firms, joint ventures and
solely-overseas-funded businesses, are only permitted to conduct
business within the locality of their registration. Pyramid
selling is strictly banned.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they can only deal in cosmetics, family
detergents, tonic products, health applicances, and clothing. They
are banned from selling gold and silver jewelry, pearls and pearl
jewelry, food, medicine, and consumer electronics.
</P>
<P>
Government authorities will not approve new enterprises
involved in multi-level direct selling before new regulations goes
into effect, according to Li Xiaokuan, a division chief of the
State Administration for Industry and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Since multi-level direct selling started operating on an
experimental basis, Central Governmental authorities have imposed
strict control over the market to avoid irregularities, Li
explained.
</P>
<P>
The business first entered China's coastal areas in the 1990s
and soon spread to dozens of cities across the country. Lack of
legislation and the immaturity of consumers resulted in illegal
practices that caused chaos in the market. The State Council in
October, 1995, issued an order demanding the immediate ceasing of
multi-level direct selling and the reexamination of the existing
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Since then, 163 such enterprises have been checked, resulting
in the revocation of 114 unauthorized enterprises and the handling
of more than 130 cases that showed evidence of irregularities.
</P>
<P>
Of the 49 authorized enterprises, 41 were re-approved.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen order within the market, departments concerned
are drafting regulations governing its supervision and
management.

<P>
CANBERRA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Olga Kuzenkova of Russia will be
stripped of her women's hammer world record because of a failure
by Australian officials to properly conduct a mandatory drug test,
a Sydney newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kuzenkova set a new record of 69.46 meters at a minor meeting
in Sydney four months ago but the distance will not be ratified by
World athletics ruling body IAAF after the mix-up, according to
the Sydney Morning Herald said.
</P>
<P>
Australian officials tested Kuzenkova's urine sample for
steroids but did not carry out tests for other banned stimulants,
as required under IAAF rules, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Kuzenkova shattered her own world record of 68.16 meters,
which she set in Moscow in June last year, with her second throw
at the New South Wales state championships at Homebush Stadium in
February.
</P>

The women's hammer will be introduced as an official

<HEADLINE> Investors are Cautious on India: Swiss Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investors, uncertain
about the prospects of further economic reforms, are adopting a
cautious approach towards investing in India, the Times of India
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The cautious approach being adopted by investors could affect
the capital mobilization of the corporate sector and result in a
decline in industrial growth," the newspaper quoted as saying an
economic study undertaken by the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS).
</P>
<P>
The UBS study attributed this "slowdown" to fears that the new
coalition government led by Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda might
find it hard to move ahead decisively on key reforms such as
privatization.
</P>
<P>
As a result of fast-paced reforms in the last four years, the
study continued, the momentum which has developed in the Indian
economy would continue for some time.
</P>
<P>
However, it pointed out that "a coalition government -- without
a clear mandate and with ideological opposition to some aspects of
the reform program -- is unlikely to initiate a bold reforms
program."
</P>
<P>
It said significant differences within the 13-party United
Front alliance on economic policies mean that some specific
decisions are likely to be harder to come by even if there is
unanimity on the need to continue with reforms in general.
</P>
<P>
The final outcome, in most cases, could be diluted compromises,
the study concluded.

KAMPALA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- President Yoweri Museveni said he
would soon to put out a hotline in the press to enable people to
report to him cases of official corruption, reported the local
daily "the New Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
Museveni who addressed over 1,500 businessmen here on
Wednesday was quoted as saying that he would urge Ugandans to
build political pressure against the police in order to rid them
of rampant corruption and inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
He described police as "inefficient, corrupt and unpatriotic,"
which should only be dealt with through political pressure.
</P>
<P>
The president said the pressure should be from lower local
councils and upwards.
</P>
<P>
Other departments mentioned by him in his speech as having
"parasites", included the Uganda Revenue Authority, Uganda
Investment Authority, Kampala City Council and the Ministry of
Lands.
</P>
<P>
Nobody is going to use political strings and send the name of
the corrupt official and other relevant information, said
Museveni.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his government is focusing on expanding the
gross domestic product in order to create a wider tax base, jobs
and markets for raw materials and utilities.
</P>
<P>
Official corruption prevailing across the country has been a
big obstacle hindering the country's economic development.

<HEADLINE> China's Development: Contributions Not Threats to World Peace (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The real reason for the fact that some Westerners have
characterized China's recent relatively speedy growth as the
"China threat" is nothing more than an attempt to curb the
country's further development.
</P>
<P>
In the eyes of some anti-China forces in the West, the article
said, development and the power of socialist China pose a serious
threat to them; they are afraid of the successes of socialist
China, which might threaten their dominant position in the new
world order.
</P>
<P>
"They are not clear that in today's world, it is impossible for
them to curb China's development. Some of the sensible people have
pointed out that curbing China will only produce disastrous
consequences," the article said.
</P>
<P>
The article also said that such a policy of "curbing" is not
new to the Chinese people. When new China was founded in the late
40's, some countries had already enforced the so-called curbing
and "blockading" policies, but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
The article reassured readers that no force whatsoever in the
world can impede the progress of 1.2 billion Chinese people.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Cager May Be Ousted from Olympic Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korean basketball player
Jung Hae Kun faces the possibility of being kicked out of the
national Olympic team following his punching in the face of a
Ukrainian opponent during the Seventh Commercial Henderson Cup
International Basketball Championship here.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean center, who was fouled several times earlier
in the match against Hong Kong's Frankwell represented by the
Ukrainian national side on Sunday, allegedly struck Ukraine's
Dmitri Bazelevski. The Ukrainian later received four stitches.
</P>
<P>
Jung, who was brought by police for questioning right after the
incident and has been suspended for the rest of the tournament by
the organizers.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's coach Choi In Sun Wednesday told reporters that
there would be a meeting after the team went home and it was up to
the South Korean Association to decide whether and how to punish
Jung.
</P>
<P>
"He might be replaced by another player," Choi said.
</P>
<P>
Choi apologized for the incident, saying that it happened all
of a sudden and "I was unable to control the situation."
</P>
<P>
The South Korean coach explained that the incident might be a
result of the team's frustrated tour of New Zealand before coming
to Hong Kong. "Many of the players were hurt when playing the big
guys there and the referees were not fair to us," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Jung was fouled several times in Sunday's match but the
referee just ignored his protests. He then failed to control
himself," he continued.
</P>
<P>
"As police came shortly after the incident, we had no time to
make apology to the Ukrainians," Choi said.
</P>
<P>
Jung, who was called to the Wanchai police station last night,
will know today whether police will charge him over the incident.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in South Korea's general consulate here said that if
Jung is charged, they would come out to help him in ways such as
finding a lawyer for him.
</P>
<P>
As the South Korean side lost all of their four preliminaries
following their defeat by Hong Kong's Seapower yesterday, the team
has been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Choi admitted this was somewhat a blow to the team in their
preparation for the Olympic Games.

</P>
<P>
The provincial government has selected 100 enterprises to
receive preferential treatments on loans, taxation, the issue of
bonds, land-use, the use of foreign funds, and infrastructure
growth.
</P>
<P>
Provincial and local government departments also will set aside

Most of the businesses make domestic electric appliances,
information and telecommunications equipment, computer components,
chemicals, building materials and medicines.

They resort to semi-advanced technologies and have a favorable
share of the market, together with market prospects.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government yesterday
warned U. S. government representatives against making statements
to destabilize the corporate existence of the country.
</P>
<P>
The warning was made in response to statements credited to the
US Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and
Labor John Shattuck that human rights situation in Nigeria has
deteriorated since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Shattuck also said the only alternative to force the Nigerian
government to improve on its record is increased sanctions by the
international community.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement released by the Foreign Ministry,
Shattuck and his colleagues visited Nigeria in late May. Apart
from enjoying unfettered movement in Nigeria, the US visitors
held talks with high ranking government officials, groups,
individuals and non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
But regrettably, the statement said, the envoy ignored views
expressed at the meetings and instead castigated the government
on matters that were never raised.
</P>
<P>
Shattuck, once back in the United States, has embarked on a
course of misleading the American public on the situation in
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The federal government of Nigeria therefore strongly condemned
these statements, according to the ministry.

DAR ES SALAAM, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is one of the
countries severely hit by HIV/AIDs in Africa, a senior official
from the Ministry of Health, Dr. Nyang'anyi told a seminar on
public health intervention in Morogoro Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the National AIDs Control Program (NACP) estimated
that by the year 1995, more than 1.5 million people were already
infected by HIV, the virus that cause AIDs. The disease was first
reported in Tanzania in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the seminar at Morogoro, about 300 kilometers west
of Dar Es Salaam, he said out of that number about 350,000 to
400,000 people are estimated to have developed aids and that half
of them have died.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Nyang'anyi (we just got his family name) said the health
care system had been badly hit by the deadly disease and that by
last December a total of 81,498 AIDs cases were reported in the
system in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said due to factors relating to under reporting, delays and
under diagnosis, the figure is thought to be a gross
understatement of the problem.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Nyang'anyi further said according to the NACP one out of
four to six cases of AIDs were reported.

BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- China is to phase in the dynamic
balance of farmland to keep pace with the nation's rising
population.
</P>
<P>
The growth of the country's arable land area is a move to feed
its enormous and still growing population.
</P>
<P>
With over 13 million ha of potential farmland to be exploited,
and another 13 million ha of land left idle because of man-made
factors, China is capable of increasing its arable land by 13
million ha and even more in the future, said Zou Yuchuan, director
of the State Bureau of Land Administration. He made the remarks at
an ongoing national conference on land administration.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, 2,100 counties and cities across China, or
75 percent of the total, had designated over 93 million ha of
arable land as reserves, thanks to the implementation of the
Regulation on Protection of Farmland, which was passed by the
State Council on July 4, 1994.
</P>
<P>
A total of 900,000 ha of land was exploited in 1995, up 31
percent from the figure of the previous year, and 350,000 ha of
the exploited land was converted into arable land, 3.3 times the
land occupied and put to other uses in the same year.

<HEADLINE> Precious Ancient Prescriptions Found Among Dunhuang Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese people used an ancient
form of nitroglycerine to treat heart attacks nearly 1,300 years
ago, a millennium earlier than the Europeans.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1900s, Chinese archaeologists discovered this
ancient prescription in documents found in a cave in the
world-renowned Mogao Grottos in Dunhuang, northwest China's Gansu
Province.
</P>
<P>
After nearly a century's work, the experts proved that more
than 1,100 prescriptions of the nitre and red orpiment compound
were recorded in the documents, which date mostly from the latter
half of the first millennium AD.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that most of the prescriptions were from books that
have been lost in past centuries, including the "Revised Ben Cao"
from the Tang Dynasty (618-907), which is the first
state-published pharmacopoeia in the world.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Professional Ethic of Medical Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey conducted by
Chinese medical departments shows that 89.6 percent of the
respondents are content with services provided by medical
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The figure is 2.2 percent higher than that recorded in a
similar 1994 survey, according to a national medical conference
held in Chongqing City of Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Only 0.23 percent of the respondents said medical workers had
received unauthorized money or goods from them.
</P>
<P>
Since October 1994, the Ministry of Public Health and other
medical departments have effectively banned medical workers from
accepting, and sometimes demanding money and goods from patients.
</P>
<P>
Many hospitals have tightened regulations concerning the moral
conduct of medical workers, and those who defy their ethical
responsibilities face punishments.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 190 hospitals across the country showed that
medical workers were offered money 18,000 times by patients, and
refused it.
</P>
<P>
However, 1,068 violations were uncovered, five people were
punished in accordance with the law, and 562 people received
administrative or economic penalties.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also issued decrees requiring doctors not to
prescribe medicine when they are not familiar with a patient's
symptoms, and not to offer any substitutes for medicine that has
been prescribed.
</P>
<P>
Professional ethics are linked to the payment and promotion of
medical workers, and also the grading of medical institutions.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin to Meet Chubais over Mutiny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin is
going to meet Anatoly Chubais, member of his electoral staff,
later today to discuss the incident that took place overnight,
when two members of the president's campaign team were detained,
sources close to the Kremlin said.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Lebed, newly-appointed head of the Russian Security
Council and presidential national security assistant, confirmed
the reports this morning about the arrest and release of two key
members of Yeltsin's campaign team, Sergei Lisovsky and Arkady
Yevstafiyev.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that he would crush any attempted mutiny.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the two men had been detained on orders from
Yeltsin's security chief Alexander Korzhakov and Federal Security
Service (FSS) chief Mikhail Barsukov.
</P>
<P>
The sources regarded the incident as "aimed at cancelling the
second round of the presidential elections" scheduled for early
July.
</P>
<P>
However, Sergei Filatov, leader of the national movement in
support of Yeltsin in the ongoing elections, described as an
"outrage" the arrest of the two key figures of the presidential
election team.
</P>
<P>
Lisovsky is a wealthy advertising and showbusiness magnate who
organized pop concerts for Yeltsin and a widely praised
advertising campaign aimed at capturing the youth vote under the
slogan "Vote or Lose."
</P>
<P>
Yevstafyev is known as a close aide to former economic reform
chief Anatoly Chubais, who acted as one of the main organizers of
Yeltsin's election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Now, both Yeltsin and his archirival, Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov, are preparing for the second round of the
elections.
</P>
<P>
The sources also said that the detainment of at least one of
the two Yeltsin's campaign figures was made at the government
house approximately at a time when Chernomyrdin had a meeting with
Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
Yevstafyev was forwarded to a room where "a lengthy talk" was
held with him. This information was later confirmed by Yevstafyev
himself in an interview with Russian television, who reported that
he was detained till three O'click this morning and questioned for
11 hours.

<HEADLINE> Famen Temple Refurbished </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A bell tower, a drum tower, two
pavilions and two corridors have been rebuilt in the Famen Temple,
where Sakyamuni's finger bones were enshrined during the Tang
Dynasty (618-907). Sakyamuni (565 B.C. - 486 B.C.) was the founder
of Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
The project, which began in April, 1995, cost five million
yuan. All added buildings were constructed in keeping with the
Tang architectural style.
</P>
<P>
The bell and the drum towers are the same size, with a side
length of six meters and a height of 18.76 m.
</P>
<P>
The bell weighs 1.8 tons and was made in 1472 during the Ming
Dynasty (1368-1644). The drum is 1.8 m high with a diameter of
2.15 m.
</P>
<P>
Historical records show that the Famen Temple once had 24
compounds during the Tang Dynasty and was listed as one of the
four most famous Buddhist sites.
</P>
<P>
Though it decayed during the following dynasties, the temple
regained its status in the Buddhist world and as a tourist
attraction after 1987, when numerous treasures, including the holy
bones, were unearthed from an underground tower.

BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- About 280 hectares of saltpetre
fields around the "Salt Lake" in Yuncheng City have been blown up
in order to protect the lake's environment, "China Chemical
Industry News" has reported.
</P>
<P>
The lake in Shanxi Province in north China, also called "Salt
Pond," is rich in natural salt resources that were first explored
3,000 years ago.
</P>

Yuncheng has become China's largest production base of
inorganic salts, and there are many tourist spots and historic
sites around the city on the east bank of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
However, the lake's environment and resources have deteriorated
in recent years since local farmers in need of money opened the
saltpetre fields and dug fish ponds around the lake.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities ordered the destruction of the 280 ha fields
to protect the lake's environment.
</P>
<P>
Further measures will be take to help the lake return to its

DALIAN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Chengli, a 64-year-old expert
of port study, gave a lecture to senior officials with the Dalian
government that may help them develop and promote business in
their port city.
</P>
<P>
"As an expert, I'm glad to serve for the country's economic
development," Hong said after his speech entitled, "Building an
Air Transportation Center in Dalian."
</P>
<P>
At present many enterprises in China's developed areas are
eager to hire hi-tech consultants to help them improve business.
</P>
<P>
To attract more experts, the enterprises have also offered high
salaries, houses and automobiles.
</P>
<P>
And experts now have become high-level government
advisors. They give speeches and presentations at industry
conferences, write newspaper articles, and are interviewed on
television and radio.
</P>
<P>
To avoid mistakes and profit loss, experts' opinions have been
considered in connection with many of China's key development
projects, including the Three Gorges Project, the largest water
control undertaking in the country.
</P>
<P>
Experts also have made great contributions to local economic
development. Liu Zeyuan, professor of development strategy study
at the Engineering University of Dalian (EUD), has advised the
city government on its plans for building Dalian into the largest
commercial center in north China. Dalian is in northeast China's
Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The 21st Century Development Research Center was formed
recently in the EUD, to provide information and advice to local
governmental departments that are drafting economic and social
development plans.
</P>
<P>
In Harbin, the capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province, advice from 18 experts convinced officials to give up a
600-million yuan investment project because it was technologically
impractical.
</P>
<P>
Many experts ultimately become governmental officials, which
gives them the opportunity to better serve China's economic
development.

<HEADLINE> Senior Communist Party Official on Party's Foreign Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of China (CPC)
has developed widespread exchanges with various political parties
abroad, a senior party official said in a broadcast speech
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"To actively expand the Party's foreign exchanges is an
indispensable part of the overall work of the Chinese Communist
Party, and a significant component of the country's foreign
relations as a whole," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Li Shuzheng, head of the International Liaison Department of
the CPC Central Committee, made the remarks in a speech
broadcast via China Radio International and the Central People's
Broadcasting Station.
</P>
<P>
The CPC has established relations with more than 300 political
parties in more than 120 countries and regions, Li said.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that all the achievements in China's revolutionary
cause and peaceful construction were made through the
self-reliance and hard work of the Chinese people under the
leadership of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, the achievements are inseparable from the sympathy
and support from peoples in other countries of the world and
progressive international forces," she said.
</P>
<P>
"This kind of support is mutual, and we have also tried our
best to back up the just causes of peoples in other countries," Li
added.
</P>
<P>
She said that following the end of the Cold War, the old world
pattern was broken and the international situation was, and is,
undergoing profound changes. Due to this, she said, the role of
political parties becomes more prominent.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Communist Party has seized the opportunity to
enhance contacts with foreign parties in order to promote mutual
understanding and help maintain the stable development of
international relations, she said.
</P>
<P>
The exchanges of different political parties have also aided
economic and trade cooperations between economic departments and
regions in China and their foreign counterparts, she said.
</P>
<P>
The China Economic Liaison Center, under her liaison
department, has developed business contacts with 68 political
parties and more than 140 companies and enterprises in 81
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that the principles of independence, total
equality, mutual respect and no interference in each other's
internal affairs have been the guidelines of the Chinese Communist
Party in handling relations with its foreign counterparts.

<HEADLINE> China's Development: Contributions Not Threats to World Peace (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua)-- Facts have demonstrated that
China's economic development constitutes an important contribution
to world peace. It is by no means a "threat," as reported
recently by the Western media.
</P>
<P>
The "Liberation Army's Daily" today carried a lengthy article
explaining why China's economic growth will greatly contribute to
world peace, and will threaten no one.
</P>
<P>
"In order to preach the idea of 'China Threat', some Western
media have put forward a bizarre theory recently about China's
economic development -- when it becomes 'too huge and powerful' it
will 'constitute threats' to the world and regional peace," said
the article, written by Liu Xinru.
</P>
<P>
The three-part article first theorized that China's development
should be put in the proper context.
</P>
<P>
According to the article, China's GNP has developed with an
average growth of 9.9 percent annually from 1979 to 1995. However,
due to its large population and weak bases, China still is a
developing country, just climbing over the poverty line and still
with relatively low economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Judged by the per-capita income, which best reflects the
overall development of a country, China still has a long way to
go, not only when compared to the developed countries but also in
comparison with some that are still developing.
</P>
<P>
"Then why do some Western media deliberately exaggerate China's
economic strength, so much so that they even put China in the rank
of developed countries?" the article queried.
</P>
<P>
The article provided two explanations: to put the "hat of a
developed country" on China is to make barriers for its entry into
the World Trade Organization, and it creates a distance between
China and other countries, especially its bordering countries.

<HEADLINE> Russian Premier Says Incident with Arrest Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Russin Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin said today that the incident with detention overnight
of two members of President Boris Yeltsin's campaign team is over.
</P>
<P>
After studying the exhaustive reports on the case, Chernomyrdin
told reporters here that the detention of Sergei Lisovsky and
Arkady Yevstafyev, two key members in Yeltsin's election team,
"can be considered as over."
</P>
<P>
Alexander Lebed, newly-named head of the Russian Security
Council and presidential national security assistant, confirmed
the information about the arrest and release of Lisovsky and
Yevstafyev, and declared that he would crush any attempted mutiny.
</P>
<P>
It has been unclear so far why the two men were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the Kremlin said the two key figures in
Yeltsin's campaign team had been detained on orders from Yeltsin's
security chief Alexander Korzhakov and Federal Security Service
chief Mikhail Barsukov.
</P>
<P>
The sources regarded the incident as "a first step in a
scenario aimed at cancelling the second round of the presidential
elections," in which Yeltsin will battle with his archrival,
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, for the Russian
presidency.

The social system and the national development strategy have

GENEVA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- With one stage left, Peter

Austrian rider finished in the 12th place in a 35-km tiem trial in
the Tour of Switzerland cycling on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> India's GDP Growth Seen at 4.5 Percent in 1996-97 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- India's gross domestic product
(GDP) is likely to grow at 4.5 percent in the financial year of
1996-97 (April-March), the Times of India reported today.
</P>
<P>
The estimate, made by securities firm HG Asia in its report on
the Indian economy, is in sharp contrast to the projections of 7-8
percent made by new Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda earlier.
</P>
<P>
According to the HG Asia report, "robust" industrial production
will be to some extent offset by a "not-so-robust" growth in the
agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the anti-inflation policy adopted by the government
over the last 18 months would also lead to the slowdown in GDP
growth in the current financial year.

<HEADLINE> More Mountain Areas to Be Opened Up For Cultivation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 25 percent of the total
6.7-million-hectares of cultivated land in China are on mountain
slopes, standing at an angle of more than 25 degrees.
</P>
<P>
With rapid economic development and population explosions, many
countries, especially some developing countries in Southeast Asia,
South America and Africa, are facing shortages of cultivated land,
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
However, poorly-managed use of land on steep slopes has
produced serious results, such as soil erosion and deteriorating
environmental conditions, which cause concern within the
international community.
</P>
<P>
A four-day international academic seminar was held in Kunming,
the capital city of southwest China's Yunnan province, to discuss
new methods to improve and use cultivated land on steep slopes.
</P>
<P>
The Geographical Society of China, the Chinese Academy of
Sciences and the World Water and Soil Conservation Association
co-sponsored the meeting. More than 80 soil experts and scholars
from 13 countries participated, representing the United States,
Britain, German, Poland, India and the Republic of Korea.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Develops Infrastructure to Help The Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan Province
plans to help its 6.6 million poor people shake off poverty by
constructing infrastructure facilities.
</P>
<P>
Lincang Prefecture, in the southwestern area of the province,
has been chosen as a trial base for the government's plan,
according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government will invest 7.2 billion yuan (about
867 million US dollars) into 62 infrastructure projects, including
airport, transportation, energy, telecommunication and water
conservancy, in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Of the 2.1 million people in Lincang, 800,000 still live under
the poverty level. The average yearly income of a farmer is only
432 yuan (52 US dollars) there.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that poor infrastructure conditions, especially
the roads, hinder the development of local economy.
</P>
<P>
"Local governments should attach importance to infrastructural
construction, which will in turn stimulate further development of
economy," said He Zhiqiang, governor of Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government will inject 120 million yuan annually
into the construction of Lincang Airport, which will be completed
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers will be encouraged to cultivate new farmland in
order to ensure grain output.
</P>
<P>
The successes of Lincang's aid-the-poor projects will be
introduced throughout the entire province in future, according the
officials.

<HEADLINE> China Enters Flood Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The flood season has arrived in
China, and some central and southern regions already have been hit
by high waters.
</P>
<P>
From April to June, China's total precipitation was less than
that of the same period in previous years, despite heavy rains in
the western part of the country, according to an official with the
State Flood-Control and Drought-Relief Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Since the flood season began, there have been three major
rainfalls in central and southern China, causing floods in several
medium and small rivers and resulting in economic losses for parts
of Guangxi, Guangdong, Guizhou, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Ili River in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region this year saw its third largest flood since the founding of
the People's Republic of China in 1949, he added.
</P>
<P>
But all the major rivers of the country have so far remained
stable, he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the vast area in north China, which suffered
persistent drought in spring and early summer, will enter the
flood season soon and must be on alert against flooding.
</P>
<P>
On June 11, the State Council convened a national telephone
conference on flood control. The State Flood-Control and
Drought-Relief Headquarters and the Ministry of Water Resources
sent more than 20 teams to the major rivers and lakes across the
country to examine the preparations in place for withstanding
possible flood disasters.
</P>
<P>
Some provincial governments issued emergency circulars on flood
control, while Beijing, Hunan, Gansu, Liaoning, Hainan, Shaanxi,
Jilin, and Qinghai provinces took effective measures against
floods, he added.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze River Delta Leads China's Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Yangtze River Delta, one of
China's richest regions, has been leading the country's economic
growth with a 17 percent annual growth rate in the past five
years, five percentage points higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
The delta area, which includes Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang,
makes up only two percent of China's total territory and ten
percent of its population. But it is one of the most developed and
urbanized regions in China.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the region produced 130 billion
US dollars in GDP in 1995, accounting for 19 percent of the
country's total.
</P>
<P>
Local officials attributed the rapid economic growth of the
region to China's reform and open policy, as well as China's
decision to give Shanghai's Pudong New Area more preferential
policies for attracting overseas funds and further opening up the
Yangtze River Valley in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
These factors combined have stepped up construction of
infrastructure facilities in Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang. In
the past five years, the region invested 24 billion US dollars in
infrastructure facilities, officials say. As a result, overseas
businessmen have flocked to the region, bringing advanced
technology, equipment and expertise.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River Delta region has approved about 50,000
overseas-funded enterprises with contractual investment of 80
billion US dollars -- about one-fourth of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
The rapid economic growth has brought more wealth to local
people: the per capita annual income has climbed to 650 US dollars
for urban dwellers and 380 US dollars for farmers, both above the
national average.
</P>
<P>
"Such a prosperous region is beyond my expectations," said
Jean-Pierre Vassaux, executive member of the board of Societe
Generale of France. "And I have found vast business opportunities
in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Ji Yunshi, vice-governor of Jiangsu Province, noted
the economic development in the Yangtze River Delta is only at the
primary stage compared with the world's advanced countries. Ji
said his province will work to upgrade its technological level,
and will open further to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Ji and other provincial and municipal officials in Shanghai,
Zhejiang and Jiangsu are confident about the region's future, as
the delta area has been designated a key development zone by the
Chinese government. To boost its economic progress, Shanghai,
Jiangsu and Zhejiang plan to invest nearly 60 billion US dollars
in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
If the region continues to maintain its momentum in
development, the Yangtze River Delta can match the Rhine River
Industry Zone and the Tokyo Bay Industry Zone in about 20 years,
said Zhu Jiakang, a noted economist from Zhejiang. He added that
the region could then have an influence on economic growth in the
rest of China.

<HEADLINE> Dialogs Better Than Confrontations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Nation-to-nation trade disputes
can only be resolved through consultations held on equal footing,
and on the basis of respecting facts and seeking common ground
while reserving differences.
</P>
<P>
In its commentary, "People's Daily" today pointed out that the
truth has once again proved by the latest negotiations between
China and the United States over intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the commentary echoed Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's remark during his meeting with acting US trade
representative Charlene Barshefsky, "Dialogs are better than
confrontations, mutually-beneficial co-operation better than
sanctions."
</P>
<P>
On the evening of June 17, trade delegations from China and the
US reached an agreement on IPR protection, thus averting a trade
war through last-ditch efforts.
</P>
<P>
The two sides held informal consultations from June 6 to 7 and,
on June 10 and 11, the US delegation went to Guangdong Province to
acquaint themselves with the tremendous efforts China has made
concerning IPT protection.
</P>
<P>
Formal consultations, which began on June 13, entered the
ministerial level on June 15. They were co-chaired by Shi
Guangsheng, Chinese vice-minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperations, and Acting US Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
The two sides' main differences were focused on the closing of
CD producers, the prolonging of the special law enforcement
period, the strengthening of law enforcement at the customs, and
the market access, the commentary noted.
</P>
<P>
Through five-day talks in a frank and constructive atmosphere,
the two sides finally reached unanimity. The US side announced to
cancel its planned trade sanctions against China and to drop China
from its list under a special 301 screening. In return, the
Chinese side declared the abrogation of its counter-retaliations
against the US in response to the US commitment.
</P>
<P>
The article quoted Zhang Yuejiao, director-general of the
Treaty and Law Department of the MOFTEC, who has participated in
the IPR negotiations for 10 consecutive years, as saying that
China's protection of the IPR is required by the demands of its
own economic and technological development instead of taking
orders from the United States.
</P>
<P>
"No matter whether or not there is an IPR protection agreement
between China and the US, the Chinese government will, as always,
rigorously enforce the law and continue its crackdown on IPR
violations." Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the economies of China and the US are very
complementary, and the two nations have great potential for trade
and economic co-operation, the article noted.
</P>
<P>
Should it carry out trade sanctions against China, the world's
leading developing country, the commentary said, the US would
suffer still greater losses itself.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the negotiations has not only laid a foundation
for the overall improvement of Sino-US trade and economic ties and
benefit the business circles of both nations, but also made
positive contributions to world peace and regional stability, the
"People's Daily" said.

HARARE, June 20 (Xinhua) -- An envoy from the mountain kingdom

to brief him on the latest constitutional developments in
Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
''We have moved even further in that the army now understands

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Exchange Reserves Not too Large: Bank Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign exchange reserves
are rich but not too large, central bank governor Dai Xianglong
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that by the end of May, China had
foreign exchange reserves valued at 85 billion US dollars, up from
21.2 billion US dollars reported at the end of 1993.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national meeting on foreign exchange, Dai urged
attendants to perceive the rapid growth in China's foreign
exchange reserves in a "strategic" manner.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the growth will subside in the future.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that China should maintain a large sum of foreign
exchange reserves as its volume of outstanding foreign debts, now
at 110 billion US dollars, is growing fast.
</P>
<P>
China should have sufficient foreign exchange reserves if it
expects to expand reforms and open itself wider to the outside
world and also maintain financial stability in Hong Kong, which
will return to Chinese rule next year, the governor explained.
</P>
<P>
Dai admitted that the Renminbi yuan's rising value since 1994,
when China drastically reformed its foreign exchange system, has
partly soured China's export growth. However, he ruled out the
possibility that China will artificially devalue the local
currency to boost exports.
</P>
<P>
"The exchange rate of the Renminbi yuan is decided by the
market and we do not have any reasons to devalue the currency,"
Dai said.

<HEADLINE> India Nudges down Rupee to Boost Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of India (RBI,
the central bank) is pressing down the rupee against the US dollar
to maintain the competitiveness of India's exports, the Times of
India reported today.
</P>
<P>
RBI, which was buying dollars at a level of 34.87/90 rupees at
the beginning of last week, stepped up its purchase price to 35.09
rupees Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates clearly that RBI is comfortable with a weaker
rupee," the newspaper quoted a dealer as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to dealers, a surge in foreign investments in stocks
in recent months has led to an increased supply of dollars on the
Indian market, putting pressure on the rupee to appreciate.
</P>
<P>
As a strong rupee would have hurt exporters, RBI had to step in
to buy dollars and peg the Indian currency down at a lower level.

<HEADLINE> Law Helps Orphans Find Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Around 40,000 Chinese orphans have
been adopted in the last two years by childless families, today's
China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The adoptions were carried out using legal procedures, showing
growing public awareness of the regulations, an official with the
Ministry of Civil Affairs said.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the progress to China's existing
Adoption Law and a set of regulations issued since 1992 to
regulate adoption as a means to ensure family and social
stability.
</P>
<P>
To further protect the rights and interests of the parties
involved, particularly the children, the ministry has revised its
adoption registration measures for Chinese citizens, Yang Yanyin,
vice-minister of civil affairs, said in a written report released
this week.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important changes was to intensify supervision
during adoptions by official agencies in charge of welfare
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Procedures on adoptions by Macao residents and overseas Chinese
were also amended. The new regulations state that Macao residents
must present documents from government civil affairs and notary
offices to adopt children on the Chinese mainland, and the Chinese
translation must be confirmed by the relevant department of the
Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch which is equal to an overseas
official agency of the Chinese Government.

<HEADLINE> Exquisite Wall Paintings Found in Crown Prince's Tomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Exquisite wall paintings and jade
funeral eulogium have been found in the tomb of a crown prince
from the Tang Dynasty (618-907), about 80 km away from this
capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists say that the wall paintings and funeral
eulogium are the best ever found in a Tang tomb.
</P>
<P>
The tomb's occupant, Li Chongjun, was the third son of the
fourth emperor of the Tang Dynasty, who was designated crown
prince in the year 706.
</P>
<P>
The crown prince, who was not the queen's son, was unhappy with
obstacles created by the queen's daughter and her husband, and
and staged a coup d'etat in 707.
</P>
<P>
He failed and was killed by his subordinates.
</P>
<P>
One of his uncles, who later succeeded the crown, buried him
near his father's tomb in 710.
</P>
<P>
Though 15 holes dug in the tomb by robbers have been found,
Li's tomb has many wall paintings and about 150 pieces of jade
funeral eulogium, which are of great educational value, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
The wall paintings include a 10-m-long landscape, the largest
of its kind ever found in a Tang tomb, and pictures of
polo-playing and processions.
</P>
<P>
The pieces of jade funeral eulogium, including 11 complete ones
each 28.1 cm long, three cm wide and 0.7 cm thick.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the funeral eulogium and wall paintings will
contribute greatly to the study of the history, fine arts and
calligraphy of the Tang Dynasty.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Operation to End Insurgency in North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Uganda People's Defense
Forces (UPDF) will launch a "clean operation" next month in
northern Uganda to end the insurgency there, said a report
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Major Gen. Salim Saleh, senior presidential adviser on
military and political affairs in the north was quoted as saying
that the operation will be one of the five reasons why President
Y. Museveni appointed and sent him to the north last month.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally in Gulu town over 300 kms north of Kampala
on Saturday, Saleh said, "the president told me to go to the
north to end the war by using both military and peaceful means. I
am in contact with Acholi tribe elders who want peace talks with
rebels of the Lard's Resistance Army led by Josephe Kony. But it
appears that Kony thinks that the elders are undermining him."
</P>
<P>
Saleh also outlined his other duties as re-organization of the
army, re-sharpening its readiness, supply of logistics and
deployment.
</P>
<P>
Under his program, he said, UPDF has since June 13 occupied
Kilak hills in Kilak county near Gulu town, which the Kony rebels
have often used as headquarters or hideouts.
</P>
<P>
His third role, he disclosed, is to re-build relationship
between the army and the civilians in a bid to help end the
insurgency.
</P>
<P>
His fourth duty, he said, is to reactivate the police,
administration police, local councils, youth groups, women
groups' and other organizations so that each group plays its role
alongside the army to end the war in the north.
</P>
<P>
He said he would give the north economic power to make the
region the richest area in the country.

<HEADLINE> China's Yuan to be Convertible Under Current Account </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- China will make its currency, the
yuan, convertible under the current account by the end of this
year, four years ahead of its self-imposed deadline of the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
"The conditions for current-account convertibility of the yuan
are basically ripe now that China enjoys political and economic
stability, a balanced sheet for international payments, a stable
exchange rate of the local currency, and rich foreign exchange
resources," said Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of
China.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal of current-account convertibility of the
yuan, China will begin July 1 to integrate foreign-funded
enterprises into its current system of selling and buying of
foreign exchange, thereby removing restrictions on such
enterprises in their use of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Also this year, China will raise the ceilings for the amount of
foreign exchange for private use. Individuals' demand for foreign
exchange that exceeds the normal standards will be approved by
local foreign exchange administration departments.
</P>
<P>
Restrictions on the amount of foreign exchange for other
non-trade purposes will also be withdrawn this year, Dai said.
</P>
<P>
"So by the end of this year, the yuan will be convertible under
the current account, meeting the requirements of the 8th clause of
the International Monetary Fund," Dai said. He called the yuan's
convertibility under the current account a "breakthrough" in
China's reform of its foreign exchange system.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that he believes that current-account convertibility
of the yuan will promote China's foreign trade and be conducive to
China's efforts to attract more foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from the central bank said that making the yuan
convertible under the current account will help China improve its
investment environment and boost the public's confidence in the
stability of the yuan.

<HEADLINE> 150,000 Women In Africa Die of Unsafe Abortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- At least 150,000 women in Africa
die annually due to unsafe abortions and related causes, today's
"Daily Nation" reported quoting a recent journal on African
health.
</P>
<P>
"The African Journal of Fertility, Sexuality and Reproductive
Health" says that among the above-mentioned deaths, 25 to 50
percent died because of unsafely induced abortions.
</P>
<P>
The journal, published by Center for African Family Studies in
Nairobi, says many desperate women have resorted to drinking
gasoline and other toxic substances in an attempt to induce an
abortion on themselves.
</P>
<P>
Around 30 and 60 million women worldwide seek termination of
pregnancy every year, the journal says.
</P>
<P>
It says, "hospital statistics from Kenyatta National Hospital
(KNH), Nairobi report the treatment of between 30 to 60 cases per
day, or 10,000 per year with complications from unsafe abortion."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Canada Receives Fewer Immigrants in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Canada received 215,700 immigrants
for the year ending June 30, 1995, down 19 percent over 1993 and 5
percent over 1994, Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
From 1990, Canada's immigration had increased steadily until
1993, and has since been on the decline.
</P>
<P>
The provinces of Ontario and British Columbia continued to
attract large proportions of immigrants. Quebec was in the third
place for the second year in a row.
</P>
<P>
The two cities of Vancouver and Toronto attracted almost
119,000 immigrants, 55 percent of the total for 1995. Toronto
alone attracted almost 81,000, or 37.6 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Montreal was the third most popular city for immigrants, luring
about 10 percent, the Statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the popularity of Montreal, the whole Quebec's share of
permanent immigrants has dropped significantly over recent years.
It reached a 10-year low of 12.5 percent in 1995, compared with
21.1 percent in 1992, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Health Warning On Measles Vaccines In Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Only 87 percent of the children
in Australia vaccinated against measles showed evidence of
immunity to the disease, a new report on Australian health said.
</P>
<P>
Inadequate storage of the vaccinations was the most likely
reason for the problem, which led to an Australian immunization
level too low to prevent measles outbreaks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Prepared by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, the
report "Australia's Health 1966" was launched today by federal
Health Minister Michael Wooldridge.
</P>
<P>
It said Australia was one of the healthiest countries in the
world, but outlined areas which required big improvements.
</P>
<P>
Report editor and the Institute's principal medical adviser
John Donovan said although the health of the Australian community
as a whole continued to improve, the nation was only middle of the
road compared with other developed countries.
</P>
<P>
"We are not so good in the areas of injuries, cardiovascular
disease, cancers and respiratory disorders, and there are still
substantial differences among different groups within the
Australian population," Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
"Of major concern are the health of Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Island people and those who live in more socio-economically
disadvantaged areas," he said.

<HEADLINE> World Copper Price Stable After Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 19 (Xinhua) -- World copper prices stabilized
this week after a roller coaster ride over the last month
following revelations of fraud at one of the world's biggest
copper trading companies, Mario Vinageras Barroso, the president
of Mexico's copper producers' association said today.
</P>
<P>
But he sought to reassure producers that world demand for copper
would continue to be stable and that there would be no sharp
changes.
</P>
<P>
Vinageras was speaking at the opening of a regional meeting of
the copper industry, just a few days after the world copper market
was rocked by news that Japanese trading house Sumitomo had
suffered losses of 1.8 billion U.S. dollars from unauthorized
copper trading by its chief copper trader Yasuo Hamanaka on the
London Metals Exchange over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The scandal could have repercussions in Latin America, which
supplies some 10 percent of the world's copper but uses only 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
The price of copper, which had already plunged from nearly
2,900 dollars per metric ton in May when rumors of the losses
first surfaced, fell from just over 2,300 dollars to 1,800 dollars
per ton after Sumitomo publicly announced the losses.
</P>
<P>
This week, said Vinageras, the price had started recovering and
was now at 2,075 dollars per ton.
</P>
<P>
Prices began to spring back as the market authorities, central
banks, Sumitomo and other banks acted to stabilize prices on the
world's copper markets and stop prices plunging further.
</P>
<P>
Saldivar Tapani Jarvinen, President of the Latin American
Copper Council, told the meeting Latin America's output of copper
could rise by ten percent percent over the next five years.

<HEADLINE> Indian Congress Party Asked to Prepare for Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Former prime minister P.V.
Narasimha Rao told his party workers Wednesday to prepare for a
mid-term election which according to him, could be "any time," the
Hindustan Time reported today.
</P>
<P>
Rao, president of the Indian National Congress, gave the
instruction during his first visit to his constituency in Orissa
after his election to the Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament)
from there last month.
</P>
<P>
He said though the Congress Party had given unconditional
support to the ruling United Front headed by Prime Minister H.D.
Deve Gowda, the support would be withdrawn if the activities and
policies went against the interests of the country.
</P>
<P>
In this background, Rao called up Congress Party members to
work hard to popularize party policies among the people and also
be ready for a mid-term poll.
</P>
<P>
Rao's remarks assumed great significance because the 13-party
United Front, with only 190 seats in the 545-seat Lok Sabha, can
not sustain a stable government without the outside support of the
Congress Party.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Families Become More Diverse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Canadian families have become more
diverse, the result of increases in divorce, separation,
re-marriage and co-habitation on the one hand, and drops in
mortality, fertility and marriage on the other.
</P>
<P>
The once-dominant family unit -- a married couple with children
-- has become less common, falling from 55 percent of all families
in 1981 to 45 percent in 1995, Statistics Canada reported here
today.
</P>
<P>
The decline has been balanced by the relative growth of other
types of families, the federal fact-gathering agency said in the
report.
</P>
<P>
Between 1981 and 1995, common-law couples doubled from 6
percent to 12 percent of all families.
</P>
<P>
In the same period, single-parent families rose to 14 percent
from 11 percent while the proportion of married couples without
children rose to 30 percent from 28 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Canada's population is expected to
reach 30 million this summer, Statistics Canada predicted today.
</P>
<P>
The nation's population is expected to hit 29,955,000 on July
1, 1996. At current rates of growth, it will likely exceed 30
million by either August or September, the federal fact-gathering
agency said in its report.
</P>
<P>
Between July 1, 1994 and June 30, 1995, the population grew 1.2
percent, slightly below the 1.3 average annual rate for the three
previous years.
</P>
<P>
The trend towards an increasingly ageing population will
continue over the next four years. Between 1996 and 2000, a total
of 1.3 million Canadians will reach 60, and 1.2 million will reach
65.
</P>
<P>
Those levels are about 50,000 higher than the total turning 60
and some 35,000 higher than those turning 65 between 1991 and
1995.

<HEADLINE> India Not to Withdraw from CTBT Talks: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- India will not withdraw from the
negotiations on a comprehensive test ban treaty (CTBT) at the
disarmament conference in Geneva nor will it sign the document
which does not advance the clause of global disarmament, the
Hindustan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Indian government has taken the view
that non-participation in the discussions, which have entered the
penultimate stage, will serve neither the national interest nor
its commitment to nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
India has insisted that a test ban should be linked to a
time-bound program of nuclear disarmament. A draft CTBT document
which will be finalized by June 28 does not take up the Indian
request.
</P>
<P>
According to the most influential Indian newspaper, the Indian
delegation at Geneva is being instructed to clarify the country's
stand on the CTBT at the disarmament conference tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Poland, Bulgaria Urge Rapid NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The presidents of Poland and
Bulgaria today called for NATO's rapid expansion into eastern
Europe which they said would not threaten Russia.
</P>
<P>
NATO's eastward expansion would even be beneficial to Russia's
democratic process and should be accelerated instead of delayed or
suspended, said Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski and his
Bulgarian counterpart Zhelio Zhelev, who is in Warsaw to attend a
NATO conference starting today.
</P>
<P>
Poland and Bulgaria share similar views on European security
and NATO's eastward expansion, they said.
</P>
<P>
Zhelev said that NATO's expansion in southern Europe to include
Bulgaria would be a logical move since the country borders Greece
and Turkey, both NATO members.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Polish Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz met
with General Klaus Neumann, who heads NATO's military committee,
to discuss Poland's integration into the Atlantic alliance.
</P>
<P>
Cimoszewicz said that Poland will make efforts to integrate
itself into NATO's defense system in order to obtain formal NATO
membership next year.
</P>
<P>
Neumann said that NATO has made a firm commitment to enlarge
itself and Russia has no decisive role to play in this.
</P>
<P>
The question is who will join NATO, and how and when they will
join, and the answers will come next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that NATO's expansion should not become the cause of
conflict as it is not directed against any third country.
</P>
<P>
Poland tops a list of former Warsaw Pact states eager to join
the alliance. But Russia is opposed to NATO's embrace of its
neighbors in eastern Europe, fearing that the Western nuclear
umbrella will be brought right up to its border.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference on the future of NATO will be attended
by NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, the Supreme Commander of
Allied Forces in Europe, General George Joulwan, and senior
alliance figures. Officials of the 34 countries in the Partnership
for Peace program, which gives non-NATO states closer links with
the alliance, will also attend.

<HEADLINE> Paris Opens First Cycle Lane to Reduce Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Blessed are those who bicycle in
downtown Paris as the first special cycle lane was opened today to
help reduce air pollution.
</P>
<P>
Cyclists will no longer have to thread their way between cars
on the 5.5 kilometer stretch starting from Boulevard Saint-Michel
northward to the Paris East railway station via Boulevard
Saint-Germain.
</P>
<P>
Paris Mayor Jean Tiberi, who officiated at the opening of the
cycle lane, said that the move is to make bicycles a common means
of transport in the capital and thereby lessen air pollution.
</P>
<P>
The new cycle lane, which cost 2.5 million francs (about
500,000 U.S. dollars), is placed between the sidewalk and the bus
lane and has its own traffic lights at crossroads. Motorists who
drive on the cycle lane and cyclists who pedal on the roadway will
be fined.
</P>
<P>
Cyclists will have an easier time traveling in the city when
more cycle lanes -- 25 kilometers by August -- are designated,
Tiberi said.
</P>
<P>
The idea for cycle lanes originated at the beginning of the
year, when the municipal authorities decided to encourage
Parisians to use bicycles to help reduce pollution from car
exhaust fumes.
</P>
<P>
Air pollution in Paris has reached serious proportions in
recent years, exceeding several times the European Union's warning
level. Statistics from the French Environment Ministry showed
that 80 percent of the air pollution in Paris came from its 2.5
million cars. Every year, 260 to 350 people Parisians die of
air-pollution-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
Paris previously had several cycle lanes which were the site of
frequent traffic accidents due to inadequate safeguards.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Import Drops In May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Australian merchandise imports
fell slightly in May despite a stronger Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
Merchandise imports fell by one percent to 6.621 billion
Australian dollars (5.231 billion US dollars) seasonally adjusted
in May from 6.691 billion Australian dollars (5.286 billion US
dollars) in April, the Australian Bureau of Statistics announced
today.
</P>
<P>
The slight fall in imports is expected to contribute to a lower
current account deficit for the month. Local economists predicted
that current account deficit was to be less than 1.8 billion
Australian dollars (1.4 billion US dollars) in May after swelling
to 1.995 billion Australian dollars (1.6 billion US dollars) in
April.
</P>
<P>
However, a stronger Australian dollar has boosted demand for
imported consumer goods, which rose three percent to 1.7 billion
Australian dollars (1.3 billion US dollars) in May.

LISBON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese experts today called for
measures to curb teenage drinking as statistics show an alarming
60 percent of the country's 12-18 year-olds drink.

<P>
Selling alcohol to youngsters should be restricted and those
caught should be fined, said experts attending a symposium in the

Alcohol education to warn teenagers, boys and girls, of the
dangers of drinking should be strengthened, they recommended.
</P>
<P>
Experts warned excessive drinking is bad for youngsters' health,
causing brain, liver, nerve and muscle damage. They also believe
drinking leads to traffic and other accidents.
</P>

Portugal is a major grape wine and beer producing nation and
its wine consumption per capita is among the highest the

<HEADLINE> France Optimistic About End to Mad Cow Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- France is optimistic that the
month-long "mad cow" crisis can be resolved at the European Union
(EU) summit starting in Florence Friday, Elysee spokeswoman
Catherine Colonna said today.
</P>
<P>
"We are certain that an agreement can be reached in Florence,
although the details may not be settled there. But the heads of
states and governments can set a framework," Colonna said.
</P>
<P>
France also called for its EU partners to "confront this crisis
with sang-froid and lucidity," she added.
</P>
<P>
She said that France will stick to three principles -- public
health, European partnership and the interests of cattle farmers
-- in dealing with the problem.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the "mad cow" crisis, "there are other important
questions which must be discussed" at the two-day summit, said
Colonna.
</P>
<P>
According to Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, whose
country holds the EU's rotating presidency, the "mad cow" problem
is not officially on the agenda of the Florence summit but will
nevertheless be discussed there.
</P>
<P>
Reports later today said that despite objections from British
farmers, Britain has given way to a key EU demand to kill more
cattle at risk from "mad cow" disease in order to get the EU's
global ban on British beef lifted.
</P>
<P>
The beef ban was imposed in March when the British government
disclosed that bovine spongiform encephalopathy or "mad cow"
disease may have links with the incurable Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease in humans.
</P>
<P>
To pressure the EU to lift the ban, the British government
adopted a non-cooperation policy with the EU three weeks ago and
has blocked all EU business since then.

<HEADLINE> Procession of Bhutanese Refugees Stopped by Indian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A funeral procession of
Bhutanese refugees in eastern Nepal were stopped by Indian police
and more than 100 of the refugees were charged, reports reaching
here said today.
</P>
<P>
The procession Wednesday by some 300 Bhutanese refugees from
Siliguri of India's eastern state of West Bengal was aimed to
take the dead body of a Bhutanese refugee, who died one week ago
in an Indian prison, to Bhutan by crossing the India-Bhutan
border.
</P>
<P>
Indian police have detained nearly 1,000 Bhutanese refugees in
various prisons during the last few months when the refugees were
trying to go to Bhutan through the Indian territory in a peace
march movement appealing for free repatriation of some 100,000
Bhutanese refugees in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The Indian police Wednesday said that the Indian government has
 ordered not to allow such a large number of refugees to enter
Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
According to Nepal-based refugee organization The Appeal
Movement Coordination Council (AMCC), five participants of the
Wednesday procession beaten by the Indian police were in critical
condition and 50 refugees sustained minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
The dead body of Baburam Shengden in a coffin was left on the
bridge where the Indian police intercepted the procession as the
refugees were forced to retreat, it was reported.

Thailand, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
During informal talks with the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) Wednesday, the Laotian side ruled out any
possible deportation, saying that the Laotian government and the
UNHCR disagreed with forced deportation.
</P>
<P>
However, the Thai side insisted that the choice be logical,
indicating that Thailand has the right to use its immigration law
to deport the Laotians.
</P>
<P>
If the refugees do not go to a third country, Thailand is not
willing anymore to give them shelter, said Khachadpai
Burusapatana, deputy chief of the Thai National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The only option left is to send them back, Khachadpai added.
</P>
<P>
The talks Wednesday mainly focused on the screening of the
Laotians for resettlement in the United States by the US Joint
Voluntary agency, which began in April and is due for completion
in late August.
</P>
<P>
So far, an estimated 1,000 of the 5,000 refugees at Ban Napho
in Nakhon Phanom province have been approved for resettlement by
the US Immigration Department, said Pakdi Rattanaphol, head of the
Foreign Affairs Division of the Thai Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
But Khachadpai said that only 3,000 are estimated to meet US
resettlement criteria.
</P>
<P>
Concrete measures to deal with the remaining 2,000 refugees
would be discussed at the next tripartite meeting scheduled for
late August in the Laotian southern province of Champassak, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Laos has prepared an area of 1,000 hectares at Ban Na Saard in
Kham Mouane province in central Laos to accommodate the remaining
refugees, he said.

<HEADLINE> Hungary's Jobless Rate Stable: Labor Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Hungary's jobless rate has long
hovered at a stable 10-11 percent, but long-term unemployment is
worryingly high, Labor Minister Kiss Peter said today.
</P>
<P>
The number of people who have been jobless for one to 1.5
years accounts for 52 percent of the unemployed, making it
difficult for new entrants to the labor market to find jobs, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate also varied widely, standing at 5-6
percent in the capital Budapest, but reaching 20 percent in the
northern and northeastern parts of the country, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He added that Hungary's jobless rate of 10-11 percent is not
high compared with Western Europe, where it is expected to average
11 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Hungary has a population of 10.2 million.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Promotes Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 20 (Xinhua) -- By placing the tourism industry
at the top of its development plan, Guangzhou expects to become a
major tourist attraction in the Asia-Pacific region by the turn of
the century.
</P>
<P>
More than 22 centuries old, the south China metropolis has 82
cultural sites under national protection, and its tropical scenery
and unique food make it one of the most popular tourist
destinations in China.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Guangzhou received 13 million tourists; 2.1 million
were from abroad. It created one-tenth of China's total amount of
foreign exchange earned from tourism last year.
</P>
<P>
To be more tempting to visitors, Guangzhou will focus on the
construction of four major scenic zones that highlight natural and
cultural features of the city.
</P>
<P>
The city will continue to improve its tourist facilities and
the service quality of the industry, and better regulate the
tourist market to create a positive environment for further
development of local tourism.
</P>
<P>
It also will launch promotion campaigns and improve the
training received by industry workers.
</P>
<P>
To collect more funding for development, Guangzhou has set up a
special account to finance improvement of scenic sites. The city
also plans to introduce more overseas investment.

<HEADLINE> Sanya A Hothouse for Future Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Sanya, the southernmost city in
China, eyes great development for its rich natural resources and
well-developed infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
An article carried by today's "China Daily" called the city a
hothouse for future development.
</P>
<P>
A port city in Hainan Province, Sanya has more than 800
different types of fish and other seafood. Shark fins, sea
cucumber and abalone are the city's "three treasures".
</P>
<P>
Sanya's proven oil reserves reach 63 billion tons, twice as
much as the Daqing Oilfield, China's biggest. The annual output of
its natural gas is expected to reach 10 billion cubic meters by
the year 2000 and 21 billion cubic meters by 2007.
</P>
<P>
Sanya has 163,000 hectares of farmland and a further 59,000
hectares of land suitable for the cultivation of tropical crops
and forests and for animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
With an annual rainfall of about 1,280 millimeters and an
average annual temperature of around 23 degrees Celsius, Sanya is
one of the most popular tourist cities in the province. It has 116
scenic areas and 140 hotels.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Sanya has invested a great deal in its
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The Sanya-Haikou Expressway and the Phoenix International
Airport have opened to traffic. There are regular flights to major
Chinese cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenyang,
and charted flights to Singapore, Malaysia, Japan and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Sanya port, handling some one million tons of cargoes each
year, has shipping lines to Guangzhou, Hong Kong and Viet Nam.
</P>
<P>
Sanya's Nanshan deep-water port, which is under construction,
will have an annual handling capacity of five million tons, and
will be one of China's biggest foreign trade port.
</P>
<P>
The city is connected with more than 900 major Chinese cities
and 159 countries and regions in the world through its modern
telecommunications network.

<HEADLINE> Meteorological Satellite Found "Precipitation" In Taklimakan Desert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Using modern satellite technology,
Chinese meteorological scientists have rejected the theory that
there is no precipitation in the Taklimakan Desert.
</P>
<P>
Research findings obtained by a meteorological satellite remote
sensing monitoring system have altered the former theory that the
subtropical high-pressure cannot enter into the basin area of
southern Xinjiang because the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau is an
obstacle.
</P>
<P>
"The mid summer is the desert's 'rainy' season and the
movements of its steam have been detected," said Xu Xihui, senior
engineer of the Meteorological Bureau of the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have discovered frequent "precipitation" in the
Taklimakan Desert since using meteorological satellite data in
their research.
</P>
<P>
They collected data from about 32 incidents of "precipitation"
in the inner part of the desert from 1991 to 1993; the volume of
rainfall was so frequent that their traces could exist in the
desert for two to three days.
</P>
<P>
They even found that the desert, covering an area of 337,600 sq
km, was almost strewn with joined strips of rain traces and this
phenomenon had existed for four days in early September 1995.

<HEADLINE> Syria, Israel Resume Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Syrian diplomats
took a surprise step on Wednesday by meeting in the U.S. State
Department to discuss a new ceasefire pact for Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Syria and Israel were joined by envoys of
the United States, France and Lebanon for the talks aimed at
working out details to monitor a ceasefire agreement previously
brokered by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was chaired by special U.S. Middle East envoy
Dennis Ross, Christopher's top aide.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a briefing
that "Dennis Ross has convened the monitoring group here in the
department. This is an issue that we wanted to return to as
quickly as we could, with the new Israeli government, and with
Lebanon, Syria, and France and others, because...this agreement
protects civilians on both sides of the Lebanese-Israeli border."
</P>
<P>
Last April, Christopher brokered an agreement between Israel
and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah (the Party of God) guerrillas
which ended 17 days of fighting in which at least 150 Lebanese
civilians were killed.
</P>
<P>
The April pact limits combat to military targets in a 9-mile
swath of Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon, except in times of
national emergency.
</P>
<P>
The pact, a two-page "understanding," called for the
above-mentioned five nations to create a panel relying on American
spy satellites and observers on the ground to monitor the
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
But the parties concerned suspended their negotiations on May
23 as Israel started its elections and newly-elected Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lambasted his predecessor Shimon
Peres' strategy of swapping Syria's Golan Heights for peace.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who was sworn in on June 18, said he also would not
permit the Palestinians to create a nation in the occupied
territories with its capital in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's position on the peace negotiations have been
condemned by most Arab nations who plan to meet in Cairo this
weekend to discuss the situation.
</P>
<P>
Christopher is going to take a Middle East tour next week and
he will meet the new Israeli Prime Minister and Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak. He also hopes to arrange a meeting with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The tour could help determine how the peace process talks might
be renewed, said Burns.

<HEADLINE> China Introduces Water-saving Irrigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to introduce a
water-saving irrigation system in 300 counties across China in a
bid to overcome a persistent drought in the north.
</P>
<P>
Over the next five years, modern spray and drip-irrigation
techniques will be applied to at least 6,700 ha. of
well-cultivated land in each of the selected counties, "China
Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The new irrigation system, operating through a pipeline
network, will replace the obsolete open-cut trenches to ensure
efficiency and conserve water.
</P>
<P>
Most of these counties, located in the arid north and northwest
China, have been suffering a chronic water shortage for decades,
especially the provinces of Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Qinghai
and Gansu.
</P>
<P>
The new system will enable at least 60 percent of the selected
counties' existing irrigated land to become high-yielding, with an
increased output of grain totalling 1.95 billion kg by the time
the program is completed.
</P>
<P>
Under the the new program, the effective water utilization rate
of irrigation is expected to be raised from the current 30 percent
to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 3.6 billion cubic meters of water and 40,000 ha of
drought-ridden farmland would be saved as a result.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Water Resources and experts are
confident that the success of the program will help ease the
worsening water shortage caused by ever-increasing demand for
farming irrigation, which consumes 80 percent of China's total
water supply.

HAIKOU, June 20 (Xinhua) -- South China's Hainan Province is
expected to become the largest non-woven production base in
Southeast Asia in seven years, a provincial official revealed
today.
</P>
<P>
A non-woven city will be built in Chengmai County on the basis
of existing Xinlong Non-woven Corporation which produces 8,000
tons of non-woven products a year.
</P>
<P>
The corporation is equipped with up-to-date technology and
equipment imported from Germany, Italy and Switzerland. Its
products sold well at the 1995 Shanghai International Non-woven
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng highly praised Xinlong's achievements
during an inspection tour to the corporation early this year.
</P>
<P>
The State Economic and Trade Commission and the Bank of China
have so far approved a technological transformation project for
the existing production lines. When the project is completed, it
will fill a gap in China's production of high-grade compound
non-woven cloth.
</P>
<P>
The second phase construction for the production base has
undergone experts' verification and will soon start.
</P>
<P>
On completion, it will turn out five billion yuan's worth of

<HEADLINE> Thai Ministry Takes Measures to Promote Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 20 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to tackle the slowdown in
export growth, the Thai Commerce Ministry has decided to hold
regular monthly meetings with exporters, according to Commerce
Minister Chucheep Hansawat.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the meetings is be to catch up with the market
situation in all regions and map out strategy, Chucheep was quoted
today by local newspaper Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the ministry met with a group of rice
exporters, and other groups will follow, he said.
</P>
<P>
Export growth slowed during the first four months of this year
to 8 percent from more than 20 percent in the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Economists are worried that the country may not be able to
achieve its earlier projection of 18 percent expansion.
</P>
<P>
Exports in the first three months were worth 348,602.4 million
baht (13,944 million US dollars), a mere 6.1 percent increase over
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has insisted that the target will be met by the
end of the year. However, the significant drop in the first four
months has nudged the ministry into taking some action.
</P>
<P>
Chucheep told Thai commercial counselors in 54 countries and
Thai trade centers in 21 countries to provide immediate reports on
the market situation in their respective bases.
</P>
<P>
Chucheep gave an assurance that the ministry would not adjust
the export target set at 1,658 billion baht (66.3 billion US
dollars), which is up 18 percent over last year, because it is
likely that export performance will improve in the second half.
</P>
<P>
He said the Finance Ministry's measures to reduce interest rate
would lower exporters' production costs, especially when exporters
need to carry stocks for a period before exporting.
</P>
<P>
"The interest rate cut will allow exporters to have cheaper
capital to run or expand businesses, and will eventually have a
favorable impact on the country's exports,' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's gross domestic product
(GDP) will rise 6.1 percent in the current fiscal year ending
mid-July, according to a senior planning official.
</P>
<P>
Vice Chairman of the National Planning Commission Prithivi Raj
Ligal said Wednesday here at a discussion program on the
forthcoming budget that the growth rate would not be achieved
from a single product but a broad base.
</P>
<P>

mainly due to a decline in agricultural production because of
unfavorable weather condition.
</P>
<P>
The new budget for the 1996-97 fiscal year from next month will
focus on resource mobilization and export promotion, the official
said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> North China Mountains Afforested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Taihang Mountains in north China
is becoming greener thanks to an afforestation program for the
once barren mountains which stretch through Shanxi, Henan and
Hebei provinces and Beijing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
The Taihang Mountain Afforestation Program, which officially
started in 1994, after operating on a trial basis since 1986,
hopes to raise the forest coverage rate of the mountains to 54.5
percent by the year 2050, up 30 percentage points from the
coverage rate in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi province, with the western part of the mountains, is
responsible for 43 percent of the program's task of planting four
million hectares of trees by the year 2000, today's China Daily
reports. Each of the past three years saw an increase of 133,000
hectares of trees, due to manual work done in the province.
</P>
<P>
It is compulsory work for both farmers and county leaders to
build pits around hills, which can hold water. The province also
encourages farmers to grow trees with cash crops, which will make
money for them and make the mountains green.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have used unique methods to promote the
forestry development, such as auctioning barren mountain land to
farmers for 70 years of usage rights, so farmers can plant cash
trees or timber trees to earn profits.
</P>
<P>
It quoted an official of the Ministry of Forestry as saying
that these approaches have not hurt the balance of species of
trees, as vast areas of the mountains are unapproachable by man
and will be planted with ecology-friendly trees by aerial sowing
and other methods.
</P>
<P>
The ministry says cash tree acreage should not surpass 30
percent of the total, to guarantee the planting of
ecology-friendly trees by aerial sowing and other methods.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial bank
of China (ICBC) has become the country's second largest foreign
exchange dealer, next to the Bank of China, owing to strong growth
in foreign exchange businesses.
</P>
<P>
The bank's total foreign exchange capital topped 24.9 billion
US dollars by the end of last year, excluding assets of its
overseas subsidiaries, Liu Tinghuan, vice-president of the bank,
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, outstanding foreign exchange savings jumped 47
percent from 1993 to 10.49 billion US dollars, with the loans
hitting 8.38 billion, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
China's robust growth in utilization of foreign funds and
booming foreign trade are providing a golden opportunity for the
bank to develop its foreign exchange business, Liu told the bank's
work conference on foreign exchange business held in Suzhou.
</P>
<P>
ICBC's foreign exchange profits also reached 420 million
dollars last year, with international settlement transactions 54.7
billion dollars, accounting for 19 percent of the country's total
foreign trade volume, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
But Liu also admitted that fluctuation in the international
financial market will bring more risks to the banks' international
businesses while China's expanding financial reform are expected
to lead to fiercer competition among the domestic market.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani President Urges Fight Against Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari today underlined the importance of fighting against all
kinds of corruption in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Lahore Press Club in Lahore, capital of Punjab
province of Pakistan, Leghari stressed the need to sustain a
simple living and urged politicians and government officials not
to live beyond their means.
</P>
<P>
"There is a great economic disparity in the country which must
be overcome through sustained efforts," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said two-thirds of the nation's population were illiterate
and denied the basic necessities of life while on the other hand a
section of society was enjoying an ostentatious lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
"Such discrimination must be eliminated if Pakistan was to
progress and develop as a welfare country," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He also called for better use of human resources and said
according to a United Nations report Pakistan was among those
countries which spend the least in this sector.
</P>

appropriate ways and means to make maximum utilization of our
human resources," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the 35-minute speech in which he touched on various
subjects. Leghari also slated those who refuse to pay taxes and
said tax culture has not been developed in this country.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Port Dredges Channel to Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A dredging project has started
to deepen the depth of the channel to the sea at Guangzhou Port,
regarded as the port's "life line".
</P>
<P>
The project, a national key scheme in the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000), consists of two phases. The first phase will enable
the water depth to reach 11.5 meters so that 35,000-ton ships can
sail into the port any time of the day. It is expected to take
three years to complete, and cost 750 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The second phase will enable its water depth to reach 12.5
meters so that 50,000-ton ships can get into the port at any time.
</P>
<P>
The channel currently has a depth of nine meters, a result of
two previous dredging operations in 1954 and 1975.
</P>
<P>
The project started from a 83-kilometer-section from Guishan
anchorage to Dahu anchorage, where the dredging is expected to
cost 140 million yuan, and will be completed in December of next
year.
</P>
<P>
The hub of water transport in south China, Guangzhou port's
handling capacity has been growing at an annual rate of nine
percent since 1980s, in the wake of rapid economic expansion in
the Pearl River delta and the whole south China region.
</P>
<P>
Last year the port handled 73 million tons of cargo, ranking
third in China.
</P>
<P>
With more traffic around the port, its channel to the sea has
limited the port's further development because of its insufficient
water depth.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the port has 30 berths able to accommodate vessels
of above 10,000-ton class, but now they can only handle smaller
ships. Larger ships have to transfer some of their cargoes to
other ships before being able to sail into the harbor, and big
cargo container liners have to transship cargo in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The dredging project will boost Guangzhou Port's handling
capacity, which is expected to reach over 100 million tons of
cargo by the end of the century.

given a warm welcome to the forthcoming visit of Chinese President
Jiang Zemin and hope it will lead to better ties with China.
</P>
<P>
"We admire China's policy of reform and opening to the outside

fields since diplomatic relations were established in March 1973,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Now the two countries enjoy good bilateral relations and are in
a strong position to enhance them, the Senate leader said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China's Women Organizations Spring up Nationwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Thousands upon thousands of
Chinese women are playing cupid and taking on the role of
troubleshooters in the neighborhood communities along streets or
hutongs (lanes) across the country, according to China Women's
News.
</P>
<P>
They have formed street-level organizations in their
communities, helping to solve family disputes and quarrels,
serving as go-betweens for lovers, and even operating businesses
for job-seeking girls.
</P>
<P>
 China has now created almost 6,800 of the grass-roots level
women organizations, according to the All-China Women's Federation.
</P>
<P>
The agencies are helpful for women living in small communities
-- usually in several streets or lanes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, over half of the government departments have special
committees to protect women's rights. And the proportion varies
according to different regions, with the level 98 percent in some
areas.
</P>
<P>
The federation has also helped create 2,682 women's rights
organizations in private companies.
</P>
<P>
Chinese women's social status has been raised substantially
since the founding of New China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
However, as a developing country, the country is still worried
about the situation, since most of the illiterates are women, and
in a few cases women were abducted and even traded by criminals.
</P>
<P>
China was the host of the Fourth World Conference on Women of
the United Nations in September last year.

of the abyss before the match. The star-studded team must defeat

the quality of the play do not believe this Italian side deserved
to go out," he said.
</P>
<P>
"You can not consider this a failure when you see the quality
of Germany, Russia and the Czech Republic. We played very well in
this ame and Kopke made some extraordiniary saves," he added.
</P>
<P>
The German coach Voghts said that he was disappointed to see
the Italians go out but he praised German defenders for what he
called world-class performances.
</P>
<P>
"We played a very strong team today and we had to battle a
draw. It is a shame that Italians are no longer in the
competetion," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the coming quarter-final clash with Croatia, the
German coach said, "it is going to be very difficult agaisnt
Croatia because Helmer may be doubtful and we may have to rebuild
our defence."

the two sides fought to a 3-3 draw and finally German and Czech
Republic, which are top two team of group C have qualified for the

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
a group of governors on Wednesday discussed measures to prevent
more fires at predominantly black churches in the South and
efforts to prosecute those responsible.
</P>
<P>
"We need to try to do more to prevent these burnings from
occurring in the first place," Clinton said in a photo session
before the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Fires considered suspicious have destroyed several dozens of
black churches throughout the South in the past year and a half.
</P>
<P>
While saying he did not believe it is a conspiracy, Clinton
said he did believe a lot of incidences are racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting Vice President Al Gore announced a
coordinated nationwide effort to try to halt the rash of fires at
churches.
</P>
<P>
Federal Emergency Management Agency Director James Lee Witt,
Attorney General Janet Reno and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
will work with the governors in all states to draft a coordinated
initiative to include surveillance and security, the creation of
"watch groups," and other efforts to identify potential risks, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting were several Cabinet secretaries and
members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
In Congress, the House of Representatives voted unanimously on
Tuesday to give the federal government more power to investigate
the church burnings, passing the Church Arson Prevention Act. The

<HEADLINE> Dow Manages Slight Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
rose Wednesday, but most stocks slid again as bonds failed to
improve and investors remained cautious about inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Dow industrials advanced 20.32 points to 5,648.35. But that
was down from a midday gain of 46 points.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues led advancers throughout the day, and most
broad-market indexes ended lower after struggling higher with
bonds earlier in the session.
</P>
<P>
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond finished unchanged at
7.10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 7 to 5 on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 375.29 million
shares, making it the sixth straight session below 400 million.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index fell 0.26 to 355.32, its ninth
straight decline; and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell
0.10 to 661.96, the eight straight decline for that blue-chip
measure. The American Stock Exchange's market value index fell
0.06 to 588.93.
</P>
<P>
The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index, which tumbled
nearly 25 points on Tuesday, fell 3.81 to 1,179.27, but several
computer-industry bellwethers rebounded.
</P>
<P>
At midday, the Federal Reserve reported that the economy
continued to grow at a moderate pace in May and early June.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have been concerned about signs of rising payroll and
wage levels, which could create too much consumer demand, pushing
up prices. Some analysts expect the inflation-leery Fed to raise
interest rates in early July to slow borrowing and spending.

<HEADLINE> Serbian Parties Condemn Terrorist attacks in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Serbian political parties today
strongly condemned ethnic Albanian terrorist attacks on policemen
in the southern province of Kosovo on Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party said in a statement the attacks showed it
was high time that the issue of Serbs' and ethnic Albanians'
co-existence in the province be solved, and the best way to do so
was ethnic Albanians' participation in Serbia's political life.
</P>
<P>
"The Kosovo issue is a state affair and must be dealt with by
relevant state institutions, this being the only way to secure
living conditions, human and civil rights that would be in keeping
with international standards, over an indefinite period of time,"
the party said.
</P>
<P>
Two policemen were killed and one wounded on separate attacks
in Kosovo in the past two days, causing tension again in the
province where nearly two million ethnic Albanians are trying to
secede from Yugoslavia to join neighboring Albanians. A total of
150 people have died during clashes with police or as result of
conflicts since 1989.
</P>
<P>
The Radical Party of Serbia said it was not hard to see what
lay behind the attacks, because ethnic Albanians had opted for
violence rather than dialogue immediately upon the recognition of
Yugoslavia that confirmed that Kosovo was its integral part,
according to official Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
The local board of Serbia's ruling Socialist Party in the
Kosovska Mitrovica district in Kosovo called for a resolute action
in finding those responsible for the terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
It also said a change in ethnic Albanian separatists' methods
was aimed at spreading the feeling of fear and insecurity among
the population in and outside the province, and at forcing Serbs
and Montenegrins to leave the province.
</P>
<P>
Borislav Pelevic, Vice-president of the non-parliamentary Party
of Serb Unity, told a news conference in Pristina, capital of
Kosovo, that the attacks were part of a joint plan by leader of
ethnic Albanian separatists Ibrahim Rugova and Albania to create
an independent state of Kosovo, Tanjug reports said.

<HEADLINE> Steiner Deplores Persecutions of Sarajevan Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Deputy to the international High
Representative for Bosnia Michael Steiner today accused the
Muslims of persecuting the Serbs remaining in Sarajevo after part
of the city was handed over to the Muslim control.
</P>
<P>
"I am ashamed of the persecution and terror over Sarajevan
Serbs in the municipalities that are now controled by the
Muslim-Croat federation, Steiner said in an interview to the
Sarajevan daily Oslobodjenje today.
</P>
<P>
Steiner said the Muslim government has lacked the political
will to put a stop to the terror and robbing of the remaining
8,000 Serbs who are now preparing to leave the city.
</P>
<P>
Before the five Serb-held municipalities reverted to the
Muslim-Croat federation on March 19, tens of thousands of Serb
Sarajevans fled their homes to settle down in other Serb
territories for fear of reprisal from their former enemies -- the
Muslims and Croats. Only a few thousands remained in their
hometown in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
"Organized or not, what is happening in Sarajevo is ethnic
engineering," Steiner said, adding "I am ashamed because of what
is happening in Sarajevo."
</P>
<P>
He said that in those municipalities formerly controled by the
Serbs, Serb homes are being robbed every day, windows are broken
at night and things taken out of houses.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that he was personally ashamed because he had
promised Serb Sarajevans, doctors for example, that they would
keep their jobs, and that they were being fired now.
</P>
<P>
What is happening in the region is a shame for this city, he
said, and urged the Muslim government to take actions to stop such
crimes as robberies and intimidation.
</P>
<P>
He added that he had talked with Bosnian Muslim leader Alija
Izetbegovic in Sarajevo and told him nothing was as it should be,
and that robberies and harassments had been going on for months.
</P>
<P>
If there is a real political will in the Muslim government,
then what is happening now must be stopped, he said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Minister: Terrorists in Kosovo Must be Restrained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Interior Minister
Vukasin Jokanovic said today following the latest terrorist
actions in Kosovo that terrorists must be restrained.
</P>
<P>
Two policemen were killed and one wounded in an incident in
Podujevo and another near Kosovska Mitrovica in the past two days
in the northwest of the southern Serbian province of Kosovo, where
90 percent of the 10 million population is ethnic Albanians who
seek to separate from Yugoslavia to join neighboring Albania.
</P>
<P>
During a break in the session of the Yugoslav lower house,
Jokanovic told reporters the ethnic Albanian separatist movement
in Kosovo was striving to maintain a tense atmosphere and even
create new tensions.
</P>
<P>
"A stabilization is not in the interest of the separatist
movement, particularly given the unequivocal stand of the
international community that Kosovo is Serbia's internal affair,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Peaceful co-existence on equal footing does not suit
separatists who believe that they can achieve their well-known
goals through terrorist actions," he added.
</P>
<P>
Five people were killed and another five wounded in separate
incidents in April, including policemen, after an Albanian youth
was shot dead by a Serb.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry will apprehend the perpetrators and bring
them to justice, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the nature of these terrorist forces and groups
is increasingly clear to the international community," Jokanovic
said, adding that terrorism must be curbed because their actions
are creating tensions among Serbs, Montenegrins and all other
citizens living in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> French, Germans, British Oppose Single Currency: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The people of germany, France and
Britain are all opposed to a single European currency, in
Britain's case by a huge 4 to 1 majority, according to a poll
conducted for the newspaper Independent.
</P>
<P>
Of British voters, 78 percent agreed that "Britain should keep
the pound", while only 18 percent thought the pound should be
replaced by the euro, the highest figure recorded for opposition
to the single currency in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The poll also shows that the whole of Europe could be moving in
a Euro-sceptic direction.
</P>
<P>
Germans oppose a single currency by 70 to 29 percent, and the
normally pro-single-currency French are opposed by 55 to 43
percent. Even th ultra-European Belgians are opposed by 50 to 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
The poll comes as an all-party House of Lords committee warns
of the dangers of Britain being left out of a single currency if
Germany and France go ahead. The report of its six-month inquiry,
published today, says "it may be difficult to resist" pressures
for informal trade discrimination against countries which do not
join.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Pass New Sanctions against Iran, Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives unanimously passed a bill on Wednesday that would
further tighten sanctions against Iran and Libya by punishing
foreign companies investing in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The bill, approved 415-0, lists six sanctions options and
requires the U.S. president to impose at least two of the six
penalties on any companies that invest $40 million or more in one
year in developing Iran's oil and gas resources or violate
existing U.N. embargoes against Libya, including sales of refining
equipment.
</P>
<P>
"This bill, in short, will require foreign companies to choose
between investing in our market or those of Iran and Libya," said
Representative Benjamin Gilman, a Republican from New York,
Chairman of the House International Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
Representative Lee Hamilton, an Indiana Democrat, said: "The
ultimate goal...is to persuade other government to adopt measures
that squeeze the economies of Libya and Iran."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Administration officials have said that the mere threat of
sanctions has chilled investment in Tehran, but U.S. allies
refusing to back U.S. efforts to isolate Iran, have voiced their
unhappiness challenged Washington for violating international
trade rules, especially when a similar legislation punishing
foreign companies that invest in Cuba was passed in the Congress
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The bill also requires the president to try to negotiate
international sanctions against Iran. Countries that failed to
join multilateral agreement against Iran would face a $20 million
sanctions investment trigger but not $40 million.
</P>
<P>
The six sanctions options from which the president may choose
include denying Export-Import Bank loans, denying export licenses,
barring U.S. banks from making loans of more than $10 million a
year to sanctioned parties, barring sanctioned financial
institutions from being primary dealers of U.S. government bonds,
banning U.S. government procurement of goods and services from
sanctioned entities and imposing import sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Parliament Decides to Set up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb parliament

</P>
<P>

Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his army commander Ratko
Mladic.
</P>
<P>
The Serb parliament also passed a number of laws, including the
amnesty law and the law annulling the laws related to the time of
immediate war threat.
</P>
<P>
The amnesty law will give up charges against anyone who had

the foundations of the Serb social system.
</P>
<P>
The parliament also adopted the law annulling the legislation

</P>
<P>

parliament voted to choose Vitomir Popovic to be the arbiter for
the Serb entity on the controversial city of Brcko in northern
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The area of Brcko is on the bottleneck of the corridor which

problem will be solved through international arbitration within a
year since the signing of the Dayton agreement in December of last
year.
