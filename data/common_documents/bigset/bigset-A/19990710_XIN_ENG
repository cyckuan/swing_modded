<P>
MOSCOW, July 9 (Xinhua) -- All 17 Georgian government officials
and journalists held hostage early Friday were released in the
breakaway republic of Abkhazia, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The hostages, including Georgian Health Minister Avtandil

Republic of Abkhazia Londer Tsaav, were seized by masked gunmen in
the Kodorskoye gorge, the only area of Abkhazia under Georgian
control.
</P>
<P>
They were released following successful negotiations between
the authorities and the gunmen, Georgian presidential press
secretary Vakhtang Abashidze said.
</P>
<P>
The group will return to Tbilisi, the Georgian capital,
Saturday morning, Abashidze said.
</P>
<P>
The group came to the Kodorskoye gorge by helicopter from
western Georgia on a regular trip.
</P>
<P>
They were held by local people of Georgian nationality who
hoped to force the authorities to solve some of their social
problems, Interfax said, quoting reliable sources.

<HEADLINE> Coke, Pepsi Cola Lower Prices in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Bottlers of Coca Cola and
Pepsi Cola have lowered the prices of their sodas from 200
Tanzanian shillings (one U. S. dollar equals to some 740
shillings) to 150 shillings in several regions of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Coca Cola Kwanza brought down their prices in Dar es Salaam,
Coast, Morogoro and Lindi regions last Thursday, the company's
sales manager Felix Mlingi said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mlingi said that the wholesales price for a crate of soda is
now 3,000 shillings instead of 4,050 shillings while the retail
price per bottle is 150 shillings instead of 200 shillings.
</P>
<P>
He explained that his company was forced to bring down the
prices after Pepsi Cola did so several weeks ago in Kilimanjaro,
Kagera, Morogoro and Dar es Salaam regions.
</P>
<P>
The Pepsi Cola chief executive in Tanzania M. Chatur said that
"we set pace of the unprecedented reduction of soft drink prices
in Tanzania. Coca Cola has followed suit. This is one of the
immediate benefits of competition in soft drinks."
</P>
<P>
Chatur could not say how long the lowered price of sodas will
be maintained as there are a number of factors being monitored
prior to making any decisions.

<HEADLINE> World to Launch Count-Up to Six Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Many countries are expected
to mark July 11, World Population Day with events to start the
count-up to the Day of Six Billion to be commemorated on October
12, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
World population, growing annually by 78 million in recent
years, reaches 6 billion this year. The huge number of population,
most of them living in developing countries, has caught attention
of policy-makers with concerns about resources, the environment
and the quality of living.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly in a recent special session appealed
to governments to integrate population concerns into national
development plans, in terms of better meeting education, health
and other needs. It also highlighted the importance of family
planning.
</P>
<P>
Describing the six billion people as a challenge, UNFPA
Executive Director Nafis Sadik on Friday pointed to the fact that
there are a billion young people between 15 and 24 years of age
today.
</P>
<P>
"Their decisions about the size and spacing of their families
will determine how many people will be on the planet by 2050 and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
"Their decisions will also help determine how they live -- in
poverty or prosperity, on a green and healthy planet or in a world
devastated by many activities," she said.
</P>
<P>
UNFPA is urging governments and organizations to use World
Population Day to build momentum and awareness of the Day of 6
billion while considering the consequences of high birth rates in
many poorer countries.
</P>
<P>
World Population Day was first marked in 1987 when population
reached 5 billion.
</P>
<P>
The global population reached 1 billion in 1804 since the
beginning of life on the planet. It took 123 years to reach 2
billion in 1927 and only 33 years to reach 3 billion in 1960.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen years later it reached 4 billion in 1974, and 5
billion in a time-span of 13 years. It reaches 6 billion in another
12 years.

<HEADLINE> Dow Jones Pulls Jo'burg Exchange Stock Off Lows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A stronger opening on Wall
Street Friday pulled South African shares off their lows.
</P>
<P>
Financial and industrial shares ended lower on pre-weekend
profit-taking and ahead of Monday's listing of Old Mutual, reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The Old Mutual listing is the largest initial public offering
by a South African company. Estimates for the initial market
capitalization are of the order of 40 billion (6.6 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
At the 16:00 local time (14:00 GMT) close, the all-share index
was down 0.11 percent, the industrial index was 0.13 percent
weaker and financials were down by 0.91 percent. Both the
resources and all-gold indices were stronger at 0.60 percent and
0.28 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Johannesburg Stock Exchange started weaker Friday after the
Dow Jones industrial average index dropped by 60.5 points
Thursday, but trading was generally subdued as investors made
space for Old Mutual shares.
</P>
<P>
The trading range on the all-share index was only 21.3 points
or less than 0.3 percent of Thursday's close.
</P>
<P>
Analysts are expecting between two and 10 billion rand (333
million to 1. 6 billion dollars) to flow into South Africa as UK
tracker funds buy the shares from South African policy-holders.
</P>
<P>
South African Standard Bank continued to gain from being the
first commercial bank to announce the latest interest rate cut.
</P>
<P>
Its share price rose by 15 cents, while the other major
commercial banks, which followed Standard Bank's lead a day later,
all saw their share prices under pressure.
</P>
<P>
A similar mixed picture was visible in the gold market.
</P>
<P>
Those gold producers who have said that they have hedged their
production at prices above 300 dollars per ounce, such as
Anglogold and Durban Deep, saw rises of 420 cents and 30 cents
respectively, but Goldfields fell by 70 cents and Harmony dropped
85 cents.
</P>
<P>
The market perceives these latter two mining houses to have
more unhedged production.
</P>
<P>
The gold price itself rose to 257.30 dollars per ounce at
Friday afternoon's London gold fix from Thursday morning's London
fix. In New York trading it gave up the gains and was last at
256.30 dollars an ounce.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations-sponsored
International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR) ended
its five-day meeting here Friday by urging the international
community to act decisively at once to guarantee a safer world for
future generations.
</P>
<P>
"Political will is essential to ensure that appropriate
policies and institutional arrangements foster a culture of
prevention at all levels of our societies," said the IDNDR in a
statement issued at the end of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We shall adopt and implement policy measures at the
international, regional, sub-regional, national and local levels
aimed at reducing the vulnerability of our societies to both
natural and technological hazards through proactive rather than
reactive approaches," it said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the statement stressed that scientific, social and
economic research and technological and planning applications
would be required at all levels and from a wide range of
disciplines in order to support risk management and effective
reduction of our vulnerabilities.
</P>
<P>
In this connection, it added, there is need for increased
information exchange, improved early warning capacities,
technology transfer and technical cooperation among all countries,
paying particular attention to the most vulnerable and affected.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the statement pointed out that appropriate
financial resources would be needed to ensure the development and
implementation of prevention and mitigation policies and programs
in all countries particularly developing countries.
</P>
<P>
In the end, the statement recommended to the international
community and to the United Nations that, based on the proven
success of the functional responsibilities and organization
arrangements during the IDNDR, the international cooperative
framework for disaster reduction be maintained and strengthened.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges U.S. Not to Scrap ABM Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev said Friday that scrapping the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Defense Treaty (ABM) would derail the process of the
reduction of strategic weapons.
</P>
<P>
"If the ABM treaty is repudiated, irretrievable damage will be
done to the process of reducing the number of strategic offensive
weapons," Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
He said Moscow has repeatedly warned that a planned U.S.
national anti-missile defense system would in effect signify a
U.S. withdrawal from the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the ABM treaty underlies the entire system of
strategic weapons reduction.
</P>
<P>
He said the process had been successful during the Cold War and
is so today, that agreements are being made and that a monitoring
mechanism has been set up, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The ABM treaty "must be preserved and its provisions fulfilled
precisely," Sergeyev said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Draft Year 2000 Compliance Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Parliament will draft a year 2000
(Y2K) compliance bill to encourage companies and public utilities
to make essential disclosures regarding Y2K compliance of their
products, services and internal operations, President Robert
Mugabe said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening a two-day national seminar on Y2K compliance
here, Mugabe said there were a few "critical" legal uncertainties
in Zimbabwe concerning the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
"It is desirable that such a bill be actively pursued to deal
with eventualities of the millennium bug," said the president.
</P>
<P>
"The Year 2000 Compliance Act could also be used as an
instrument by the National Year 2000 Task Force to ensure
cooperation from key organizations which could otherwise seriously
cripple the economy if they were non- compliant," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe commended the significant number of companies in the
private sector, the Posts and Telecommunications Corporation and
government departments that had already attained a high level of
preparedness.
</P>
<P>
He said there are still some grey areas which need to be
cleared especially with respect to public utilities and local
authorities.
</P>
<P>
In response to the Y2K problem, the Zimbabwean government set
up the National Y2K Task Force under the Ministry of Higher
Education and Technology last July.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said this facilitated the pooling of resources for
planning purposes that would cover technological and legal
challenges of the year 2000 problem.

<HEADLINE> Freeze on Russian-NATO Military Ties Remains In Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A moratorium on Russian-NATO
military relations remains in force and contingent upon political
decisions, Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Patient and hard work will be needed" to restore those
relations because "one river cannot be entered twice," Sergeyev
told a press conference, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Russian-NATO Permanent Council "must be
transformed from a decorative into a constructive body."
</P>
<P>
Russia's ties with NATO, already strained because of the
military alliance's eastward expansion, plummeted to a new low
when NATO staged a 78-day air campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has since frozen its relations with NATO but limited
contacts were resumed between the two sides in peacekeeping
operations in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Russia's presence in four sectors in Kosovo presents numerous
advantages. Russia is there in strategic areas in the center of
Kosovo," Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
"Our presence in four sectors of responsibility will promote a
more effective interaction between Russian and NATO peacekeepers,"
Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
The minister's remarks followed President Boris Yeltsin's
statement Thursday that Moscow would follow a middle-of-the-road
course when dealing with the West, avoiding both direct
confrontation and unquestioning friendship.

<HEADLINE> S. African Life Expectancy to Drop by 20 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The life expectancy of the
average South African was expected to drop from 60 to 40 years by
2008 as a result of AIDS mortality, the Department of Welfare and
Population Development said Friday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3.6 million South Africans were already infected
with HIV, and it was estimated that the virus would have infected
20 percent of the work force by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Over the next three years, the annual death toll could be
250,000, leaving behind almost 600,000 orphans," the department
said in a statement issued two days before the World Population
Day which fall on July 11.
</P>
<P>
The loss of productive workers could reduce the country's
economic growth rate by about two percent.
</P>
<P>
The department said about 40 million people worldwide had been
infected with HIV since the late 1970s, of which more than 11
million are believed to have died.
</P>
<P>
The department said AIDS was having a major impact on growth
trends in the world's population, which was expected to reach the
six-billion mark by October this year.
</P>
<P>
Reaching this mark was somehow a success, as people today lived
longer and healthier lives than any other generation in history,
said the statement .
</P>
<P>
"Today there are over a billion young people between the ages
of 15 and 24. The world leadership's decisions will determine how
future generations will live -- in poverty or prosperity, on a
green and healthy planet or in a world devastated by human
activity," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The World Population Day was first commemorated in 1987, when
the five- billion mark of the world population was reached.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's population was expected to reach 43 million in
October.

MOSCOW, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin said Friday that he supports a proposal by Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov to appeal to the Council of Europe against a
Latvian language law that hurts the Baltic country's ethnic
Russian minority.
</P>
<P>
"I am prepared, as prime minister of Russia, to make the
pertinent appeal to the Council of Europe and other international
organizations," Stepashin said.
</P>
<P>
The Latvian parliament on Thursday passed a bill mandating the
use of the Latvian language at most public functions and in
business, even those involving only Russian speakers, who account
for 40 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin complained that Russian speakers "live as outcasts"
because of discriminatory practices, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said earlier that the law goes against international
legal standards and that he will report to President Boris Yeltsin
on measures to protect Latvia's Russian speakers planned by the
Russian government.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohamed Said
Essaihaf Friday complained about the sanctions against it and
urged Arab countries to unite and help Bagdad get rid of the
embargo.
</P>
<P>
As a special guest invited for the 35th Organization of African
Unity (OAU) scheduled for July 12-14 here, Essaihaf said that his
government is expecting moral support in favor of Iraq's "just
claim to lift the embargo imposed on us for some nine years now."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed the sanctions against Bagdad after
Iraq invaded Kuwait during the gulf war nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
As for the new Iraqi initiative to get out of the crisis,
Essaihaf said that it consists of an opposition to the position of
the United States "whose sole objective is to impose its hegemony
on Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister said that his government is asking all Arab
states to be interdependent with Iraq and to call for the lifting
of the embargo which is a "fair claim".
</P>
<P>
He said, "we owe our participation to this summit to Algeria
and we will attempt to prepare all forthcoming OAU meetings" so as
to explain to our African friends the relation between Iraq and
the U.N. Security Council and the unjust embargo imposed on Iraq.

<P>
LUANDA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Hallo Trust, the British demining
company which is operating in Angola's central city of Huambo,
said Friday that it is concerned over the increasing casualties
created by land mines in the area.
</P>
<P>
Representative of the company Mattw Hovell said that 19 cases
of land mine explosion occurred in the past two months in Kalima
and Etunda in the suburbs of Huambo, causing seven deaths, the
Angolan news agency Angop reported.
</P>
<P>
The capital city of Huambo Province has been besieged by the
rebel National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
since the civil war renewed late last year. The UNITA troops have
planted land mines in the area in order to cut off road traffic
between Huambo and the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Hovell noted that his company is committed to removing land
mines in all places controlled by the Angolan government,
especially in the rural area.
</P>
<P>
Due to the escalating conflicts, the Angolan government has
actually stopped its demining operation across the southern
African country.
</P>
<P>
There are on average eight to nine mine explosions in Angola
each month.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics released by the United Nations,
more than 11 million land mines had been planted in Angola during
the 30 years of its independence and civil wars.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Farmers Urged to Increase Farm Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Friday urged Zimbabwean farmers to fully utilize the land that was
distributed to them to develop agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
"Agriculture is our main industry in Zimbabwe. Most of our
people reside in rural areas and must be compelled to work hard to
improve their output," Mugabe said when opening the Murewa Grain
Marketing Board silo in east Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The president said Zimbabwe should produce more staple maize
because it was in high demand in the southern African region.
</P>
<P>
"If Zimbabwe do not grow adequate maize then we have a
disaster," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Farming is part of our culture and we should take advantage of
this for Zimbabwe to become a real grain basket for the region,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, people would only increase their agricultural
output if they were given adequate fertile land.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe had told the visiting British delegation recently that
if London failed to give the Zimbabwean government money, they
would not compensate the white farmers whose land was being taken
for the land distribution exercise.
</P>
<P>
"If they give us money, we will give it to their children so
that we get the farms," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said he had made it "in black and white" that
they would acquire land from these farmers for the land
redistribution program.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government plans to get a total of five million
hectares of land from white farmers in the next five years to
resettle about 150,000 black families throughout this southern
African country of about 12.5 million people.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa stressed here Friday it is important to speed up the
restructuring of the secretariat of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
On the fringe of the 70th session of the OAU Foreign Minister
Conference, Moussa told the Algerian News Agency that the coming
OAU summit will deal with the OAU's financial crisis and the
restructuring of the pan-African body's secretariat in addition to
other issues of common concern for the continent.
</P>
<P>
Many OAU members fall short of their financial commitments,
thus hindering the operations of the OAU and limit its
effectiveness, the Egyptian minister pointed out.
</P>
<P>
On the current crises in the continent, Moussa said there are
positive signs of detente and political solutions.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the necessity to implement the two accords signed
recently between the conflicting parties in the Democratic
Republic of Congo and Sierra Leone..
</P>
<P>
There are also promising indicators in othe unstable areas in
the African continent, such south Sudan, Mauritius and Angola,
Moussa noted.
</P>
<P>
As for the Middle East peace process, the Egyptian Foreign
Minister said the new Israeli government, led by Ehud Barak, is
confronted with commitments that need new stances and policies to
implement what was agreed upon, rebuild trust and stop the Jewish
settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
"The true Israeli attitudes will be made clear soon and we hope
they will be constructive on the contrary to the attitudes of
former Israeli government led by Benjamin Netanyahu," Moussa
added.

<HEADLINE> Africa Suffers from Chronic Brain Drain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Africa has suffered a chronic brain
drain due to the continent's aggravation poverty and increasing
instability, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Materials released by the information center of the 35th OAU
summit here indicated that some 10,000 highly qualified Africans
are estimated to be working abroad, accounting for nearly one
third of the continent's skilled work force.
</P>
<P>
These people are mainly working in western Europe and north
America. Many of the professionals have left their home countries
due to political, economic and social conditions, low salaries and
bleak prospects.
</P>
<P>
According to the OAU materials, 21 of 54 African countries
including Algeria, Benin and Burkina Faso suffer most from the
exodus of the professionals. More than 35 percent of nationals
with university education in these countries are living on foreign
soil.
</P>
<P>
The International Organization for Migration, a Geneva-based
inter-governmental body, has been trying to assist in reversing
this brain drain trend since 1983, but with little success.
</P>
<P>
So far, only more than 1,800 highly educated Africans have
returned to their home countries.
</P>
<P>
The migration organization appealed to African leaders and
regional organizations to make more efforts to attract these
qualified nationals to come back.
</P>
<P>
It warned that unless measures are taken to address the
problem, the shortage of highly qualified Africans will continue
unabated, saying that Africa, the most underdeveloped continent in
the world, needs its skilled human resources more than ever at the
threshold of a new millennium.

to persuade the Mujahideen to withdraw.
</P>

Ekoglasnost is against the presence of any troops in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Interview: CP Sees Bright Future as Thai Economy Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Driving in and out of the parking
lot in Fortune Town, a business complex in central Bangkok, became
extremely difficult on Friday as the newest branch of Lotus
Supercenter, a Chareon Pokphand (CP) Group retail shop, opened
here.
</P>
<P>
Avid buyers flocked to the supermarket, the 15th in Thailand,
and brought out all kinds of goods, from television sets to
fragrant rice, which are much cheaper than other days.
</P>
<P>
Pleased to see the huge crowd of shoppers, CP Group Chairman
Dhanin Chearavanont said he believed that the Thai economy has
begun picking up.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua after the opening ceremony, Dhanin
said the Thai economy is regaining its strength at a slow pace
though it is very hard for it to restore to the pre-crisis level
shortly.
</P>
<P>
"The economy had been in deep water for two years, but now it
has finally emerged to the sea level," Dhanin, president of
Thailand's largest agro-industry conglomerate, said.
</P>
<P>
As for the future development of CP Group, he said he would put
more weight on agriculture, food industry, telecommunication and
retail businesses.
</P>
<P>
With rich experience in the agro-industrial sector, CP has the
potential to become the world's largest company in that area,
Dhanin said.
</P>
<P>
Convinced that information technology will dominate the next
century, Dhanin vowed to stick to his TelecomAsia company despite
its 1 billion U.S. dollar debt burden and the fact that 1 million
of its telephone lines failed to find subscribers.
</P>
<P>
TelecomAsia, originally a telephone company, has already
started to provide cable TV service, Internet service, e-commerce,
electronic education and other hi-tech services.
</P>
<P>
As for the retail business, Dhanin said that even during the
worst period of the economic crisis, CP had seen the opening of at
least one new 7-eleven convenient store in every 40 hours.
</P>
<P>
Now, more than 1,200 such stores are scattered all across
Thailand. CP has a plan to increase the number to 3,000, with the
opening of two to three stores every day, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dhanin denied reports that CP has reduced its involvement in
China, one of its most important overseas markets, saying 104 out
of its 170 enterprises in China are making money. All the 104
companies are in the agriculture category.
</P>
<P>
Like most Thai companies, CP was hard hit by the country's
worst economic crisis in a decade and part of the reason was that
it borrowed aggressively during the boom years. Selling all or
part of its shares in some non-core businesses both in Thailand
and China is one of the steps CP has taken to prop itself up in
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Reducing shares sometimes helps the development of the
enterprise and benefit the shareholders, Dhanin said.

<HEADLINE> Kipketer to Represent Denmark at Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee(IOC) has given green light to Kenya-born Wilson Kipketer
to represent Denmark in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, the Danish
Olympic Committee said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 800-meter world champion has lived in Denmark since 1990
and was naturalized last year, but his attempt to run for his new
country has yet to be approved by Kenya and the IOC.
</P>
<P>
According to the Olympic charter, an athlete must seek
permission from his native country to compete for his new one if
he changes his citizenship less than three years before the games
and has competed for another country in a previous Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Kipketer wanted to run for Denmark in the Atlanta Olympics in
1996 but his attempt was blocked by Kenya.
</P>
<P>
In March, the Kenyan Olympic Committee informed its Danish
counterpart that Kenya didn't oppose Kipketer appearing for
Denmark at the Sydney Olympics. Kipketer finally realized his wish
after IOC gave its nod Friday, the DOC said.

<HEADLINE> Bailey Says No to Panamerican 100 Metres Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Former world record holder Donovan
Bailey has refused to run for his country in the 100 meters at the
Panamerican Games in Winnipeg, Canada, later this month.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Olympic champion was overlooked for the blue
riband event by his country's athletics federation who preferred
instead Bruny Surin and Brad McQuaig.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago Bailey, who will contest the 4x100m relay,
finished third in his home championships behind Surin and McQuaig.
</P>
<P>
But after this pair pulled out the Candian federation turned to
their third choice Bailey who felt slighted and turned down the
official approach.
</P>
<P>
He was off the track for nine months since rupturing his
Achilles tendon in September and only returned on June 11 at
Nuremburg with a 100m run of 10.51s. He then clocked 10.23 in
Calgary and a disappointing 10.40s last Saturday in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Another 100m absentee at the Panamerican games, staged between
July 23 and August 8, is American Maurice Greene, who shattered
Bailey's 100m record time of 9.84sec with a new world mark of 9.
79s in Athens three weeks ago.

<HEADLINE> Mozambicans Living Abroad Can't Vote: Electoral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican National Electoral
Commission said here Friday that the Mozambican citizens living
abroad can't vote in the coming general elections due to the
"expensive cost".
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the commission, Maria Macuacua, announced this at
a press conference, the Mozambican News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was quoted as saying that it is too expensive to
organize and monitor the registration of the voters living abroad
and their casting.
</P>
<P>
The Secretariat of the Technical Administration of Elections
said in a recent report that Mozambique should not repeat the
"painful" experience of 1997 when the country spent a lot of money
in ineffectively conducting census of the Mozambican citizens
living abroad.
</P>
<P>
Only some 1,000 Mozambicans were registered then in South
Africa, Portugal and Swaziland which were supposed to have the
largest population of Mozambican compatriots.
</P>
<P>
It is not known how many Mozambican citizens are living abroad
now.
</P>
<P>
As for the date of the voting, the spokesman said that it is
not decided yet, but a working commission has been established to
decide the date.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the elections will be held this year.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the electoral commissions at provincial and county
levels have started to operate.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Get Grant From Japan for Power Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Overseas Economic Cooperation
Fund of Japan has agreed to provide 25 million U.S. dollars as an
unconditional grant for the rehabilitation of seven power stations
in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The amount would be in addition to an earlier commitment of 8
million dollars to rehabilitate a unit of the Fenchuganj Power
Station in the northeastern district of Sylhet, the national news
agency BSS Friday quoted official sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
At least 150 megawatts of power would be recovered after
overhauling the seven power stations with a generation capacity of
688 megawatts, said Quamrul Islam Siddique, chairman of the Power
Development Board.
</P>
<P>
At present these seven power stations are generating 460
megawatts of power which is 228 megawatts less than its generation
capacity, Siddique said, adding that there will be a net gain of
at least 300 megawatts of power after the overhauling is
completed.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the German agency, KFW, has already committed to
providing 72 million dollars for overhauling of the three units of
another 450-mw power station.
</P>
<P>
The government has been seeking 140 million dollars from donors
for the rehabilitation of some of the existing old and junk power
stations and has so far been able to get commitments totaling 105
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
It has asked the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to
provide the remaining 35 million dollars, but the latter put
forward some conditions, including incorporation of power stations
and hand-over of the transmission lines to the Power Grid Company,
before committing the fund.
</P>
<P>
Extensive discussions are going on with the donors to get the
remaining portion of the fund, according to a senior official.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bangladesh has also initiated discussion with Canada
and Italy for getting 15 million dollars for overhauling several
other power stations.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Loans $180M for Ghana's Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Friday agreed to
provide Ghana with a fresh loan of 180 million U.S. dollars for
the west African country to deepen its economic reforms, a report
from Accra said.
</P>
<P>
The loan, under Ghana's Economic Reform Support Operation II,
is mainly to support the privatization of the external marketing
of cocoa and the energy and financial sectors.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be paid in 30 years with a 10-year grace period.
</P>
<P>
Ghanaian Finance Minister Kwame Peprah and World Bank country
director in Ghana Peter Harold signed on the agreement.
</P>
<P>
"This particular credit is not only the largest of its kind we
have received, but it is also an indication that our development
partners are confident with the path we have chosen," said the
finance minister.
</P>
<P>
Peprah said the timing of the loan is significant for Ghana
because it confirms the confidence of the international community
in the country's efforts to unleash the potential of the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
According to him, opening up the external marketing of cocoa,
beginning in the year 2000, is part of Ghana's own long-term cocoa
development strategy.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the assertion that privatizing the external
marketing of cocoa was a condition of the World Bank loan.
</P>
<P>
"In our reforms, we determine what to do," Peprah noted.
</P>
<P>
Harold said the loan reflects the strength of Ghana's reforms
which have yielded positive results such as a single digit
inflation.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ghana Statistical Service, inflation was 9.4
percent in May this year, down from 20.8 percent at the beginning
of 1998 and 70.8 percent at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank official noted that Ghana has laid a strong
foundation for the development of the private sector, especially
in the financial and energy sub-sectors.
</P>
<P>
If the measures taken were to be continued, he added, the
reforms, which started in 1986 will yield more positive results.

LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets ended the
week in positive territory Friday after a solid opening on Wall

<HEADLINE> British Economists Defend UK's Gold Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Britain's plan to sell more than
half its gold reserves is no policy aberration but the product of
sound finance, and withering criticism may only make things worse
for gold prices, according to British economists and market
analysts.
</P>
<P>
Changing central bank policies worldwide reflect pressures to
generate returns from national reserves, favouring
foreign-currency holdings over low-yielding gold, they said.
</P>
<P>
"I would say this is a natural progression in central bank
policy," Roger Alford, senior research associate in the financial
markets group at the London School of Economics, was quoted as
saying by a Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
"This represents the growing influence of economists in the
Bank of England and indeed at the International Monetary Fund and
elsewhere. They tend to look at the rates of return on assets and
to ask whether asset allocation is right or not," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gold's fall to fresh 20-year lows this week, after Britain held
its first 25-ton auction, showed its fallibility as a reserve
asset. The Bank of England plans to sell 415 tons over the next
couple of years and put the money into dollars, euros and yen,
according to earlier reports.
</P>
<P>
"If you really are in trouble and you need to sell gold is the
market going to absorb it at the current price? I think not," said
Alford, who described the amount sold by Britain as "trivial" in
the context of international money flows.
</P>
<P>
"If you are a central bank with reserves in dollars, euros and
yen at least you have a variety of markets rather than just a
single gold market in which to trade," he said.
</P>
<P>
Forrest Capie, professor of economic history at London's City
University Business School, said taxpayers had been short-changed
by central banks with high gold weightings in reserves.
</P>
<P>
"You only have to look at the price trend over the last 20
years to see that taxpayers can legitimately ask: 'Is this the
best you can do?' It's very difficult to defend holding gold on
the scale at which it has been held," he was quoted saying.
</P>
<P>
Evidence that central bankers are taking greater interest in
the worth of their gold includes their tendency in recent years to
account for it at or near market prices, rather than leave it at
an artificially low book value, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
"There's definitely been a tendency to move in the direction of
market-related prices," said Philip Klapwijk, managing director of
industry consultants Gold Fields Mineral Services.
</P>
<P>
He said Britain's gold sale and the more than 10 percent fall
in prices since its plan became public in May had made gold policy
a pressing issue among the 11 countries in Europe's single
currency bloc, which together hold 12,574 tons of gold.
</P>
<P>
"The UK was not considered a natural seller. People did not
expect them to step up to the plate and start selling 415 tons
of gold reserves. I do think it's concentrated the minds of a lot
of other central banks," he said. "There was this idea that gold
would be put onto the back burner in Europe but I think that's
unrealistic now."
</P>
<P>
Anti-sales protests by gold miners and producer countries such
as South Africa, which faces devastating job losses and economic
hardship if low prices force shaft closures, could perversely do
more harm than good, according to British analysts.
</P>
<P>
Reuters quoted an unnamed analyst as pointing to the danger of
preventing the International Monetary Fund's planned sale of up to
311 tons from its holdings of 3,217 tons intended to help fund
debt relief for poor countries.
</P>
<P>
"If the IMF sale does not go ahead with the sales it will
probably be the worst day in gold's history," the analyst said.
"If they can't use it they will give it back to members, and what
will all those countries do with it?"
</P>
<P>
Fund members included countries which had sold substantial
amounts of reserve gold in the past, and which would probably do
so again, Reuters said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Gets $4M Loans from Regional Bank in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Eastern and Southern
African Trade and Development Bank approved in 1998 more than four
million U.S. dollars in support of Tanzania's development
projects.
</P>
<P>
The money is equivalent to 13 percent of the 32.48 million
dollars approved by the bank to support 17 development projects in
its seven member countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank's annual report for 1998 available here
Friday, the total loan approvals represented an increase of 93
percent over the previous year's 15.842 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other member countries which got the bank's project facilities
in 1998 are Kenya, Uganda, Sudan, Rwanda, Zambia and Malawi.
</P>
<P>
The supported projects cover the manufacturing sector,
agriculture, tourism, infrastructure and others.
</P>
<P>
The report said the projects financed by the bank have promoted
trade in sub-regional markets.
</P>
<P>
"The bank placed more emphasis on private sector, lending
especially to projects with the capacity of generating foreign
exchange and creating employment," it said.
</P>
<P>
In Tanzania, for instance, the bank approved a loan worth
650,000 dollars to Aqua Slides Limited to finance the
establishment of a modern water sports complex in Dar es Salaam
and another 1.6 million dollars to finance the rehabilitation of
the Musoma Dairy Limited.
</P>
<P>
The bank also extended one million dollars each to Msasani
Slipway Limited to finance the establishment of an accommodation,
leisure and entertainment seaside complex in Msasani peninsular,
and Simba Steels Limited to finance the acquisition of an
industrial plot.

<HEADLINE> Unionists Call N.Irish Peace Plan "Unfair" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's Ulster Unionist
Party (UUP) on Friday criticised the latest plan put forth by the
British and Irish governments to revive the province's staled
peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a statement after a two--and-a-half hour session that was to
be called to discuss the formula, the 110-member executive said it
backed their leader David Trimble's description of the blueprint
as "fundamentally unfair and unbalanced", a Reuters report filed
from Belfast said.
</P>
<P>
Trimble, who read the statement to reporters, signaled that he
would continue to try to win government assurances about the deal
before next Thursday's deadline set by Britain and Ireland for
unionist and republican parties to accept the proposals.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to keep working through the weekend to try to
achieve the objectives that we have sought," Trimble, who is the
province's First Minister, was quoted as saying outside the UUP
headquarters in central Belfast.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart
Bertie Ahern produced the formula last Friday after months of
talks with the feuding parties failed to break the deadlock over
guerrilla disarmament and the launch of a power-sharing provincial
administration.
</P>
<P>
The governments proposed that ministers should be appointed to
the "shared" cabinet on July 15 and that the Irish Republican
Army, which called a ceasefire in a long war against British rule,
should begin disarming within weeks and complete it by May 2000.
</P>
<P>
However, the Unionists have steadfastly refused to sit in a
cabinet with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political arm, until arms are
scrapped.
</P>
<P>
The executive's statement called on all the province's armed
groups, both Irish republican and pro-British loyalists, "to
declare that violence is over and to commence actual
decommissioning (disarmament) immediately, leading to its
completion by May 22, 2000."

<P>
XINING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Twenty four Hong Kong deputies to
the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) began an inspection
tour of northwest China's Qinghai Province today.
</P>
<P>
"The prospect for economic and technological cooperation
between the two places is very catholic as their economies and
trades are increasingly complementary," said Su Sen, deputy
governor of Qinghai.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong people are welcome to tour the province, develop
resources, set up enterprises and negotiate trade," he added.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that Hong Kong NPC deputies have made
inspection visits to Qinghai. They will stay there for ten days.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai, located on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, is an
economically less-advantaged but resource rich province, with a
small population yet vast territory.
</P>
<P>
The deputies will go to local rural areas, mines and schools to
learn about the economic and social conditions of the province, a
local source said.

TEHRAN -- Over 10,000 Iranian students gathered in front of
Tehran University Saturday morning to protest the bloody crackdown
on university students by the country's conservative security
forces.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators called for immediate inquiry into the violent
crackdown on students on Thursday and Friday and urged the Iranian
leader and Commander-in-Chief of the Iranian armed forces
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to answer the students.
</P>
<P>
No anti-riot police were seen around the venue of the rally.
But a few traffic police closed the streets leading to Tehran
University.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want violence, we want rule of law," a student told
Xinhua at the rally, "we condemn the use of force against students.
"
</P>
<P>
The students reiterated their support for the reform programs
launched by President Mohammad Khatami and urged relevant
officials to make efforts to safeguard the honor of the university
and its students.
</P>
<P>
Many students upheld newspapers at the rally to show pictures
of the bloody clashes between students and the police, during
which, as protesters claimed seven students were killed, about 300
injured and 500 arrested.
</P>
<P>
Several hundreds of students staged a rally Thursday night at
the Tehran University dormitory, protesting the newly-approved
press law and the ban of the popular moderate daily Salam (Hello).
</P>
<P>
Violence occurred after anti-riot police forced into the
dormitory without prior permission from the Interior Ministry. It
was the most violent clash in the country since the Islamic
revolution in 1979. (Iran-Students-Protest)

<HEADLINE> Costa Holds off El Aynaoui at Swiss Open </HEADLINE>

<P>
GENEVA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Albert Costa stamped his
superiority at high altitudes as the Spaniard held off the charge
of Moroccan Younes El Aynaoui at the 550,000 U.S. dollars Swiss
Open here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The eighth seed rallied to a 4-6, 7-6 (7/5), 6-3 victory over
El Aynaoui who claimed third seed Marcelo Rios as a second-round
upset victim.
</P>
<P>
Costa, the 1996 champion at high altitude Gstaad, will face
either fifth-seeded compatriot Felix Mantilla or Ecuador's Nicolas
Lapentti in the best-of-five set Sunday finale at this 1,050-metre-
high venue.
</P>
<P>
Powering on his blistering serves to take the opening set, the
33rd-ranked El Aynaoui put himself in a position to upset the
Spaniard by pushing Costa to a tiebreak.
</P>
<P>
But Costa, who has won all of his nine career titles on clay,
made advantage of his experiences on clay-court to win the
tiebreaker against the Moroccan, who began to display signs of
fatigue and passivity.
</P>
<P>
Costa then broke El Aynaoui to go up 5-3 in the final set,
holding to take the victory for the second time in five
appearances.

<HEADLINE> Truce Declared After Fortnight Strike by Quebec Nurses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A 48-hour truce has been declared
and accepted by both striking nurses and the government of Quebec
Province of Canada.
</P>
<P>
The 47,000 nurses decided to suspend the strike after a
strategy meeting Friday on future steps to take. The provincial
government announced the acceptance of the truce hours later,
according to Saturday's local media reports.
</P>
<P>
While announcing their readiness to go back to the negotiating
table, the nurses stressed their determination to go on with the
strike after two days of truce next week, "until the government
realizes that it has to negotiate."
</P>
<P>
Chief government negotiator Marrice Charlesbois responded later
in the day that provincial premier Lucien Bouchard had accepted
the deal.
</P>
<P>
"If the illegal strike is stopped," Chalesbois said, "the
negotiations will start again."
</P>
<P>
The government passed legislation on July 2 ordering the nurses
back to work, only to be ignored by the federation of the nurses.
</P>
<P>
The strikers are demanding an immediate catch-up pay increase
of 10 percent plus another six percent over two years. The
government's offer is five percent over three years.
</P>
<P>
The reports put the salary of Quebec nurses at the lowest in
Canada among their unionized counterparts, with their minimum at
30,340 Canadian dollars (about 20,631 U.S. dollars) and the
maximum at 44,072 (about 29,968 dollars).

SILVERSTONE, ENGLAND, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Finnish driver Mika
Hakkinen claimed pole position for Sunday's British Grand Prix at
Silverstone.
</P>
<P>
The McLaren driver posted a time of 1:24.804, with Ferrari's
Micheal Schumacher second and David Coulthart third in the
qualifying session Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Damon Hill, who has suggested he may retire after the
race, produced his best qualifying display of the season to finish
sixth.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen, who leads Schumacher by eight points in the drivers
championship, took his 16th career pole by almost half-a-second.
</P>
<P>
Ferrari's Eddie Irvine made it a good day for the British
hopefuls with the fourth fastest time, but there was little joy
for Johnny Herbert who finished in 11th place.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen, who finished second after starting from 14th in
France,said everything had gone to plan.
</P>
<P>
"The car was working extremely well," he said. "The race could
well be very exciting even though overtaking is so difficult here.
"
</P>
<P>
Schumacher, who strayed too wide on his last run, said: "I
tried to do more than what the car was capable of.
</P>
<P>
"But I had the first run to fall back on. There was no point
trying to do another safe run after that, you need to try and
improve the time," he added.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Will Have no Place in Formula One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SILVERSTONE, ENGLAND, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Tobacco sponsorship
in Formula One will ultimately have no place in the sport, Motor
sports governing body FIA president Max Mosley said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The International Automobile Federation chief said in a press
conference at the British Grand Prix that Formula One will have to
give up tabacco in the medium to longer term.
</P>
<P>
"I think Formula One will have to give up tobacco in the medium
to longer term because if it doesn't it will find itself in a more
and more disadvantaged position vis-a-vis sports sponsorship
generally,"he said.
</P>
<P>
"It will find itself up a blind alley, being left behind by the
mainstream sponsorship."
</P>
<P>
He said that he believed most teams would voluntarily sever
tobacco sponsorship if it could be proved that it encouraged young
people to smoke.
</P>
<P>
The FIA had written to health ministers in the countries
hosting grands prix asking them to provide any evidence but Mosley
said the response had been poor.
</P>
<P>
"The World Health Organisation didn't even bother to answer,"
he said. "It does indicate something rather less than a vague
interest on the part of the health ministers in whether there is
tobacco sponsorship in Formula One or not."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Players Kin Wish Success for World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The heartstrings of the Chinese
players kin have been pulled by what is going on in Los Angeles,
where a Women's World Cup final will be played on Saturday between
China and the host United States.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of head coach Ma Yuan'an, the Chinese squad
has stormed into the final on a best scoring record 18-2, setting
up a re-match of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics final.
</P>
<P>
Ma's wife Fang Zhongtian held a rosy picture for the would-be
thriller while revealed her worry about the close showdown.
</P>
<P>
"I have full confidence in them. They are high-spirited and
have played better and better," Fang said. "I feel encouraged and
I think they deserve to lift the Word Cup."
</P>
<P>
Fang did not conceal her worry, saying that she is uncertain if
the referees can judge without any bias towards the host.
</P>
<P>
"I wish what happened on the 1996 Atlanta final will not be
replayed this time," she said.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States fought to a 1-1 tie in the first
half of the 1996 Olympics final before the host grabbed the title
22 minutes into the next half with a goal which controversially
failed to be judged offside.
</P>
<P>
While Ma's daughter Ma Fang thought more of the process rather
than the result of the match.
</P>
<P>
"Whether win or loss, I will feel greatly proud of Chinese women
's soccer and feel honored with such a capable father," she said.
</P>
<P>
The women's competition has also caught the eyes of Chinese men,
especially the husbands of the female players.
</P>
<P>
Forward Jin Yan's husband Ping Wei made no secrect of his
confidence, thinking that China will have no great problem in
beating the United States.
</P>
<P>
"If the Chinese squad can do as well as in the 5-0 thrashing
over defending champions Norway, they will meet no great trouble
in winning the final."
</P>
<P>
"But I also have some worries. I fear they will feel nervous
when stepping onto the turf. and I think their defense teamwork
remains to be desired."
</P>
<P>
Liu Jun, the husband of veteran Liu Ailing who scored twice in
the semi-finals and was selected into the All-Star line-up, was
more optimistic and listed three seasons for China to carry off
the palms.
</P>
<P>
"During the last training session prior to their American trip,
I found that although the training was very demanding but they
appeared quite relaxed, which is the ideal form before a major
event."
</P>
<P>
"They have achieved what they desired before the championship.
They had kept a low profile with an aim of reaching the last four,
so they have a very relaxed mental condition.
</P>
<P>
"Judging from the viewpoint of stategy, the United States are
not as fast as the Chinese in attack and defense. So I think if
China keeps its momentum, it's in a position to score an
overwhelming victory."

<HEADLINE> U.N. Helps Lebanon Combat Hashish Cultivation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. will provide Lebanon with
4 million U.S. dollars in technical aid to help the country
combat the cultivation and trafficking of drugs, a U.N. official
announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Pino Arlacchi, U.N. under secretary-general for combating drug
trafficking, said in a news conference that the fund will be used
for Lebanese interior affair forces to crack down on the drug and
help farmers to grow alternative crops.
</P>
<P>
He said he has contacted with the donor countries which
expressed willingness to finance agricultural projects suitable
for investments for the once hashish-growing farmers.
</P>
<P>
The hash industry was a fabulous money-earner for Lebanon
during the 1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
Giving in to U.S. post-civil war pressure, Lebanon and Syria
sent joint troops to the country's eastern area of Bekaa,
destroying vast areas of hash plantations and bringing the
industry to an end in 1993.
</P>
<P>
But, as the U.S. failed to honor its promise to provide
alternative crops for Lebanese farmers, some of them have
reportedly returned to the hashish cultivation in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the U.N. announced that Lebanon was removed from
the blacklist of narcotics-producing countries but is still
considered as a transit for transporting drugs produced in both
Turkey and Columbia.
</P>
<P>
Arlacchi arrived here Saturday from Amman where he discussed
ways to combat drugs with Jordanian leaders and also announced a
3-million-dollar aid to the country for the same purpose.

GENEVA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Nicolas Lapentti threw the spanner
into the works as he outlasted former champion Felix Mantilla of
Spain in a marathon Saturday at Gstaad to prevent an all-Spanish
final at the Swiss Open.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Open semi-finalist took nearly two-and-a-half
hours to overcome 1997 Gstaad champion Mantilla 6-4, 4-6, 7-5,
setting up a final with another Spaniard clay-court specialist
Albert Costa.
</P>
<P>
Lapentti, ranked 26th, looked in trouble late in the third set
against Mantilla until a string of three straight service breaks
left the match on serve, 6-5 to the South American.
</P>
<P>
Mantilla failed to put together his game as he dumped a
backhand into the net to give Lapentti a match point.
</P>
<P>
Lapentti did not give any chance to Mantilla who netted a
backhand to be sent packing.
</P>
<P>
Earlier eighth-seeded Costa held off the challenge from
Moroccan challenger Younes El Aynaoui in a 4-6, 7-6 (7/5), 6-3
comeback in the day's other semi-final.
</P>
<P>
Costa levelled his career mark against world No 33 El Aynaoui
at 1-1 with the victory in one hour 50 minutes.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Agency to Offer Assistance to China Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Environment Program
(UNEP) has promised to offer further technical assistance to
China in combating the current flood which hit the middle and
lower reaches of the Yangtze River in central part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
UNEP Executive Director Klaus Toepfer made the remarks in a
letter sent Thursday from here to Xie Zhenhua, Director of the
State Environmental Protection Administration.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Toepfer said UNEP sent a mission to China in
January this year to assess the environmental damage caused by
the floods in 1998 and prepare proposals to address the flood
causes.
</P>
<P>
"While re-confirming our commitments in implementing the
projects we have both agreed upon," Toepfer said, "I would like
to offer further technical assistance to the government of the
People's Republic of China in combating the current floods."
</P>
<P>
Recently, heavy rains hit China, especially in the central and
south parts of the country, causing great damages to the
properties and claiming dozens of lives.
</P>
<P>
Toepfer said UNEP could offer rapid assessment of vulnerable
areas and potential impacts on them, particularly, possible large
environmental pollution by the floods, and in-depth field
observation and study of environmental causes of the floods, such
as increased run-off by degraded vegetation cover and
deforestation.
</P>
<P>
He promised that "in any form, I am determined and ready to
assist the government of China to mitigate threats and damages to
the environment and human life posed by this flood."
</P>
<P>
Toepfer also designated Xia Kunbao, special advisor to the
Deputy Executive Director of UNEP on Emergency Response, as a
liaison officer for UNEP's assistance to China against 1999
Yangtze floods.

<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) rejected an offer by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on
accepting an independent Palestinian state rather than
implementing the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
PNA's Local Government Minister Sayb Uriqat said the PNA wants
to hear from Barak, at his meeting with PNA chairman Yasser Arafat
scheduled on Sunday, clearer stances on adherence to implementing
the Wye agreement, the Palestinan daily Al Ayam daily reported on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said the PNA also wants Barak to halt all forms of
settlement activities so that the heading for final status talks
may be meaningful.
</P>
<P>
Israeli newspaper Maarif quoted Barak's aides as saying Barak
is ready to recognize the Palestinian statehood in return for the
PNA's agreemeent to postpone the implementation of some Wye
agreement's provisons into the final status negotiantions.
</P>
<P>
"Our stance is clear, it is necessary to implement the Wye
accord, the transitional provisons, halt all settlement
activities, " Uriqat said.
</P>
<P>
He added the PNA's stance is not against, but complementary
with Barak's statement recognizing the Palestinian right to
self-determination and statehood.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Israeli TV, Barak said the Palestinian
state is a reality, saying what Israel should do is to make it no
threat against her.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The world's oldest giant panda in
captivity is reported to be suffering from epilepsy in Wuhan Zoo
in central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Information from the zoo said that Dudu, who enjoyed "her" 37th
birthday in late April, has had at least one spasm of the disease
daily since this June, due to old age and abrupt temperature
changes in Wuhan, the provincial capital which is also dubbed as
the "hot oven".
</P>
<P>
The zoo has set up a round-the-clock special monitoring team to
keep watch on the state of the giant panda. They have started to
spoonfeed the giant panda with special food which has medicines
added and prepared a range of emergency medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
As the old giant panda cannot stand a closed air-conditioned
environment, zoo keepers place 100-kg ice daily in its habitat in
addition to turning on the air conditioner but leaving the windows
open.
</P>
<P>
Born in 1962, Dudu was first transferred to Chengdu Zoo and
then moved to Wuhan in 1972.
</P>
<P>
China now has less than 1,200 giant pandas. The average life
span of wild giant pandas is around 15 years while that of pandas
in captivity is around 25 years.

JOHANNESBURG, July 10 (Xinhua) -- All the warring parties in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) conflict have arrived in
the Zambian capital of Lusaka to sign a peace pact, South African
President Thabo Mbeki' s office said Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"All the parties are there. The signing ceremony will go

On whether a representative from the rebel group, the Congo

They are all there."
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire agreement was agreed upon at a regional
ministerial meeting in Lusaka.

<P>
In another development, the Democratic Party (DP), South
Africa's official opposition, Saturday said it would prefer it if
South Africa provided political support at this stage to the DRC

hailstorms and earthquakes have affected many parts of the country
this year. Since the beginning of the flooding season, floods have
brought huge losses to provinces along the Yangtze River, the
largest river in China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, people are worried about a possible deluge along the
Yellow River, the second largest in the country. The Yellow River
often changed its course in history, causing enormous casualties
and economic losses.
</P>
<P>
Li Keqiang, director-general of the Yellow River Anti-Flood
Headquarters and governor of Henan Province, recently made an
inspection tour in the areas vulnerable to flooding.
</P>
<P>
Henan, a long-time victim of Yellow River floods, has been busy
preparing for the possible arrival of severe floods. A flood-
blocking zone has been set up in Puyang City, home to 1.2 million
people and the hugely valuable Zhongyuan Oilfield, with its assets
worth an estimated nine billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Local governments and farmers have built up many flood-
sheltering platforms in the area in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Continue Anti-terrorism Operation: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
continue its ongoing combing operation in the country's
southeastern region to uproot terrorism, Home Minister Mohammad
Nasim said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a delegates' conference of the National Physicians
Association at the National Press Club, Nasim sought cooperation
of all, irrespective of party affiliation, in ridding the country
of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"There can be difference of opinion in a democratic society and
one can oppose our party ideology," but "none should oppose the
government's steps to stop terrorism and all should unite on this
vexing issue to uproot terrorism," he said.
</P>
<P>
The terrorists, whoever they may be, would be brought to book,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
The country's law-enforcing agencies have arrested some 60,000
"terrorists" and recovered more than 1,000 fire arms during a
country-wide combing operation against terrorism since late April
this year.
</P>
<P>
The government launched the combing drive on April 21 following
bomb explosions early this year in two separate places in the
southwestern region that killed several political leaders and
activists and injured many others.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Lift Ban on Travel to Yemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The British government is
considering lifting the ban on travel to Yemen imposed following
the abduction of four Britons in southern Yemen late last year,
well-informed diplomatic sources said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The sources expected the British-Yemeni ties to improve
following Yemen's trial of eight Yemeni Britons and others on
charges of abducting and killing foreigners and forming an
extremist group with the aim of harming Yemen's security.
</P>
<P>
They were convicted of collaborating with armed groups in
abducting 16 Western tourists and leading to the deaths of four of
them in a rescue operation by the Yemeni security forces on
December 29.
</P>
<P>
Three Britons and an Australian died in the incident.
</P>
<P>
The trial will clear the way for improving bilateral ties
between the two countries, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Britain has sent correspondents to cover the trial
and the final ruling is expected on July 26.

<HEADLINE> Revitalizing Economy, Pressing Task for Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- African leaders, who are gathering
in Algiers, Algeria, for the upcoming summit of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU) scheduled for July 12 to 14, are finding it
a pressing task to revitalize the economy of Africa which is
trying to be better prepared for the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
While the magtrend of the world is a rapid economic growth
characterized by economic integration and increasingly science and
technology-intensive development, Africa, despite all its efforts
for economic recovery, is facing the challenges to build up all
the basic needs for an economic take- off.
</P>
<P>
Peace and stability, a precondition for even the survival of
the people, are still absorbing much of the efforts of leaders,
the much-needed natural and social resources that should have gone
to social progress and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Some 14 out of the 53 members of OAU, the biggest organization
in Africa, are involved directly in armed conflicts, internal or
inter-state, while more are sucked into the conflicts indirectly.
</P>
<P>
Among the 48 most underdeveloped nations listed by the United
Nations, 33 are in Africa.
</P>
<P>
What's worse, despite the sustained efforts toward
socio-economic recovery and development, Africa, which depends
heavily on foreign capital for investment, is plagued by a
staggering burden of debt with a total of 370 billion U.S. dollars
and it is still growing at an annual rate of 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the continent, which is managing an
annual per capital income of 221 dollars, 203 dollars for each
African has to be used in debt servicing if no remarkable progress
is made in debt relief.
</P>
<P>
Africa, which used to account for 3.1 percent of the world
market in the 1960s, finds that its share has withered to merely
1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Besides, illiteracy and diseases including pandemics such as
HIV/AIDS and malaria afflict an increasing segment of the
population.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, unemployment, rising crime, drug abuse and
trafficking, terrorism and other social scourges are spreading at
an alarming rate and worsen the already poor economic situations
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
It is, however, encouraging to see that the continent has
provided itself with a blueprint for collective action toward
socio-economic recovery and development through the establishment
of the African Economic Community.
</P>
<P>
The continental economic community, which started in 1991 as an
integral part of OAU, is aimed to promote economic, social and
cultural development and the integration of African economies in
order to increase economic self- reliance and promote an
endogenous and self-sustained development, by utilizing the human
and material resources of Africa as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The huge project scheduled to accomplish in 34 years is a
millennium project that may be regarded as one of the key projects
for the continent's economic strategy at the crucial juncture of
history.
</P>
<P>
OAU is also expected to find a mechanism for the making,
keeping of peace on the continent. The continent has won its
independence in the 20th century and is striving for an economic
liberation and recovery, a pressing task ahead for the continent.
</P>
<P>
The Algiers OAU summit, which is to map out the development
blueprint for the new century, may go down into the history as a
milestone for African economic recovery.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Students Protest Police Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Over 10,000 Iranian students
gathered in front of Tehran University Saturday morning to
protest the bloody crackdown on university students by the
country's conservative security forces.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators called for immediate inquiry into the violent
crackdown on students on Thursday and Friday and urged the Iranian
leader and Commander-in-Chief of the Iranian armed forces
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to answer the students.
</P>
<P>
No anti-riot police were seen around the venue of the
rally. But a few traffic police closed the streets leading to
Tehran University.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want violence, we want rule of law," a student told
Xinhua at the rally, "we condemn the use of force against
students."
</P>
<P>
The students reiterated their support for the reform programs
launched by President Mohammad Khatami and urged relevant
officials to make efforts to safeguard the honor of the
university and its students.
</P>
<P>
Many students upheld newspapers at the rally to show pictures
of the bloody clashes between students and the police, during
which, as protesters claimed seven students were killed, about 300
injured and 500 arrested.
</P>
<P>
Several hundreds of students staged a rally Thursday night at
the Tehran University dormitory, protesting the newly-approved
press law and the ban of the popular moderate daily Salam (Hello).
</P>
<P>
Violence occurred after anti-riot police forced into the
dormitory without prior permission from the Interior Ministry. It
was the most violent clash in the country since the Islamic
revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the mediation efforts by a number of ministers,
including the Interior Minister Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari and
Minister of Higher Education Mostafa Moin, the unrest continued
until Friday night.
</P>
<P>
According to the Islamic Republic News Agency, the students
have demanded to meet President Khatami and inform him of
their demands.
</P>
<P>
Also in protest against the crackdown, Moin on Saturday
submitted his resignation to President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian conservative Majlis (parliament) on Wednesday
passed the general outlines of the new press law, which is
believed to impose more strict rules and limits on the press.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the moderate daily Salam was ordered to close
down by the Special Court of Clergymen for publishing a
"classified document" of the Intelligence Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Salam reported on Tuesday in its front page that former Deputy
Intelligence Minister Saeed Emami (also known as Islami), one of
the main agents behind the serial political killings in the
country, has proposed to amend the country's press law in order to
control the press.
</P>
<P>
Emami, who was arrested for masterminding killings of several
Iranian dissidents, committed suicide in prison on June 19 by
taking depilatory substance while taking a bath.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Iran Nation Party Darius Forouhar and his wife
were stabbed to death at home while at least three dissident
writers were mysteriously killed in Tehran later last year.

KUWAIT CITY, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia's Defense and
Aviation Minister Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz arrived here on
Saturday on the last leg of his four-nation Gulf tour aimed at
reaffirming Riyadh's consistent policy on regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Prince Sultan, also Saudi Second Deputy Prime Minister and
Inspector General, has already visited the United Arab Emirates
(UAE), Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Oman, also a member state of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC), is not included in the visit due to the absence of
Sultan Qaboos Bin Said, who is on a private visit abroad.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said on Saturday that Sultan, during his
two-day trip here, will meet with Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber
Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah on regional issues, as well as means of
bolstering bilateral ties between the two GCC states.
</P>
<P>
The reports also quoted informed Gulf sources as saying that
Sultan wants to assure the GCC states that Saudi Arabia, the Gulf
heavyweight, will stick to its policy on major regional issues.
</P>
<P>
They said the visit also aims at dismissing "groundless
rumors about a change in the Saudi policy after its rapprochement
with Iran."
</P>

The UAE recently voiced dismay over the warming up of ties
between some GCC states headed by Saudi Arabia and Iran, fearing
the rapprochement would undermine the GCC support to Abu Dhabi in

<HEADLINE> Estrada Describes Peso Depreciation As "Temporary Aberration" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said here Saturday that the peso's depreciation at the end of the
trading week is merely "a temporary aberration."
</P>
<P>
The situation is expected to normalize, with the local currency
strengthening further in the coming days, because of additional
infusion of more dollars into the country, he said in a weekly
radio program.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that the nation's foreign exchange reserve is now
at an all-time high of 14 billion U.S. dollars, which would make
it easier for the central bank to ease any pressure on the peso
instigated by currency speculators.
</P>
<P>
"When we assumed office last year, the dollar reserves of the
Central Bank were only 5 billion dollars, now its 14 billion
dollars. That's why they should not play this game because the
government now has the ammunition against them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Director General Felipe Medalla of the National Economic and
Development Authority also said in the radio program that the
slight depreciation of the peso may be attributed to speculators
"testing" the government's will.
</P>
<P>
He reminded currency speculators that the government expects
millions of dollars to enter the country in the coming days and
weeks.
</P>
<P>
These include the 100 million dollars from the Asian
development Bank, another 100 million dollars from Japan under the
fund initiative of Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, 250
million dollars from the International Monetary Fund and 1 billion
dollars from investments by Pilipinas Shell in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
But currency dealers blamed lower interest rates for the peso's
depreciation in the last few days.
</P>
<P>
The peso Friday slid to an intra-day low of 38.6 to the dollar,
from 38.43 in the previous day and closed at 38.51 against the
greenback, the lowest in the last three months.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank said Friday that it froze its overnight
borrowing rate at 9 percent and lending rate at 11 percent to
maintain the stability of the peso.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the Central Bank have cut its
overnight rates for 20 times and reduced the key rates by an
overall 437.5 basis points.

<HEADLINE> Seminar on China's Peaceful Reunification Opens in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A seminar on China's peaceful
reunification opened here Saturday, drawing some 200 scholars and
noted figures from across the world.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Taiwan-based Strait Peaceful Reunification
Association, the two-day seminar offers an arena for participants
to express their views on the resolution of the Taiwan question as
well as political, economic and cultural issues across the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
Liang Su-rung, president of the Strait Peaceful Reunification
Association, said China's peaceful reunification is an issue of
common concern for all Chinese the world over.
</P>
<P>
People on both sides of the Taiwan Strait have the common
desire to replace confrontation with cooperation, and break the
impasse in the cross-strait talks through consultation and
negotiation, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that both sides would sit down for
sincere talks and sign an agreement as soon as possible to end the
state of hostility, and in the precondition of "one China" make
concerted efforts in the political, economic and other fields for
the benefit of the people on both sides of the strait.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech, Wan Guoquan, president of China Council
for the Promotion of Peaceful Reunification, expressed his desire
for a peaceful reunification at an early date.
</P>
<P>
He said that the "one country, two systems" concept is the best
way to maintain the peace, security and development across the
Taiwan Strait under the "one China" principle, and therefore it
conforms to the interests of the people on both sides.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that at present the issue is not one of whether
the "one country, two systems" is applicable to Taiwan, but one of
whether leaders in Taiwan want a national reunification. He
criticized some Taiwan leaders for showing interest in the U.S.-
led TMD and the "new U.S.-Japan security guidelines" and going
after "Taiwan independence", "two Chinas" or "one China, one
Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
Tang Shubei, executive vice-president of the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), said that to work for
early talks on ending the state of hostility across the strait,
the ARATS and the Taiwan Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) can
hold talks on the procedures of the political negotiations such as
the time, venue, topics, the calling of the representatives, and
the forms of negotiation, so as to arrive at solutions acceptable
to both sides.
</P>
<P>
For the present, the two sides can have wide-ranging dialogues
on political and economic issues to seek common ground and
consensus while shelving differences to create conditions for
political negotiations and economic and business consultations.
</P>
<P>
The "one country, two systems" is the basic concept for China's
ultimate reunification, Tang said, noting that any issue can be
brought up for negotiation under the "one China" principle.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the early establishment of direct postal,
commercial and transport links across the Taiwan Strait, saying it
would be a positive move to increase mutual trust and bring about
closer ties between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Renewed War traps 150,000 in Southern Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The latest outbreak of fighting in
western upper Nile region of southern Sudan has cut off 150,000
people from urgent relief assistance, the U.N. World Food Program
(WFP) said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
War between two rebel factions in southern Sudan has prevented
WFP from delivering food aid for several months, the U.N. agency
said in a news release, adding that it fears a worsening
humanitarian crisis to these people, exacerbating an already
fragile situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
"This is the last straw for thousands of families already
struggling in the vicious cycle of war -- it's a desperate
situation and the turmoil just carries on." sad David Fletcher,
deputy country director in Kenya and deputy coordinator for
operations in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
WFP is extremely concerned for thousands who left their homes
last month for safety and moved further inside western upper Nile
as they are now even more difficult to reach, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The agency added that an additional 35,000 people in
government-held areas of western upper Nile are also in danger of
being cut off from assistance due to a recent upsurge in
insecurity.
</P>

<P>
NEW DELHI, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The number of heart patients in
India has increased rapidly to attain epidemic proportions, a
cardiological expert said Saturday in Jaipur, 258 km southwest of
New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Currently, at least 50 million people in India are suffering
from heart diseases and the number of heart patients is estimated
to reach 100 million by the year 2010, President of the
Cardiological Society of India Dr. Upendra Kaul told newsmen.

It is the rapid urbanization, high stress, saturated fat diet
and smoking which have made Indians very prone to heart diseases,
he said.

Many ailments of heart, brain, legs and toes, gall bladder,
kidney and esophagus can be treated by the latest minimally

<HEADLINE> Archaeologists Find Ancient Palace Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese
archaeologists have identified 20 odd sites as the ruins of
palaces of a mysterious ancient capital.
</P>
<P>
The sites, which can be dated back to as early as 3,000 years
ago, were found in an area of 2,600 square meters in Zhengzhou,
capital of central China's Henan province.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists believe that they were part of the "forbidden
city" of the capital of the Shang Dynasty (16th-11th B.C.), the
second dynasty in Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
The location of the dynasty's capital has long remained a
mystery. However, a number of scholars have guessed it was in the
present day Zhengzhou.
</P>
<P>
The newly discovered sites feature rectangle and round blocks
and a number of holes on the ground which the archaeologists
believe were used for fixing palace pillars.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists have also unearthed some jars and urns with
words inscribed on the surface which have provided clues to the
existence of the ancient capital.

HONG KONG, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong police Saturday handed
over 12 pieces of Tang Dynasty steles to China's mainland
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The historical relics were among the assets worth 50 million HK
dollars (6.1 million U.S. dollars) seized by the Hong Kong Police
Narcotics Bureau (NB) against an international drug manufacturing
and trafficking syndicate in 1992.
</P>
<P>
In December 1998, the Court of First Instance of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region issued a confiscation order on the
assets.
</P>
<P>
The steles, worth about 1.1 million HK dollars (141,025 U.S.
dollars), were bought and smuggled into Hong Kong by the syndicate,
representing part of their proceeds from drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Acting Chief Superintendent of the NB Ng Kam-wing, representing
the Hong Kong police, handed over the relics to officers from the
Guangdong Public Security Bureau.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholars in Social Sciences Meet in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 70 specialists in social
sciences from China's mainland, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao began
a two-day symposium here Saturday afternoon to explore chances of
better cooperation between these areas.
</P>
<P>
Under the auspices of the Macao Society of Social Sciences, the
symposium was aimed at strengthening the exchanges of the four
areas as Macao will return to the motherland on December 20 this
year, said Wong Hon Keong, chairman of the society.
</P>
<P>
"To start a new era and build a new Macao will be the common
aspiration of people throughout the country as well as the leading
historic mission for the 400,000-odd residents of Macao," Wong
said at the opening ceremony of the symposium.
</P>
<P>
He noted that as Macao has a small population and is short of
natural resources, it must rely on the mainland, Hong Kong and
Taiwan on the basis of displaying its own advantages.
</P>
<P>
"After Macao's return, the practice of 'one country, two
systems', 'Macao people governing Macao' and a high degree of
autonomy will surely provide bigger driving power for its
cooperation with other areas of China," Wong Hon Keong said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pakistan Ponders Ways to Defuse Tension With India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The two-month-long intense
situation in the disputed Kashmir area between Pakistan and its
rival neighbor India is expected to take a turn for the better as
Pakistan has intensified its diplomatic endeavors.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's short visit to Washington this
week, though taken as a surprise by many people who are following
closely the Kashmir crisis, represented the culmination of intense
diplomatic activity in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
As the most important message came from the three-hour-long
meeting between Sharif and U.S. President Bill Clinton, Pakistan
will take "concrete steps" for the restoration of the Line of
Control (LoC) which divides the Himalayan region between Pakistan
and India.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's interpretation for the clause of "concrete step" in
the Pak-U.S. Joint Statement, which, as expected, has left many in
this country bewildered, is that Pakistan will use its influence
and persuade what it calls the "Kashmiri freedom fighters" to
withdraw from the heights they have occupied in the Kargil sector
along the LoC.
</P>
<P>
The reason Pakistan has agreed to do so is that it believed the
freedom fighters have achieved their objective to draw the world's
attention to the Kashmir issue, and the joint statement has
included the main elements of Pakistan's position on the latest
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Soon after returning from his controversial visit to
Washington, Sharif held extensive talks with the country's
military brass and his key cabinet ministers on the "concrete
steps" he pledged in the joint statement.
</P>
<P>
And on Friday, the Defense Committee of the Cabinet (DCC),
Pakistan's highest decision-taking forum on defense and security
matters, decided to "appeal to the Mujahideen (freedom fighters)
to help resolve the current Kargil situation".
</P>
<P>
It is being interpreted as the first "concrete step" for
defusing the unprecedented tension with India since their last war
in 1971.
</P>
<P>
The second "concrete step" was taken immediately after the DCC
meeting Friday when Prime Minister Sharif in a meeting with
Mujahideen leaders formally appealed to them to pull out from the
Kargil sector.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, Sharif, during his meeting with a
delegation of Mujahideen leaders Friday, asked them to "help the
government in respecting the Line of Control" amid assurances that
"we will continue to provide you diplomatic, political and moral
support."
</P>
<P>
Informed sources earlier quoted the Mujahideen as "resenting"
the decision of the Sharif government and saying, "the strategy,
we were being asked to adhere to, will lead to a serious setback
to the freedom struggle in Kashmir."
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman for the United Jihad (holy war) Council,
an umbrella organization representing 15 Mujahideen groups, said
later the Kashmiri Mujahideen were considering proposals for
pulling their men out of the Kargil sector.
</P>
<P>
The Mujahideen had earlier rejected the appeal for withdrawal,
"but their attitude changed after the meeting of the Defense
Committee of the Cabinet," said the spokesman who declined to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
The latest crisis began in April when several hundred
"Mujahideen volunteers" entered Kargil in India-held Kashmir and
captured more than half a dozen key military posts close to a
strategic route the Indians use for sending supplies to their
forward positions in disputed Siachen and Ladakh area.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Kashmir region remains tense as Pakistan and
India have been trading allegations and fierce artillery fire
along the LoC during the past two months, finally leading to
serious military confrontation between the two estranged neighbors
who had fought two wars over Kashmir since their inception in
1947.
</P>
<P>
As the Pak-U.S. Joint Statement says that the current fighting
in the Kargil region of Kashmir is "dangerous" and contains the
seeds of "a wider conflict", it is vital for peace and security in
the South Asian region that the LoC in Kashmir be respected by
both Pakistan and India in accordance with the 1972 Simla
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here believe that defusing of tension along
the LoC is an imperative of averting a wider armed conflict or
even a full-fledged war between the two rival neighbors.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Pakistan's diplomatic initiatives, though it
seems hard to be implemented if not possible, are certainly
welcomed in the present circumstances, they observed.
</P>
<P>
As expected, the latest move by the Sharif government has
triggered off strong reaction from various sectors of the society.
</P>
<P>
Major opposition parties term the "Sharif-Clinton deal" as a
"setback" as it will not only demoralize the armed forces but will
also dishearten the whole nation which has been extending all-out
support to freedom fighters in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that it will be a tough task for the Sharif
government to take the nation into confidence as noises of
disapproval and resentment are already beginning to rise.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, it is yet to be seen whether Pakistan will
be successful in bringing India to the negotiation table to
continue the dialogue process under the Lahore Declaration signed
by the two countries in February this year.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that immediate and direct talks between Pakistan
and India are all the more necessary now to resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The international community is expecting positive response from
the Indian side as withholding the dialogue process is against the
best interests of the sub-continent.

<HEADLINE> FISU Confirms Record Entry of Palma Universiade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PALMA, Spain, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A record 5,952 entry of
athletes and officials was confirmed by the International
University Sports Federation (FISU) for the Palma World University
Games here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The previous record of 5,740 participants was set at the
Fukuoka Universiade in 1995 in Japan with 3,949 athletes and 1,791
officials, while the 20th edition in Palma counts 4,030 athletes
and 1,922 officials.
</P>
<P>
"When I see these figures, I cann't help comparing them with
our first Summer Universiade in my hometown of Turin, Italy in
1949, exactly 50 years ago," said FISU president Primo Nebiolo,
also president of the International Amateur Athletics Federation.
</P>
<P>
"I was the president of the local organising committee and I
can remember how happy we were with our 982 athletes and 422
officials from 45 countries," said Nebiolo.
</P>
<P>
"Now for the first time, we have more than 4,000 athletes, we
have also 124 countries (and regions), and all these figures
underline how important the FISU movement has become.
</P>
<P>
"When I look back, I clearly see the long way we have travelled.
In 1959, the University Sport Movement was divided and weak. Now,
we can only see unity and strength," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The future looks, to me, as sunny as the weather here," he
said, "In 2001, FISU will go to Beijing for the 21st Summer
Universiade and for the first time, all the big countries of the
world will be together in China, providing the FISU ability to
reunite everybody under the banner of sports and friendship," the
FISU president said.
</P>
<P>
"And this is our fundamental justification, being able to bring
together young athletes of the world who will become leaders in
their own countries.
</P>
<P>
"And for the 2003 Summer Universiade, we have four very strong
candidates: Amsterdam (of the Netherlands), Monterrey (of Mexico),
Moscow (of Russia) and Taegu (of South Korea).
</P>
<P>
"It is a very important date in our history, and I am very
happy to see the evolution of our federation. Like I said earlier,
our dream from 50 years ago has become reality," the FISU
president said.

<HEADLINE> China Keen to Share Education Software Technology With Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kuala Lumpur, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The development of multimedia
education software can potentially be among the first areas of
cooperation in the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC), between
Malaysia and Peking University, an official of the university said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Professor Wang Xuan suggested that the university and the
Malaysia Multimedia University (MMU) should embark on a
technology-sharing project to localize the former's technology in
software development.
</P>
<P>
"This collaboration can be a platform later for local companies
and teachers with primary and secondary schools to develop
multimedia education software or education titles in Malay as well
as in the English language, based on our (Pekinq University's) own
multilingual development tool," he said.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Wang, an MSC International Advisory Panel (IAP) member,
said this to reporters after a meeting with Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad on the last day of the three-day third MSC IAP
meeting in Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
This education software had only been proven commercially
viable after a seven-year period of research and development work,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Now, it has been well received in major markets like the United
States, Canada, Japan and Singapore, as well as in China, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"If we (Peking University and MMU) want to develop it
(software) together, it can be developed through our own company
established here called PUC Founder (MSC) Sdn Bhd," he said.
</P>
<P>
PUC Founder is an MSC company which acquired the status in
1997. It is a subsidiary of Founder (Hong Kong) Ltd., an
international leading software content developer, which in turn is
a subsidiary of Peking University.
</P>
<P>
PUC Founder, involved in the distribution of software products
in Malaysia, is temporarily based in the Technology Park near
here.
</P>
<P>
PUC Founder managing director Teh Hon Seng said there are
already plans to set up its own research center, most likely in
the Technology Park, by the end of this year to facilitate
business expansion into production and research and development
here.
</P>
<P>
"We are at the advanced stage of completing the study plans.
And if it is okay and if economically viable, we should start
identifying a piece of land (in Technology Park) to start the
construction (of the research center building] by September," he
said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the proposed investment for the center, he
said that while it was premature to decide the amount at this
point of time, it has spent between two and three million rupiah
for day-to-day operations.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Wang said that he would after his return home brief
Chinese leaders on the experiences gained here during the IAP
meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said there were a still a lot of things that China could
learn from Malaysia in the development of information technology.
</P>
<P>
"As both Malaysia and China are developing countries, China is
keen to learn how Malaysia is developing its own IT techniques as
well as the ways it protects its intellectual property," he said.

Mika Hakkinen set the fastest time in his Mclaren-Mercedez in
practice for the British Grand Prix Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen, who led the practice on Friday, has set his eyes high
to not only take the leading grid position Saturday afternoon, but
also winning in the Silverston circuit, round eight of the World
Championships.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen's sister car, driven by David Coulthard, took the
second place Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
Michael Schumacher, in the Ferrari F399, was the third fastest.
Both he and team-mate Eddie Irvine used the latest aerodynamic set-
up for this set-up. "It was difficult to get the right set-up for
the cooler conditions," said Schumacher who also did some pit stop
practice. Irvine also spun off and abandoned his car in the gravel
trap at Luffield.
</P>
<P>
The Jordan Mugen-Hondas of Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Damon Hill
set fourth and fifth fastest times, with both drivers relishing
the performance of the latest uprated spec V10 engine and
lightweight gearbox.
</P>
<P>
"This is very definite progress," said Frentzen, winner of
French Grand Prix two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Hill, who announced on-off retirement after his lacklustre race
in France, spent much of the session trying to adapt the handling
balance to the cooler conditions.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Minister Resigns Protesting Crackdown on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Minister of Culture and
Higher Education Mostafa Moin resigned on Saturday in a protest to
the bloody crackdown of university students by the
conservative-dominated security forces (police).
</P>
<P>
In his resignation to President Mohammad Khatami, Moin said
that the entering of security forces into Tehran University campus
and their beating up of innocent students "is not acceptable under
any basis and expediency."
</P>
<P>
"Due to my failure to respond to my divine duties and legal
responsibilities, and because of the innocence and homelessness of
the children of the nation and their worrying families, and due to
the unpleasant consequences of these violent and seditious
breaches of law, I hereby submit my resignation as minister of
culture and higher education," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I consider this incident a suspicious measure with an aim to
turn the society into turmoil and to sabotage the trend of
political development and undermine the Islamic Republic system,"
the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted the resignation as saying.
</P>
<P>
Several hundreds of university students Thursday night staged
a rally at the Tehran University dormitory, protesting the
newly-approved press law and the ban of the popular moderate
daily Salam (Hello).
</P>
<P>
Over 1,000 anti-riot police forced into the dormitory to crack
down the rally and clashed with students who tried to prevent
their entry.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said that at least seven students were killed,
about 300 injured and 500 others arrested by the police during the
clashes which lasted several hours into Friday morning.

strongly blast the crackdown and warned that the use of force
against students by police at University dormitory may turn into a
national crisis.
</P>
<P>
This incident cannot be analyzed in simple terms or accepted
that it was not part of a calculated plan with the motive of
plunging the country into crisis by a number of willful forces,
the ministry said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian NGO Calls for Nationwide Awareness of Disintegration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jakarta, July 10 (Xinhua) -- An Indonesian non-governmental
organization, the National Front or Barisan Kebangsaan (BK),
Saturday called for nationwide concern and caution over the
increasing disintegration movements in the country.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, BK's leader J.M. Hidayat strongly urged
every Indonesian element to be aware of certain movements which he
called "Irama-suka" (Groups with same agreements), that have
consistently provoked disintegration through racial, religious and
poverty issues.
</P>
<P>
Recent efforts to abolish Pancasila (The Five Pillars
Principles) as Indonesian main ideology and Pancasila education in
schools and institutions, Hidayat said, had clearly shown that
Irama-suka planned a constitutional coup d'etat against Pancasila.
</P>
<P>
After the general election which was held on June 7, certain
forces in Indonesia have tried to replace the Pancasila by a
religious doctrine.
</P>
<P>
Pancasila, introduced by the late president Soekarno as
national platform, was designed and built from Indonesia's early
independence movements and from the very base of Indonesian
culture and accepted by most of the people.
</P>
<P>
"This means anything against Pancasila is an act of betrayal
towards Indonesian forefathers who gave their lives to achieve
Indonesia's independence, also the very essence of Indonesian
tradition that combined together for the sake of nation's
integrity," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Based on these reasons, BK also called Irama-suka "Nation's
Traitor".
</P>
<P>
According to Hidayat, recent separatist movements which
occurred in Indonesia gave proof to the existence of Irama-suka.
Clashes which led to separatism in some provinces, such as West
Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Ambon, Aceh, Irian Jaya and East Timor, were
part of a mega project to establish a country based on a certain
religion, consisting of eleven provinces located in the eastern
and northern parts of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
BK also warned President Habibie not to fall into the trap of
Irama-suka which hides under a cover that Irama-suka was supposed
to be Habibie's train to maintain his current position as
president.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, BK also pleaded to President Habibie
and the armed forces to take serious action against these
movements that have clearly sown seeds of disintegration among the
nation.

<HEADLINE> SADC Closer to Ratifying World Criminal Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Southern African countries
moved closer this week to ratifying an international criminal
court, according to officials attending a regional workshop in
Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
They had reached a clear understanding on the technical steps
required for ratification, South African media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"There has been major movement on this level," head of the
South African delegation, Medard Rwelamira, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from 12 countries in the Southern African Development
 Community (SADC) attended the workshop.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Ministry deputy director-general, Abdul
Minty, said the workshop agreed on a model for legislation that
countries would have to pass to ratify the UN statute adopted in
Rome last year.
</P>
<P>
Should it become reality, the court would punish acts of
aggression by countries, genocide, war atrocities and crimes
against humanity.
</P>
<P>
At least 60 countries have to sign and ratify the statute
before the court can be established. Only four states have so far
ratified the statute.
</P>
<P>
Eight of the 14 SADC members have signed the statute, but
several lack the expertise to draft the national legislation
required to comply with and ratify the statute.
</P>
<P>
The Pretoria workshop discussed ways to overcome this obstacle
and to coordinate ratification in the region.
</P>
<P>
Rwelamira said the workshop was only about technical matters.
"We were not here to come to a decision on ratification. The
delegates will now report to their respective principals."
</P>
<P>
The exact scope and definition of some of the crimes listed
under the Rome statute still had to be thrashed out, Rwelamira
said.
</P>
<P>
SADC delegates still disagreed, for example, on what an act of
aggression entailed.
</P>
<P>
"This issue involves many sensitivities and could take five to
six years to finalize," Rwelamira said.
</P>
<P>
He said the workshop agreed to work with a preparatory
commission set up in Rome to finalize such matters by June next
year.
</P>
<P>
South Africa had not taken a final decision on ratification
yet. An inter-ministerial task team was examining the practical
steps required.
</P>
<P>
"We expect to make recommendations in this regard to the
cabinet within a month or so, for it to take a decision on the
matter," Rwelamira said.

<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Huashan, one of China's most
famous mountains located in the northwestern Chinese province of
Shan'anxi, will be the site for the Eighth Asian Roch-climbing
Championships September 4-5 this year.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that China played host to such
championships, following the 1992 Asian championships in Changchun,
Jilin Province in Northeast China.
</P>
<P>
This year's event is expected to draw hundreds of participants
from more than 10 countries and regions including China, Japan and
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Rock-climbing, which features steady and thrilling movements,
has become in recent years one of the hottest and most spectacular
sports in the world.
</P>
<P>
With great progress achieved in recent years though, Asian
climbers, especially those from Japan and South Korea, are far
behind the world caliber.
</P>
<P>
Famed with its rugged, imposing and delicate cliffs, Huashan is
an ideal site for the sport and a national training camp was set
up there three years ago by the Chinese Mountaineering Association.
It was the site for the 1997 national championships and an
international invitational meet the next year.

<HEADLINE> Pak Trade Deficit in 1998-99 Stands at 1.56B Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's trade deficit in
1998-99 fiscal year ending June 30 stood at 1.56 billion U.S.
dollars as exports fell 10.5 percent despite the introduction of
various incentives for the foreign trade sector.
</P>
<P>
According to the trade figures for 1998-99 fiscal year, exports
during the year totaled only 7.72 billion dollars as against 8.63
billion dollars in the previous year, showing a decline of 10.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the import bill in 1998-99 amounted to 9.28 billion
dollars as against 10.12 billion in 1997-98 fiscal year,
registering a decline of 8.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government had vowed to achieve zero-rate trade
deficit during the last fiscal year when it announced its trade
policy for 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
Despite efforts to contain the deficit, it has been on the rise
gradually due to stagnation in exports and rise in import bill
following reduction in import duties from 45 to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
Total exports of 7.72 billion dollars are far below the target
of 10 billion dollars set by the government in its annual trade
policy.
</P>
<P>
However, an official from the Commerce Ministry said Saturday
that though the figures were not encouraging, considering the
recession in economic activities throughout the world and
Pakistan's share in the global trade, Pakistan's exports did
reasonably well.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that quantity of exports has obviously
increased but due to decline in the unit price value, export
earnings have fallen sharply.
</P>
<P>
The declining prices of Pakistan's key textile sector exports,
which consist of two-thirds of the total export income, have
eroded the dollar earnings, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They said that in the next trade policy which is expected in a
couple of days, the government should take practical steps to
boost exports to arrest the deficit.

<P>

<HEADLINE> Tehran University Dean Condemns Brutality against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Dean of Tehran University
Dr. Khalili Iraqi on Friday strongly condemned the use of force
against protesting students by the Iranian security forces,
local newspaper Iran Daily reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly condemn this brutality against the dear students
and recommend an academic attitude even if the possibility that
they have done wrong exists," Iraqi said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "we should first understand what our attitude
would be if our own children do something wrong, the same should
be our attitude towards these young people (students) who are
like our spiritual children."
</P>
<P>
Several hundreds of university students Thursday night staged
a rally at the Tehran University dormitory, protesting the
newly-approved press law and the ban of the popular moderate
daily Salam (Hello).
</P>
<P>
The students entered a bloody scuffle with anti-riot police
after they forced into the dormitory without prior permission of
the Interior Ministry, which is responsible for the country's
security.
</P>
<P>
Rumors said that about 300 students were injured and 500
others arrested by the police during the clashes.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Ministry of Culture and Higher Education warned on
Friday night that the use of force against students by
policemen at University dormitory may turn into a national
crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the ministry strongly criticized the
conservative-dominated police for forcing into university
dormitory, insulting and beating students, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian conservative-dominated Majlis (parliament) on
Wednesday approved the general outlines of the new tough press
law, threatening to put more strict rules and pressures on the
country's press.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the country's most popular moderate daily
Salam was closed down by the conservative-dominated judiciary for
publishing a "classified document" of the Intelligence Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's statement confirmed that tens of students were
injured and several hundreds of others were arrested and insulted
by the police.
</P>
<P>
This incident cannot be analyzed in simple terms or accepted
that it was not part of a calculated plan with the motive of
plunging the country into crisis by a number of willful forces,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry called on Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
President Mohammad Khatami and all relevant organizations to put
an end to this sorrowful incident by launching all-out efforts
and taking expedient measures.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, Iranian Deputy Interior Minister
Mostafa Tajzadeh on Friday night strongly blasted the police for
intervening in the student rally without being permitted by the
Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He promised that all the arrested students would be released.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Firmly Implement New Transport  Rules: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will not
rescind the decision to implement the newly-introduced Transport
Licensing Board (TLB) regulations, President Daniel arap Moi has
announced.
</P>
<P>
The President said his government was resolute in implementing
the new TLB regulations on matatu (privately-owned public service
mini-bus) and other public transport vehicles and would not budge
under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks Friday while presiding over a passing out
parade of 657 recruits at the Central Service Unit Training School
in the capital Nairobi, local media reports said Saturday..
</P>
<P>
Matatu workers in Kenya went on strike from Wednesday in
protesting the new TLB rules, which has paralyzed business in some
cities and towns in the country.
</P>
<P>
The new TLB regulations went into effect Tuesday. It stipulate
that all matatus should be licensed; matatu drivers and conductors
wear identification badges; re-allocation of matatu routes by TLB;
and matatu owners pay road licence, advance tax and insurance
fee.
</P>
<P>
Moi told matatu operators to comply with the government's new
TLB regulations or quit their business and directed them to
immediately register their vehicles accordingly or lose their
passenger service vehicle licences.
</P>
<P>
The government would take tough measures in dealing with matatu
 operators who flouted the law, the president warned.
</P>
<P>
Those in the matatu industry who have stricken over the new
rules, like any other Kenyans, must respect the law as it could
not be applied selectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president railed at some foreigners including those from
Ethiopia and Somalia in the matatu industry who had joined the
ongoing strike and also accused certain members of parliament of
citing the matatu operators into effecting the strike.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Transport and Communications Minister William Ntimama
said Friday that the government would not retreat or compromise on
the implementation of the TLB rules as the ongoing matatu strike
entered its third day.
</P>
<P>
The minister told reporters in his office here that the TLB
rules "are legal and operational and there is no way that we will
modify, adjust, retreat or compromise on their implementation."
</P>
<P>
It is reported that matatu operators in some towns resumed
business Friday as their touts enticed passengers to board their
mini-buses.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand's Political Power Play Ends as New Cabinet List Endorsed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 10 (Xinhua) -- With the endorsement by King
Bhumibol Adulyadej Saturday, Thailand's cabinet reshuffle finally
drew to an end after a month-long power struggle within individual
political parties and among parties of the coalition.
</P>
<P>
It is the second government reshuffle since the Chuan Leekpai
government took power in November 1997. The first reshuffle saw
the entry last October of the Chart Pattana Party (CPP), which has
51 seats in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Democrat Party member Trairong Suwankhiri was named deputy
prime minister, while Arthit Urairat, a Democrat party deputy
leader, was made science minister.
</P>
<P>
CPP's Paveena Hongsakul, former deputy labor minister who has
been voted most popular Thai female politician, was moved to
become minister of the Prime Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
Pinyo Niroj, also from CPP, took another ministerial post in
the Prime Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
Somsak Prissanananthakul, former deputy education minister, was
promoted to the chief of the ministry, leaving his deputy post to
Kanchana Silpa-archa.
</P>
<P>
The most controversial figure in the new cabinet line-up is
Gonpot Assawinvijit, a wealthy businessman but not a member of the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Gonpot, a school friend of Suwat Liptapallop, CPP's
secretary-general, was said to have owed 154 million baht (4.2
million U.S. dollars) to some of the 56 closed finance companies.
It was not known whether the debts were classified as
non-performing loans or they had been settled.
</P>
<P>
This reshuffle was originally planned to be a minor one,
filling only the post left vacant by ailing Deputy Agriculture
Minister Somchai Sunthornvut, who had resigned from the post.
</P>
<P>
The government had also been considering finding a candidate to
replace Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi, who is running for the director-generalship of the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
However, a likely government reshuffle provided chances for
member parties of the ruling coalition to re-allocate cabinet
seats under their respective quotas in order to achieve better
balance between different factions in their own parties.
</P>
<P>
But instead of mending differences, the Social Action Party
(SAP), used to be the fourth-largest member of the ruling
coalition with 20 seats in the House of Representatives, was
forced to the edge of splitting up as rival factions turned bitter
to each other and party advisor Rakkiat Sukthana had demanded
party leader Suvit Khunkitti, at that time deputy premier and
science minister, to give up his science post and keep only the
deputy premiership.
</P>
<P>
Suvit then rejected this demand and resigned. His resignation
forced the party to hold a meeting to elect a new executive
committee. Suvit was successfully re-elected as SAP party leader
and kicked Somsak and Rakkiat's men out of the coalition.
</P>
<P>
As a result, SAP withdrew from the government, reducing the
government's majority in the lower house from 254 to 234.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said that SAP was the biggest loser in the
reshuffle since it has lost the prime position for the next
general election.
</P>
<P>
"The party was a complete wreck as a result of no-holds-barred
infighting. It's another classic case of self-destructive
politics," said Sopon Orkgara, a local political analyst.
</P>
<P>
Later, the news about SAP was replaced by other noisy squabbles
within the Chart Pattana Party and Chart Thai Party, the second
and third-largest members of the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Even the core ruling Democrat Party was not quiet. There were
reports that party leader Chuan Leekpai and Secretary-General
Sanan Kachornprasart were at odds over the choice of compromises
within and among the coalition partners.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi PM: Solve Kashmir Issue Through Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina said on Friday that the Kashmir issue, the long-standing
problem between India and Pakistan, should be solved through
discussion instead of conflict, press reports here said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a lecture on peace and cooperation in South Asia,
Hasina, who is in Britain on an official visit, said: "Though this
is a bilateral issue, we are concerned about it. Because of the
regional interest, peace should be maintained here."
</P>
<P>
She told her audience at the Royal Institute of International
Affairs that India and Pakistan should resolve the dispute through
talks across the table, not by arms.
</P>
<P>
"The money being used for the war can be used for the
development of the people for the region," she said, hoping that
the two countries will come to an understanding through
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Peace is a precondition for progress and prosperity, she said,
calling for integrated efforts of South Asian countries to
establish peace for ensuring a better life for the teeming
millions living in the region.
</P>
<P>
"For ensuring peace and progress, we want to establish a
society based on the rule of law in South Asia through mutual
cooperation and understanding among its seven nations," she said,
adding that as the highest number of poor people live in the
region, efforts should be on maintaining peace and progress.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government gives special attention to
strengthening relations with all countries, South Asian nations in
particular, so as to promote regional and global cooperation by
removing mutual distrust, she said.
</P>
<P>
"We have been able to solve our differences with our neighbors
in a spirit of good neighborly relationship," she said, citing the
signing of the Ganges water treaty and cross-border bus service
with India as the outcome of her government's policy of amity
based on mutual national interests.

Volcano has recorded no volcanic quake in the past 24 hours and

<P>
In a bulletin issued here, the Phivolcs said that its experts
recorded an emission rate of about 1,900 tons of sulfur dioxide
Friday, down from 2,800 tons Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Observations of the summit crater revealed wispy to moderate
steaming early yesterday morning and then decreased to weak
steaming for the rest of the day," the institute said.
</P>
<P>
But, it said, Mayon's alert status remains at Alert Level 2,
which means the public should not venture inside the delineated
six-kilometer radius permanent danger zone.
</P>
<P>
But an extra kilometer was added only in the southeast sector
of the volcano as safety buffer zone, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The public, especially those living near the footsteps of the
volcano, should be on alert and be aware of the danger of volcanic
flows in case of sudden explosive activity," the Phivolcs warned.
</P>
<P>
According to Phivolcs experts, Mayon, the most active volcano
in the world, is unlikely to erupt in days.
</P>
<P>
On June 22, Mayon's mild eruption rained ash over surrounding
towns of the volcano, which is about 330 kilometers southeast of
Manila.
</P>
<P>
Mayon's last major eruption on February 2, 1993 killed 78
people and affected 17,119 persons.

<HEADLINE> Beef Price Rises in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The retail price of beef rose by
between 14 and 30 percent in Zimbabwe on Friday, the third
increase in six months, the daily Herald reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
High quality beef went up by 14 percent, while economy beef,
which is consumed by the majority of the people, rose by 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
The last time the prices were increased was in last December,
when prices went up by 14.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Stockfeed Manufacturers' Association Michael
Collins had immediately warned that the new prices of feeds would
obviously have adverse effects on all meat producers.
</P>
<P>
With economic hardships continuing to bite deeper into the
pockets of the people, most families will find it difficult to
afford beef, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Before this increase, some families were already failing to buy
beef and other basic commodities because of rocketing prices.
</P>
<P>
Prices of basic commodities are going up frequently, and salary
and wage increments no longer match them, the newspaper said.

<P>
AMMAN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has pledged to

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Repatriate 20,000 Rwandan Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's Minister of Home
Affairs, Ali Ameir Mohamed, has said the government will
repatriate 20,000 refugees from Rwanda as peace has been restored
in their homeland.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has prepared strategies in partnership with Rwanda and
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to convince
the refugees to return to their country voluntarily and quickly,
press reports Saturday quoted Mohamed as saying.
</P>
<P>
Presenting a speech at the parliament in the central city
Dodoma Friday, the minister said there is no reason to warrant
continued stay of the refugees in Tanzania since Rwanda has become
peaceful and stable to a large content.
</P>
<P>
The remaining batch was part of refugees who fled the1994
Rwanda genocide. In 1996, more than 500,000 refugees from the
central African country returned home from Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
At present, Tanzania plays host to around 800,000 refugees from
eight countries, 369,336 of which are in camps under the
management of UNHCR.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Discover Novel Immune Stimulant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A group of American scientists
have discovered a novel immune stimulant that may have significant
medical use for the treatment and prevention of infectious
diseases.
</P>
<P>
The stimulant may also contribute to the treatment of immune
deficiency disorders, according to the scientists at the Human
Genome Sciences, Inc., a company aimed at discovering and
understanding human and microbial genes.
</P>
<P>
The discovery, described in the July 9 issue of Science
magazine, may lead to new approaches to the treatment of certain
types of leukemia and lymphoma, the company said Friday in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Called B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS), the immune stimulant is
a natural component of the immune system. Also a naturally
occurring substance and a protein made by the human body, it
stimulates the production of high levels of antibodies by causing
the antibody producing cells, called B cells, to grow and produce
abundant antibodies. Antibodies act to protect the body from
infections such as bacteria and viruses.
</P>
<P>
According to the company, BLyS may be a long sought missing
link in the body's ability to protect itself from infection. For
many years, scientists have searched for substances that stimulate
the growth of antibody producing cells. BLyS seems to be one of
those substances.
</P>
<P>
The discovery, the company said, also helps to answer a well-
known puzzle. It has been known that another type of immune cell,
the monocyte, is involved in B cell stimulation and ultimately
antibody producing. But the precise role of monocytes has been a
mystery. The discovery that monocytes produce BLyS, a substance
that stimulates B cell growth and activates antibody production,
may be the answer to this long-standing riddle.
</P>
<P>
Describing potential medical uses of BLyS, the company cited
patients undergoing treatment for organ transplantation or those
recovering from chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation, who
may often have low levels of antibodies as a result of low numbers
of B cells. BLyS would shorten the recovery time for such patients.
Another potential use might be to stimulate B cells growth in AIDS
patients deficient in B cell production.

Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The law, enacted on Friday, is composed of 11 chapters

and that they receive the rights they are entitled to; and to
enable the systematic utilization within the country of the
knowledge experience and skills gained abroad.

<HEADLINE> Colombian President Vows to Continue Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Andres Pastrana said Friday that the talks to sign a peace
agreement with the guerrilla will continue, despite the combats of
security forces with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
"The talks will continue despite the attacks to the military
forces" in the rural zone of Gutierrez, in the center of the
country and near Santafe de Bogota, in which at least 36 soldiers
and 37 rebels died.
</P>
<P>
"The government will continue seeking a peace approach,
although occurrences like that of Gutierrez cause sadness and
concern," said Pastrana in the El Chaparral in the south of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana said that is better to talk than to fight, and
insisted that the peace talks will continue.
</P>
<P>
The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the
Pastrana government started a process of reconciliation last year
and they agreed in May on a common agenda that would start to be
discussed last Wednesday, but that the guerrilla asked to postpone
until next July 20.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks are aimed at ending Colombia's long-running war
that has claimed more than 35,000 lives in just 10 years.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Lifts Ban on French, Dutch Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) of Thailand Friday conditionally lifted a ban on dairy,
poultry, eggs and meat products from France and the Netherlands,
but maintained curbs on Belgian products over fears about
cancer-causing dioxin.
</P>
<P>
FDA chief Mongkol Songkhla said that only French and Dutch
products with health certificates from the countries of origin
assuring that they were dioxin-free would be allowed into the
country, the Nation newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The FDA took the decision after the French and Dutch
governments "had shown food-safety monitoring and checking to the
agency's satisfaction," Mongkol said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Belgian officials who met Public Health Minister
Korn Dabaransi on Thursday failed to convince health authorities
to cancel the ban on their products, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Mongkol said it was necessary for the FDA to maintain curbs on
Belgian products, since there had not yet been adequate
information from the Commission of the European Union on the
"safety" of these products.
</P>
<P>
The FDA imposed a ban on Belgian dairy, poultry, meat and egg
products on June 7 and later extended the ban to cover those
products from France and the Netherlands on June 9, after it was
discovered that 80,000 tons of Belgian animal feed had been made
with oil laced with dioxin.
</P>
<P>
Some of the feed, the animals that had eaten it, and their
by-products, were traced to France, the Netherlands and Germany,
triggering curbs on their products as well.

<HEADLINE> Employees File Lawsuit Against Minister for Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Two employees of the Canadian
Foreign Ministry have filed a 33 million Canadian dollar (about 22.
44 million U.S. dollars) lawsuit against their minister Lloyd
Axworthy for "wasteful spending".
</P>
<P>
The local CBC Radio reported Friday that Joannah Gualtiere and
John Guenette alleged in the lawsuit that Minister Axworthy and
his officials had wasted billions of taxpayer's dollars in
careless spending.
</P>
<P>
Gualtiere was quoted as saying that her bureau was caved in to
the wasteful spending of ambassadors and senior foreign service
officers, who are more interested in "grandiose and luxurious
accommodations and lifestyles".
</P>
<P>
The two employees, who used to be in charge of their bureau's
property around the world, are now on long-term sick leave without
pay. They said they were harassed and demeaned at work after
raising complaints.
</P>
<P>
The foreign affairs department has rebutted the allegations in
a statement of defence, saying the bureau did feasibility studies
before making spending decisions.
</P>
<P>
"The allegations are groundless and without foundation and we
expect to be able to show that," a lawyer said on behalf of the
foreign affairs department.

<HEADLINE> China Ready for the Championship Match at Women's Wo rld Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese team held their last
training session at the 3rd women's World Cup tournament here Friday
and appeared relaxed and in high spirit.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team will play hosts the United States at Rose Bowl
on Saturday for the title of the tournament. The match is expected
to be a balanced World Cup final.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team, which have 7 players selected to the All-Star
team, may have peaked at the right time. They beat defending
champions Norway 5-0 with a flawless performance.
</P>
<P>
"We are now ready for the final. We feel no pressure and we will
definitely go all out for a win." said Chinese head coach Ma Yuanan.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was confident in winning the final, Ma said:"Of course.
We have beaten the American team twice in three encounters this year.
We think we find the right tactics to cope with the Americans."
</P>
<P>
Ma also praised the American team:"The American team are
definitely one of the best teams in the world. They are deserved
for a berth in the final."
</P>
<P>
"All the players in the American team have good skills and the
American team also have a very good team-work." said Ma Yuanan.

<P>
Ma said Chinese captain Sun Wen is the best female footballer in

"We have proved our scoring ability with 19 goals in five
matches. We have also proved that we have a solid defense line as
so far we have conceded only 2 goals." said Ma Yuanan.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Ma Yuanan promised the final would be an exciting one, a
match which could help promote the women's soccer worldwide.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Corporations Intensify On-Campus Recruiting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 9 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of U.S.
corporations are striking out extensive and competitive on-campus
recruiting programs, according to a study released Friday.
</P>
<P>
Contributed to the trend are the worsening shortage of skills
and the strong desire of corporations to attract qualified
candidates, especially among dwindling in-demand technical
graduates, said the National Corporate Consultants, a U.S. premier
college recruiting firm.
</P>
<P>
Between May 1997 and May 1999, the firm surveyed more than 1,
200 students and some 40 placement officers on campuses nationwide,
finding that the number of companies participating in college
recruiting has increased by more than 40 percent in the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
Corporate recruitment programs have become more extensive with
many companies developing a year-round presence on campuses.
Companies also hold more elaborate fall career fairs to
professional consultants to make sure their organizations can
compete in the scramble to attract top graduates.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that college placement offices host an
average of 348 companies annually. Fifty-six percent of graduating
seniors register with their schools' placement officers, and most
of them secure jobs upon graduation.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that business majors are most interested in
consulting, marketing and financial services. But most in-demand
by companies are technical graduates -- in computer services and
engineering-- who secure an average of 11 interviews compared with
nine interviews that non-technical graduates receive.
</P>
<P>
The recruiting service firm said that the survey is more proof
of corporate concern over the skills shortage already affecting
companies' performance and productivity.
</P>
<P>
Education reports indicated that the number of bachelor degrees
peaked in 1998 and is now dipping, the firm said. The number of
today's technical graduates in the United States is approximately
50 percent less than 10 years ago, while the number of engineering
graduates is 20 percent down.
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, many corporations are increasing
their on-campus recruiting, outsourcing recruiting to service
firms, and resorting to competitive compensation strategies and
sign-on bonuses to attract the best graduates.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Colombian army and police
intensified their vigilance Friday on the outskirts of Bogota
after a large-scale guerrilla offensive against the capital was
thwarted Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the biggest
rebel group in the country, intended to gain an advantageous
position before peace talks are resumed on July 20, military
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The fighting beginning early Thursday in the Gutierrez
municipality of the department of Cundinamarca, 80 kilometers from
the capital, was the worst of recent clashes between the
government forces and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The army reported that some 40 guerrilla fighters died in the
fighting, while the rebels said they killed 45 army troops.
</P>
<P>
Colombia's prolonged civil war has claimed more than 35,000
lives in 10 years.

MANAGUA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua has an illiteracy rate of
almost 30 percent, one of the highest in Central America, said an
expert on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Juan Bautista Arrien, coordinator of a study on teaching in
five Central American countries, attributed the high rate to the
country's meager budget allotted to education.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua spends 4.3 percent of its gross domestic product on
education, while other countries in the region allocate 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Arrien said that while the education coverage reaches 90
percent in some Central American countries, in Nicaragua some 950,
000 children of school age are left out of school.
</P>
<P>
Only 73-74 percent children are attending school, he added.

<P>
He believed the visit will play a positive role for the healthy
and stable development of Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also talked about training a new generation of
leaders for the bilateral friendship.
</P>
<P>
Qian said, many people of the older generation that worked for
the Sino-Japanese friendship have either passed away or become old.
Thus it is quite important to train a new generation of leaders in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi agreed with him, saying that friendship between the two
countries should continue from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
Japan will create a favorable environment for training a
younger generation of leaders that understand China and love China.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also briefed each other on the economic situation
of their respective countries, and expressed confidence in the
recovering trend and further development of bilateral economic and
trade ties.
</P>
<P>
They also exchanged views on regional and international issues
of common interest.

<HEADLINE> NATO May Reduce Peacekeeping Troops in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, July 9 (Xinhua) -- NATO's Supreme Commander General
Wesley Clark said in Sarajevo Friday that the alliance may cut its
peacekeeping troops in Bosnia as the situation there has improved,
Croatian Radio and Television reported.
</P>
<P>
The ending of the Kosovo crisis and the progress made in the
implementation of Dayton Agreement opened the possibility of
reducing the Stabilization Force (SFOR) troops in Bosnia, Clark
said after a meeting with the members of Bosnia's joint presidency.
</P>
<P>
However, there will be no change in the tenure of the SFOR
troops, who will continue carrying out their duties defined by the
Dayton accords, Clark explained.
</P>
<P>
He also confirmed that NATO and the Bosnia-based SFOR troops
will provide all necessary support to the first summit on the
stabilisation and rebuilding of southeast Europe, which he said
will be held in Sarajevo at the end of this month.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The number of overseas tourists who
visited the east China coastal province of Shandong hit a record
of 210,000 in January-May of the year, 28 percent more than the
figure for the same 1998 period.
</P>
<P>
As one of the country's renowned tourist destinations, Shandong
Province reaped 76 million U.S. dollars of income in foreign
exchange from tourism, 20 percent more than that in the same 1998
period, or six percentage points higher than national growth
average.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of Korea tops the list of overseas countries in
terms of the number of its tourists to Shandong Province. In
January-May of this year, the number of overseas visitors from the

<HEADLINE> Costa Rican Sets Banana Export Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican banana producers set
an export record in the first five months of the year, National
Banana Corporation (Corbana) announced Friday
</P>
<P>
Banana exports from January to May amounted to 48 million 18-
kilogram boxes, a 3.8 percent increase over the 46.2 million boxes
during the same period of 1998, according to Corbana data
published Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican banana exports increased at a time of
uncertainty after the European Union changed its quota system for
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The quota system, declared illegal by the World Trade
Organization (WTO), gave Costa Rica a little more than 25 percent
of the total imports from Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican Foreign Trade Minister Samuel Guzowski and European
Commissioner Leon Brittan discussed the issue this week in
Brussels, but it is not known yet what will be the EU's definitive
position on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The European market is of special importance to the country
because the prices there are higher than in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica is the second largest banana exporter in the world
after Ecuador.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's State Bodies Urged to Move Faster against Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnam Y2K Steering Committee
has recently urged the Vietnamese government's agencies and
state-owned enterprises to step up their efforts to squash the
millennium bug, the Vietnam News reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The committee was quoted as saying that most such bodies are
behind in their preparations to deal with the computer Y2K
problem, which experts fear will cause systems around the globe to
crash when the new century arrives.
</P>
<P>
More than half of Vietnam's state bodies, businesses and
provincial authorities have yet to outline their plans to find a
solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
Of the total 71,000 computers inspected, 43,500, or 61 percent
have been marked as unprepared for the Y2K problem, said
Vietnamese computer experts, adding that about 70 percent of
operating systems and 90 percent of software applications would
not be able to cope with the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
Only some major sectors are preparing on schedule. Topping the
list are the post and telecommunications sector with 85 percent of
the work complete, the gas and oil sector also with 85 percent,
aviation and banking sectors with 60 percent, and the financial
sector with 15 percent. In all, only 10 percent of all units are
prepared.
</P>
<P>
One percent of all Vietnam's units will be critically affected
by the Y2K problem, 71 percent severely affected, 20 percent
nominally affected and four percent minimally affected, according
to Vietnamese computer experts.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Y2K Steering Committee said the total cost for
dealing with the problem will be 545 billion Vietnamese dong (39
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, the majority of Vietnam's companies and government
offices have failed to provide funding to overcome the Y2K
problem, despite state regulations that allow them to finance the
costs with their regular budgets.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Fish Meal Exports Plunge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Chilean fish meal exports plunged
34 percent in the first five months of 1999 compared with the same
period last year, said a report of the National Fishing
Association on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The earning for that period also dropped to 124.7 million U.S.
dollars, a 64 million dollar fall from last year's.
</P>
<P>
The fall was attributed to a lower catch of jurel in the
country's central-south zones, where the government has imposed a
ban on this species for the lack of adult fish all the season,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
The price of fish meal went down from 700 dollars per ton last
year to 430 dollars per ton registered in April this year, while a
slight recovery was seen in May with an average price of 462
dollars per ton.
</P>
<P>
The price of canned jurel and sardine also dropped 17 percent
to 858 dollars per ton compared with 1998.
</P>
<P>
The total exports of the entire fishing sector, however, showed
a slight increase of 1.6 percent in the first five months of 1999,
which was mainly boosted by the good harvest of salmon.

BANGKOK, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Top-seeded Sun Jun from China's top
seed was ousted by compatriot Ji Xinpeng in the men's singles on
the fourth day at the World Grand Prix Thailand Open Badminton
Championships here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
An our-of-form Sun lost the match 17-15, 15-7.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Li Yongbo said Sun was not trained hard
enough before the match while Ji has become one of the rising
stars among a young generation.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's Rachid Sidek, the only non-Chinese in the quarter-
finals, posed a threat to the Chinese-dominated men's singles by
ousting China's Dong Jiong.
</P>
<P>
Dong said after the match that he has been hit by knee injury
since January this year and often lost to nobody, which damaged
his self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
However, he regained much of his confidence in this match,
despite the eventual loss to the experienced Malaysian ace.
</P>
<P>
In the lady's singles, top-seeded Chinese Dai Yun marched on
after beating local favorite Sujitra Ekmongkolpaisarn.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Badminton Association of Thailand
complained a bad luck for Sujitra as being drawn into the same
group with Dai.
</P>
<P>
Chin's mixed doubles pair Liu Yong and Ge Fei will take on
Danes Michael Sogaard and Rikke Olsen in Saturday's final.

<HEADLINE> Asian Delegates Walk Out in World Cup Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Asian delegates walked out of a
FIFA Extraordinary Congress on Friday in protest at the location of
places for the 2002 World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Asian delegates stood up and left the conference room en masse,
leaving the remaing national associations in stunned silence.
</P>
<P>
The world governing body of soccer FIFA gives Asia two spots in
the 2002 World Cup finals to be co-hosted by Japan and South Korea.
The Asian Football Conferdation (AFC) ask for a third place besides
Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The sensational move came less than 24 hours after the AFC said
they would boycott the 2002 qualifying tournament and go into the
World Cup with only two countries, joint hosts Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
AFC general secretary Peter Velappan said:"This continent has
3.5 billion people and is hosting the World Cup for the first time.
This matter has been going on for several months, it's no use FIFA
waking up to it now."
</P>
<P>
"The issue is quite clear: We want three full qualifying berths
plus two for the host nations. The ball is now in FIFA's court."
Velappan said.
</P>
<P>
"We will only reconsider if Mr. Sepp Blatter can come up with an
amicable conclusion. There is sufficient time to solve this but it
is now FIFA's responsibility." Velappan said.
</P>
<P>
Chung Mong Joon, South Korea's FIFA and AFC vice president, also
walked out of the conference room. "AFC will hold a extraordinary
congress very soon in Kuala Lumpur. We will reconfirm or change our
decision at that time."
</P>
<P>
Blatter said he had been let down by the reaction of the Asian
delegates:"I have tried to find a solutioon to increase Asia's
numberof spots. I have negotiated with other continents and UEFA
has already given up half an allocation. I agreed privately with
the AFC president to take up this further problem outside the
confines of this conference. This explains my shock reaction
today."

WASHINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Five-time U.S. Open champion
Steffi Graf has entered the 1999 U.S. Open championships, the U.S.
Tennis Association confirmed in New York, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Graf, whose tennis future was left in doubt after reaching the
Wimbledon singles final, has been included in a list of U.S. Open
entries submitted by the WTA Tour, the USTA said in a statement
issued Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Open will be held from August 30 through September 12 at
the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old German, currently ranked number three in the
world, triumphed over then number one Martina Hingis from
Switzerland in the French Open final, her first grand slam singles
title since the 1996 U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
After the victory, Graf announced she would not compete at
Roland Garros again.
</P>
<P>
One month later, Graf reached the Wimbledon final, where she
lost to American Lindsay Davenport. She told a post-match press
conference that she did not intend to play at Wimbledon in the
future and left her status for the U.S. Open uncertain.
</P>
<P>
Graf has won 22 career grand slam titles, and in 1988 achieved
the "Golden" Grand Slam, when she claimed the women's singles
crowns at each of the four Grand Slam championships and at the
Seoul Olympics.

<HEADLINE> China vs Russia in Universiade Women's Volleyball Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PALMA, Spain, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese women spikers
exploited their advantages in height to beat their Japanese peers
in three straight sets, booking the first berth in the women's
volleyball final at the 20th World University Games here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese outpowered the Japanese 25-20, 25-18 and 25-16 in
one hour and a half, and will vie against the Russians for the
team title after the latter defeated France 25-20, 25-21 and 25-21
in the other semi-final.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese players displayed their normal form with many a
good blocks and aggressive serves, which deprived the Japanese of
their advantages of quick moves in team work," said Zhen Jiucheng,
manager of the Chinese volleyball team.
</P>
<P>
With an average height of 1.84 meters, the Chinese blocked most
of the attacks from the Japanese who usually resorted to lops to
the backcourt in their previous outings.
</P>
<P>
"We have studied the Japanese tactics and had our training in
the morning with keen attention on their style of play," said the
Chinese manager.
</P>
<P>
"It's comparatively easier for us to beat the Japanese since
they also looked forward to advancing to the final," said Zhen
Jiucheng. "Once we achieved our dominance in front of the net and
displayed our good backcourt defense, they were quickly out of the
bullets from the weaponry."
</P>
<P>
Despite its three consecutive off-line attacks, the Chinese
managed to win the first set from 14-13 to 25-20, and rushed ahead
from 13-12 to 18-13 through four solid blocks in a row for a 2-0
lead before dominating the third set from the beginning to secure
their outing to the final.

French opponents by fully exploiting their body advantages in
front of the net with witty lops.

Romania 25-18, 28-26, 17-25 and 26-24, while Chinese Taipei
rallied from the first set deficit to edge over Thailand 23-25, 25-
20,15-25, 25-20 and 15-13.
</P>

Czech Republic 15-25, 20-25, 25-16, 25-23 and 15-3 in the
competitions for the ninth to 12th places, with Canada recording
three straight wins over Brazil 25-22, 25-21 and 25-23.
</P>
<P>
The 13-16th matches saw Ukraine beating Sweden 25-19, 25-22 and
25-16, and Switzerland outscoring South Africa 25-10, 25-4 and 25-

<HEADLINE> Beckham to Miss Man United's Australian Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- David Beckham, who is on a honeymoon
holiday with spice girl Posh, will miss Manchester United's two-
match tour of Australia.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports Friday, United manager Alex Ferguson
has confirmed that Beckham would not be in the team.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson, who will also miss the trip to accept his Knighthood
from the Queen at Buckingham Palace on July 21, said the club
never intended to include Beckham on the Australian tour, although
he could fly out to meet up with the squad for the China leg of
the trip.
</P>
<P>
Beckham has been allowed to return late to pre-season training
following his wedding to singer Victoria Adams of the Spice Girls.
</P>
<P>
"David was told at the end of the season that he had to be back
on July 12," Ferguson said, playing down British newspaper
speculation that he and the player had fallen out over the issue.
</P>
<P>
"I think obviously some attempt had been made by one of his or
his bride's agents to get an extension to his time off but we
couldn't do that because he needs to get fit for the new season.
</P>
<P>
"I spoke to David last week and he understood. There is not a
bust-up on my part. We considered all the players and when they
should come back. David played his last game on June 5 and the
12th of July was the latest we could possibly have him back.
</P>
<P>
"He's had 37 days off now which is almost six weeks and he
needs to get fit. He was never going to Australia at the start
and there are no plans for him to go. Whether he goes to the
second leg in China and Hong Kong depends on his fitness."
</P>
<P>
The news will leave the promoters of two matches between United
and Australia's national team fuming as they said they have an
agreement stating Beckham would play.
</P>
<P>
"We've tried to be nice but we've been forced to get tough,"
said Dominic Galati, managing director of the promoters. "It's
not the honeymoon anymore, it's a two million Australian dollars
penalty instead.
</P>
<P>
"They (United) are being paid more by us than they've ever
received for an overseas tour and we feel they should honour the
contract," he added.

<HEADLINE> Hill Shows Ambition for British GP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Formula one driver Damon Hill's on-
off retirement plans could take a back seat if he reproduces
Friday's practice times in the British Grand Prix on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the first practice at Silverstone the 38-year-old 1996 world
champion put a disappointing start to the season behind him to
record the seventh best time of the day.
</P>
<P>
He improved on an eleventh place standing with his second run -
one of the few drivers to improve on his first practice run.
</P>
<P>
At one point, he was fourth, but Ralf Schumacher in the
Williams, David Coulthard in the McLaren and Stewart's Rubens
Barrichello made late improvements to push him down the field.
</P>
<P>
Hill's future - which has been in doubt for the last fortnight -
rides on the outcome of the British race and repeating Friday's
form in Saturday's qualifying round is all-important.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has reportedly chosen Nick Heidfeld to replace Hill for
the rest of this season if the British driver quits.
</P>
<P>
The best time was set by reigning world champion and table
topper Mika Hakkinen in the McLaren - a mere 0.023 seconds up on
Ralf Schumacher.
</P>
<P>
Eddie Irvine in the Ferrari came in third, with Coulthard in
the other McLaren in fourth and Rubens Barrichello in fifth.
</P>
<P>
Hill's long-time rival Michael Schumacher came in sixth.
Second placed overall, he trails Mika Hikkinen by eight points
going into the halfway stage of the competition.
</P>
<P>
Hill's teammate and French Grand Prix winner Heinz-Harald
Frentzen slipped back to 14th.
</P>
<P>
Briton Johnny Herbert had a disappointing run, placing 18th, as
doubts grow over his career in Formula One.

<HEADLINE> World Copper Prices Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- World copper prices hiked due to
the closing of some mines and the strikes affecting several copper
smelting plants in the world this week, official sources said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
A report of the Chilean Copper Commission (Cochilco) showed
that the positive trend in copper prices is a reaction to the
announcement of the closing of high-cost operations by the
Australian firm BHP and the output reduction of the Asarco firm.
</P>
<P>
This was joined this week by the strike of the Kidd Creek plant
in Canada.
</P>
<P>
The report said that although the London Metals Market
inventories maintained a sustained reduction during the week, it
registered a 10,800 metric ton increase this Friday, making the
stocks go up to 5,325 tons in the last seven days.
</P>
<P>
The total copper production in the year went up to 169,825
metric tons.

<HEADLINE>   I Would Never Let My Fans Down, Says Grobbelaar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Bruce Grobbelaar, the former
Liverpool goalkeeper suing The Sun newspaper for libel over its
allegations of match-fixing, has told the High Court in London he
would never have betrayed his fans.
</P>
<P>
Grobbelaar, who earlier said he had fallen victim to a "classic
scam" set up by the paper, gave evidence on the first day of his
action for "substantial" damages for articles published in
November 1994.
</P>
<P>
His counsel, Richard Hartley QC opened the case before the jury
of seven men and five women, promising they would hear how The Sun
operated to obtain its "so-called" news.
</P>
<P>
The 41-year-old former Zimbabwean international, took the stand
and said of his Liverpool fans: "They accepted me as I was, a fun-
loving person that loved my football. I would never have done
anything to let them down."
</P>
<P>
The Sun claimed Mr. Grobbelaar took 40,000 pounds to make sure
Liverpool lost to Newcastle the previous year, and missed another
payday by accidentally making a sensational save against
Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
This civil action follows two criminal trials at Winchester
Crown Court in 1997 - the first ended in deadlock - which cleared
Grobbelaar of conspiracy along with ex-Wimbeldon players John

Hartley pointed out that his client would not have agreed to go
through another hearing if did not believe he was in the right.
</P>
<P>
He told the jury: "You may think that the fact Mr. Grobbelaar
is prepared to face a jury for a third time shows a certain amount
of guts and that he knows he is in the right."
</P>
<P>
He added: "The real question you will have to decide when you
have heard all the evidence is whether the defendants have proved
that the allegations are true, namely that Mr. Grobbelaar did take
bribes and did fix football matches."
</P>
<P>
Grobbelaar is seeking additional exemplary damages to punish
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"The Sun was enjoying every moment of publicity those articles
were getting and were gloating at having crucified one of the
great sporting heroes - that's what they love most - and that
cynical gloating is one of the more unpleasant features of this
case," said Harltey.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper denies libel and is set to argue justification
and qualified privilege during the month-long hearing.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Mexico Bid for 2003 Summer Universiade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PALMA, Spain, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Mexico have
officially applied for hosting the 2003 Universiade on Friday,
bringing the candidates to four for the 22nd edition.
</P>
<P>
After Moscow made its official bid on Thursday, Mexico becomes
the fourth country that applies for the hosting of the Universiade,
said Primo Nebiolo, president of the International University
Sports Federation (FISU).
</P>
<P>
Nebiolo met the Mexican delegation on Friday morning as
officials from Monterrey submitted their formal application.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Amsterdam of the Netherlands and Taegu of South Korea
also applied for the 2003 Universiade.
</P>
<P>
In its bid, the Moscow delegation guaranteed to the FISU
president the commitment of the Russian government and of the city
of Moscow to ensure a successful event.
</P>
<P>
Yuri Luzhkov, mayor of Moscow, further supported the candidacy
of his city by underlining that 2003 would be a particularly
significant date for the Russian capital who hosted the 1973
Universiade.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the city of Monterrey claims to have
sufficient experience in grand-scale events as it has successfully
held several international events and was also part of the FIFA
World Cup finals in 1970 and 1986, the 1968 Olympics and the
Junior Olympiad in last April with 14,000 athletes.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Mexico already was the theater of the 1979 universiade
in Mexico city with 4,381 participants from 94 countries and
regions.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Pays 1.64 Billion Dollars of Public Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela had paid 1.64 billion U.S.
dollars of its public debts during the first half of this year,
the Finance Ministry announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The country will make a payment for a similar amount during the
second half of the year, which includes 777.64 million dollars in
the third quarter and 920 million dollars in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela canceled a payment for 621 million dollars last June,
said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign debt service reduced its international
reserves, especially at the end of the first and second quarters.
</P>
<P>
The increase of oil income and the reduction of imports caused
by the economic contraction prevented a further reduction of the
reserves, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan government is studying a possible reduction of
the foreign debt with an emission or exchange of public debt bonds.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Wins Springboard Diving Title at Universiade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PALMA, Spain, July (Xinhua) -- Chinese diver Wang Kenan took
advantage of the rival's blunder to win the gold of men's three-
meter springboard in the 20th World University Games here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Troy Dumais of the United States, who led after the first five
dives, botched his last dive. He then complained that the on-
lookers' noise affected his dive and demanded for a second try.
His demanded was accepted.
</P>
<P>
But he failed again with the dive, a reverse 3 1/2 somersault,
which earned him only 38.850 points.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who ranked second after five dives, garnered 640.530 to
claim the gold. Ken Terauchi of Japan won the silver with 630.810
points. The bronze went to Rafael Alvarez of Spain, who collected
a total of 627.300 points. Dumais slipped to a dismal fifth in
611.670.
</P>
<P>
"I was very confident throughout the competition," said 19-year-
old Wang. "I knew so long as I brought my best, the gold would be
mine."
</P>
<P>
"But Dumais is rather strong. If he had not made the mistake,
maybe he world have taken the gold," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Shaanxi Province
has begun a 50-year ecological improvement plan to increase
cultivated land and plant more trees and grasses to stop soil
erosion, official sources here said.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the province will reclaim 19.03 million
ha. of farmland, plant 2.1 million ha. of grass, and reclaim 118,
000 ha. of eroded land.
</P>
<P>
Forest coverage is expected to be increased from 28 percent to
48 percent by the year 2050.
</P>
<P>
The scheme will be implemented in three stages, with the first
phase starting this year and running through 2010 with a cost of
78.78 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi is located on the middle reaches of the Yellow River
and has suffered from soil erosion that has affected almost 50
percent of its land area.
</P>
<P>
The deteriorating environment caused by this is one of the main
factors holding local economic growth, officials said.

UNITED NATIONS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia Friday voiced its
hope that Bernard Kouchner, the newly-appointed U.N. special
representative for Kosovo, will be "objective, impartial and
cooperative" in leading the United Nations Interim Administration
Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK).

<P>
"Yugoslavia is ready to cooperate with the U.N. mission headed
by Mr. Kouchner," he said, adding that it is hoped that the U.N.
mission would take appropriate steps to ensure safety and security
for all ethnic groups in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
On the post-war reconstruction, the senior Yugoslav diplomat
said that Yugoslavia as a whole was subject to "the brutal
invasion" of the NATO countries, so the post-war reconstruction
should not only begin in Kosovo, the Yugoslav province, but also
in the whole Balkan country, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Some NATO countries have linked the economic assistance to the
political issue of some possible personnel changes in our
government, this is totally unacceptable," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the destruction caused by NATO's 79-day air strikes, which
began on March 24, Jovanovic said that the government-sponsored
assessment is under way, but initial estimate shows that the
direct and indirect loss Yugoslavia sufferred from the NATO
attacks totals 100 billion U.S. dollars. "Yugoslavia should be
compensated," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO, without the authorization of the U.N.
Security Council, unilaterally launched military attacks on
Yugoslavia, a sovereign member of the U.N. family, thus violating
the U.N. Charter and International law.
</P>
<P>
On the disarmament of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA),he
voiced Belgrade's dissatisfaction with the NATO-led peacekeepers,
or KFOR, who have shown "too much tolerance with the terrorists
and separatists."
</P>
<P>
After the total withdrawal of Yugoslav military and police
forces from the Serbian province, KLA took the chance to fill the
power vacuum, and set up interim administration in some of the
areas.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the rebels have seized such public institutions as
radio and television stations, and national banks in Pristina, the
provincial capital, and they even hang the Albanian national flags
in some public buildings in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, only two kinds of flags are legitimate in
Kosovo, one is the national flag of Yugoslavia and the other is
the flag of the United Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If the United Nations thinks only one kind of flag is
sufficient in Kosovo at the interim period of time, it should be
the U.N. flag," he said.
</P>
<P>
"How come to hang the national flag of a third country, Albania
who openly supports the independence of Kosovo?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
The disarmament of KLA was among clear-cut provisions in the
military technical agreement between Yugoslavia and NATO, and the
Security Council Resolution 1244, adopted on June 10, which says"
all Member States should bear in mind the authority of the
Security Council in the maintenance of the peace and security in
the world and respect for the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
KLA has committed such criminal activities as kidnapping,
burning down civilian houses and murdering, which led to the
continuous worsening of the security on the ground in Kosovo, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade adopts "a wait-and-see" approach towards what the U.N.
and the peacekeepers is going to do in Kosovo because the peace
process is just at its initial stage, he added.

<HEADLINE> Former U.S. Astronaut Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. astronaut Charles
Conrad, who in 1969 became the third man to walk on the moon, died
in a motorcycle accident in California State of the United States
Thursday at the age of 69, said reports reaching here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Conrad, who also flew two Gemini missions in the 1960s and
commanded first Skylab mission in 1973, crashed on a turn Thursday
on Highway 150 near Ojai, California, and died five hours later at
Ojai Valley Community Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Flags at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral in Florida
State and at Johnson Space Center in Houston flew at half-staff
Friday in observance of Conrad's death.
</P>
<P>
Conrad, who lived in Huntington Beach near Los Angeles, was on
a trip to Monterey with his wife, Nancy, and friends.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
selected Conrad, an aeronautical engineer and Navy test pilot, as
an astronaut in 1962, three years after the first seven astronauts
were announced. He piloted the eight-day Gemini 5 mission in 1965,
which set an endurance record in orbiting the earth. A year later,
Conrad commanded Gemini 11, which docked with another craft during
orbit and set a space altitude record of 1,360 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
As commander of the Apollo 12 mission in November 1969, Conrad
earned the distinction of being the third man to walk on the moon
after bringing the lunar module down in the moon's Ocean of
Storms.
</P>
<P>
The first two moonwalkers were Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin,
who landed there 30 years ago this month, on July 20, 1969.
</P>
<P>
Conrad and astronaut Alan Bean spent seven hours and 45 minutes
on the lunar surface. Among their tasks was installing a nuclear
power generating station to provide a power source for long-term
experiments.
</P>
<P>
Conrad is the third of the 12 original moon walkers to die.
James Irwin of Apollo 15 died in 1991 and Alan Shepard of Apollo
14 died a year ago.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Friday issued a presidential statement, extending a welcome to the
positive developments in the Libyan compliance with relevant
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The statement came at the end of the Security Council's
day-long closed-door session to consider a report by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council welcomes the positive developments
identified in the report and the fact that the Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya has made significant progress in compliance with the
relevant resolution," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the 15-nation also welcomes the Libyan
commitment to implement further the relevant resolutions in order
to meet all the requirements.
</P>
<P>
"It encourages all parties concerned to maintain their spirit
of cooperation," the statement said, adding that the Security
Council "reaffirms its intention to lift those measures
(sanctions) as soon as possible" under relevant Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions were suspended in early April when Libya
handed over tow suspects of the Lockerbie bombing, killing a total
270 people in December 1988, for trial in the Netherlands under
Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
The Libya's U.N. ambassador, Abuzed Omar Dorda, Tuesday
demanded that the United Nations lift sanctions against the North
African country, saying "the politicization of this legal dispute,
in whatever form or by anyone, is not acceptable."
</P>
<P>
Annan said in his report that Libya had promised to cooperate
with a trial of the two suspects and pay compensation if the two
were convicted. But he said the United States needed more evidence
before it would agree to lifting the sanctions, mainly because the
trial of the two suspects will not start before February next
year.

radio and television stations, and national banks in Pristina, the
provincial capital, and they even hang the Albanian national flags
in some public buildings in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, only two kinds of flags are legitimate in
Kosovo, one is the national flag of Yugoslavia and the other is
the flag of the United Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If the United Nations thinks only one kind of flag is
sufficient in Kosovo at the interim period of time, it should be
the U.N. flag," he said.
</P>
<P>
"How come to hang the national flag of a third country, Albania
who openly supports the independence of Kosovo?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
The disarmament of KLA was among clear-cut provisions in the
military technical agreement between Yugoslavia and NATO, and the
Security Council Resolution 1244, adopted on June 10, which says
"all Member States should bear in mind the authority of the
Security Council in the maintenance of the peace and security in
the world and respect for the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
KLA has committed such criminal activities as kidnapping,
burning down civilian houses and murdering, which led to the
continuous worsening of the security on the ground in Kosovo, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade adopts "a wait-and-see" approach towards what the U.N.
and the peacekeepers is going to do in Kosovo because the peace
process is just at its initial stage, he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Veterans Secretary to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Veterans Affairs Secretary
Togo West Jr. confirmed Friday that he will step down before the
Clinton presidency ends.
</P>
<P>
"I do not anticipate serving till the end of the
administration," West said.
</P>
<P>
West, who plans to return to private life, refused to say when
he will resign, but he told reporters he will stay through fiscal
year 2000 ending September 30.
</P>
<P>
West has been under criticism from veterans' groups and under
fire for his handling of travel funds and for not pushing the
administration to increase budget for the Department of Veteran
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Senator Cristopher Bond, chairman of the Senate Appropriations
subcommittee that oversees the Department of Veteran Affairs,
raised allegations of possible mismanagement at the department at
a congressional hearing in April.
</P>
<P>
"We have heard numerous allegations about waste, excessive
travel expenditures, the hiring of limousines, chartered aircraft,
lavish parties... and other actions which may or may not be
illegal but certainly raise eyebrows," said Bond, who is
investigating West's use of travel funds.

<HEADLINE> British Mint Goes Commercial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Britain's 1,000 year-old Royal Mint
can now make jewellery as well as coins, as it is to be given
greater freedom to operate commercially.
</P>
<P>
The move by the Government will mean that the Mint, which makes
the nation's coins, will be able to expand into jewellery
manufacturing and other non-coinage business.
</P>
<P>
Also, it will be able to licence its brand name, as well as
entering into joint ventures with private companies or overseas
government organisations.
</P>
<P>
British Treasury officials said that the government had an
"open mind" on whether the Mint, based at Llantrisant in Wales,
could eventually be privatised.
</P>
<P>
"The new arrangements are very desirable and if you did want to
privatise it, the government has an open mind about that," BBC
quoted a spokesman as saying, adding that "they would be very
beneficial."
</P>
<P>
Economic Secretary Patricia Hewitt said the changes would
enable the Mint to go out and win more business.
</P>
<P>
"These measures will enable the Royal Mint to update the way it
is run into today's modern commercial and business world and make
it fit for the 21st century," she added. "It will also ensure that
the Royal Mint makes the best possible use of the opportunities it
faces.
</P>
<P>
"That includes the ability to offer an extended range of goods
and services and to make fuller use of its expertise and
capacity," she said. "The world coinage market is increasingly
competitive. The Royal Mint must be ahead and stay ahead of the
game if it is to thrive. We cannot stand still if we want to
maintain its position at the forefront in the global marketplace."
</P>
<P>
The union representing most Royal Mint workers welcomed the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
John Sheldon, joint general secretary of the Public and
Commercial Services union, said "This is a victory for common
sense. The Mint is a public sector success story, delivering
profits back to the exchequer every year."

<HEADLINE> Security Council Hails Positive Developments in Libyan  Compliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Friday issued a presidential statement, extending a welcome to the
positive developments in the Libyan compliance with relevant
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The statement came at the end of the Security Council's
day-long closed-door session to consider a report by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council welcomes the positive developments
identified in the report and the fact that the Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya has made significant progress in compliance with the
relevant resolution," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the 15-nation also welcomes the Libyan
commitment to implement further the relevant resolutions in order
to meet all the requirements.
</P>
<P>
"It encourages all parties concerned to maintain their spirit
of cooperation," the statement said, adding that the Security
Council "reaffirms its intention to lift those measures
(sanctions) as soon as possible" under relevant Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions were suspended in early April when Libya
handed over tow suspects of the Lockerbie bombing, killing a total
270 people in December 1988, for trial in the Netherlands under
Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
The Libya's U.N. ambassador, Abuzed Omar Dorda, Tuesday
demanded that the United Nations lift sanctions against the North
African country, saying "the politicization of this legal dispute,
in whatever form or by anyone, is not acceptable."
</P>
<P>
Annan said in his report that Libya had promised to cooperate
with a trial of the two suspects and pay compensation if the two
were convicted. But he said the United States needed more evidence
before it would agree to lifting the sanctions, mainly because the
trial of the two suspects will not start before February next
year.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo War Shows Need of Russia For Europe, Dini Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
said here Friday that the Kosovo war showed one important lesson
that Russian involvement in European decision-making system was
vital for European Union security.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference on Kosovo in Rome, Dini stressed the
important part played by the Group of Seven Western nations plus
Russia (the G-8) in resolving the Balkan conflict, saying that
this demonstrated "how wrong it would be to try and keep Russia
out of European policy-making."
</P>
<P>
"Precisely because a totalitarian regime no longer rules in
Moscow, it would be a mistake to relegate the Russian nation to
the margins of the continent, ignoring security interests and the
importance of its participation in decisions affecting Europe,"
Dini continued.
</P>
<P>
He described Russia and Serbia as the "two unfortunate nations
of post-Communist Europe, traumatized and with their pride wounded
by the fall of their political system, which they also imposed on
others."
</P>
<P>
Dini also said that, while it was right for NATO to "intervene
in emergency situations," the organization to deal with such cases
was ideally the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"It is inevitable that, some time in the future, every lasting
peace agreement is brought back to the logic universally accepted
by the UN," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The last lesson to be learned from Kosovo is that we need to
push ahead with UN reforms, to make it more effective and
representative, especially the Security Council, an agency
primarily responsible for international peace and stability," Dini
said.
</P>
<P>
Dini concluded that while the US had been crucial to winning
the conflict, it was "up to Europe to create peace," observing
that "the war has had the effect of accelerating and modifying the
horizons of European construction, revealing the fragility of a
system only built upon economics and a common currency."

<HEADLINE> Italian Trade Unions Refuse Cut in Pension System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Italy's three main trade union
federations Friday expressed their unbending refusal to consider
cuts in the pension system before 2001, indirectly responding to
calls from the country's central bank and employers.
</P>
<P>
Giving their views on the government's 2000-2003 economic
planning document which approved last week, trade union leaders
also criticized the government for lack of vision in promoting
economic development in poor southern regions.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Italy governor Antonio Fazio told parliament Thursday
that pruning the country's generous pension system was necessary
to be able to reduce taxes and ensure solid economic growth in
coming years.
</P>
<P>
Although the government appears to want to make cuts in welfare
spending, and in particular in pensions, it is hindered by a
previous administrations agreement with unions.
</P>
<P>
Unions agreed to pension reforms in 1997 on the condition that
they would not be touched again until 2001.
</P>
<P>
"We're not opposed to reworking the internal balance of welfare
spending," said Sergio Cofferati, one of leaders of trade unions.
</P>
<P>
He said that "what is unacceptable is to return to this subject
before the scheduled date and with the idea of making cuts."
</P>
<P>
"Ill-considered measures on spending can provoke ruptures which
then make policies in other areas difficult to implement," he
warned.
</P>
<P>
Cofferati and other union leaders also criticized the
government's economic plan for only partially satisfying the
objectives and strategies set out in the "Social Pact" for jobs
signed by labor, employers and the government earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Greek, Albanian Foreign Ministers Meet in Athens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou on Friday met with his visiting Albanian counterpart
Paskal Milo to discuss the Albanian illegal immigrants and
cooperation between the two countries in the field of economy as
well as in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after their talks, Papandreou said that the
deportation by Greece of Albanian illegal immigrants should no way
be related to the immigrants legally living in Greece.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that Albanians recently expelled from Greece
had not followed the legalization procedures introduced last year.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou said that cooperation between the two neighboring
countries would include initiatives regarding infrastructure
projects, in the framework of the Balkan stability pact.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation would involve Greece's development aid to
Albania, natural gas and infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
While describing the bilateral relations as "excellent," he
announced that Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis would visit
Albania on August 24.
</P>
<P>
Milo, who arrived here earlier Friday for an official visit,
said that his conclusion after the Athens talks was that the Greek
government had full understanding on the issue of Albanian illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that Tirana was doing its utmost to restore order
and improve security in southern Albania where a large number of
ethnic Greek are living in.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that if the two countries persisted with the
differences, they would distance the prospects for cooperation in
the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also adopted a joint communique which
reafirms the significance the two countries attributed to
improving infrastructures in southeastern Europe and their mutual
interest in promoting the plan for a Dalmatian highway, in which
other interested parties would be invited to participate.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Milo also met with Greek premier Simitis,
Greek Parliament President Apostolos Kaklamanis and Greece's
Alternate Foreign Minister Yiannos Kranidiotis.
