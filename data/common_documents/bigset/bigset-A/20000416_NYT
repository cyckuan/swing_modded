SOWARD GOES TO JAGUARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC receiver R. Jay Soward is all about speed, and
last winter was no exception. Soward spent four months running
furious 40-yard dashes for NFL scouts _ and running away from his
past. Inconsistent and temperamental with the Trojans, he knew the
fastest way into the first round of Saturday's NFL Draft was to
show maturity and dedication during the scouting process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew NFL people had questions about my work ethic,'' Soward
said. ``So I made sure to prove them wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward made a believer of Jacksonville, which selected him with
the 29th pick of the first round. He'll play for one of the
league's best coaches, Tom Coughlin, and alongside one of the top
quarterbacks, Mark Brunell. He'll join a Super Bowl contender in a
warm-weather city with a former Trojan, tackle Tony Boselli, on the
offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony and I don't know each other personally, but we know of
each other and we've sent messages through other people,'' said
Soward, who joined USC guard Travis Claridge (second round) as the
only local players selected Saturday. ``I'm thrilled about playing
with him. The draft went the way I wanted. It was a great day.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5-9 and 177 pounds, Soward is small and not very strong.
Buthe has blazing speed, he can return punts and kicks, and he has
a knack for big plays. During practices for the Senior Bowl and the
East-West Shrine game _ and at the important NFL Scouting Combine
in February _ he was disciplined, hard-working and humble. He ran
precise routes and eliminated the drops that plagued his USC
career. He also ran a blazing 40-yard dash (4.32 seconds, he said)
during a personal workout for Coughlin at USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of the matter is that it's impossible to replicate
speed like his, and it's hard to find someone with the double
ability to be a returner and a receiver,'' said Soward's agent,
Leigh Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing standing between R. Jay and going even higher
(in the first round) was a question about his work habits. But he
handled the scouting process beautifully. The entire procedure
consisted of him being reliable. He really dedicated himself, and
he did a terrific job. He went a long way towards restoring himself
as a first-round pick.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward scored 23 touchdowns and averaged 16.6 yards per catch at
USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted more playmakers,'' Coughlin told ESPN. ``We felt
like (Soward) was a key acquisition.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville was one of the teams interested in Claridge, who
instead went to Atlanta with the sixth pick of the second round
(37th overall). Claridge played guard for three years at USC, then
switched to tackle for his senior season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Falcons asked me what I wanted to play,'' Claridge said.
``I told them I'd play whatever position would get me on the field
the fastest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little surprised about Atlanta. I had a lot of
indication that Jacksonville would take me, but they took R. Jay
instead.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA receiver Danny Farmer, expected to go in the middle rounds,
was not drafted Saturday. He'll probably be selected this morning
in either the fourth or fifth round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny's only problem was he was compared to (Denver's) Ed
McCaffrey,'' said Steinberg, who also represents Farmer and
Claridge. ``There's a tendency to stereotype some receivers as big
and slow, but Danny ran well in individual workouts.''

DODGERS RUN OUT OF GAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It finally caught up to them -- the two months of
spring training, the cross-country road trip into Montreal and New
York, and the San Francisco series made longer by the suspended
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were due for a letdown, and although Gary Sheffield
and Eric Gagne did their best to delay it, it was unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Taubensee's career-high-tying four RBI, coming on a home
run and double, offset Sheffield's three-run homer and lifted
Cincinnati to a5-4 victory before 51,179.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us probably slept too much last night trying to
regroup,'' manager Davey Johnson said. ``It was still a heck of a
well played ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers entered the game having won five in a row and
batting .276, third-best in the league. Sheffield had hit in all
previous 10 games this season and 16 in a row dating back to Sept.
25. His fifth-inning three-run shot off starter Denny Neagle
extended that.
</P>
<P>
   But in the first eight innings Saturday, the Dodgers managed
just five hits against four Reds pitchers, including just one
between the sixth and eighth. Sheffield's shot was the only hit in
nine at-bats for the 3-4-5 hitters, to go with five walks.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers awoke in the ninth with two hits and a run off Danny
Graves, and they had Devon White at third with two out. But Graves
earned his -- and the team's -- first save by getting Shawn Green
to ground out (ending his nine-game hit streak) and, after walking
Sheffield, retiring Eric Karros on a grounder to second.
</P>
<P>
   The winning pitcher, Scott Williamson (1-1), struck out two of
the three batters he faced. He relieved Neagle, who gave up four
hits with five walks and five strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Alan Mills (0-1) gave up two runs on Taubensee's
seventh-inning double.
</P>
<P>
   Taubensee is showing Mike Piazza isn't the only catcher who can
bat cleanup. He batted fourth a team-high 64 times in 1998 and,
although never batting in that spot last year, hit 21 homers and
drove in 87 runs, both highs for a catcher since Johnny Bench's 24
homers in 1980 and 109 RBI in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a pretty good clutch hitter,'' Reds manager Jack McKeon
said.``He's one of the guys who gets hot for a week or two and
carries you.''
</P>
<P>
   This type of performance was just what the Reds needed, since
Ken Griffey Jr. had been driving in most of the runs. Griffey had
14 RBI in eight games but failed to drive in a run for the second
straight game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow, (Taubensee) will be there, I know that,'' McKeon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Dodger not showing signs of fatigue was starter Gagne,
which was understandable since was in Albuquerque until Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He originally was slated as the team's fourth starter, but after
going 0-2 with a 15.63 ERA this spring, Gagne found himself
demoted. He threw six shutout innings in his one start for the
Dukes, then got the call after Kevin Brown broke a pinky.
</P>
<P>
   His performance Saturday is what the Dodgers wanted from him all
along: five innings, three hits, two earned runs, three walks and
five strikeouts. His one blemish was a first-inning home run to
Taubensee, who became just the eighth player to homer into the
second deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing was to go back to Triple-A,'' Gagne said,
``just to my thinking back together, get positive and throw the
ball like I could.''

SHAQ'S ABSENCE PROVES HIS WORTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's a good thing Shaquille O'Neal sat out a game
this week, because without him, everyone got to see how closely the
Lakers resemble... the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who doubted that O'Neal is the hands-down winner for Most
Valuable Player should have been convinced by how average the
Lakers looked without him.
</P>
<P>
   He is on his way to becoming the first NBA player since Wilt
Chamberlain to lead the league in scoring and rebounding since the
1962-63 season. He even might have won the award if Michael Jordan
had played this season. Well, let's not go too far.
</P>
<P>
   With O'Neal leading the way, let's hand out some season-ending
hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Most Valuable Player: O'Neal. Not even a close call. Other
players had stellar seasons, like Utah's Karl Malone, Miami's
Alonzo Mourning and Detroit's Grant Hill, but they were all playing
in O'Neal's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie of the Year: Elton Brand, Bulls. No one gave Brand much
respect in November, but he's left every other rookie in the dust,
capped off by his 44-point effort this week. He's the only rookie
averaging a double-double (19.5 points, 10.0 rebounds) and he's
been far more consistent than the two runners-up: Rockets point
guard Steve Francis and Clippers forward Lamar Odom.
</P>
<P>
   Coach of the Year: Phil Jackson, Lakers. OK, maybe he wouldn't
be doing much if he coached in Vancouver, but the guy knows how to
handle pampered superstars. He found a way to get Shaq and Kobe to
co-exist, and has even managed to keep Glen Rice in line. It's a
far cry from last year's finger-pointing and underachieving.
</P>
<P>
   The shame of awarding Jackson this honor is that it overlooks
what Doc Rivers did in Orlando. He's got little real talent but has
somehow turned the Magic into a playoff contender. Utah's Jerry
Sloan deserves honorable mention for keeping the Jazz among the
NBA's elite, even though the team was written off for being too
old.
</P>
<P>
   Sixth Man: Rodney Rogers, Suns. Let's see, he was 35 pounds
overweight last season with the Clippers but has resurrected his
career in Phoenix. What changed? Probably the fact he joined a
first-class organization dedicated to winning. Nah, that couldn't
be it.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Jerome Williams gave the Pistons a boost but wasn't as
consistent as Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Most Improved Player: Dirk Nowitzki, Mavericks. The German
wunderkind finally lived up to his hype this season (17.8 ppg),
although not in time to save Don Nelson's job. He has become a more
talented version of Toni Kukoc, although he's too soft defensively.
</P>
<P>
   Others deserving consideration were Detroit's Jerry Stackhouse
and Vancouver's Michael Dickerson.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive Player of the Year: Alonzo Mourning, Heat. They play
defense in this league? Mourning leads the NBA in blocked shots,
even though he's a 6-9 center. Seattle's Gary Payton remains the
best defensive guard, but he doesn't take the physical beating
Mourning withstands on a nightly basis.
</P>
<P>
   Executive of the Year: Glen Grunwald, Raptors. He convinced
Charles Oakley to re-sign last summer, didn't trade Tracy McGrady
during the season and didn't fire coach Butch Carter. All of those
moves make the Raptors a lot more than Vince Carter, and gives
Toronto a great chance to win at least one round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Truth patrol: Charles Barkley debuted his new Internet talk show
this week on Nike.com, complete with studio and guests.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for Barkley to show why he was one of the
most refreshing voices in the NBA. Here's a sampling:
</P>
<P>
   On Indiana coach Bobby Knight: ``I just want him to grab the
wrong person one day. I would pay a million dollars for him to grab
me. Then, I'd beat him to a pulp.''
</P>
<P>
   He blamed NBA commissioner David Stern for the decline in
television ratings: ``He's over-marketed the league. He's got too
many young players who aren't ready for prime time.... The league
has made a star out of every player who thinks he can play. Vince
Carter is a nice kid and has a lot of talent. But NBC can't make
him Michael Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   He criticized the league for being too happy to select Carter
for the Olympic team after Tom Gugliotta was injured. ``Stern did
cartwheels when Gugliotta hurt his knee 'cause he could put Carter
on the team. That noise y'all heard wasn't MIR (the Russian space
station) crashing. That was the league office in New York cheering
when poor Tom went down.''
</P>
<P>
   Bold move: Paul Westphal's ``Mr. Nice Guy'' image took a hit in
Seattle, but earned him a lot more respect as a coach, after he
benched starters Vin Baker, Brent Barry and Ruben Patterson before
this week's game with Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal inserted second-year players Rashard Lewis and Shammond
Williams and someone named Lazaro Borrell into the Sonics' lineup.
Seattle promptly went out and beat the Timberwolves by 27 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just lost nine of 11 and I thought we needed to shake
things up,'' Westphal said. ``Vin's been taking a lot of criticism
and he hasn't been playing up to his expectations or anybody
else's. So sometimes if you change things, it might make a
difference and that's what we tried to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker did his best to hide his displeasure over being benched,
especially after a blowout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect coach (Westphal),'' Baker said. ``The thing with me
is I'm a team player. It's more disappointing to me the way I've
been playing. But I'll be back in a couple of days. I'm not worried
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   No hope: The embarrassment known as the Clippers finally made
the cover of Sports Illustrated, under the headline ``The Worst
Franchise in Sports History.''
</P>
<P>
   A fan of the article was former Clipper Rodney Rogers of the
Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true,'' Rogers said. ``The owner (Donald Sterling)
doesn't care. It's a hobby for him, and it will never change.''

   (Phoenix) - It's not fair that I get to walk into Liz Duncan's
classroom at Valley View school and see the faces of her students.
</P>
<P>
   It should be you.
</P>
<P>
   But you're busy earning a living, and the kids want to say
thanks to someone before they leave. All I have to do to free up
some time is ignore the world's rotten news for a little while,
which is easy.
</P>
<P>
   It's lunch hour Friday when I arrive. Pizza boxes are stacked on
a table just inside the classroom. Before we get there, we can
smell the pepperoni and hear soda cans popping and the sounds of
seventh- and eighth-grade boys and girls laughing and talking.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan has met me near the princi pal's office at Valley View, a
small elementary school tucked away in the low desert of south
Phoenix, from which the skyscrapers of downtown have slipped below
the horizon like the masts of tall ships.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids are really excited,'' Liz says.
</P>
<P>
   She opens the door, and in a big, smiling chorus the students
say, ``Thank you!''
</P>
<P>
   You're the one who should be hearing this, not me. All I did was
tell you about them.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Duncan's class, a mix of main stream students and those with
physical and mental difficulties, was trying to collect enough
money to go on a field trip to Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The total cost was $27,000. The students had spent every weekend
and many school nights since Octo ber operating carwashes and
holding raffles and setting up bake sales.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, as the deadline for making their final payment ap
proached, the class was still $6,000 short.
</P>
<P>
   Liz called to tell me about her students and how hard they'd
worked and how great they were. And I told you.
</P>
<P>
   By 7 the morning the newspaper article appeared, 11 people had
telephoned Liz offering to help. By 8:30 a.m., there were 160
calls, and pledges of nearly $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long after that, they'd erased the $6,000 deficit, with
enough extra cash to pay an unexpected $700 surcharge on the tour
package.
</P>
<P>
   And it didn't stop.
</P>
<P>
   People at a trucking company baked 40 cakes, drove Liz and 10
students to a truck stop, set up a bake sale and even bought the
children and their teacher breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Some high school students in Scotts dale donated money for
souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   And more and more people tele phoned. Eventually, Liz Duncan's
class received enough donations to take three additional kids on
the trip, students who were new to the class.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Friday, their last day of school before the five-day
sight-see ing adventure in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many of you have never been on a plane before?'' Liz says.
Nearly half the students raise their hands. They'd be heading to
Washington early Sunday morning. To them, even the prospect of a
two-hour layover in Cleveland is exciting.
</P>
<P>
   All through lunch, they say how nice it was of people they've
never met to help them. They're polite and grate ful for all you've
done. They're happy, optimistic, curious about the world and still
under the wonderfully mistaken belief that the local com munity has
given them a gift _ when just the opposite is true.
</P>
<P>
   You'd know this if you could see them. As it is, the kids get
five days in Washington and I get an hour or so with them at Valley
View. Some snapshots are made before I leave of me and the kids and
their teacher. If I could, I'd send one of those pictures to each
of you with this note scribbled on back:
</P>
<P>
   Having a wonderful time. Wish you were here.

GALAXY BEATS DALLAS 2-1

<P>
   PASADENA -- Dallas couldn't of scripted a better scenario to end
its five-game losing streak against the Galaxy at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Burn, off to the best start in the MLS, faced a Galaxy cast
without five players, including starters Ezra Hendrickson (World
Cup qualifier), Simon Elliott (attending his sister's wedding), and
super-sub Sasha Victorine (U.S. U-23 Olympic training).
</P>
<P>
   But the Galaxy, boasting a bunch a reserves that would start on
many teams in the MLS, received a rare goal from rare starter Paul
Caligiuri early in the first half. Clint Mathis, playing
sensational the past few weeks, provided another goal in the second
half as Los Angeles held off the Burn, 2-1, Saturday in front of
16,244.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas striker Ariel Graziani provided a small scare, scoring in
the 83rd minute to cut the Galaxy's lead in half. He finished a mad
scramble in front of the net, but L.A. was able to hold on.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy, which had trailed in their previous two matches
against New England and Columbus before rallying to earn draws,
remained unbeaten (3-0-2) to wrestle the MLS' best record away from
Dallas (3-2-0).
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid talked about the importance of getting
ahead early.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the last things we said in the locker room was that we
were not going to play catch-up this week,'' said Schmid. ``We were
going to score the first goal, score again and make our goals stand
up and impact the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set a goal that we wanted six points in this homestand. We
got three tonight and we want three more next week (against
Miami).''
</P>
<P>
   Caligiuri may have provided the early spark, but Galaxy
defenders Robin Fraser and Greg Vanney handled the dangerous duo of
Graziani and MLS MVP Jason Kreis, limiting the two strikers to rare
chances in front of the net before Graziani's late strike, his
fourth of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Caligiuri, starting only his second game of the hear, handled a
beautiful free kick from Mauricio Cienfuegos to give the Galaxy a
1-0 lead in the 17th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos, taking a free kick a few yards past the penalty area
to the left side, caught Dallas by surprise when he decided not to
take a shot on goal. Instead, Cienfuegos made eye contact with
Caligiuri, and as Caligiuri cut in front of the net, Cienfuegos
sent a quick pass in front. Caligiuri one-touched it running away
from the goal with the outside of his foot, barely sneaking the
ball inside the near post for his first goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That play was something we work on in practice,'' said
Caligiuri. ``I couldn't believe they left the near space open
without a zonal player there. Mauricio put a great ball in there
and it was my job to finish it.''
</P>
<P>
   Caligiuri, who helped with the game tying assist against
Columbus last week, is making the most of his limited minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for everyone when they get their opportunities
to capitalize and contribute to the team,'' he said. ``It means a
lot personally, but it's important to win our games at home,
especially against teams like Dallas who you figure to meet again
down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas had a good chance to draw even in the 31st minute. Oscar
Pareja passed a ball back over his head in front of the Galaxy goal
for Chad Deering. Instead of looking for a shot, Deering headed the
ball across the goal area for Graziani, but the Argentine striker
headed his shot inches over the cross bar from a few yards out.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas had a few other chances to even the game, but the Galaxy
doubled its lead in the 65th minute as Mathis notched his third
goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   From just past midfield, Zak Ibsen sent a ball wide to Cobi
Jones. Jones, looking for cutters, spotted Mathis splitting two
Dallas defenders as he headed toward the goal. Jones hit Mathis on
the run and Mathis finished with a one-touch volley directly in
front of Dallas' net, freezing goalkeeper Matt Jordan, who had no
time to react.

 SYMINGTON CALM IN EYE OF STORM  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fife Symington has sat in a U.S. Bankruptcy Court while one of
Phoenix's top attorneys has branded him a liar and a fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Day after day, the former Arizona governor has endured the
pounding with remarkable composure; he has been combative when on
the stand and stoic when off. He has chatted and joked with friends
and reporters after each day's grilling. He has been unfailingly
upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Symington became belligerent only once: the day pension-fund
attorney Michael Manning closed in on him on the witness stand.
Symington stood up and vehemently defended his real estate deals.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with most of the scheduled testimony behind him, evidence
is stacking up against Symington. It's clear he provided a
seriously flawed financial statement to union pension fund managers
in 1990 who then gave him a $10 million loan for the Mercado
project in downtown Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   What's not clear is whether the statement made a difference.
Symington's attorney argues that fund managers weren't interested
in the numbers and would have made the loan anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The standard for Judge George Nielsen, who is expected to decide
the case by summer's end, is clear. Debts obtained through fraud
cannot be wiped out by bankruptcy. At stake is $18 million, the
total the loan debt has reached with interest.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the way Symington envisioned beginning the
millennium. A decade ago, he was Arizona's golden boy.
</P>
<P>
   He charged to the governorship on a quest to rescue his state
from the zany unpredictability of then-Gov. Evan Mecham.
</P>
<P>
   He pledged to guide government with the same steady hand he used
to build what seemed to be a thriving real estate business.
</P>
<P>
   VAST HORIZONS VANISH
</P>
<P>
   After he became governor in 1991, his political horizons seemed
so vast that a business partner offered to wipe out part of a debt
if Symington won the presidency this year.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of grooming himself for the White House, Symington
is on trial, accused of bankruptcy fraud, and waiting to hear if he
must face yet another trial in his federal criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, in the middle of his second term as governor, a federal
jury convicted him of criminal bank fraud and he resigned his
office in disgrace. An appeals court threw out his conviction last
year, ruling that a juror was improperly dismissed, and prosecutors
must decide soon whether to retry the case.
</P>
<P>
   Symington claims to be calm as he awaits the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally out of my hands,'' said Symington, whose business
and political careers spawned bookloads of stories about his fierce
desire for control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sitting back and obsessing about this,'' he said.
``The fear is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Symington admits now what he never would acknowledge before,
that he was often miserable during the federal investigation that
led to his indictment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't imagine what it's like getting up in the
morning and knowing that your friends are being slammed into the
grand jury,'' he said. ``I can't begin to explain the trauma that
Ann and I went through.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann, Symington's wife, is the anchor of a family that he says
has become stronger under the stress of the bankruptcy, conviction
and resignation.
</P>
<P>
   An heiress to the Olin chemical fortune, she also picks up much
of the tab for the multimillion-dollar attorneys fees generated by
her husband's legal woes.
</P>
<P>
   Family wealth made it possible for Symington to wait out his
appeal at culinary school. There, he learned the skills that have
made him an apprentice chef at Franco's Trattoria in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   REFUGE IN THE KITCHEN
</P>
<P>
   Symington, who loved the prestige and trappings of elective
office, says he has found refuge in the kitchen. He talks of his
comfort within the rich aromas, the clanging pans and simmering
sauces of the upscale restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Once the proud developer of $60 million office buildings, he is
now concocting $5.50 deserts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make a great tiramisu,'' he boasts. He offers a tip: ``Use
imported mascarpone cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   Symington has built for himself a new routine not often
available to bankrupt real estate moguls whose legal bills have
passed the $5 million mark.
</P>
<P>
   But then, not many can take a European vacation right before
they flee to the protection of Bankruptcy Court. Symington, who was
in his second term as governor at the time, shrugged off the howls
of criticism. He said the 1995 trip was a present from his wife for
his 50th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   He is a man born to privilege. His great-grandfather was
Pittsburgh steel baron Henry Clay Frick, who in 1892 survived an
assassination attempt during his union-busting crackdown on the
notoriously bloody Homestead Strike.
</P>
<P>
   That history sets Symington's trial against an ironic
background. It is the working class, the Teamsters and masons and
carpenters who own the pension funds, who are pursuing this
patrician son of Harvard in Bankruptcy Court.
</P>
<P>
   Symington claims to be baffled by their lawsuit. He says that
even if the pension funds prevail, they will have accomplished
little more than enriching Manning.
</P>
<P>
   He scoffed at Manning's contention that Symington is in line to
inherit a fortune following the death of an uncle.
</P>
<P>
   `NO POT OF GOLD'
</P>
<P>
   The cold-steel glare once familiar to political foes was back in
his eyes as he refused to answer questions about any coming
inheritance. He said only, ``There will be no pot of gold at the
end of the rainbow.''
</P>
<P>
   There certainly was no fortune in the Mercado, the Mexican
village-themed retail and office center that Symington touted as a
can't-miss addition to downtown Phoenix. Symington lost the project
to the real estate recession that claimed all his properties.
</P>
<P>
   The downturn began shortly before Symington's 1989 announcement
that he would run for governor. It overwhelmed him slowly, drowning
him in unmanageable debts on buildings with too few tenants.
</P>
<P>
   His most painful loss was the Camelback Esplanade, where the
Ritz-Carlton and two office towers are now thriving.
</P>
<P>
   Conceived in the mid-1980s, the Esplanade brought Symington his
first political notoriety as he orchestrated a glitzy,
spare-no-expense public relations campaign to get the project
approved by the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of his partners on that project, Jerry Hirsch, who
offered to forgive part of a personal debt if Symington had won the
White House by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Symington says that the covenant ``was completely Hirsch's
idea,'' and insists that he never really aspired to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch's attorney at the time takes a somewhat different view.
``I think Jerry viewed that as a sort of humorous statement about
Fife's ambition,'' Paul Meyer said. ``I think Jerry believed that
it was Fife's ambition to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   Symington says his only desire now is to extricate himself from
all legal entanglements and get on with his culinary career. His
fate in Bankruptcy Court depends on a legal standard different from
what prevailed at his criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
   A MORE DIFFICULT BURDEN
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors merely had to show that Symington
deliberately falsified financial statements that could have
deceived his lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Manning and the pension funds carry a more difficult burden.
They are attempting to establish not only that Symington was
deliberately deceitful in claiming a net worth of $12 million, but
also that the pension funds ``reasonably relied'' on that financial
statement when they made the loan.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Shull, Symington's bankruptcy attorney, says he will put the
pension funds' directors on trial when Manning's case is done. He
claims the funds did little more with the financial statement than
stuff it into a file. Beyond that, he claims the funds committed
themselves three years earlier to make the loan.
</P>
<P>
   With that defense, Shull says, Symington can endure Manning's
relentless assault on the 1990 financial statement, the focal point
of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Manning has laid siege to the statement. He has demolished
Symington's reckoning that his ownership share in 16 commercial
properties gave him a $12 million net worth.
</P>
<P>
   TRIAL A PLAY-WITHIN-A-PLAY
</P>
<P>
   Symington's apparent equilibrium during the assault, his
patrician insistence that all is well, is the substance of the
play-within-the play at Symington's trial.
</P>
<P>
   This is a trial, after all, about how Symington presented
himself during a time of withering stress. It is about allegations
that he constructed a facade of financial dynamism at a time when
his real estate was falling on his head.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, when Manning moved close to Symington's
witness-stand perch to direct his attention to a blow-up of the
financial statement, the former governor stunned the court with his
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to tell Judge Nielsen that his back was hurting,
Symington asked for permission to stand and stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen assented and Symington sprang to his feet. He locked his
hands defiantly on his hips and put a hostile edge on his responses
to Manning's questions.
</P>
<P>
   Manning, a former linebacker at Emporia State University in
Kansas, calmly held his ground. The strange tableau lasted for
about 10 minutes, until Manning moved back to the lectern and
Symington sat down.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, Symington was still energized by the
faceoff.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he had sought to accomplish in the confrontation, he
responded with the pugnacious delight he once carried into
political battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to sit there and have him glower down at me,''
he said. ``I'm going to stand up to him, and I'm going to look him
right in the eye, and we're going to go at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Symington expressed surprise when he was asked if the scene lent
credence to Manning's claim that he lied so that he could appear
worthy of a big loan.
</P>
<P>
   Symington said he indeed had back pain. He said it was the
lingering effect of tumbling into a street as he fought off a
knife-wielding mugger during a trip to Spain last year with his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   A PAIN IN THE . . . HIP
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't lie to the judge,'' Symington said. ``The truth of
the matter is that I have a sore hip. So, I needed to stand up and
stretch. But I also stood up to Manning. So, it was a two-fer.''
</P>
<P>
   Symington professes disdain for Manning and his interrogation,
which will continue next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just an effort to try to wear me down, and exactly the
opposite is happening,'' he declared to the usual end-of-day wedge
of cameras, recorders and notepads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly the opposite is happening. I feel like I'm getting
stronger.'' &QL;

Cleveland adds a Brown; Redskins get Arrington, Samuels
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW YORK _ The top portion of the NFL draft went according to form
until the New York Jets made the first of their record-setting four
No. 1 draft choices.
</P>
<P>
   On a Saturday when there were no first-round trades for the
first time in two decades, Oakland owner Al Davis pulled the
biggest surprise by using the 17th pick on Florida State kicker
Sebastian Janikowski.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a felony charge of trying to bribe a police officer,
Janikowski has a May 3 court date in Tallahassee, Fla., to see if
he can keep from being deported back to Poland, his native country.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Cleveland used the top pick on Penn State defensive
end Courtney Brown after he agreed to a seven-year contract that
could be worth $45 million, including a $10.1 million signing
bonus. The last year of the deal is voidable if Brown reaches
certain incentives that could push his total income to $57 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an emotional roller coaster,'' said Brown, who is
represented by Marvin Demoff and Houston's Sean Jones. ``It feels
so good to have everything said and done. Now I'm ready to play
some football.''
</P>
<P>
   With the second and third picks, Washington didn't rock the
boat. The Redskins selected Penn State outside linebacker LaVar
Arrington and Alabama offensive tackle Chris Samuels.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have the needs we had, it was very fortunate for
us,'' Redskins director of player personnel Vinny Cerrato said.
``The impact guys were there, and we really needed them. It fell
right into our laps.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time in history that teammates were the first
and second picks. Brown and Arrington joined Michigan State's Bubba
Smith (Baltimore) and Clint Jones (Minnesota) in 1967 and
Nebraska's Irving Fryar (New England) and Dean Steinkuhler
(Houston) in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no disappointment for me seeing Courtney going No.
1,'' says Arrington, who is represented by Houston's Carl Poston.
``I couldn't have been picked behind a better guy. He was the
natural pick for them, and he deserved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati listened to a lot of offers for the fourth pick, but
the Bengals drafted Florida State receiver Peter Warrick, the
highest-rated prospect, according to National Scouting Combine.
They plan to play Warrick opposite Darnay Scott and get rid of Carl
Pickens, assuming anyone will take him with his big contract and
bad attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Fireworks had been predicted when Baltimore made the fifth pick,
but the Ravens declined trade offers and selected Tennessee running
back Jamal Lewis, who ran the 40-yard dash in 4.38 seconds for
them. The Ravens had the second-best draft Saturday behind
Washington. With the 10th pick in the first round, they got the
receiver they wanted, Travis Taylor of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia and Arizona didn't pull any surprises by drafting
Florida State defensive tackle Corey Simon and Virginia running
back Thomas Jones in the next two spots.
</P>
<P>
   With the eighth pick, Pittsburgh considered drafting Marshall
quarterback Chad Pennington. But Bill Cowher's job is on the line
next season, and he doesn't have time to watch a quarterback
develop. By drafting Michigan State's Plaxico Burress, the Steelers
took a receiver in the first round for the second consecutive year.
If they don't have a quarterback who can throw the ball to Burress
and Troy Edwards, last year's first-round pick, it could be a
wasted pick.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago wanted the 6-foot-5 Burress because the NFC Central is
loaded with such tall receivers as Randy Moss (Minnesota), Keyshawn
Johnson (Tampa Bay) and Herman Moore (Detroit). But the Bears
didn't shed a tear by settling on New Mexico outside linebacker
Brian Urlacher, the best athlete in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Urlacher joins cornerback Thomas Smith and defensive end Phillip
Daniels, both of whom were signed as high-paid free agents, as the
latest addition to a Bears defense that should be vastly improved.
</P>
<P>
   After Baltimore took Taylor and the New York Giants selected Ron
Dayne, the Heisman Trophy-winning running back from Wisconsin, it
was time for the Jets to make their first pick.
</P>
<P>
   With Bill Parcells calling the shots for first-year head coach
Al Groh, the Jets chose Tennessee defensive end Shaun Ellis and
South Carolina outside linebacker John Abraham.
</P>
<P>
   With back-to-back picks, Parcells was able to strengthen the
defense for Groh, a longtime defensive coach. Once the Jets took
Ellis and Abraham, who were coveted by Green Bay and Denver,
respectively, very little went according to form.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers settled for Miami tight end Bubba Franks, and the
Broncos took California cornerback Deltha O'Neal. Franks should
replace Mark Chmura, the Packers' veteran tight end who was charged
with sexual assault last week. Even if Chmura is cleared or the
charges are dropped, don't expect him back in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Denver coach Mike Shanahan reached for O'Neal because starting
cornerback Dale Carter has been suspended for the season after
violating the league's substance-abuse policy.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco will be desperate for a quarterback if Steve Young
doesn't return, as is expected, but the 49ers used their No. 1 pick
on Michigan State outside linebacker Julian Peterson. After Oakland
took Janikowski, the Jets were on the board for the third time.
</P>
<P>
   With Vinny Testaverde the starter at quarterback and Ray Lucas
the backup, the Jets selected Pennington. He was the best
quarterback in the draft, and he will be given time to develop.
</P>
<P>
   With their last pick in the first round, the Jets solved a need
by taking West Virginia tight end Anthony Becht.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom portion of the opening round, there were a couple
surprises. Seattle thought Alabama running back Shaun Alexander was
too good to pass up. The Seahawks used their second No. 1 pick on
Wisconsin offensive tackle Chris McIntosh.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers also had two No. 1 picks. They solved their most
pressing need by taking Ohio State cornerback Ahmed Plummer in the
24th spot. Their defense got another boost in the second round when
they were fortunate to get Virginia Tech defensive end John
Engleberger, projected to be a first-round pick in almost every
mock draft, and Texas A&AMP;M cornerback Jason Webster.

   Fife Symington has sat in a U.S. Bankruptcy Court while one of
Phoenix's top attorneys has branded him a liar and a fraud.

   ``It's totally out of my hands,'' said Symington, whose business
and political careers spawned bookloads of stories about his fierce
desire for control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sitting back and obsessing about this,'' he said.
``The fear is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Symington admits now what he never would acknowledge before,
that he was often miserable during the federal investigation that
led to his indictment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't imagine what it's like getting up in the
morning and knowing that your friends are being slammed into the
grand jury,'' he said. ``I can't begin to explain the trauma that
Ann and I went through.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann, Symington's wife, is the anchor of a family that he says
has become stronger under the stress of the bankruptcy, conviction
and resignation.
</P>
<P>
   An heiress to the Olin chemical fortune, she also picks up much
of the tab for the multimillion-dollar attorneys fees generated by
her husband's legal woes.
</P>
<P>
   Family wealth made it possible for Symington to wait out his
appeal at culinary school. There, he learned the skills that have
made him an apprentice chef at Franco's Trattoria in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   REFUGE IN THE KITCHEN
</P>
<P>
   Symington, who loved the prestige and trappings of elective
office, says he has found refuge in the kitchen. He talks of his
comfort within the rich aromas, the clanging pans and simmering
sauces of the upscale restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Once the proud developer of $60 million office buildings, he is
now concocting $5.50 deserts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make a great tiramisu,'' he boasts. He offers a tip: ``Use
imported mascarpone cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   Symington has built for himself a new routine not often
available to bankrupt real estate moguls whose legal bills have
passed the $5 million mark.
</P>
<P>
   But then, not many can take a European vacation right before
they flee to the protection of Bankruptcy Court. Symington, who was
in his second term as governor at the time, shrugged off the howls
of criticism. He said the 1995 trip was a present from his wife for
his 50th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   He is a man born to privilege. His great-grandfather was
Pittsburgh steel baron Henry Clay Frick, who in 1892 survived an
assassination attempt during his union-busting crackdown on the
notoriously bloody Homestead Strike.
</P>
<P>
   That history sets Symington's trial against an ironic
background. It is the working class, the Teamsters and masons and
carpenters who own the pension funds, who are pursuing this
patrician son of Harvard in Bankruptcy Court.
</P>
<P>
   Symington claims to be baffled by their lawsuit. He says that
even if the pension funds prevail, they will have accomplished
little more than enriching Manning.
</P>
<P>
   He scoffed at Manning's contention that Symington is in line to
inherit a fortune following the death of an uncle.
</P>
<P>
   `NO POT OF GOLD'
</P>
<P>
   The cold-steel glare once familiar to political foes was back in
his eyes as he refused to answer questions about any coming
inheritance. He said only, ``There will be no pot of gold at the
end of the rainbow.''
</P>
<P>
   There certainly was no fortune in the Mercado, the Mexican
village-themed retail and office center that Symington touted as a
can't-miss addition to downtown Phoenix. Symington lost the project
to the real estate recession that claimed all his properties.
</P>
<P>
   The downturn began shortly before Symington's 1989 announcement
that he would run for governor. It overwhelmed him slowly, drowning
him in unmanageable debts on buildings with too few tenants.
</P>
<P>
   His most painful loss was the Camelback Esplanade, where the
Ritz-Carlton and two office towers are now thriving.
</P>
<P>
   Conceived in the mid-1980s, the Esplanade brought Symington his
first political notoriety as he orchestrated a glitzy,
spare-no-expense public relations campaign to get the project
approved by the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of his partners on that project, Jerry Hirsch, who
offered to forgive part of a personal debt if Symington had won the
White House by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Symington says that the covenant ``was completely Hirsch's
idea,'' and insists that he never really aspired to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch's attorney at the time takes a somewhat different view.
``I think Jerry viewed that as a sort of humorous statement about
Fife's ambition,'' Paul Meyer said. ``I think Jerry believed that
it was Fife's ambition to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   Symington says his only desire now is to extricate himself from
all legal entanglements and get on with his culinary career. His
fate in Bankruptcy Court depends on a legal standard different from
what prevailed at his criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
   A MORE DIFFICULT BURDEN
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors merely had to show that Symington
deliberately falsified financial statements that could have
deceived his lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Manning and the pension funds carry a more difficult burden.
They are attempting to establish not only that Symington was
deliberately deceitful in claiming a net worth of $12 million, but
also that the pension funds ``reasonably relied'' on that financial
statement when they made the loan.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Shull, Symington's bankruptcy attorney, says he will put the
pension funds' directors on trial when Manning's case is done. He
claims the funds did little more with the financial statement than
stuff it into a file. Beyond that, he claims the funds committed
themselves three years earlier to make the loan.
</P>
<P>
   With that defense, Shull says, Symington can endure Manning's
relentless assault on the 1990 financial statement, the focal point
of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Manning has laid siege to the statement. He has demolished
Symington's reckoning that his ownership share in 16 commercial
properties gave him a $12 million net worth.
</P>
<P>
   TRIAL A PLAY-WITHIN-A-PLAY
</P>
<P>
   Symington's apparent equilibrium during the assault, his
patrician insistence that all is well, is the substance of the
play-within-the play at Symington's trial.
</P>
<P>
   This is a trial, after all, about how Symington presented
himself during a time of withering stress. It is about allegations
that he constructed a facade of financial dynamism at a time when
his real estate was falling on his head.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, when Manning moved close to Symington's
witness-stand perch to direct his attention to a blow-up of the
financial statement, the former governor stunned the court with his
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to tell Judge Nielsen that his back was hurting,
Symington asked for permission to stand and stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen assented and Symington sprang to his feet. He locked his
hands defiantly on his hips and put a hostile edge on his responses
to Manning's questions.
</P>
<P>
   Manning, a former linebacker at Emporia State University in
Kansas, calmly held his ground. The strange tableau lasted for
about 10 minutes, until Manning moved back to the lectern and
Symington sat down.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, Symington was still energized by the
faceoff.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he had sought to accomplish in the confrontation, he
responded with the pugnacious delight he once carried into
political battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to sit there and have him glower down at me,''
he said. ``I'm going to stand up to him, and I'm going to look him
right in the eye, and we're going to go at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Symington expressed surprise when he was asked if the scene lent
credence to Manning's claim that he lied so that he could appear
worthy of a big loan.
</P>
<P>
   Symington said he indeed had back pain. He said it was the
lingering effect of tumbling into a street as he fought off a
knife-wielding mugger during a trip to Spain last year with his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   A PAIN IN THE . . . HIP
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't lie to the judge,'' Symington said. ``The truth of
the matter is that I have a sore hip. So, I needed to stand up and
stretch. But I also stood up to Manning. So, it was a two-fer.''
</P>
<P>
   Symington professes disdain for Manning and his interrogation,
which will continue next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just an effort to try to wear me down, and exactly the
opposite is happening,'' he declared to the usual end-of-day wedge
of cameras, recorders and notepads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly the opposite is happening. I feel like I'm getting
stronger.'' &QL;

RED SOX BATS GIVE MARTINEZ A BREATHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ This was the no-frills Pedro Martinez Experience for a
sellout crowd of 33,122 at Fenway Park Saturday afternoon. This was
not the IMAX theater, sensory overload version in which it's all
Pedro, all the time, in 360-degree Technicolor.
</P>
<P>
   That's not going to happen on occasions such as this, when the
Sox beat the Oakland A's, 14-2, after giving their ace a 7-1 lead
two innings into the game. Christmas, to borrow Mo Vaughn's
phrasing from a week ago, was canceled yet again.
</P>
<P>
   No tinsel. No ornaments. Just straight-ahead Martinez, who threw
an economical 94 pitches in seven innings in dispatching the A's,
perhaps the most patient hitting club in the majors but one that
had no choice but to swing at Martinez's offerings after falling
hopelessly behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a lead like that, you pretty much go out there and
throw strikes and make it happen,'' said Martinez, who ran his
record to 3-0 and lowered his ERA to 1.27 but with nine strikeouts
saw his streak of 10-K games end at 10. ``I got away with some
cheap outs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the view of the A's, Martinez shouldn't have gotten away with
hitting Miguel Tejada with a fastball in the back of the shoulder
in the third inning. There was little to suggest Martinez hit
Tejada on purpose. The two are buddies from the Dominican Republic,
said Martinez, who tipped his cap in apology to the A's shortstop
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``He dives a little (over the plate), but that pitch was
completely out of control,'' Martinez said. ``He's a good friend
from the Dominican; we hang out a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, sensitive to any suggestions that he throws at people,
bristled when someone wondered whether Tejada was a target because
he'd hit a home run off Martinez last August. ``You can write that
if you want,'' he said. ``I think we've done enough talking.''
</P>
<P>
   But privately, there was grumbling in the A's clubhouse because
no one, especially A's reliever Ron Mahay, retaliated against a Red
Sox hitter. The A's remember last season, when Martinez drilled A's
infielder Olmedo Saenz, and the closest the A's came to answering
back was when ``Nutty'' Buddy Groom threw a pitch behind Nomar
Garciaparra. Groom was gone after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Mahay, who was plucked off waivers from the Red Sox by the A's a
year ago last March, won a spot as the fifth starter coming out of
camp this spring. But his turn was skipped this go-round and his
hold on the job appears tenuous. Saturday, Mahay threw one pitch
under Brian Daubach's chin in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I moved some guys off the plate,'' Mahay told Oakland
reporters afterward, apparently unaware that some uniformed A's
were seething.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez hasn't lost in 14 appearances, including a dozen
starts, since falling to the A's and their prized young pitcher,
Tim Hudson, last Aug. 19. The rematch was Mike Tyson-Peter
McNeeley, as Hudson was chased with two outs in the second inning
after yielding six hits, four walks, and seven runs. Hit the rewind
button, and Hudson was Sox pitcher Brian Rose the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson, like Rose, was looking at flags blowing in his face.
That can play mind games with a young pitcher, said Sox center
fielder Darren Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure it does,'' he said. ``They know they can't make a lot of
mistakes when the wind is blowing out. I'm not a pitcher, but to me
you have to bear down and be more aggressive, get ahead in the
count, because when you get behind you're going to get hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really comes down to pitching. (Friday night), Brian was
struggling a little bit and today their guy was struggling. (Kevin)
Appier was on his A game (Friday), and Pedro had his A game today.
They also made some mistakes defensively (four Oakland errors) and
those turned into runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Daubach doubled home a run in the first and two more in the
second, an inning that began with Manny Alexander's triple and
climaxed with Carl Everett's two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Everett, serving as designated hitter, had four RBIs. He hit a
sacrifice fly in the first, blooped a double to start the Sox'
two-run sixth, and singled home a run and scored in the Sox'
three-run seventh. Everyone in the Boston lineup scored at least
one run, on an afternoon that began with Trot Nixon bunting on his
own in the first inning after Jose Offerman hit a leadoff single.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, you don't see Trot bunting in the first inning,''
said Daubach, who has been on base six times in two games against
the A's. ``We tried to play for one run, and we scored seven.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when it was 9-2, there was Lewis, racing from second to
third on a ground ball to the left side, arriving safely with a
headfirst slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never let up,'' Lewis said. ``You have to play the
game the same way, start to finish. A seven-run lead in this
ballpark and the wind blowing out, anything can happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the reason why this team has success. Everybody takes
the same approach, no matter what.''

HEY, GET OUT OF THE ROAD!
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service

 BY LAURA TRUJILLO 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Three seconds after Troy Arthur rushes his firetruck out of
Station 25, a white Ford Escort zips in front of him, ignoring his
flashing lights and hollering siren.
</P>
<P>
   This is frustrating, but routine, Ar thur laments, moving on.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer cars pull to the side of the road these days when fire
engine lights flash by.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, it took 3{ minutes on average to get to most
emergencies in Phoenix. Now it takes almost five. Fire captains
blame rude drivers as well as growing gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In five years driving a Phoenix fire engine, Arthur has seen a
Toyota rear-end a firetruck, a Buick refuse to budge from its lane
and a Honda hug a truck's bumper to maneuver crowded streets.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix ranked third in the nation for dangerous driving
incidents last year and third again on a list of metro areas with
high aggressive-driving death rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel stressed for time, they don't want to give up
their spot. They think, `If I pull over and stop, five cars will
pass me,' '' says Capt. Mark Burdick of the Glendale Fire
Department. ``It's like the Indy 500.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix slowly has become a big city, Deputy Chief Bob Khan
says. ``People have just become insensitive to the job we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists try to understand what they say is a disappointing
trend. The lure of firefighters still exists, as they still lead
parades and wave at children.
</P>
<P>
   So, psychologists doubt the refusal to pull over is a lack of
respect.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that ``so many people have become absorbed with their
own psyches that they lose touch with what's going on outside of
their car windows,'' says Michael Hurd, a psychologist and host of
``Solutions _ Not Excuses'' on KFNX-AM (1100).
</P>
<P>
   ``People cut each other off on the road for no good reason,''
Hurd says. ``People don't hold the door for others, even when it's
easy or appropriate to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychology Professor Leon James says rudeness is learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grow up being driven around by aggressive drivers,'' says
the road rage expert at the University of Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   So, firetruck engineers or drivers must learn to anticipate
motorists who don't stop.
</P>
<P>
   It's frustrating, firetruck engineers say, to see drivers who
forget what to do when they hear the sirens, such as those who pull
to the center turning lane or who don't pull to the right and stop.
Or those who, in their insulated worlds of rolled-up win dows,
air-conditioning and loud ra dios, don't hear the sirens.
</P>
<P>
   Even Burdick, the fire captain, ad mits singing to the radio,
then spying a firetruck in his rearview mirror, lights and sirens
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's embarrassing,'' he says, noting that he had a bumper
sticker identi fying himself as a firefighter on his car.
</P>
<P>
   But what really upsets him are people who simply refuse to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I`ll have my lights on, stopping at a red light and the cars
with the green will take off. I'm there, 30,000-some pounds with a
siren and lights, and they go in front of me,'' Arthur says. ``It's
like they just see an open lane, they take it. They don't care.
Every body's in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   Burdick says, ``You pull up, and people just look at you. It
flabber gasts you. It's almost like a chal lenge, and you can't
stop and yell at them. You have to get to your call.''
</P>
<P>
   Police, who say people still pull over for them, can cite
drivers who fail to yield, but it's rare that they catch them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's usually, I guess you might say, the people in the higher
income brackets, the Mercedeses. I don't want to sound
inappropriate,'' says Scott Frey, a captain for Rural/Met ro's
Station 16 in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   But 13 years on a Phoenix firetruck has taught Capt. Elby
Bushong that everyone is in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will plead innocence,'' he says. ``But in my mind . . .
it's more important for them to get where they're going than for us
to respond to someone's tragedy.''

Diehard 500 winner could be anyone
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
TALLADEGA, Ala _ For the first time in the 52-year history of
NASCAR, a season has started with eight different winners in the
first eight races.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFL, they call that parity. In NASCAR, they call it
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt will try to become the first driver in 24 years
to win three consecutive races at the Talladega Superspeedway when
he starts the Diehard 500 today from the second row.
</P>
<P>
   But the trend for the 2000 season would appear to be against
Earnhardt _ the restrictor-plate racing master _ since no driver
has won twice so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   It has revitalized a series dominated by a select group the past
few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to believe this is good for the sport,'' said Ken
Schrader, a driver who hasn't won since 1991. ``It's definitely
better than seeing the same person win every week.''
</P>
<P>
   In the previous three seasons, four drivers _ Jeff Gordon, Dale
Jarrett, Mark Martin and Jeff Burton _ accounted for 64 percent of
the victories. In 1998, Gordon and Martin combined to win 20 of the
33 races.
</P>
<P>
   If you picked one of those drivers, you had a better than 50-50
chance of being right, but not this year. The series already has 18
drivers in 2000 who have posted at least one top-five finish.
</P>
<P>
   The parity also is showing up in qualifying. On Friday at
Talladega, Jeremy Mayfield became the seventh different driver to
win the pole this season. But Mayfield is not one of the eight
drivers who have won this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of drivers out there capable of winning that
haven't won yet,'' Schrader said. ``It shows how competitive things
are now. Most teams out here are capable of winning on a good
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the non-winners this season are Gordon, Tony Stewart and
Terry Labonte, three drivers who accounted for 11 wins last season.
Other drivers capable of winning this year include Mike Skinner,
Mayfield and rookie Matt Kenseth.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrick Motorsports, with Gordon, Labonte and new team member
Jerry Nadeau, has won four of the last five Winston Cup
championships and taken the checkered flag in 55 races. But the
prestigious team has yet to win this season.
</P>
<P>
   That could mean the 2000 season is well on its way to setting a
NASCAR record for most winners in one season. Winston Cup had 14
different winners in three seasons of the modern era _ 1988, '90
and '91. The series had six winners after eight races in 1988 and
seven winners after eight races in 1990 and '91.
</P>
<P>
   The circuit would need seven new winners in the last 26 races
this season to set a record. Kevin Triplett, NASCAR's director of
operations, not only thinks that's possible, he believes it's
likely to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have some dominant teams, but there's more
competition now,'' Triplett said. ``We have 25 to 30 cars that are
capable of winning on any given day. I don't see how that's a bad
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Triplett was referring to how some NFL fans consider parity a
dirty word. Last season was a prime example when St. Louis and
Tennessee made it to the Super Bowl instead of the traditional
powers.
</P>
<P>
   But most NASCAR fans want to watch a race where as many drivers
as possible have a legitimate shot at winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``When one guy wins a lot of races, people start talking about
that guy winning too much,'' Triplett said. ``When you have eight
winners in eight races, people say there's no dominant team and
they wonder who is going to take charge. That situation generates a
lot of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that has helped even the field this season is a
decision NASCAR officials made after the Ford Taurus drivers
dominated the Daytona 500. NASCAR allowed the teams with the new
2000 model Chevrolet Monte Carlo to add two inches to the front air
dam.
</P>
<P>
   Things have balanced out since then with two victories for
Chevrolet, two for Pontiac and four for Ford.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fords still may have an advantage in a restrictor-plate
race. They took the top three qualifying spots and four of the top
five for today's event. Only Earnhardt, the man they say can see
air, breaks up the Ford show up front.
</P>
<P>
   A victory by ``The Intimidator'' would equal Buddy Baker's three
consecutive Talladega victories in 1975 and '76.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team really has come together,'' Earnhardt said. ``I think
we're finally starting to understand the aerodynamics of this Monte
Carlo. The Fords still are better and no one has won twice yet
(this year), but they better not write me off here.''

HOUSTON'S LOSS IS BOSTON'S GAIN 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ So, what exactly were the Houston Astros thinking when
they shipped Carl Everett to Boston in exchange for minor league
prospects Adam Everett and Greg Miller?
</P>
<P>
   Everett had three more hits and four RBIs in Saturday's 14-2
rout of the Oakland A's. In 10 games with the Red Sox, he's hitting
.444 with a team-high four homers and 13 RBIs. He's a 28-year-old
switch-hitting center fielder with speed who hit .325 last season
with 25 homers and 108 RBIs, playing half his games in the
cavernous Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   What were the 'Stros thinking? Season ticket-holders should
bombard the club switchboard and tell general manager Gerry
Hunsicker, ``Houston, we have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to cut pay,'' said Everett. ``But it's hard to
insult me. I let everybody have the benefit. I don't get
embarrassed or offended.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros should be embarrassed, and at long last perhaps there
is revenge for Jeff Bagwell. In the worst day of his professional
life, Uncle Lou Gorman traded minor leaguer Bagwell to the Astros
for journeyman pitcher Larry Andersen in 1990. It was the Sox'
worst deal since you-know-who was traded you-know-where for sheet
music to ``No, No, Nanette''!
</P>
<P>
   But now the Sox have pilfered Everett because the Astros
committed their cash to Messrs. Bagwell, Biggio, and Alou. And the
early reviews are boffo.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when the Celtics got Robert Parish? When the Bruins got
Anson Carter? Sometimes a Boston team picks up a talented guy who's
been suppressed elsewhere and blossoms in New England. Everett is
beginning to look like one of those players.
</P>
<P>
   As longtime coach of the Expos, Boston coach Tommy Harper saw
Everett evolve with the Marlins, Mets, and Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't play much in those early years and it was difficult
to tell,'' said Harper. ``Then in Houston, they gave him the
at-bats and you could tell he was coming on. He changed his
approach a little. He became better equipped to handle the offspeed
pitch. The first changeup we threw him in Montreal last year he hit
very far. I said, `We gotta change the book on this guy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Boston manager Jimy Williams employed Everett as designated
hitter Saturday. It was the second time he gave Everett a day to
rest his legs.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of Pedro Martinez's first Fenway start since the
1999 Octoberfest rout of Roger and the Yankees, fans were lined up
on Yawkey Way halfway to Van Ness Street at 9 a.m. Jimmy Fund
patient Brendan Smith of Beverly Farms fired a strike for the
ceremonial first pitch, and then Everett put the game out of reach
with a two-run second-inning double.
</P>
<P>
   Batting lefthanded against Oakland's Tim Hudson, Everett bonged
his first ball off the Wall in left. He was keenly aware that the
hit would have been a routine out in the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   From the left side, Everett has one of those classic inside-out
swings that enables him to utilize the Monster to left and
left-center. Fred Lynn and Wade Boggs made a living out there and
Carl Yastrzemski and Pete Runnels also took advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say I'm a pull hitter, but I'm not,'' said Everett.
``I'm an inside-out hitter. I try to hit inside the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he doesn't aim for the Wall during batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to hit the ball to shortstop in batting practice. I'm
the ugliest BP hitter you'll find.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse than Eddie Murray?
</P>
<P>
   ``Worse than Manny (Ramirez) in Cleveland,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox fans won't care. They come to see Everett hit in the
games and it's hard to believe what they're seeing. Everett is
already a favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear 'em, but I don't let it affect me in any way,'' he
said. ``I don't think it helps me positively or negatively. I just
like to play hard and you can see they enjoy it when you play hard.
These people support you whether you're winning or losing. In
Houston, they didn't support you even when you were winning.''
</P>
<P>
   He made a lot of friends with Sox fans in Fort Myers, Fla., in
spring training and found some familiar faces in the seats at
Fenway. He says his Opening Day commuting horrors are behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've felt good since the season started,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to see it getting any better than this. Red Sox fans
already are comparing him to the golden Lynn of 1975 and he seems
to like Boston more than a Kenyan marathoner.
</P>
<P>
   Revenge fo Bagwell?
</P>
<P>
   ``Baggy wants to come back here,'' said Everett.
</P>
<P>
   Great. Get Hunsicker on the phone.
</P>

UH narrows coaching search
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JERRY WIZIG &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The University of Houston men's basketball coaching search might
have reached its final three candidates.
</P>
<P>
   A source familiar with the process indicated Saturday that
Appalachian State's Buzz Peterson, Kent's Gary Waters and Ball
State's Ray McCallum appear to be in the final cutdown to hire a
successor for Clyde Drexler, who resigned March 30.
</P>
<P>
   None of the trio, all head coaches at Division I programs, was
available for comment Saturday. UH athletic director Chet Gladchuk,
who is conducting the search, declined to be anywhere near as
specific.
</P>
<P>
   Gladchuk on Saturday referred to his forecast of last week that
the new coach would be named by late this week. Gladchuk, who has
declined to name coaches already interviewed or viewed as serious
candidates, said he was ``not sure'' if the hire would be completed
any sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Also uncertain is the standing in the current process of UH
assistants Reid Gettys and George Walker, both of whom have applied
for the position and have met twice with Gladchuk.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, a former player at North Carolina, has led Appalachian
State to at least 21 wins in each of the last three seasons in his
four years with the Southern Conference school. He previously was
associate head coach at Vanderbilt and an assistant at North
Carolina State.
</P>
<P>
   Waters has been head coach at Kent, a Mid-American Conference
school, for four years after seven seasons as an assistant at
Eastern Michigan and reportedly toured the UH campus with president
Arthur Smith and other UH officials.
</P>
<P>
   McCallum's seven seasons at Ball State, also an MAC program,
have been marked by NCAA Tournament appearances in 1994 and '95 and
this past season. His team played in the National Invitation
Tournament in 1997 and '98.

FIRST-RATE EFFORT BY PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ They did the best they could, which is all
you can ask of an organization.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody will know for some time whether the players Bill
Belichick selected in his first day running the Patriots' draft
will turn out to be impact players, but this much can be said of
what he accomplished Saturday _ he got all he could from where he
was sitting.
</P>
<P>
   With no first-round pick there was little Belichick could
predict about what he would be facing when it came time for the
46th pick, but he was sure someone would be there he didn't expect
and he was right.
</P>
<P>
   Who was there was a 307-pound offensive tackle out of Hawaii
named Adrian Klemm, a player many teams felt would be a first-round
selection. The fact he was not doesn't reflect badly on him because
only three offensive linemen were taken in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day Belichick followed his draft board,
preferring to go with the best player available according to the
team rather than taking a running back right away. He was gambling
that somehow he could take care of that crucial matter later on.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick turned out to be right on both counts.
</P>
<P>
   First, he got a huge and athletic offensive lineman who could
start as a guard but be able to move to left tackle, the spot Bruce
Armstrong has filled so ably for the past 13 years. Then he got the
running back he wanted all along when Arizona State's J.R. Redmond
fell to the Patriots at No. 76.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond was Arizona State's offensive MVP the last three years
and rushed for 1,085 yards in 1999 despite being suspended for one
game by the NCAA in a bizarre cell phone scam. It led to Redmond
briefly marrying a woman who worked part time in the ASU football
department because she told him he could avoid any NCAA penalties
if he did.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage was annulled and Redmond went on to complete his
season in fairly strong fashion. He did well enough that many
scouting services had him listed as the fifth-best back in the
draft behind the big four of Jamal Lewis, Thomas Jones, Ron Dayne,
and Shaun Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   As things turned out, Trung Canidate and Travis Prentice were
taken ahead of Redmond as well, but his abilities as a receiver out
of the backfield, inside runner on first and second down, and as a
kick and punt returner made him particularly attractive and useful
to the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Had Belichick not landed a high-profile back he might have been
criticized for taking Klemm first, but when it came time to make
his first pick, Belichick took one look at his draft board and the
move he needed to make was clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of good players on the board at the time but
Adrian was clearly the top player we had on the board,'' Belichick
said. ``There was a big gap between him and the next one in value
on the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was clearly the highest-rated player on our board. For us,
he was the top value.''
</P>
<P>
   The same was true with Redmond. In fact, the Patriots were
talking with Redmond on the phone and preparing to take him in the
second round when it became clear Klemm would still be available.
Redmond was put on hold with the belief that he would be gone by
the time New England picked again.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, he was not and so the same situation existed
with Redmond that did with Klemm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to take Klemm but J.R. was the next consideration,''
Belichick said. ``We felt the value was there for Klemm. The same
was true with J.R. He was the clear choice (on the draft board). We
had him on the phone 20 minutes before we selected him.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the first day of the first draft of Bill Belichick's
second chance ended with his team getting the rights to two players
he believes can come in and help in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   If they do, he and his staff will have had an impact already on
the fortunes of the New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't, Belichick can still go to bed knowing he got all
he could out of the situation.

BABA ON TARGET IN OVERTIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Imad Baba took a cross pass along the right
side and all the Revolution midfielder could see in front of him
was the goal. He never saw the D.C. United goaltender Tom Presthus.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I shot it, I didn't even see the ball when I hit it,''
said Baba, who scored the winning goal in overtime in the
Revolution's 2-1 win Saturday &UR;  &LR; night at Foxboro Stadium. ``I just
heard it go off the post. I didn't know it went in until I saw it
in the other corner.''
</P>
<P>
   The pass came from forward Wolde Harris, with William Sunsing
touching the ball just before him. ``I was yelling and luckily
(Harris) handed it off to the right,'' said Baba, who scored his
second goal of the game in the 97th minute. ``I just wanted to hit
it on target. I didn't care where the keeper was. I just wanted to
get it on target.''
</P>
<P>
   Baba called the winning goal ``probably one of the biggest'' he
has ever scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the ball come to the other side of the goal, I was
in awe,'' said Baba. ``I heard my teammates and the crowd, it was a
great feeling, something you don't think will ever happen to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Baba registered the Revolution's first goal on a penalty kick in
the 72d minute when Sunsing got fouled in the box by United
defender Jeff Agoos. Baba wanted to take the shot and wasn't going
to allow anyone else to take it.
</P>
<P>
   He blasted a shot into the lower left corner, tying the game at
1-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that situation, I don't think anything but goal,'' said
Baba, who has three goals this season. ``For me, there's no die.
You have to score that, that's what you play for. When the ball's
hit, the goalie moves. Both of us moved at the same time. He
guessed right but I just hit it in the corner. You pick your spot
and hit it hard. Your main decision is before you even kick it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Revolution's first victory of the season, coming
before a home-opening crowd of 15,175.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a win with a lot of fans coming out to enjoy a good
soccer game and we gave them their money's worth,'' said Baba.
``Hopefully, we can just feed off this win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution didn't play well in the first half, but came on
strong in the second when United turned defensive-minded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to take advantage of the extra man,'' said Baba,
referring to the ejection of United's Judah Cook who received two
yellow cards in the first half. ``We wanted to attack them when we
had the chance. We needed a win and we wanted to win. We played
well all around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept playing our game, trying to get the ball inside with
some crosses. We were patient and it went all the way to sudden
death.''
</P>
<P>
   When Baba provided sudden victory for the Revolutiuon.

REVOLUTION UPEND UNITED IN OT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Revolution found some winning
combinations Saturday &UR;  &LR; night. They played with a man advantage for
64 minutes, found an offensive rhythm in a 3-5-2 alignment, and
took a 2-1 victory over D.C. United in golden goal overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Imad Baba converted a second-half penalty and drilled the
deciding goal in the 97th minute as the Revolution won for the
first time this season. It was also their first three-point victory
over United since July 20, 1996, and vaulted them into second place
in the Eastern Division with five points in five games.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution discovered an effective midfield mix in the
second half as they pressed forward to capitalize on the 33d-minute
expulsion of D.C. defender Judah Cooks. Mauricio Ramos moved to a
more central midfield role, where he took charge, actively calling
for the ball, commanding attention, directing traffic, and
distributing to the wings and through the middle. He ignited the
play on the winning goal, driving forward from the halfway line,
then flaring a pass to Ted Chronopoulos on the left wing.
Chronopoulos's cross ended up at the feet of William Sunsing, who
laid the ball off to Wolde Harris, who found Baba on the right
side. Baba, who had tied the game with a penalty kick in the 72d
minute, one-timed a hard drive into the far side of the net,
leaving goalkeeper Tom Presthus with no chance.
</P>
<P>
   Sunsing, who replaced Mike Burns in the 65th minute, enabled the
Revolution to play a five-man midfield and his dynamism and
unpredictability kept the United defense off balance.
</P>
<P>
   Seven minutes after entering the match, Sunsing drew a penalty
in a collision with Jeff Agoos. Harris held possession against
three defenders and threaded a soft ball into the penalty area for
Sunsing, who fell head-first after being bumped by Agoos.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Ali Saheli, who handed out seven cautions, six to D.C.
players, awarded the penalty. And Baba converted into the left side
of the net, easily beating Presthus.
</P>
<P>
   That goal energized the Revolution, who had held the lead in
only one game this season and have only eight regulation-time
victories in their last 37 matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first half, everyone was nervous, nobody wanted to make
a mistake,'' Revolution coach Fernando Clavijo said. ``I told
everyone to start releasing the ball quicker and play simple, go
forward and take chances. We took command in the second half. You
can say it was against 10 men but I've seen teams play better with
10 players.''
</P>
<P>
   D.C. United has won the Major League Soccer Cup twice at Foxboro
Stadium and entered the match with only one regulation-time loss in
nine games at the stadium. And United acted like the home team,
receiving a break when Cooks appeared to handle the ball in the
penalty area in the fifth minute.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th minute, United appeared to receive another break as
linesman Roger Itaya allowed play to continue as at least two
United players appeared to be offside, and Jaime Moreno easily
scored on a shot past Jeff Causey. Revolution defender Dan
Calichman went face-to-face with the linesman and continued the
discussion even after the kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   In the 33d minute, Cooks was caught out of positon on a
Revolution throw-in and again deliberately handled the ball. This
time, Saheli issued a second yellow card and an ejection.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the first half, Marco Etcheverry was omnipresent
with threatening touches and lethal free kicks, plus a 55-yard
attempt, into the wind, which Causey stopped with his chest.
Meanwhile, the Revolution displayed little poise offensively in the
first half, seldom making the incisive passes necessary to unlock
the D.C. defense.
</P>
<P>
   That changed in the second half as Ramos, who has been a close
friend and rival of Etcheverry since they were 8-year-olds in Santa
Cruz, Bolivia, took charge.

FORMER MAVERICKS STAR ROY TARPLEY BOUNCES BACK IN AN UNLIKELY
PLACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE MONTGOMERY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PERM, Russia _ Roy Tarpley's ninth-floor apartment is barren of
memorabilia from his roller-coaster career with the Dallas
Mavericks, except for one item.
</P>
<P>
   It's a video from the 1988 season, when Tarpley earned pro
basketball's coveted Sixth Man Award and helped propel the
Mavericks into the conference finals for the first time in team
history. Those were heady days, back before his career sank under a
fog of cocaine, alcohol and arrogant excess.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary is called ``Bouncing Back,'' a title that also
neatly encapsulates Tarpley's life here in Perm, a gray factory
town at the southern foothills of the Ural Mountains and a half a
world away from the glitz of the NBA and the bright lights of
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   These days, No. 42 from the Dallas Mavericks is No. 22 on the
Ural Great, a respected Russian professional basketball team. Five
years after he was bounced from the NBA for drug and alcohol abuse,
Roy James Tarpley Jr. is grasping for a rebound in a city that was
closed to foreigners until just 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been easy. The cultural differences are immense, the
language barrier foreboding. Tarpley was sidelined because of an
off-court injury, and coaches call his performance erratic.
Moreover, his salary _ he won't say how much _ is only a fraction
of the $26 million, six-year contract that he signed with the
Mavericks in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, say those who know him, this Roy Tarpley is not
the same wayward star who bounced in and out of jail and rehab
programs, skipped practices and ultimately became the first NBA
player in league history to be ejected twice in his career for
substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a happy man today,'' Tarpley said in an hourlong interview
recently, reflecting on his days in Dallas and his new life in
Perm. ``I know it sounds corny, but that's how I am today. I'm
corny. I'm tired of being so cool, you know what I mean, as far as
drugs and getting high. People, they ask me, `Do you get high or
something?' I say, `I'm 7 feet tall. That's high enough.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Roy Tarpley who rose from the bench two Wednesday nights
ago, six minutes into a much-anticipated game against a superior
Moscow team, bore a strong resemblance to old No. 42 of the 1988
Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   As a sellout home crowd of 7,000 waved light sticks and flooded
the stadium with a deafening ``Oo-RAL Grea-a-t,'' Tarpley sank a
basket three minutes after entering the game, then quickly
completed a free throw.
</P>
<P>
   His team lost, but Tarpley went on to compile a
``double-double'' that distinguished his Dallas days: Double digit
points (18, the second highest for his team) and double-digit
rebounds (13, the highest of either side).
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked like the old Roy,'' he beamed proudly after the game.
``This is the most I've played since I've been here.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarpley describes himself as ``older and wiser,'' a man who
prays every day, asking God to help him control his temper. He also
draws strength from his girlfriend, Calandra Campbell of Arlington,
who accompanied him on his journey to the edge of Siberia. Tarpley
calls her ``my backbone.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia, where vodka is a national institution and beer kiosks
never close, is hardly the best environment for someone with a
history of addiction. Teammates say that Tarpley drinks beer and
goes to nightclubs on road trips, but there has been no evidence
that his wildly unpredictable past is reappearing. He shows up
regularly for practices and gets along with other players and team
officials, all of whom know about his personal problems and
turbulent history in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   At 35, Tarpley is the oldest player on the team. Although he has
become an instant leader since joining nearly five months ago,
coaches say he has still not developed to full potential. He missed
nearly two months of play when he slipped on the ice and broke his
shooting hand.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, general manager Sergei Kushenko and coach Sergei
Belov both say they sense an inner turmoil in Tarpley, possibly a
lingering hangover from his Dallas days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a very lonely man,'' Belov said. ``He's very
important to our team, but we cannot say we're satisfied entirely
in his playing. He plays one game very well and another game not so
well. He is not so stable inside, and the slightest thing makes him
nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarpley acknowledges that he is often nagged by ``butterflies in
my stomach,'' whether he is playing basketball or just sitting
idly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a roller-coaster ride,'' he said. ``It just comes
and goes, going up and down _ maybe a couple of curves.''
</P>
<P>
   He grapples with insomnia and often stays up until dawn watching
American movies on the VCR. When he sleeps, he tosses and turns,
sometimes dreaming of confrontation on the basketball court. But,
at the same time, he also claims a personal contentment which he
says was lacking during his days of multimillion-dollar stardom.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have all the money in the world, you can have all
these people in your pocket coming at you from all angles and
directions and you can be the most miserable guy in the world with
all the money, the fame, the stardom,'' he said. ``I'm a lot
stronger now.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Tarpley believes he was treated unfairly by the
NBA and contends the league's testing program was an overly harsh
``invasion of privacy'' that produced distorted results. But does
he deny taking drugs?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to talk about it. That's my past. That's like
the president of the United States: `I tried marijuana once, but I
didn't inhale it.' Who hasn't grown up and tried a joint? Who
hasn't drunk a beer?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Tarpley also acknowledges that his downfall was
self-inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a lot of bad decisions. I felt, you know, that every
day was a party. Out all night with women and all that stuff just
caught up to me.''
</P>
<P>
   If he could take those 10 years back, he says, ``I'd have been
more serious about my life and my career. You never really miss
something until you don't have it.''
</P>
<P>
   What Tarpley has now is a new opportunity in a place he surely
never envisioned himself during his much-traveled childhood in New
York, Alabama or Detroit. He never read about a place called Perm,
even in geography books, and his only knowledge of Russia came from
Cold War-era newscasts or from the '60s James Bond thriller, From
Russia with Love.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural clashes erupt constantly. Slavic teammates, as well as
fans and townfolk, are still adjusting to an outspoken, 7-foot-tall
African-American who wears a mink coat and yellow suits, a gold
earring and a neatly trimmed Shakespeare-style beard.
</P>
<P>
   And Tarpley, in turn, says he might never adjust to the bleak,
six-month-long winters and drab lifestyle in his new city of
residence. Sometimes, he says, he confronts what he perceives as
subtle displays of racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the store and a guy bumped into me and looked at me
ugly, and I would ignore it,'' Tarpley said. ``You've got to be
really stupid or crazy to mess with a 7-footer.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared to other Perm residents, who scrape by on an average of
about $40 a month, Tarpley and other team members live a pampered
existence. Rookies make as little as $500 per month, but others
average around $100,000 per year, and some, presumably including
Tarpley, make far more. Tarpley and Campbell share a spacious
four-room apartment provided by the team, along with a chauffeured
Jeep Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
   But they long for the simple pleasures of America _ fast food, a
wide selection of trendy restaurants, friends who speak their own
language. Tarpley's Russian vocabulary hasn't evolved beyond ``da''
(yes) and ``nyet'' (no).
</P>
<P>
   ``The honest truth, I'm just bored,'' Tarpley said. ``It's OK.
I'm not going to say it's great. It's very hard and difficult to
stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the bigger cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg, which
boast a vibrant nightlife and Western-style amenities, Perm has
been to slow to break from its Soviet past.
</P>
<P>
   A working-class city of just more than 1 million, it was closed
to foreigners until 1989 because of strategic defense production.
For 17 years, until 1957, it was called Molotov, after a Stalin-era
foreign minister whose name inspired the Molotov cocktail. A statue
of Lenin still presides over the town square. And less than 100
miles to the east lies Perm 36, an infamous labor camp that
operated until 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Perm is also an unlikely breeding ground for one of Russia's
hottest basketball properties _ the Ural Great, founded just five
years ago by five young businessmen, all former classmates and
amateur athletes who jointly amassed a string of lucrative holdings
with the invasion of post-Soviet capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   The team's guiding force is Kushenko, the 38-year-old general
director who has sought top-flight players throughout Europe.
Belov, the coach, is a renowned athlete who led Russia's national
team to victory over the United States in the 1972 Olympics and
later was inducted into America's Basketball Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Under Kushenko, Ural Great boasts such NBA-style attractions as
comely cheerleaders, halftime contests and stylish ad campaigns, as
well as a roster of talent good enough to compete with top-flight
U.S. universities and European teams. Ural Great defeated the
University of Nebraska during a U.S. exhibition tour.
</P>
<P>
   Tarpley joined the team in November after beginning a comeback
in 1999, first with the Apollon Limassol in Cyprus, and then with a
first-division Greek team, the Dafni Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Ural Great needed a center, and Tarpley seemed ideal. Team
officials explored every good, bad and ugly detail of Tarpley's
life through meticulous research on the Internet and concluded that
his potential overshadowed the risk. Kushenko also saw something of
himself in Tarpley's past.
</P>
<P>
   When he was in his late 20s, Kushenko recalled, he drank
excessively and hitchhiked from place to place, with no ambition or
goal. Friends helped straighten him out, planting him on the road
to financial success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was down one time, too,'' he said, comparing himself to
Tarpley.
</P>
<P>
   Tarpley agreed to move from the warmth of the Mediterranean to
the heartland of Russia, but he quickly discovered that Ural Great
is a long way from the NBA. On his first road trip, the team
assigned him to a train compartment with a bewildered Russian woman
carrying a baby. The next leg of the trip was a five-hour adventure
over Russian roads, on a rented bus filled with smoke and exhaust
fumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz,'' Tarpley recalled.
``I wanted to click my heels together and say, `I want to go home.'
''
</P>
<P>
   The former Mavericks star has bonded with the only other
African-American on the team, Donnell Thomas, a 6-foot-5 native of
Chicago who played in New Zealand, Spain, Portugal and Holland
before coming to Perm in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy has been kind of a crutch for me and a kind of a mentor,''
Thomas said. ``And I've been kind of a crutch for him, so we've
been good for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   During a typical practice last week, Tarpley and Thomas stood
toward the side of the court as coaches explained the drills in
Russian, waiting patiently for a translation from an assistant
coach who speaks passable English. Russian team members say they
like and respect Tarpley but some feel uncomfortable with his brash
American-style tendency to talk back to the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   In the dressing room after last week's game against Moscow CSKA,
Tarpley openly grumbled when informed that team members were
expected to show up for photographers the following morning, a
scheduled day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``A day off is a day off,'' Tarpley said. ``We're seeing too
much of each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the discomforts, however, Tarpley believes his stay here
has demonstrated a resiliency and ``mental toughness'' that can
keep him on the court for another three or four years, regardless
of where he winds up. He has no desire to return to the NBA after
that ``mess with them.'' But he knows he wants to keep playing, and
he is guided by advice he once received from former Mavericks owner
Don Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `You can either be a rising star or a falling
star,' and that stuck with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Which one is Roy Tarpley?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no falling star,'' he said. ``I never look down on myself.
I keep my head up. We all learn from our mistakes, and I feel like
I have. That's why I have so much to give.''

REID'S CUP VISIT LEADS TO FULL PLATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ One of the endearing rituals of the Stanley Cup is that
every member of the winning squad is entitled to spend at least a
day at home with it over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto polishes it up, secures it in
its custom carrying case, and sends it out with a Hall
representative as protector/chaperone. The Cup has been all over
the world and has been known to be a real party animal.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Hall officials) like guys like me who are married,'' said
ex-Bruin Dave Reid, a member of the Dallas Stars last June when
they won the Cup. ``Some of the single guys, well, they maybe could
get in a little trouble with it. But the guy who brought it to my
house, he got a lot of sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid, pursuing another Cup this spring, this time with the
Colorado Avalanche, benefited by a slight scheduling snafu last
summer. Prior to it being shipped to his summer home in Ontario,
the Cup was delayed in Quebec en route from a visit with Guy
Carbonneau. The Hall rewarded Reid's patience by allowing him to
keep the Cup for two days instead of one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took it everywhere,'' said Reid, reciting an itinerary that
included the local police department, the Sears store, even the
garage where a longtime friend fixes his car. ``My wife's cousin
owns a golf course, and we took it there for a three-hour party.
It's just a great chance for everyone to see it, and mostly it's a
photo thing. You spend most of your time smiling, with one arm
around the Cup and the other around whoever it is next to you who
wants their picture taken.''
</P>
<P>
   On Day 2, Reid headed into Toronto, the Cup in the back seat of
his car, and trooped it around town _ a favor to his father, whose
business clients were eager to touch hockey's holy grail. At one
point, it became far more efficient to park the car and just walk
from office to office. So there was Reid, scooting from one street
to the next, from Bloor to Yonge to Adelaide, with hockey's most
cherished trophy hoisted high on his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were moving at a pretty good clip, so it wasn't like people
came running out of buildings to see it,'' said Reid. ``But people
we'd pass on the sidewalk, they'd stop and ask, `Hey, is that
really the Stanley Cup?' I mean, when you think about it, why would
someone be walking down the street with it, right? But I'd be there
saying, `Yeah, it's the Cup, all right.' And either people would
just stand and stare, or they'd say, `Nah, that's not the Cup.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The names of the Dallas Stars weren't etched into the Cup until
later in the summer. During the Christmas break, Reid finally got
to see his name on it, when the Hall let him bring it home for a
second visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just unbelievable to see your name there,'' said Reid,
who broke into the NHL with the Bruins in 1983-84. ``And it would
so great for it to happen to Ray (Bourque) now. I know he'd give up
all his Norris Trophies (five) for that. Anyone would. And for the
rest of us, that's all the more incentive to win it here, for Ray
to have that chance. We've talked about that since he got here,
maybe not to his face, but kind of behind his back. I don't think
he'd mind. Do you?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bourque's no longer in the Hub, but he's not forgotten in the
Bruins' pro shop on Causeway Street. According to shop boss Lauma
Cerlins, Bourque's No. 77 replica sweater in black and gold, at
$140 a pop, remains a very hot item. ``People come in and ask,
`When are you going to mark down the Bourque stuff?' '' said
Cerlins. ``And the answer is: Never. It's still selling great.''
The hottest non-Boston item in the pro shop is anything related to
the Avalanche, Boston's home hockey team now that Bourque wears his
No. 77 in Colorado. ``At one point after the trade, we sold out of
all Avs stuff,'' said Cerlins. ``We had to search high and low to
find some more hats.'' Avalanche sweaters sell for $75, but the pro
shop doesn't process custom orders _ either with number or name _
for out-of-town sweaters . . . As widely predicted, ex-Bruins coach
Brian Sutter walked the plank in Calgary last week, along with
general manager Al Coates. Sutter: ``I have nothing to be ashamed
of. None of our coaches have anything to be ashamed of. None of our
players have anything to be ashamed of.'' In fact, the Flames can
be proud they remained in a hunt for a playoff spot to the very
end, probably eight weeks longer than could be reasonably expected
given the lack of roster depth . . . Rumors continue that Mark
Messier will end up back on Broadway once the Canucks issue him the
$2 million that will buy out the last year of his deal. Don't bet
on Wrentham's Garth Snow being back in British Columbia either. His
deal calls for just under $2 million next season and the Canucks
won't want to pay that kind of money for a Felix Potvin backup . .
. It's still a long way to the Cup finals, but Avalanche captain
Joe Sakic is jumping around like a rookie and a first-round victory
over the Coyotes undoubtedly will earn him mention as the potential
Conn Smythe (playoff MVP) winner. Sakic won it when Colorado
clinched the Cup in '96. Only five players have been two-time
Smythe winners: goalies Patrick Roy and Bernie Parent; forwards
Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux and defenseman Bobby Orr . . .
Don't be surprised if ex-Bruin Andy Brickley ends up right back
where he belongs, working in a Bruins' broadcast booth. He could
even end up right back at Ch. 38 . . . The Coyotes have to hope
Sean Burke tightens up in their net. He allowed a couple of cream
puffs to get by him in Game 1 vs. Colorado, no doubt bringing a
smile to the face of Nikolai Khabibulin, who wouldn't play in
Phoenix this season for a long-term deal worth more than $3 million
year. Burke went into Saturday's matinee with only one playoff
victory since fronting the New Jersey net in the '88 semifinals vs.
the Bruins . . . The Black 'n' Gold faithful flocked to the Vault
this season. Final attendance: 669,237, for an average of 16,323
(92.9 percent capacity), with 14 sellouts (17,565).

   The State House might have to consider a class-action suit, now
that the Blues have launched a Golden Dome approach for the
playoffs. Rather than grow playoff beards, four of the Blues (Craig
Conroy, Marc Bergevin, Jamal Mayers, and Jamie McLennan) opted to
dye their hair bright yellow for the postseason run. Mayers, who
routinely shaves his head, tinged his eyebrows, fashioning tiger
stripes. ``If it was just myself, I'd look like an idiot,'' said
Mayers, who tuned up in the minors with Worcester (AHL). St. Louis
coach Joel Quenneville, 41, didn't opt for anything that radical:
``The only dye I'm going to have is Grecian Formula.'' . . . What a
beating (7-0) the Capitals took in their playoff opener with the
Penguins Thursday. Part of what stoked the thumping was a remark by
Washington coach Ron Wilson earlier in the week: ``We'll go (to
Pittsburgh) and beat 'em anyway.'' He was referring to the
Capitals' having to play Game 2 in Pittsburgh because of a
scheduling conflict in D.C. The Penguins slapped Wilson's quote on
their dressing room wall and then went out and handed the Capitals
their worst postseason defeat ever. ``It definitely made us
angry,'' said Penguins troublemaker Matthew Barnaby. ``You want to
be taken seriously.'' . . . Headin' south: the Flames called a news
conference Friday and made it clear they will go up for sale June
30 if season tickets aren't boosted from 9,000 to 14,000 in the
next 10 weeks. Club owners say they've lost $37 million over five
years and project to lose at least $58 million over the next four.
If the numbers aren't met, look for the franchise to end up in
Portland, Ore., or Houston . . . Flyers coach Roger Neilson,
recovering from multiple myeloma, watched Philadelphia's playoff
opener vs. Buffalo from a luxury box. Reports had Eric Lindros,
still recovering from a Grade 2 concussion, nowhere to be seen at
the First Union Center. Neilson left Saturday for a vacation in
Texas, doctors advising him to get more rest. He remains hopeful to
return behind the bench if the Flyers advance to the second round .
. . Alain Vigneault did an admirable job behind the Montreal bench,
his Canadiens losing more than 500 man-games to injury. That said,
Vigneault could be gone if ownership gives GM Rejean Houle the
gate, the Canadiens missing the playoffs for a second straight year
for the first time since the early-'20s.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens to the Devils this postseason, look for
Slava Fetisov to become their coach next season. Larry Robinson
played the good soldier, moving to the top job when GM Lou
Lamoriello gave Robbie Ftorek the heave-ho, but he made it clear
upon leaving Los Angeles that he didn't want to be a top man
anywhere again . . . Ex-Bruin Charlie Simmer, now a TV color man
with the Coyotes, said he and his Triple Crown partners, Dave
Taylor and Marcel Dionne, get no feelers for card shows or promos
these days. ``Out of sight, out of mind,'' said Simmer. Taylor is
GM of the Kings. Dionne, according to Simmer, runs a business that
manufactures miniature hockey sticks as novelty items . . . The red
in the Hurricanes' uniforms is nothing compared to the bloodletting
club owner Peter Karmanos has witnessed with his Compuware Corp. in
recent months. Consider: Compuware was trading at a one-year high
of $40 a share around Christmas, making the company worth some
$14.4 billion. It was pounded last week, dropping one day from $20
to $12 per share, and closed Friday at 12 1/8. In a little more
than 100 days, Compuware's value has dropped slightly more than $10
billion _ a drop of about $100 million a day. That, folks, is one
miserable plus-minus . . . First casualty of the playoffs:
Toronto's Yanic Perreault banged up a knee in Game 1 vs. the
Senators, tearing two ligaments and finishing him for the year.
Perreault, remember, initially was mentioned in trade talks when
the Bruins shoveled Dmitri Khristich's rights to the Maple Leafs
early this season . . . Open days weren't easy for the
Penguins-Capitals to secure in Pittsburgh, either. The rink already
had dates booked with the World Wrestling Federation, an ice show,
and a Latin dance contest . . . Just like in Boston, where Bruins
players' pledged their allegiance to head coach Pat Burns as soon
as the season ended, Blackhawks players faithfully endorsed Lorne
Molleken as they departed for the summer. Blackhawks GM and
Vineyard resident, Mike Smith, sounded less than swayed by the
sentiment. To wit: ``Unless I missed it, maybe it happened the last
couple of years I was on Martha's Vineyard and I didn't read it,
but I didn't know the hockey business became a democracy.''

BOURQUE HAVING TIME OF HIS LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ There are minutes, and then there are minutes. Ray
Bourque played another half-hour Saturday, the ex-Hub icon rolling
over the boards every other shift in Colorado's 3-1 (ho-hum)
playoff victory over the overmatched Phoenix Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   But, for all those minutes, the 39-year-old Bourque barely
looked out of breath in the thin, chilled air of the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been good here,'' said Bourque, his Avalanche now with a
cushy 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series. ``It's the same
minutes, the same role. But when you're out there with Joe (Sakic)
and Peter (Forsberg), they're working the defensemen in the other
end. I'm probably not spending as much time in my own end.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't exactly a retirement job for Bourque. After all, 30
minutes of playoff hockey, even if it were all spent in the neutral
zone, is still a test for anyone. But Bourque is surrounded by so
much other talent, and the Avalanche's game plan is so built around
speed and transition, that Bourque can look at the game straight
ahead, rather than constantly check his rear-view mirror as he digs
the puck out of his own end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd get the chance to play with him,'' said
Boston University product Chris Drury, who potted Colorado's first
goal, opening a 1-0 lead only 3:31 into the first. ``Growing up in
New England (Trumbull, Conn.) and going to BU and everything, I
just always assumed he'd be a Bruin for life. Every game he has
played here has been just unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque assisted on the Drury strike, which came on a
five-on-three power play, giving the veteran blue-liner his third
assist this postseason. He now has 128 playoff assists, fourth all
time _ behind Wayne Gretzky (260), Mark Messier (186), and Paul
Coffey (137).
</P>
<P>
   Just what does the ex-Bruins captain mean in Colorado's overall
scheme? Consider: They breezed to this win, with Bourque finishing
with but one shot _ a slapper on the power play midway through the
third period. In his Boston days, Bourque could be penciled in for
at least four shots a night. On the rare night that he didn't get
them, Boston's chances of winning went from break-even to little
hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get space and time, I'll shoot it,'' he said. ``But
they're doing a good job out there of getting on me pretty quick,
and that usually means someone else is open. Hey, I don't mind
giving up the puck to these guys and letting them shoot it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche moved out to a 2-0 lead with only 4:27 gone, this
time with another former Bruin, Dave Andreychuk, providing a key
assist on an Alex Tanguay short-range sweep under the crossbar.
Andreychuk, whose game fell off badly in the second half with
Boston, finished with six shots; teammate Sandis Ozolinsh had a
game-high seven. Andreychuk also was on the ice when the Avalanche
scored their third goal, another five-on-three strike with 9:32
gone in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Benoit Hogue scored the only Phoenix goal. The Coyotes' two top
offensive performers, Bostonians Keith Tkachuk and Jeremy Roenick,
have been silenced thus far.
</P>
<P>
   For two games, the Coyotes have applied little pressure on
goalie Patrick Roy. The Avalanche will allow the long shot, but
quickly close into the slot and smother the odd rebound that Roy
allows. If Phoenix does manage a short-range shot on net (rare),
Bourque &AMP; Co. not only take care of it, but often flip it ahead and
begin the lightning-like transition up ice. If the Coyotes are
going to get back in this series, they first have to find a way to
prevent the Colorado attack from turning around on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's impressed me most since getting here is the way this
team plays away from the puck,'' said Bourque, now with eight goals
and nine assists in the 16 games since coming from Boston. ``We
have a lot of offense, but we also pay attention to the details
when we're not attacking.''

RANGERS' GREER LIKELY TO MISS 4-6 WEEKS AFTER ANKLE SURGERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Rangers left fielder Rusty Greer has decided to
undergo arthroscopic surgery to remove bone chips from his right
ankle and is expected to miss four to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Greer made the decision yesterday after the Rangers decided to
put him on the disabled list with a strained left hamstring. The
Rangers medical staff also felt surgery would be a good idea now
because there is a strong suspicion the ankle, which has been
bothering Greer since spring training, contributed to the hamstring
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like this is the time to get it done,'' trainer Danny
Wheat said. ``It was gradually getting worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgery has been scheduled for today and will be performed
by Dr. Charles Cook in Dallas. This is the first time in Greer's
major-league career he has gone on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy having to do this, but it will relieve some
anxiety in my mind knowing the pain will be gone,'' Greer said.
``But having to miss two weeks being on the disabled list and
another two weeks because of this is frustrating. I signed up to
play. Not being able to do so is frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also believed that, if Greer didn't have the
surgery, it would cause problems over the course of the season and
he would miss a significant amount of time. He missed a week in
spring training and required a cortisone shot to ease the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been bad at times,'' Greer said. ``It's not that I can't
go out there and play, but I can't go out there and play the way
I'm capable and help the ballclub, because I don't know when it's
going to grab.''
</P>
<P>
   The hamstring injury, which Greer suffered Thursday in New York,
was going to cause him to miss a week. That's why the Rangers
decided to put him on the disabled list instead of Frank
Catalanotto, who remains sidelined with a strained groin muscle.
The Rangers are hoping Catalanotto can at least pinch hit today and
be at full speed by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers determined Greer wouldn't be able to pinch hit for a
week, which led to the decision to put him on the disabled list.
That led to Greer's decision to have the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the right decision,'' Greer said. ``It's not a snap
decision. It's something we talked about all morning. I didn't want
to get into July or August and tell them I couldn't play or need to
miss every other day.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates said Chad Curtis will take over in left
field, and switch-hitting outfielder Jason McDonald was called up
from Triple-A Oklahoma to serve as the fourth outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never want to lose a key player,'' Oates said. ``But all
spring I don't think Rusty has been running well. If we can get him
back by the first of June, we'll have four solid months where he
can play the way he's capable.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Doug Melvin said this is why the Rangers traded
for Curtis, and Melvin sees no reason to look for front-line
outfield help outside the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that concerns you is if you get another
outfielder injured,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin acquired Curtis from the New York Yankees during the
winter meetings for minor-league pitchers Brandon Knight and Sam
Marsonek.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be able to go with a guy with experience,''
Melvin said. ``He plays the game the right way and knows how to
play it.''

FOR COWBOYS, 49 IS REALLY FINE PICK: VOLUNTEERS' GOODRICH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ After a more than seven-hour wait because of the
absence of a first-round pick in this weekend's NFL Draft, the
Cowboys were richly rewarded last night when they were able to land
Tennessee cornerback Dwayne Goodrich with the 49th pick overall.
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich, a three-year starter for the 1998 national champion
Volunteers, earned a 5-rating by the Cowboys, which is their
highest, based on the results of a player's physical, intellectual
and psychological testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my wildest dreams, I didn't think he would drop down to
us,'' said Cowboys coach Dave Campo immediately after Goodrich was
grabbed off the board at 6:10 p.m. _ exactly seven hours, 10
minutes after the NFL draft had begun in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never wavered on \Rpicking\S him,'' Campo said. ``You're
talking about a 5-foot-11, 198-pound corner who has been timed in a
4.38-second 40 and who played in the Southeast Conference week in
and week out against quality players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys filled a top-priority need by drafting a cornerback
higher than they have done since 1992, when they took Kevin Smith
in the first round (24th overall) out of Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a break in this draft,'' said Cowboys owner Jerry
Jones, referring to the Cowboys' lone first-day pick after trading
away their first- and third-round selections to Seattle for wide
receivers Joey Galloway and James McKnight, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was no secret if we were drafting for position, it would be
cornerback,'' Jones added. ``And then to see Dwayne Goodrich
sitting there ... well, this was a very easy decision. I've never
been more comfortable in making a pick.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 10 minutes that the Cowboys were on the clock, they
entertained offers from both the Pittsburgh Steelers and Tampa Bay
Buccaneers to move down a few spots and pick up an extra
fourth-round selection.
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich's presence on the board forced Jones to wave off both
proposed deals, even though the Cowboys were interested in picking
up an extra selection since they presently have only five picks,
including four today as the NFL draft concludes with Rounds 4-7.
</P>
<P>
   Jones admitted that there were only two other players still on
the board who would have caused the Cowboys to select rather than
trade down. One of them was Kansas State linebacker Mark Simoneau,
who was taken by Atlanta in the third round (68th overall). The
other, a cornerback, remains on the board, but Jones was careful
not to tip his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich, seen by the Cowboys as a ``bigger Kevin Smith'' with
similarly long arms and equally good instincts for the ball, will
be given a chance to start at Deion Sanders' right cornerback spot.
Sanders is expected to be released June 2 for salary-cap reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, cornerbacks Smith and Kevin Mathis have missed a
combined 21 games over the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to put any pressure on \RGoodrich\S,'' said
Jones. ``But in my mind, he needs to come in and do it right now.
He will have a learning curve ... but times have changed in the NFL
because of the cap system and bonuses. We don't have time \Rto
wait\S.''
</P>
<P>
   The main reasons Goodrich fell into second round are thought to
be his drop-off in performance from his junior year. A disc problem
in his lower back, which resulted in a summer weight-room injury,
was partly to blame, along with Tennessee's defensive scheme
changing from mostly man-to-man to 50-percent zone with blitz
packages.
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich has been diagnosed with a heart condition, similar to a
murmur, although the Cowboys discounted the seriousness of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had no bearing on us giving him a 5-rating,'' said Jones,
calling it reminiscent to a condition belonging to former Cowboys
running back Sherman Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich was the sixth cornerback taken yesterday. He grew up in
Oak Lawn, Ill., where he was a Cowboys fan and remembers losing $10
on the Cowboys in 1985 when the Chicago Bears beat his favorite
team, 44-0.
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich missed one game last season after being arrested for
disorderly conduct outside a campus convenience store Sept. 26. The
charge was later dismissed when Goodrich complied with court terms.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had to sit yesterday and watch each of their four
NFC East rivals make picks in the top 11 overall. Washington,
favored to repeat as divisional champion, took Penn State
linebacker LaVar Arrington and Alabama offensive left tackle Chris
Samuels with the second and third picks; Philadelphia, Florida
State defensive tackle Corey Simon with the sixth; Arizona,
Virginia running back Thomas Jones with the seventh, and the New
York Giants, Heisman Trophy-winning running back Ron Dayne of
Wisconsin with the 11th.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to be at Nieman-Marcus all day long and not have any
money on you,'' quipped Larry Lacewell, Cowboys director of pro and
college scouting, who actually took a cat nap at one point during
the Cowboys' long wait, which began with war room participants
showing up at Valley Ranch at 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little frustrating to me to see all our of division
rival sitting right up there at the top of the draft and getting
the very best players in the draft,'' admitted Jones, quickly
adding that there is more to winning a Super Bowl than coming up
big on draft day. nn

BIRD FLASHING HIS OLD MOVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ ``One thing that's left to do that really intrigues me
is to be able to put a team together. That would be fun.'' _ Larry
Bird
</P>
<P>
   Is he sending us signals again? In February, Larry Bird let it
be known he could, and would, put together a group to buy the
Celtics in a nanosecond. It took a nanosecond for that idea to
bomb, but the always calculating Bird lit a flame of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's finishing up his third year coaching the Pacers. He
insists there won't be a fourth. He's insistent there is nothing
else on his plate. He has a chance to move into the front office
and build a team where he is. He doesn't want to.
</P>
<P>
   Or, we should say, he doesn't want to do it there.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview with the Globe's Bob Ryan, Bird offered
some read-between-the-lines observations that seem to indicate he
knows what he wants to do. He wants to put a team together? Where
else would he do it but in Boston?
</P>
<P>
   Retirement in Naples? C'mon. He doesn't want to go back there
and live the life of the Florida squire. Been there, done that. He
said as much in the interview. He says three years is enough for a
coach, exempting two people: Pat Riley and Jerry Sloan. (You may
have noted which coach is missing from that list.)
</P>
<P>
   The only conclusion we can draw from this _ Larry is not the
type to come out and say what he really wants _ is it's time for
Bird to come back to Boston and run the Celtics. He may be a
Hoosier by birth, but he's a Celtic by blood. Could it happen? Why
not? Yes, there would have to be accommodations on all fronts,
starting with Bird's relationship with the Celtics' chairman of the
board.
</P>
<P>
   Bird has not been a fan of Paul Gaston and has said so, both in
recent oeuvre and in comments about buying the team. Then again, we
know from the present situation that being buddies with the owner
is not a prerequisite for the job. Gaston is, above all else, a
businessman. He cannot like what he sees right now from a business
standpoint: empty seats, no playoffs, and a payroll significantly
higher than a number of playoff teams.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing Bird back is a business no-brainer. Yes, Bird would
inevitably be judged by the product on the floor, but he has shown
to be a pretty good judge of talent and chemistry. Gaston and Bird
would have to bury their respective hatchets for the good of the
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The second impediment would be Rick Pitino. He and Bird could
not work in tandem. That much we know. Pitino's contract calls for
the final say in all basketball matters. But he also has to run
these decisions by Gaston. Who's to say that Bird couldn't be hired
as a consultant to the owner? Or as the owner's adviser? Or as the
owner's receptionist? As long as he had Gaston's ear _ and Gaston
agreed to listen.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are obstacles. There always are when there are egos
at stake. But I believe it was Pitino who first said, ``The ends
justify the means.'' The Celtics are defined mostly by utter
apathy. Only when Mt. St. Pitino erupts does the team get any face
time. Bird wants to put a team together. We don't think he was
referring to Vancouver. There's no time _ or place _ like the
present.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The season ends Wednesday and it's time to make the annual
All-This and All-That selections. This clearly has been the Year of
the Laker and it will be reflected in various categories.
</P>
<P>
   MOST VALUABLE PLAYER &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal, LA Lakers. The ballot calls for five
selections, but this could, and should, be unanimous. Shaq finally
has matched his overwhelming talent with his overwhelming ego and
the results have been, well, overwhelming. The only question is why
it took him this long to realize he had it in him. If he starts to
enjoy this, the league could be in for another dynasty. Selections
2-5 are Kevin Garnett, Alonzo Mourning, Karl Malone, and Tim
Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   COACH OF THE YEAR &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson, LA Lakers. Yeah, sure, we knew it was the coaching
all the time in LA. No one saw this coming, except, perhaps, the
always prescient Big Chief Triangle. Jackson's no dummy. He saw in
LA exactly what he saw in Chicago: a team that had the personnel to
win, but didn't have a clue how to do it. He pushed all the right
buttons and, voila! The Lakers may be an abdominal strain away from
elimination, but they're also the prohibitive choice to go all the
way. Doc Rivers will get a lot of support and he should. He's done
a wonderful job with what he has. But his team may not even make
the playoffs. Sloan? He's getting to be an afterthought, which is
too bad because he simply does it every year. So does Riley.
</P>
<P>
   ROOKIE OF THE YEAR &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Steve Francis, Houston. This has basically boiled down to a
two-man race, even though Lamar Odom may turn out to be the best of
the lot once liberated from Clipper Hell. Francis gets the nod for
a couple reasons. First, he plays the most difficult position for a
rookie (point guard). Second, he isn't accumulating stats on a
truly awful team, which is the case with Chicago's Elton Brand
(although it's clearly not his fault). The Rockets have had some
quality wins while the Bulls and Clippers have been uniformly
horrible.
</P>
<P>
   SIXTH MAN OF THE YEAR &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Rogers, Phoenix. The Suns are still making noise even
with two of their top players (and 2000 Olympians) not around.
Rogers has been a key to their success and also has adapted to the
role off the bench. Jerome Williams would be an excellent choice as
well, for he truly defines the concept with his energy off the
bench. But the Suns could end up with the fifth- or sixth-best
record in the league and Rogers played a big part.
</P>
<P>
   MOST IMPROVED PLAYER &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Jalen Rose, Indiana. This won't be unanimous because of the
candidates. But is there anyone who has upgraded his game more than
the Pacers swingman? He has taken over Reggie Miller's role as the
de facto Man at Indiana (although Bird still would like to see
Miller take the big shot). He's also turned into a most valuable
free agent. Other candidates include the Mavericks' Dirk Nowitzki,
who is going to be a terrific player, the Grizzlies' Michael
Dickerson and Rose's teammate, Austin Croshere. Pitino's choice:
Shaq. But the award is designed to honor an ``up-and-coming''
player who made a ``dramatic improvement'' from previous seasons.
Shaq was pretty good last year, too.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSIVE PLAYER &QC;
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal. The Lakers are the best defensive team in the league and
have been all season. Shaq has gone from indifferent to dominant on
defense; he's third in blocked shots. The Lakers might have had 82
shutouts if they kept Eddie Jones, who, along with Mourning, are
good choices as well. But why not honor the best defensive player
on the best defensive team?
</P>
<P>
   ALL-NBA TEAM &QC;
</P>
<P>
   First team: C O'Neal, F Garnett, F Duncan, G Jason Kidd, G Gary
Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Second team: C Mourning, F Grant Hill, F Malone, G Kobe Bryant,
G Stephon Marbury.
</P>
<P>
   Third team: C David Robinson, F Vince Carter, F Chris Webber, G
Allen Iverson, G Michael Finley.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest selection was finding a legitimate No. 3 center.
Robinson wins by default; the only other serious candidates are
Patrick Ewing and Vlade Divac. I put Iverson on the third team
because he makes Antoine Walker look like a discriminating shooter.
Finley wins out over worthy candidates such as Jones and Jerry
Stackhouse. The Mavericks' minutes man is almost indestructible,
not to mention good.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One more piece of evidence as to the dramatic difference between
the East and West this season: not a single team from the Eastern
Conference looks like it will have a winning road record. Wow. That
must be a first, right? Wrong. If you think winning on the road is
tough now, you should go back to the late 1970s, when it was almost
unprecedented. In the 1976-77 season, the year Portland upset the
power-packed Sixers in the NBA Finals, not a single team had a
winning record on the road. (The Lakers had the best record at
53-29, but were 16-25 on the road.) The following year, only the
Blazers, who had that memorable 50-10 start, were better than .500
on the road. In 1978-79, only two (the Bullets and Sonics) managed
the feat. This year, five teams in the West will finish better than
.500 on the road while Phoenix needs only to win at Golden State,
and Seattle needs to win two of its last three to turn the trick.
The only Eastern team with a shot is Toronto, which must win
Tuesday in Miami and Wednesday in Orlando to finish 21-20 on the
road . . . Pitino is guaranteeing a winning season in the Shaw
Summer League . . . Dikembe Mutombo hopes to hear from the Atlanta
Hawks before they make any moves this summer. ``I'm praying for
that,'' said the Hawks center, who called this season ``the most
disappointing ever for me.'' That's not the way it was last year
when they unloaded Mookie Blaylock and Steve Smith. Mutombo said he
heard about the deals on the radio. ``Whatever does happen, I'm
just hoping I get a phone call and ask me what I think instead of
hearing about it afterwards. That's pretty tough.'' As for the
season, Mutombo says he can't conceive of not making the playoffs.
``I can't look at the standings in the papers anymore,'' he said.
``I used to see 50 wins. Now, I see 50 losses.'' Mutombo has spoken
with Lenny Wilkens over the coach's charge in a recent Sports
Illustrated article that Wilkens didn't consider Mutombo a leader.
``Everywhere I have been, I have been a leader,'' Mutombo says.
``In my country. In my home. In my family. I've always looked at
myself as a leader, a role model. I think it would be hard for
someone to say I am not a leader. Anyone who sees me working would
have to judge me as a leader. Whatever I have, I leave it on the
floor.'' . . . The consensus winners from the recent Portsmouth
Invitational Tournament were MVP Mike Smith of Louisiana-Monroe and
Reed Rawlings of Samford. Both are in the 6-foot-7-inch, 6-8 range
and have excellent shooting range. ``They could take an escalator
ride in the draft,'' said Celtics GM Chris Wallace. ``They've gone
from being lucky to being drafted, to where are they going to be
drafted.'' Portsmouth produced two first-rounders last year, Jeff
Foster and Devean George. The Nike Desert Classic concludes this
weekend, the second of the three big predraft roundups with the
third in early June in Chicago . . . Looking at Ron Mercer since he
joined Orlando, it's hard not to see a guy who may be in for a big
shock this summer. His shooting, always his strong suit, is awful.
How can he be anything more than an insurance policy for Orlando?
If the Magic can't get Jones or Hill, they might turn to Mercer. If
they get either one, where will Mercer go and what does he thinks
he's worth? More and more, it's looking like the $28 million he
turned down in Boston (over four years) will never come his way
again. The Magic aren't going to spend for the sake of spending
this summer, and don't be surprised if as many as nine players on
their current roster are back.

ASU'S REDMOND ANSWERS CALL FOR RUNNING BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Patriots put character issues aside and
patiently waited to draft a running back Saturday &UR;  &LR; night. After
passing on Arizona State's J.R. Redmond with their second-round
pick, they found him there with the 76th overall selection.
</P>
<P>
   The first day of the draft saw the Patriots take an offensive
lineman and a running back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think considering where we started it was good where we
ended up,'' said coach Bill Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond was suspended for one game last season for violating
NCAA rules by using a cell phone belonging to a woman who worked in
the Arizona State athletic department. The woman suggested that in
order to avoid a rules violation they needed to be married. The two
were married, but when the story came out, Redmond was punished by
the NCAA and the marriage was annulled.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond addressed the issue Saturday &UR;  &LR; night in a conference
call, saying he learned a valuable lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a decision to seek advice and help from your
closest friends during those times,'' said Redmond, who credited
his father with assisting him through those difficult days.
</P>
<P>
   The Redmond story actually broke when the Patriots were in
Arizona last Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots researched it and Belichick interviewed Redmond
about the problems last week when Redmond came to Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any trouble surrounding J.R.,'' said
Belichick. ``He made a bad decision. We've all made bad decisions.
I don't think it'll happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond is a tailback who can also be a top returner. He was
timed at 4.44 in the 40-yard dash, but dropped to No. 76 because of
his off-the-field problem as well as the fact that some teams
consider him a third-down back/returner rather than an every-down
back.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond is known for his outside running ability but has decent
cutback moves and can run up the middle. He's third in ASU history
with 3,210 yards on 616 carries. He also racked up 5,522 career
all-purpose yards, second in school history behind Whizzer White.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can be a four-down player,'' said Belichick. ``There were
times he was flanked out. He has good hands, can really catch the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick said he was on the phone with Redmond when he was
about to choose Adrian Klemm with the team's first pick. Belichick
said he would have taken Redmond had Klemm not been there when the
Patriots selected 46th.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick said his staff, including Scott Pioli, the new
assistant director of player personnel, figured the teams choosing
before the Patriots in Round 3 would not be going for running
backs. He was right.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had him on the phone the second time and J.R. wanted to see
his name on TV before he believed it,'' said Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick said of Redmond, ``He's a sharp guy who looks you
straight in the eye. I think he's a very focused kid. The people at
Arizona State think the world of him. He's a hard worker.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond will likely be the front runner for the starting
halfback job. He'll compete with Raymont Harris and Kevin Faulk and
will also give Faulk a run for his money as the lead kick returner.

PATRIOTS HAD A LINE ON KLEMM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ After telling one and all that they
preferred to take an offensive linemen later in the draft, the
Patriots Saturday grabbed the University of Hawaii's Adrian Klemm
with the 46th pick of the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Klemm was projected as a late-first-round pick, but a few
offensive linemen lasted until the second round after only three _
Chris Samuels, who went to Washington with the third pick; Stockar
McDougle, who went to Detroit with the 20th pick; and Chris
McIntosh from Wisconsin, who went to the Seahawks with the 22d _
went in the first.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots passed on Arizona State running back J.R. Redmond
(although they picked him up a round later) and Miami of Ohio's
back Travis Prentice. They also passed on receivers Dez White
(Georgia Tech) and Jerry Porter (West Virginia).
</P>
<P>
   Klemm, a 6-foot-3-inch, 292-pounder from Santa Monica, Calif.,
played left tackle and led a Rainbows offense that ranked third in
the conference in passing, averaging 328.7 yards per game. He
allowed 4.5 sacks while also collecting 75 knockdowns and graded
84.9 (out of 100) for blocking consistency.
</P>
<P>
   Klemm is considered one of the fastest offensive linemen in the
country, timed at 4.98 in the 40-yard dash. He's considered a mean
player at the line of scrimmage, often going right after defensive
linemen. Pass protection is his strength, but he has the quickness
to be a decent run blocker.
</P>
<P>
   The physical education major played tight end for part of his
junior season before switching back to tackle in coach June Jones's
run-and-shoot offense.
</P>
<P>
   New Patriots coach Bill Belichick, who was in the war room with
vice president of player personnel Bobby Grier, scout Larry Cook,
and Robert and Jonathan Kraft, as well as coaches and other
administrative personnel, said he took the best player on the
board, indicating there wasn't a debate about taking a running
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had Adrian in for a visit last week and put him through two
workouts,'' said Belichick. ``We're excited to get him. There were
a lot of good players on the board, but Adrian was clearly
higher-rated than the rest of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick said Klemm may not stay at tackle; he could be
switched to guard. He added that he wanted Klemm to get to New
England as soon as possible to begin learning the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick said that how Klemm was able to lose 40 pounds in a
summer to switch from tackle to tight end was impressive. Klemm
said he lost the weight with extra running and diet. Belichick said
the Patriots won't be asking him to move to tight end, but he will
be in the hunt for a guard or tackle spot with Max Lane, Ed Ellis,
Todd Rucci, Grant Williams, Lance Scott, and Derrick Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel relieved that it finally came through,'' said Klemm.
``One of the coaches told me they thought the Patriots might take
me one or two picks before (it happened).''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident I can play at the next level,'' Klemm added. ``I
figure with coaching, and by increasing my strength, I can do it.
I'm familiar with everybody there. I have a pretty decent
relationship with them. I think my strength is my pass blocking.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were looking at several second-tier offensive
linemen, a few decent receivers, a couple of backup defensive
linemen, and the running backs, when they were up.
</P>
<P>
   The top four backs _ Jamal Lewis (Baltimore at 5), Thomas Jones
(Arizona at 7), Heisman Trophy winner Ron Dayne (the Giants at 11),
and Shaun Alexander (Seattle at 19), went early. At that point
there was a sense the Patriots were sweating it out on Redmond and
Prentice. But not as it turned out.
</P>
<P>
   As the late first round approached it appeared the Patriots
would have to make a deal to get one of the two backs, but what
helped them was a run on cornerbacks, linebackers, and defensive
linemen late in the round.
</P>
<P>
   Also helping matters were projected second-rounders like kicker
Sebastian Janikowski (17th to Oakland), tight end Anthony Becht
(27th to the Jets), cornerback Rashard Anderson (23d to Carolina),
and wide receiver R. Jay Soward (29th to Jacksonville) all going in
the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots didn't pull off a trade. The Bengals were offering
running back Corey Dillon around, and spoke to the Kansas City, who
walked away from a deal, according to Chiefs general manager Carl
Peterson. Kansas City didn't even go for a running back. They
picked wide receiver Sylvester Morris from Jackson State at 21.
</P>
<P>
   A deal that had been speculated on involving the Patriots
getting running back Priest Holmes from the Ravens never developed.
</P>
<P>
   The other surprise right at the end of the first round was Super
Bowl champion St. Louis taking running back Trung Canidate of
Arizona with the 31st pick. Canidate was one of the fastest runners
in the draft, but he was projected behind Redmond and Prentice. The
Rams, taking a chance, which champions can do, had been expected to
take an offensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   The early second round was a free-for-all for the leftover
projected first-rounders. The Browns took Arizona wide receiver
Dennis Northcutt, whom some draft experts had earmarked for New
England. The Saints, with their first pick of the draft, took
Kansas State's Darren Howard, a defensive end, and the Bengals went
with Louisiana State cornerback/safety Mark Roman.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots hoped a running back would be there for them in the
third round and they got their man when Redmond fell into their
laps.

<P>
   BOSTON _ The day began as all such days begin for those players
who are not mortal locks to be one of the first five picks of the
National Football League draft.
</P>
<P>
   Nervous anticipation was the way Rose Mary Hovan described it
Saturday morning from her home in Rocky River, Ohio. ``It's going
to be that way all day until we hear something.''
</P>
<P>
   For Chris Hovan, the youngest of Rose Mary and Dennis Hovan's
three sons, the effort to make Saturday normal was almost
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   His brothers, Craig and Matthew, had come home for the weekend.
A few uncles and aunts were also gathering for a mini-family
reunion they hoped would turn into a celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Four hours and 25 minutes into the draft, it turned out that way
when the Minnesota Vikings selected Hovan, the 6-foot-2 1/2-inch
defensive tackle from Boston College, with the 25th pick of the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone had been telling us Chris would go anywhere from 10
to 25,'' said Dennis Hovan with a relieved laugh Saturday
afternoon. ``We didn't think it would be right at No. 25.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings' call came from deep left field. Minnesota was not
one of the teams that had expressed an early interest in Hovan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams like Carolina, the Raiders had talked to him,'' said
Dennis Hovan, who was in charge of transportation late Saturday
afternoon _ the Vikings wanted Chris in Minneapolis as soon as
possible, so Dennis Hovan rushed his son into the shower so he
could catch a 6:40 flight out of Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Hovan said he was delighted _ to be picked and to be going to
the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   But as generally is the case with Hovan, who became as well
known at Boston College for painting black triangles on his face on
game day as for his prowess as a defensive tackle, the reasons were
not obvious. He is now on the same team as John Randle, the
defensive lineman who just happens to paint black triangles on his
face and sometimes says outrageous things.
</P>
<P>
   Hovan said it doesn't matter where he plays, although he figures
he will play a lot. The Vikings were ranked 27th defensively in the
NFL last season.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College coach Tom O'Brien, who watched Hovan anchor his
defensive line for the past three seasons, including last year when
he had 11 quarterback sacks and 20 tackles for losses, called the
pick ``a steal.''
</P>
<P>
   There already has been speculation Hovan will play defensive
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my natural position is inside,'' he said. ``But they
play me at end. I think I have great quickness and great
intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Vikings defensive coordinator Emmitt Thomas offered an immediate
compliment. ``You can see some of Randle in him,'' said Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   When he talked to the Minnesota media, Hovan was asked about his
development from an undersized 240-pound defensive end to a
305-pound monster mash defensive tackle. ``A great weight training
program at BC,'' he said. ``And I want to thank my parents for
giving me enough money to buy food.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Hovan had been told he was more likely to be picked
in the lower half of the first round than the upper half, it did
nothing to decrease the game-day butterflies he felt Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He left the house in the morning with his brothers and father
for breakfast, just to get out of the house, knowing that sitting
in front of the television watching ESPN and tracking the draft
might take a while.
</P>
<P>
   His nerves started to jump around 4 o'clock when Seattle, which
made no secret of its need for help on the defensive line, came up
for its second pick of the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks had chosen Alabama running back Shaun Alexander
with their first pick of the first round at No. 19. The speculation
on the second pick at No. 22 centered on Wisconsin offensive tackle
Chris McIntosh. But when the NFL's Gene Washington came up to the
podium to announce the Seahawks' pick, the entire room at the Hovan
house went silent for a moment when he said, ``The Seattle Seahawks
select Chris . . . McIntosh.''
</P>
<P>
   The waiting continued.
</P>
<P>
   Not for too much longer. A few minutes later, the Vikings called
to tell Hovan they were going to pick him with the 25th pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tenacious player,'' said Vikings coach Dennis Green.
``He's exactly the kind of guy we need.''
</P>
<P>
   With the pick, the celebration in the Hovan family room began.
The food, which had been picked at all afternoon, tasted better.
The phone started to ring, with calls from friends and members of
the media, in Minneapolis and Boston. Hovan's agent, Tom Condon,
called with words of encouragement and advice.
</P>
<P>
   And then it was a mad rush to the airport, with a couple of
suits, a few changes of underwear, but unlimited ambition for what
the future will bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been like a fairy tale,'' said Rose Mary Hovan. ``Things
couldn't have worked out better.''

VARGAS IMPRESSIVE IN TITLE DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS - No one said this was going to be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Ike Quartey, 14-month layoff and all, was ready to fight when he
stepped into the ring to face IBF junior middleweight champion
Fernando Vargas before a crowd of about 7,000 here on Saturday. He
was as strong, quick and sharp as he ever was.
</P>
<P>
   And Vargas, after only 18 fights, was up to the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas calmly and cooly - and with great courage - took plenty
of punishment but simply outworked the challenger to win a
unanimous decision, retain his title and remove any doubt as to
whether he's among the world's elite fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The judges scored it 116-111, 114-113 and 116-111. The Daily
News had it 116-111.
</P>
<P>
   And CompuBox stats, though certainly not conclusive, supported
the judging. Vargas, who trained like never before, threw a
remarkable 909 punches, landing 389 of them. Quartey was 272 of
645.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it when people say I can't do something,'' said Vargas
(19-0, with 17 knockouts). ``I like to prove them wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kid is a little smarter (than Quartey believed he'd
be). I showed a lot tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Quartey, who had fought only once in the past 2 1/2 years,
looked as if he was hungry to make up for lost time.
</P>
<P>
   The former welterweight champ from Ghana, fighting at 154 pounds
for the first time, was the aggressor for the bulk of the fight. He
stalked what he had said would be easy prey throughout.
</P>
<P>
   And that was OK with Vargas, a counterpuncher who wants his
opponent to walk into his punches.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Quartey (34-2-1, 29 KOs) did damage. His left jab was
somewhat effective - although Vargas equalled him jab for jab - and
landed enough power punches to test Vargas' chin and will.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey's best round was the ninth, when he connected on several
of his best punches and Vargas' nose bled profusely.
</P>
<P>
   However, Vargas enjoyed many more such moments. He never
staggered Quartey but consistently landed power punches that
would've badly hurt a lesser opponent.
</P>
<P>
   A look at their faces after the fight told the overall story:
Quartey's was a swollen mess - his right eye grotesquely closed -
while Vargas' was relatively unmarked.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens when one fighter outpunches - and outlands -
ano another fighter 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas didn't take any chances in the end. Quartey didn't fade
in the final rounds quite as badly as he has in past fight but was
no match for the fresher, more-active champion in 10-12.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas won all three rounds on two cards, only one on the third,
although he didn't need the points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I showed I can go 12 tough rounds with a slick southpaw (Winky
Wright, in his last fight),'' Vargas said. ``I showed what type of
fighter I was then. And I showed it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Quartey, who feels he was victimized when he lost a close fight
to Oscar De La Hoya in his last bout, had similar feelings on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   When the decision was read, he simply shook his head. Afterward,
obviously distraught, he had little to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to tell you,'' he said. ``... What fight
were you watching? 116-111?''
</P>
<P>
   Vargas has an interesting immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he goes on trial in Santa Barbara on assault charges
after he and friends allegedly assaulted a man last year. He faces
possible jail time if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming he can win that fight too - or least walk away with
light punishment - his next big fight could be against WBA junior
middleweight titleholder Felix Trinidad late this year.
</P>
<P>
   If it happens, Vargas doesn't plan to run as De La Hoya, his
bitter L.A. rival, did in a controversial loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tito (Trinidad), you're a great fighter,'' Vargas said. ``I
know you want to unify the titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to show you how a real Mexican fights.''
</P>
<P>
   In preliminary bouts, Antonio Diaz (31-2, 22 KOs) knocked out
Ivan Robinson (29-4, 11 KOs) at 1:45 of the 11th round of a
scheduled 12-round junior welterweight bout.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz, a title contender from Coachella, gave an outstanding
performance against a tough, tested veteran.
</P>
<P>
   He gradually wore down Robinson with consistent punches to the
head and body, finally prompting referee Mitch Halpern to stop it
when Robinson was unable to return punches.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz has won 23 consecutive fights.
</P>
<P>
   And Jose ``Shibata'' Flores (39-8, 20 KOs) defeated Paul Vaden
(29-3, 11 KOs) by a unanimous decision in a 12-round junior
middleweight bout.
</P>
<P>
   Flores is a training mate of Vargas.

USOC BOARD PONDERS BLAKE'S IDEAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The speculation had been swirling among the sports
governing bodies for weeks, ever since the US Olympic Committee
began talking about bottom lines and money-for-medals. Swimming
will be fine. Biathlon is in trouble. Men's field hockey is
history. Et cetera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone fears change,'' US Fencing Association executive
director Michael Massik said Saturday, as USOC board members
pondered new CEO Norman Blake's controversial idea to link future
funding to performance at the Games. ``Unknown is scary. Until the
plan is revealed, everyone is going to be afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Blake has pointedly avoided singling out any sports, he's
made it clear that the age of entitlement, of governing bodies
getting dollars without strings, is over. That's welcome news to
some sports, bad tidings for others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it,'' said USA Gymnastics president Bob Colarossi,
whose federation stands to prosper under the new philosophy. ``I
like the business emphasis. I like the accountability. I like the
focus on athletes. It's the same message I've been giving my board
for the last two years.''
</P>
<P>
   While Blake's abrupt shift in emphasis is ``incredibly bold,''
said USA Wrestling executive director Jim Scherr, most governing
body officials polled Saturday were waiting to see more details
before ringing alarm bells. ``One of the things we need to keep in
mind is, he's unveiling a plan that isn't finished,'' said Massik.
``He's still working on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The USOC and its new ``account managers'' won't start hammering
out business plans with sports bodies until this summer and may not
be finished until after the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City.
But the essence of Blake's message is unmistakable. ``You should
have a game plan for how you're going to get your athletes into
medal contention,'' said Colarossi.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the sports bodies say they have no problem being judged
on performance. ``That's what it's all about,'' said US Rowing
president Monk Terry, who won a silver medal with the US men's
eight in 1972. ``That's totally in line with what we're trying to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is whether the USOC's bottom-line approach will
recognize that performance is relative, that what is abject failure
for basketball is a historic achievement for team handball. ``If
the account managers are good,'' said Terry, ``they'll understand
and help us come up with realistic goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the sports bodies face potentially divisive internal
wrangles about where the money should go. The freestyle wrestlers
win decidedly more medals than the greco-roman wrestlers do. Will
the federation now feel obliged to tilt toward freestyle? ``That
obviously is a fear,'' conceded Scherr, who said USA Wrestling
still will support both sides equally.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, sports bodies that may never win a medal will be
trying to convince the USOC of their intangible value. ``Remember
Ping-Pong diplomacy?,'' USA Table Tennis president Sheri Pittman
said. ``It opened the door to China.''

WINNING ISN'T EVERYTHING, BUT IT'S OLYMPIC THING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The next minefield in the road for the US Olympic
Committee and its new hardcore emphasis on performance is whether
America will continue to send a full team to the Games. That's
always been considered a divine right, even though no other country
does it. But a hefty minority, if not a majority of the US squad,
has little chance at a medal and many can't crack the top 20 in
their event. At the 1998 Winter Games, no cross-country skier or
biathlete finished in the top 30 and no jumper made the top 25.
That's not likely to change at Salt Lake City two years from now.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Blake, the USOC's new bottom-line CEO, believes just
making it to Olympus isn't good enough anymore. ``It's being there
and winning,'' he said. All but a few countries send only athletes
they feel can make an Olympic final because they can't afford to
subsidize ``no-hopers.'' That's never been an issue for the
Americans, but it will be after this quadrennium. ``You can't make
everyone happy and have a winning team at the Games,'' said Blake.
``We're not the US government, which can print money. We have a
finite amount of resources.''
</P>
<P>
   A dollar spent on a no-hoper is a dollar taken away from a
potential medalist. ``Nobody wants to touch that issue, but it's
staring us right in the face,'' said Blake. So the USOC will likely
pressure its national governing bodies to send only those who can
be competitive. If the NGBs insist on dispatching 35-year-olds on
self-fulfillment quests to finish 50th in their fourth appearance
at Olympus, they'll be doing it on their own dime.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though the new US Anti-Doping Agency won't be up and running
until after the Sydney Games, it's a major credibility boost for
the Americans, who want to lead the global fight against banned
drugs. As long as the USOC tested its own athletes, the rest of the
world dismissed the Yanks as hypocrites. USADA will do the testing
and oversee the appeal process. Terry Madden, who was named CEO
Friday, says the agency will perform 5,000 doping tests next year,
half without notice. The board chairman will be Frank Shorter, the
1972 Olympic marathon champion who is convinced he lost to a doped
runner (East Germany's Waldemar Cierpinski) in 1976 . . . Back on
the track Sunday for the first time since she pulled out of last
summer's world championships with a back strain will be sprinter
Marion Jones, who'll run the 400 at the Mt. SAC Relays in
California. Jones won't run the event at the Olympic trials, but
she's hoping a fast time will get her a spot on the 4 x 400 relay
at Sydney, one of five possible gold medals for her . . . The
Golden League track organizers may be handing out 50 kilos of gold
ingots to athletes who win six of their seven meets this year, but
the cash value is only half of last year's $1 million jackpot. At
least they're not paying off in euros . . . First international
test for the US Olympic women's gymnastics hopefuls under Bela
Karolyi comes this next week in New Zealand against the Chinese and
Australians and 10 other nations in the Pacific Alliance meet. If
the Americans can make the top two, it'll be a sign of improvement
since last year's sixth-place finish at the world meet. On the
squad are Amy Chow, Vanessa Atler, Elise Ray, Morgan White, Erinn
Dooley and Marie Fjordholm . . . Second chance (of three) to earn
Olympic boxing spots comes this week for light flyweight Brian
Viloria, welterweight Dante Craig, and light heavyweight Michael
Simms Jr. at the regional qualifier in Mexico. The other nine squad
members already got their tickets punched at the first qualifier in
Tampa last month. Since lightweight Marshall Martinez has left the
team for personal reasons, alternate David Jackson will have to
earn back the spot. Last chance comes in late May in Argentina . .
. The failure of the US women's field hockey team to qualify for
the Olympics (for only the second time) continues a gradual
downward spiral from a World Cup bronze in 1994 to fifth in the
Olympics to eighth in the 1998 World Cup to out of the 10-team
Olympic field. The Americans, who needed to finish in the top five
at the recent qualifier in England, lost the fifth-place match,
2-0, to China, which had never made it to Olympus. ``We just need
to learn how to finish teams and put our opportunities away,'' said
captain Tracey Fuchs, whose mates scored just eight goals in six
matches.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One yardstick for how much US men's soccer has developed since
the 1994 World Cup here: All but one of the 18 members of the
under-23 team, which will play in this month's Olympic regional
qualifier in Hershey, Pa., are professionals, 13 with MLS squads
(including the Revolution's Brian Dunseth). The Americans, who'll
meet Honduras and Canada in the prelims, need to make the finals of
the six-team tournament to get to Sydney . . . US women's soccer
team captain Carla Overbeck isn't the only prominent athlete who's
had to contend with Graves' disease (overactive thyroid). Sprinter
Gail Devers was diagnosed in 1988 and came back to win Olympic gold
medals in both 1992 and 1996. Overbeck's spot on the Olympic team
is all but automatic. ``I told Carla that she did not have anything
to prove to me,'' said coach April Heinrichs . . . Last chance for
a Sydney ticket for the US women's water polo team comes next week
in Sicily, where they'll have to finish in the top two at the
qualification tournament. Their top rivals will be Italy, Hungary,
and Russia. If an Asian team doesn't make the final eight (out of
13), the Americans can make it by placing third. The US males
earned their spot by winning last summer's Pan American Games . . .
One of the problems with holding the Olympics on an island (albeit
a continent) is marine life. Recent shark assaults on rowboats in
Sydney's harbor has some folks worried about holding the swimming
leg of the triathlon there, although there hasn't been a fatal
attack in the area in three decades. And migrating whales, passing
through on the way to Antarctica, could disrupt the sailing events.
While the whales aren't eligible to compete, they do have right of
way . . . Bridge as a winter Olympic sport? Why not, said Marc
Hodler, the octogenarian IOC member from Switzerland. ``The human
brain is at least as important as muscles,'' said Hodler, who wants
it as a demonstration sport at Salt Lake City. Only problem is, the
tables would have to be on ice or snow. Them's the rules at the
Winter Games.

QUIGLEY FINALLY COMES OF AGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He was ready to give it up, quit, put the clubs in the
closet, and take a rest. Then the thought of missing a tournament _
just three rounds of golf _ nearly made him nauseous, so Dana
Quigley hopped on a plane, got to Indianapolis Thursday morning,
played in a pro-am that afternoon, and took part in the Comfort
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   OK, he didn't play well, but Quigley dreaded the call he had to
make to the good doctor. ``I was afraid to talk to (Dr. Bob)
Rotella about it. I didn't want to tell him,'' said Quigley, who
had promised the sports psychologist he'd take the week off. ``He
called me and said, `I heard you're playing,' and I said, `Yeah.'
He said, `Well, I'm proud of you. You took three days off.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That was last September, but Quigley related the story after
shooting 69 Thursday in the first round of the PGA Seniors'
Championship at PGA National in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. He enjoys
telling that story because it serves as the perfect framework to
what he is all about. Which is? ``No one can understand that I do
not get mentally or physically tired by playing golf,'' he said.
``I get such a joy and such a pleasure out of competing against
these guys that it really, really pumps me up. You know, I may be a
strange bird, but that's the way it is for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Quigley turned 53 Friday, but acts like a 23-year-old because
he's getting a chance to live the life he felt he should have had
when he was 30 years younger. He was an aspiring Tour professional
back then, with long hair and bell-bottom pants, but for one reason
or another, it did not work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the amount of money I'm making now, that's got to be
a reflection of missed opportunity,'' he said. ``I worked so many
years without making anything _ I'm making up for lost time in that
area.''
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake, said Quigley, the reason the PGA Seniors'
Championship marks his 100th consecutive start (for which he's been
eligible) has to do with more than money. ``As for the passion for
playing golf,'' he said, ``that's been inside me forever.''
</P>
<P>
   He made his Senior Tour debut in this event just four days after
turning 50 in 1997 and Quigley has taken time off only in the
offseason. There was that memorable playoff victory in Long Island
in late 1997, a joy tempered by the news of his father's death, and
a pair of victories in 1998 as Quigley cracked the million-dollar
mark in season earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he teed it up in 38 events, finished second twice,
third three times, and was in the top 10 an astounding 18 times. It
was another million-dollar season _ $1,327,658 to be exact.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I used to play when 100 or 200 bucks was a good
prize,'' said a grateful Quigley of his days that revolved around
state opens and New England pro-ams. He won virtually everything,
but probably spent most of his prize money traveling from Maine to
Rhode Island and everywhere in between. So now, when purses are
routinely more than $1 million, why wouldn't he be out there?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I continue to have the enjoyment I'm getting from it, I
don't know when it will ever stop,'' said Quigley, who has been
second twice among five top 10 finishes in nine starts this year.
Another million-dollar campaign seems certain, though Quigley was
asked if it is frustrating being close to, but not inside, the
winner's circle in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, because I was poor for 50 years and I enjoy making money
out here. There's a lot of money for second, third, fourth, and
fifth as well as for winning. I have never, ever given it a thought
whether I'll win again or not. It doesn't absolutely matter at all
to me. What I've done already _ I'm still in shock from what I've
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Refreshingly honest, but for good reason. Quigley only dreamed
of the spotlight many of his current colleagues _ Jack Nicklaus,
Hale Irwin, Lanny Wadkins, Tom Kite, Tom Watson _ embraced
seemingly with ease, and it took Quigley a long time to gain the
confidence to play on the Senior Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scared me to death that I would be back out when I was 50
and trying to beat these guys who I couldn't beat back when I was
20 or 30,'' said Quigley.
</P>
<P>
   Along these lines, Rotella proved crucial. Quigley met him in
1996 through his fellow Rhode Islander, Brad Faxon, who worked with
Rotella for years. ``(Rotella) had a lot of respect for my game for
some reason,'' said Quigley. ``Somehow I bought into what he was
saying and I just came out and believed in myself.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a belief that paid off handsomely. It may pay off with a
win at this weekend's major championship, but if it results in
another top 10 finish, or even less, no worries, said Quigley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting to the next tournament and getting on site of the next
week is what pumps me back up. I'm excited when I go to these. I
can't wait to get to (next week's Las Vegas Senior Classic)
already.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   US Amateur champion David Gossett, a sophomore at the University
of Texas, has a decision to make regarding his future. ``I can play
here with these guys,'' said Gossett, the only amateur to make the
cut at the Masters. ``I just need to sharpen a few things up.''
Gossett shot 75-71-79-78 to tie Jack Nicklaus at 303, but making
the cut at the Masters and playing on Tour are different animals.
He returned to college, but there are some marquee events on his
schedule _ the Memorial in May, the US Open in June, the British
Open in July _ and a decision will be made this summer. ``For 20
years old, I like where I'm at.'' . . . Nicklaus, who played the
final round of the Masters with Gossett, was asked for his rookie
recollections of Augusta. ``I remember hitting 31 greens in
regulation (out of 36 holes), having eight three-putts, and
shooting 150. Arnold Palmer hit about 19 greens and shot 141. I
knew then that it isn't how many greens you hit, it's how you get
it in the hole.'' Because it was a spur-of-the-moment answer, it
seemed appropriate to check Nicklaus's memory. Sure enough, in
1959, he shot 76-74 and missed the cut. Palmer shot 71-70 . . .
After he completed his first Masters, Padraig Harrington was
greeted by a small, but loyal group of fellow Irishmen off the 18th
green. ``I enjoyed the experience tremendously,'' said Harrington,
who qualified for the Masters because he was in the top 50 in the
World Rankings as of Jan. 1. He has fallen since, which kept him
out of The Players Championship, but give him credit for
dedication. He went to South America for two events (he finished
second and first) and was exhausted when he finally made it to
Augusta. And Augusta National is not an easy course to figure out.
``It's a far different course, mentally speaking, than I've ever
seen. You doubt your yardages, you doubt your distances. It's
tricky _ and I like that.'' . . . Pssst, if you are looking for a
Masters darkhorse next year, you could do worse than Carlos Franco.
In two starts at Augusta, the talented gent from Paraguay has
finished T-6 and T-7. He opened with a 79 this year, but shot three
straight sub-par rounds _ 68-70-69 _ to finish eight shots back. In
eight rounds, Franco has been under par four times, even twice, and
1 over once . . . Then there's Tim Herron, who missed the cut for
the third time in four starts at Augusta. In 10 rounds, Herron has
broken par once. He's shot 75 or higher seven times.

   John Daly continues to struggle. Tuesday night, he reportedly

KING IMPRESSED WITH VARGAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MORALES  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS - Don King on Saturday night was full of talk, which,
for the man with the electric hair, was no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   King was among the 6,631 people who witnessed the coming out
party of Oxnard's Fernando Vargas, who not only withstood every
serious challenge by Ike Quartey, but had Quartey looking
completely beaten up, his right eye nearly swollen shut.
</P>
<P>
   In winning a convincing unanimous decision over Quartey to
retain his International Boxing Federation junior middleweight
belt, Vargas jumped right into super stardom, though he would
probably say he was already there.
</P>
<P>
   After the fight, Vargas (19-0, 17 KOs) said he wanted Felix
``Tito'' Trinidad, the WBA champion, next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to show Trinidad how a real Mexican fights,'' said
Vargas, obviously alluding to Oscar De La Hoya, who ran away and
hid from Trinidad in their bout last September, losing his WBC
welterweight belt in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Vargas was a fighter's fighter Saturday. Everything
Quartey did, Vargas did better, and stronger. And was King ever
impressed afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a great opportunity for Fernando Vargas to prove
himself,'' said King, who said he is hopeful of beginning
negotiations for a Trinidad-Vargas bout as soon as possible. ``And
we think Vargas proved himself tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people might say that Quartey had not fought in 14 months
or whatever, and that may be true. But you can't take nothing away
from Fernando Vargas.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he got caught, he was still there. He didn't get on his
bicycle and make like Carl Lewis or Jesse Owens. I think the kid
did a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Another obvious shot at De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   King said that Main Events Chief Operating Officer Gary Shaw,
who promotes Vargas, already has approached him about a unification
bout, which could be held in October at Caesars Palace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no deal in place, but Gary Shaw had asked me if Vargas
won, would we make this fight,'' King said. ``So let's see now if
he can talk that talk and walk that walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Shaw: ``We are ready, willing and able to fight Felix
Trinidad.''EP Added Shelly Finkel, co-manager for Vargas: ``I just
talked to Don King, and hopefully this week we can start serious
negotiations. I am going to make Vargas-Trinidad.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, complimentary as he was about Vargas, King made no
bones who he believes is the best fighter not only in the division,
but the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think Felix ``Tito'' Trinidad is the best fighter
anywhere,'' King said. ``He doesn't run from no one.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by Vargas' performance, neither will he once the two
warriors get ready to rumble.
</P>
<P>
   Only minutes after the bout had ended, and while Quartey was
leaning on the ropes, his face battered and his ego bruised, Vargas
talked to Trinidad through a television camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tito, you are a great fighter,'' Vargas said. ``I think you
are the only one who will step up and unify the division.''
</P>
<P>
   The queston is, who else but Trinidad would have a shot at
defeating Vargas, who was obviously in the best shape of his life,
and fought like it, too?
</P>
<P>
   There is one hurdle for Vargas to clear, however. His trial on
felony assault charges begins Monday in Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   It is a fight of a different kind, to be sure. But if Vargas,
King and Trinidad are to realize their dreams, a victory in court
for Vargas would be very helpful.''

VARGAS IMPRESSIVE IN VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS - Ike Quartey, 14-month layoff and all, was ready to
fight when he stepped into the ring to face IBF junior middleweight
champion Fernando Vargas before a crowd of about 7,000 here on
Saturday. He was as strong, quick and sharp as he ever was.
</P>
<P>
   And Vargas, after only 18 fights, was much better - which he
hopes will make people think.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas calmly and coolly, and with great courage, took
considerable punishment but simply outworked the challenger to win
a unanimous decision, retain his title and remove any doubt as to
whether he's among the world's elite fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The judges scored it 116-111, 114-113 and 116-111. The Daily
News had it 116-111.
</P>
<P>
   And CompuBox stats, though certainly not conclusive, supported
the judging. Vargas, who trained like never before, threw a
remarkable 909 punches, landing 389 of them. Quartey was 272 of
645.
</P>
<P>
   ``I beat one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world
convincingly,'' said Vargas (19-0, with 17 knockouts). ``No one has
been able to do that. No one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I hope, people will start giving me credit as one of the
best fighters in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Quartey, who had fought only once in the past 2 years, looked as
if he was hungry to make up for lost time.
</P>
<P>
   The former welterweight champ from Ghana, fighting at 154 pounds
for the first time, was the aggressor. He stalked what he had said
before the fight would be easy prey throughout.
</P>
<P>
   And that was OK with Vargas, a counterpuncher who wants his
opponent to walk into his punches.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Quartey (34-2-1, 29 KOs) did damage. His left jab was
somewhat effective - although Vargas equaled him jab for jab - and
landed enough power punches to test Vargas' chin and will.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey's best round was the ninth, when he connected on several
of his best punches and Vargas' nose bled profusely.
</P>
<P>
   However, Vargas, very patient, enjoyed many more such moments,
consistently beating Quartey to the punch and landing dozens of
quick, effective combinations to which Quartey ultimately had no
answer.
</P>
<P>
   He never staggered Quartey but the power-punch numbers were
telling: He landed 257, to Quartey's 150.
</P>
<P>
   A look at their faces after the fight said even more: Quartey's
was a swollen mess - his right eye closed - while Vargas' was
merely bruised in places.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens when one fighter outpunches - and outlands -
another 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I showed I can go 12 tough rounds with a slick southpaw (Winky
Wright, in his last fight),'' Vargas said. ``I showed what type of
fighter I was then. And I showed it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Oxnard's Vargas was particularly gratified that he was able to
beat Quartey much more convincingly than did Oscar De La Hoya, his
bitter rival who had to rally in the 12th round to pull out a
decision in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it means a lot,'' he said. ``De La Hoya was supposed
to be one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world and I
beat (Quartey) much easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does that say about me?''
</P>
<P>
   Quartey, who feels he was the victim of a bad decision against
De La Hoya, had similar feelings Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   When the decision was read, he simply shook his head. Afterward,
obviously distraught, he had little to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to tell you,'' he said. ``... What fight
were you watching? 116-111? I feel it should have been a close
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Vargas has an interesting immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he goes on trial in Santa Barbara on assault charges
after he and friends allegedly assaulted a man last year. He faces
possible jail time if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming he can win that fight, too - or least walk away with a
light sentence - his next big-name opponent could be against WBA
junior middleweight titleholder Felix Trinidad in October.
</P>
<P>
   If it happens, Vargas doesn't plan to run as De La Hoya did in a
controversial loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tito (Trinidad), you're a great fighter,'' Vargas said. ``I
know you want to unify the titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to show you how a real Mexican fights.''
</P>
<P>
   In preliminary bouts, Antonio Diaz (31-2, 22 KOs) knocked out
Ivan Robinson (29-4, 11 KOs) at 1:45 of the 11th round of a
scheduled 12-round junior welterweight bout.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz has won 23 consecutive fights.
</P>
<P>
   And Jose ``Shibata'' Flores (39-8, 20 KOs) defeated Paul Vaden
(29-3, 11 KOs) by a unanimous decision in a 12-round junior
middleweight bout.

FALL OF THE LEGENDS: POSITION OF COACH HAS LOST ITS STATURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vince Lombardi must be rolling over in his grave.
</P>
<P>
   And no doubt Vince McMahon is dancing atop it.
</P>
<P>
   Once a throne reserved for hard-nosed icons to persevere by
preaching prose and teaching Xs and Os, the coaching profession of
the 21st century is downsizing into faceless figureheads forced to
passively motivate millionaires, pacify fans infatuated with glitzy
instant gratification, and appease corporate owners demanding a
healthy bottom line and a winning record.
</P>
<P>
   While players push contracts into an unfathomable nine digits,
coaches are paying the price.
</P>
<P>
   Saddled with more pressure, less respect and shorter leashes,
coaches in all sports are struggling to keep jobs for 29 months,
rendering Tom Landry's 29 ``years'' with the Dallas Cowboys as
untouchable as Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The erosion of the coach's stature is an alarming problem,''
said sports psychologist Dr. Don Beck, director of the National
Values Center in Denton. ``The profession has been overwhelmed by
two deep trends. One, the idea of `good authority' has gone out the
window. Two, the financial pressure to win-or-else has politicized
coaches from role models into selfish entrepreneurs. We've lost
longevity, followed by trust. When you lose trust, coaches no
longer have the proper control.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words: Goodbye, Woody Hayes; Hello, P.J. Carlesimo. The
macho mojo has migrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret players have the power today, not the
coaches,'' said Red Auerbach, who coached the Celtics for 20 years
and has been with the Boston organization for 50. ``Players are
getting coaches fired instead of vice-versa. \RPlayers\S realize
there are pots of gold at the end of the rainbow other than just
winning as a team. And some of them, like all these million-dollar
endorsement deals, have little or nothing to do with listening to
your coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Stars coach Ken Hitchcock, ``Coaches aren't the show,
players are the show.''
</P>
<P>
   The towering hub of the sports world flowchart from Pop Warner
football to the World Series, ``Coach'' was often loved, sometimes
loathed, always respected. But in this knee-jerk era of greed,
quick fixes and sound bytes, coaches are getting less time to make
their first impressions last.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of the current coaching landscape reveals that 77 of
the 118 head coaches in the four major-league sports have been with
their teams three years or less. Barely a half-century removed from
Connie Mack's unthinkable 50-year reign as manager of the
Philadelphia Athletics, no current coach in any of the four major
sports has had the same employer longer than Tom Kelly's 15 years
with the Minnesota Twins.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFL _ once ruled by larger-than-life 25-year icons like
Landry and Miami's Don Shula _ only 16 coaches hired since the 1970
merger have stuck with their first teams more than eight years. In
the NHL, where a coach's average tenure is 2.4 years, there have
been six firings since the start of this season.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are dinosaur careers like North Carolina's Dean Smith (34
years) and the Los Angeles Dodgers' Tom Lasorda (21), about as
likely to return as eight-tracks and busy signals. And, as
remaining sideline stars like Penn State's Joe Paterno (34) and
Indiana's Bob Knight (30) run out of lifelines, coaching will
continue the trend away from George ``Papa Bear'' Halas and toward
Craig T. Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll never see another Landry or another Shula, forget it,''
said New York Giants longtime general manager George Young. ``It's
a different world now. The prices of the franchises are higher, the
odds are greater, the stakes are more lucrative and the focus on
the teams is more intense. I think there's more pressure on coaches
today than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys recently promoted Dave Campo and the Mavericks are
expected to soon hire a new coach. But it doesn't take a 1040
short-form expert to deduce that neither will be here long.
</P>
<P>
   Since Landry's firing in 1989, the Cowboys have been through
four coaches. The Mavericks, led by Dick Motta in their first seven
years, are looking to hire their ninth coach in 13 years if Don
Nelson's successor is selected in the off-season, as expected.
</P>
<P>
   It's not only underachievers like the Cowboys' Chan Gailey or
one-year blunders like the Mavericks' Quinn Buckner and the
Dodgers' Glenn Hoffman who are signing contracts that far outlive
their tainted tenures. Whether it's the Florida Marlins' Jim
Leyland having his team dismantled because of budget, the Cowboys'
Jimmy Johnson and the Chicago Bulls' Phil Jackson leaving due to
ego clashes with management or the St. Louis Rams' Dick Vermeil
finally running out of years if not tears, simply winning is no
longer enough for even championship coaches to keep coaching.
</P>
<P>
   This off-season alone, four NFL coaches with Super Bowl rings
(Vermeil, Miami's Jimmy Johnson, the New York Jets' Bill Parcells
and the New Orleans Saints' Mike Ditka) stepped off coaching's
carousel. Only Ditka was fired. Vermeil first retired 18 years ago
as the Philadelphia Eagles' coach, citing ``burnout.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize what a stressful job coaching is,'' said
Leon Barmore, the Louisiana Tech women's coach who announced his
retirement earlier this month after 18 years. ``I'm scared to
death. This has been my life. But one thing I won't miss is the
stress. It's taken its toll.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently Barmore has more to give, however. On Thursday, he
announced he was coming out of retirement to finish his contract at
Louisiana Tech.
</P>
<P>
   But for every Barmore who stubbornly endures, there's a Clyde
Drexler in Houston or a Danny Ainge in Phoenix who voluntarily gets
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our league, it's have 10 good years and then one bad one
and you're fired,'' said Nelson, the sixth winningest coach in NBA
history during his 20 seasons. ``The only thing different now is
it's a fair trade-off because we're paid so well. In the old days,
we were in that same predicament for little or no money.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether a side-effect of a society obsessed with how much
instead of how, or simply a vanishing of respect coinciding with
the perceived status of money, the legacy and longevity of the head
coach are diminishing. There's still a Scotty Bowman in Detroit, a
Pat Summitt at Tennessee, a Bobby Bowden at Florida State, a Robert
Hughes at Dunbar and a Gene Hackman in ``Hoosiers'', but coaching's
Old School is about to close its doors.
</P>
<P>
   Ready or not, today's sports environment idolizes Wrestling's
``The Rock'' more than Notre Dame's Rockne, and craves McMahon's
XFL style just as much as Lombardi's Green Bay substance.
 &LR; subheds:JUST WIN _ NOW _ BABY! Unlike the loyal backers who
cheered Alabama's Paul ``Bear'' Bryant in the '70s, DePaul's Ray
Meyer in the '80s and even the Yankees' Joe Torre in the '90s,
fans, boosters and owners have lost the art of patience.
</P>
<P>
   Energized by modern technology and the Internet, they no longer
wait for preheating ovens, last night's late scores or 6-8 weeks to
allow delivery of their K-Tel albums. Instead, they pop dinner in
the microwave, turn on ESPN and download their favorite song from a
web site before it's time to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, they don't have time to wait for a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like you want to win now,'' Campo said. ``I think
\Rowner\S Jerry Jones wants to win now. I want to win now. He puts
an awful lot of money in what he does and he expects a positive
return on his investment. And the fans don't want a five-year plan,
they want results now. Is that pressure? Sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Some coaches, like Rangers manager Johnny Oates, sense the
increased pressure from a dramatic change at the top of
organizations now run by bottom-line committees instead of
soft-hearted individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of ownership has changed,'' said Oates, beginning
his sixth season in Arlington. ``These are people who made their
money outside of baseball and they're used to the corporate world.
I remember when John McMullen fired Bob Watson as the Astros'
general manager. He said he thought it was a good idea to change
people around every two years so things don't get stale. You make
changes whether it's necessary or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a comparison of annual rainfall in the Farmer's Almanac, no
team better illustrates the dehydrated coaching climate than the
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   After posting a record of 18-38 in his first four years as
Cowboys coach, Landry was awarded a 10-year contract extension by
owner Clint Murchison Jr. After posting a record of 18-16 and two
playoff berths in two years, Gailey was fired by Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that NASDAQ-volatile mix yearly roster changes via free
agency, salary cap squeezes and early departures from college, and
the pressure to win is growing faster than the list of dot.com
millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously there are smaller windows,'' Campo said. ``You've
got a great team one year and you're expected to take that next
step. But all of a sudden, one guy is gone, your chemistry is
changed, and you're out of a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obstacles, there are still a precious few coaches
who can harness Regis Philbin's power and Mark Cuban's money.
Parcells wrote his own ticket, as has Phil Jackson. With a unique
perspective and an abundance of talent to work with, Jackson has
the Los Angeles Lakers on the verge of 70 victories and his image
comfortably two steps in front of the on-rushing critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at it as some sort of miracle,'' said Lakers owner
Jerry Buss of his first-year coach. ``He probably has some
characteristics of somebody from outer space. I don't think anybody
expected the instant success that he's had. We thought it would
take more time. It usually does.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an era of endorsements, egos and exaggerated bank
accounts, there is much more chagrin than Zen.
</P>
<P>
   Even more daunting than the task of winning for today's coach is
the challenge of keeping players' minds on their play and off their
pay. With athletes comparing stacks of dead presidents and
listening to agents diagram marketable end-zone dances instead
listening to coaches instructing them how to actually score
touchdowns, it's no wonder most coaches claim money is the root of
the player-coach communication meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't coach the money anymore,'' Hitchcock said. ``But you
can't be afraid of it, either.''  &LR; subheds:TALENT OVER TEACHING Red
Holzman's 18-year stint with the New York Knicks is as dead as the
hook shot because owners are finally learning what racetrack
bettors paid dearly to acquire long ago: the reality that a bad
horse with a good jockey is still a bad horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any magic, none of us do,'' said Knicks coach
Jeff Van Gundy, who has seen 47 NBA coaching coaches during his
five seasons in New York. ``You have no chance if you don't have
great players and, at heart, good people. Some teams just keep
going through coaches when what they need to do is get new players.
Look at Phil \RJackson\S. He gets to start with the best player
\RMichael Jordan\S in the game. He went from being a maverick to a
genius. But if you start with the Clippers, everyone assumes you
can't coach.''
</P>
<P>
   In football, it was Kurt Warner, Marshall Faulk and a healthy
Isaac Bruce that turned the Rams' Vermeil into a champion this year
after a combined 9-23 record the two previous years.
</P>
<P>
   Further decreasing the importance of coaches, owners also
realize that fans don't pay to see the Donna Karan bikini; they pay
to see Heidi Klum make it move. And they don't pay to see Jackson's
Triangle offense; they pay to see Kobe Bryant use it to get free
for a dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Some coaches _ like Nebraska's Tom Osborne (24 seasons), the
Pittsburgh Steelers' Chuck Noll (23) and the Twins' Tom Kelly (15)
_ were fortunate to succeed without changing expression, much less
changing. But Landry began failing because he resisted change, a
stubbornness the aging icons realize they must avoid to fight off
extinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, you have to change your strategies and you have to
change how you present them,'' Jackson said. ``What you don't ever
have to change are your principles. That's what you stand on.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches realize the only two types of species are those that
have been fired and those that will be. They acknowledge that the
career footsteps of Frank Broyles' 19 seasons at Arkansas and
Darrell Royal's 20 at Texas aren't likely to be traced. But they're
also alarmed that Jim Cleamons was fired by the Mavericks after
only 98 games, Ray Rhodes by the Packers after one season and
Robbie Ftorek by the New Jersey Devils despite his team being in
first place in the Eastern Conference with a month left in the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Once strong-armed by larger-than-life legends such as John
Wooden, Bryant and Lasorda, today it's easier to name the members
of 'N Sync than the head coaches of UCLA basketball (Steve Lavin),
Alabama football (Mike DuBose) and the Dodgers' manager (Davey
Johnson).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame, but it's to the point where coaching has to be
rewarding on a season-to-season basis rather than over a long
career,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   To remain vital, the coaching fraternity is tweaking its image
by implementing computers, cozying up to administrators, visiting
inner cities, adding assistants and considering minorities as
legitimate candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The face of coaching doesn't need a complete makeover. Purdue's
Gene Keady can keep his intense comb-over, the Miami Heat's Pat
Riley can maintain his cool slickback and Florida's Steve Spurrier
can continue hurling his visor. But staring down a crisis that has
seen them lose control, authority and longevity, coaches are
realizing they have to at least call minor audibles in order to
keep what they desperately want:
</P>
<P>
   And that's Lombardi's legacy alive, and McMahon's influence in
check. nn

COACH BIGGER THAN LIFE ON AMERICAN LANDSCAPE 
WITH COACHES-ICONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was the coach of our basketball team, and we loathed him.
</P>
<P>
   He screamed at us. He belittled us. He called us stupid. In the
vernacular of the time, he said we played like a girl.
</P>
<P>
   We were 10 years old.
</P>
<P>
   His name is unimportant, because you don't know him. He never
amounted to anything as a coach, beyond the dozens of
now-inconsequential games that he always won at our local
playground level.
</P>
<P>
   The memories fade. We forget our parents' anniversary. We forget
our third-grade teacher. We forget the name of the girl that we
asked to the prom.
</P>
<P>
   But we don't forget a coach.
</P>
<P>
   Long after the youthful tears dry, we remember his stinging
words. His temper. The way our stomachs churned, knowing we would
have to face him in practice.
</P>
<P>
   To most of us, the coach is the first contentious authority
figure that we encounter outside of home. Teachers are loved and
compassionate. Their anger passes.
</P>
<P>
   But the coach is a master of his domain. He controls the flow of
perspiration and of tears. He can demand that you change your
tackling style. He can sit you on the bench. He controls both the
carrot and the stick.
</P>
<P>
   From our early days, we are steered into sports. The coach
teaches us the rules. He becomes our sharpest critic.
</P>
<P>
   All too often, a child forms his lasting impressions of a sport
_ and sometimes of athletics, in general _ solely because of his or
her first coach. The responsibility is seldom acknowledged. To a
coach, the players are the expendable ones.
</P>
<P>
   But there is only one coach.
</P>
<P>
   At the higher levels, television cameras fixate on him.
Newspapers rush to quote him. Alumni pine to play golf with him.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Royal, Tom Landry, Paul ``Bear'' Bryant, John Wooden,
Woody Hayes _ they all ascended to a higher coaching plane. When a
coach wins, his words and ways can take on an aura of
infallibility. There is no madness in his methods.
</P>
<P>
   It is no mere coincidence that the punching incident that felled
Hayes' Ohio State coaching career did not come in the 1978 Rose
Bowl, but in the less-alumni-pleasing Gator Bowl. In Indiana, with
no recent Final Fours to buffer the basketball coach's foul words,
the heat is even being turned up on the loutish Bobby Knight.
</P>
<P>
   Because sports is so ingrained in the fabric of our society, the
coach invariably casts a broad shadow in the community.
Consequently, he can be both revered and reviled, lauded and
loathed _ sometimes all in the same weekend.
</P>
<P>
   After all, we all have an opinion about the coach. The cab
driver on his way from the airport, the hairdresser at the beauty
shop, the neighbor next door _ they all have their own ready
assessments of the town's Don Nelson and its Johnny Oates.
</P>
<P>
   A bad coach can ruin a Friday night. A good coach can launch a
parade and a civic holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The good coach gets a house on the lake. The bad coach gets a
``For Sale'' sign planted in his front yard.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Cowboys' Chan Gailey seemed to be fired as much
for his insipid style as his playoff lapses. Any teller at the bank
will tell you that.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, however, was a victim of the changing times. Whereas
Landry coached for an owner who gave him a 10-year contract
extension following a losing season, coaches today often have to
answer to an owner or athletic director who has many millions of
dollars at stake.
</P>
<P>
   For owner Jerry Jones, Gailey became a tough sell. Nelson was
walking that same plank, until the NBA Mavericks mustered a spring
surge.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's new boss, Mark Cuban, paid $280 million to buy the
Mavericks. Rangers owner Tom Hicks, who employs Oates, has 49,200
seats to fill every night at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Where a coach's primary pressure used to be winning, in other
words, he now has to pull his weight in a business with a bottom
line.
</P>
<P>
   In a little more than a decade, what was once perhaps the most
glamorous job in sports _ head coach of the Dallas Cowboys _ has
become a seat far too uncomfortable to easily fill. The line of
succession runs from the Hall of Famer Landry to two-time Super
Bowl winner Jimmy Johnson, to the previously underemployed Barry
Switzer, to overmatched and career-long assistant Gailey, and now
to Dave Campo, who has never been a pro or Division I college head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   In Landry's day, he was a symbol of the franchise, just as
Bryant was at Alabama, Royal at Texas and Frank Broyles at
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The list of latter-day coaching ``gods,'' however, has grown
slim. Florida State's Bobby Bowden and Joe Paterno of Penn State
may be the only two football coaches left whose patriarchal
presences dominate their universities. The ``patriarch'' coach can
operate his program both under the table and above the law. Critics
are discouraged. Resistance is futile.
</P>
<P>
   In so many ways, the phenomenon is uniquely American. We are a
nation dominated like no other by team sports. And the coach of the
team _ the hometown team, usually _ inevitably assumes a golden
space on the sporting landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Americans enjoy following golf and tennis, for instance, but few
could name any golf or tennis coaches. Gymnastics' Bela Karolyi,
who rose to prominence on the Olympic stage, may be the one coach
who has found notoriety in non-team sports.
</P>
<P>
   From our earliest days, we are channeled into signing up for
``the team.'' We try on the uniform. We meet the coach.
</P>
<P>
   For a parent, the unwritten contract is taken far too lightly.
Several youth leagues now run background checks on their
prospective coaches. Nearly all youth associations require their
coaches to be registered and tested, at least in the most
fundamental skills.
</P>
<P>
   It's a start, but most parents know little or nothing about
their kid's coach, his or her playing experience or whether he or
she can teach your child even the basic skills. In the eyes of most
parents, sadly, the coach's competence is directly related to how
often their own child gets to play.
</P>
<P>
   I spent eight years coaching my son. I tried to teach the
fundamentals. I labored to make our baseball practices fun. Before
the start of each season, I would announce to the parents that
every boy would get to play and every boy, including the coach's
son, would take his turn to sit.
</P>
<P>
   To some parents, it still wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   But we made a lot of happy memories. When our scrappy little,
overachieving fifth-grade basketball team used its final timeout of
the season to hold a group hug, there wasn't a dry eye amongst the
coaching staff. And when our rawest beginner, a smiling young man
named Clay, got the first base hit of his life late in one baseball
season, the glow on his face sent a chill up my jaded spine.
</P>
<P>
   We are all coaches at heart. Maybe that's why we have so many
strong opinions about the men and women who coach the teams we
love.
</P>
<P>
   We don't forget a coach.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, I was reading my hometown paper when I saw the
obituary for my old, original basketball coach. The screamer. The
one who called us 10-year-olds stupid and teased us when he made us
cry.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't send flowers.  &LR; tagtop:Gil LeBreton, (817) 390-7760

CLIPPERS LOSE IN OVERTIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After clinching the top seed for next month's NBA
Draft lottery with Friday's convincing loss at Phoenix, the
Clippers earned the luxury of breaking character.
</P>
<P>
   With no additional pressure to get clobbered, they might have
eased up on the lousiness throttle Saturday night and took a big
swing at the Denver Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   They even had a victory precedent, having tagged the Nuggets as
their most recent (March 14) victims.
</P>
<P>
   So, rather than back into the lottery, the Clippers pushed
Denver to overtime before losing, 115-114, before 17,738 at Staples
Center. Rookie Lamar Odom, who received a rare benefit of a
doubtful call on a drive at the end of overtime, missed the second
of two free throws with .5 seconds before the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just missed a free throw to lose the game,'' said Odom, who
finished with 13 points and 13 rebounds. ``This one probably hurts
me more than if we lost by 30.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Anderson rallied from back-spasm agony to produce 31
points for the Clips, while Tyrone Nesby added 25 and 8 rebounds.
But the home tag team was trumped by Denver's 1-2 punch, with Nick
Van Exel getting 44 points and 8 assists, while Antonio McDyess
rang up 30 points and 20 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Van Exel ... he's not bad,'' said Clips interim coach Jim Todd
while studying the stat sheet. ``I told our guys that this just
goes to show how good you guys actually could be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers began game No. 80 with 15 consecutive losses and
the fresh glory of a Sports Illustrated cover story branding the
franchise as the worst in the history of franchises. Perhaps the
most frightening element to this ``worst'' aftermath is the
collective belief in Clipperville that the story could have been
even more damning.
</P>
<P>
   Chew on that a moment. Being judged only the worst ever is
considered a minor victory, because the historical assault on
Donald T. Sterling was believed to be relatively tame.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling, an infrequent Staples spectator of late, attended
Saturday's game, as did free-agent threats Anderson and Maurice
Taylor, who missed a pair of road games this week. Taylor (sore
ankle) didn't suit up vs. Denver, but Anderson (back spasms) had
the good fortune of feeling fit enough to play against a team he's
interested in playing for next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow, I'll be sore as hell,'' Anderson said. ``I'll be in
treatment all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's audition produced a 9-point effort in the second
quarter, during which the Clips outscored Denver, 28-21, to take a
55-50 lead at intermission. It was their first halftime lead in
eight games.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers coughed up a 7-point lead in the third period, but
Anderson poured in another 7 to close the quarter with the home
team in front, 79-78.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth quarter produced four lead changes before Van Exel
nailed a 3-pointer off a jump ball with 19.3 seconds left to send
the game into overtime at 98-98.
</P>
<P>
   Denver led by as many as five points in OT, but a 3-pointer by
Nesby put the Clips in range at 113-111, Nuggets, with 19.5 to
play. Before Odom's close, Van Exel missed 2 of 4 free throws,
while Anderson dropped 2 of 2. Odom followed Van Exel's last miss
with a baseline drive that was challenged by McDyess, who was
called for a phantom foul.
</P>
<P>
   Odom made the first shot, missed the second and that was that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might be the best loss we've had,'' Anderson explained,
``because we finished the game. I liked this game.''

TEXAS RANGERS MANAGER REFLECTS ON HOW HE MANAGES THE COACHING LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY OATES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   {Johnny Oates has managed the Texas Rangers since 1995 and has
led the Rangers to division titles three of the past four years.}
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, a long time ago, so many things have happened to me
where in my mind, I said, why me?
</P>
<P>
   I can remember back playing Little League and the Junior League
team was short. They were getting ready to leave the complex at
Myrtle Beach, S.C., and the coach came over and asked me to play
with the 13-year-olds. I don't know why he picked me because there
were better players there than me.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a sophomore at Virginia Tech, we had a senior who was
the catcher all through the preseason drills. I just stayed in the
background; he did everything.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when we went to play North Carolina in our first game, not
only was I in the starting lineup but I was hitting fourth. Nobody
had ever given me an indication that was going to happen and to
this day, I don't know why.
</P>
<P>
   I've spent so much of my time asking why. Now I try to get past
that and just be thankful for what I have and not take it for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure is part of this job. Where I used to get pressure from,
when I first became a manager, was trying to please everybody. I
played in the big leagues and I had no idea of the demands put on a
manager's time. I realized they had to do a lot of extra stuff but
I never imagined how much.
</P>
<P>
   I had to learn the press was not my enemy. That's where my
stress came from. Not from the game, not from trying to win. When
it comes time for the game to start, I love that part.
</P>
<P>
   I think I'm getting better with the press. At first I was a fish
out of water because I thought every question was not for
information but ``why did you do that you, dummy?'' Now that I look
back on it, the questions are the same now _ and some of them will
bug me after the third and fourth time _ but I think I'm getting
better every day in handling the media.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle is the self. Because I am a perfectionist,
I expect things to be done right. I don't expect to win every
ballgame but I expect things to be done right.
</P>
<P>
   I find it a challenge dealing with players and I tell them right
up front I don't treat them all the same. But I treat them all
fairly. I really believe I treat them all fairly.
</P>
<P>
   I may give Rafael Palmeiro privileges I don't give Ruben Mateo.
I might give John Wetteland privileges that I might not give
Francisco Cordero. I'm a little bit of the old school, I think you
earn privileges. But we all have boundaries regardless if you're a
Wetteland or a Scottie Sheldon or Mike Lamb. Because if you don't
have boundaries, there's chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly I've had disagreements with them, I've had
disagreements with Rusty Greer and it is pretty hard to believe
that you could have a disagreement with him. I've had a couple of
disagreements, believe it or not, over the past 33 years with my
wife Gloria. And I love her dearly. So those things are going to
happen. You just try to do it in-house and don't let those
disagreements become public.
</P>
<P>
   I realize I'm judged on my won-loss record. That's the job.
Everybody is judged on something. If Rusty doesn't hit, he's
probably going to be out of the big leagues. If Wetteland doesn't
pitch, he's going to be out of the big leagues. If we don't win,
I'm going to be out of the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   At the very beginning, I felt a whole lot of pressure to win. I
was so much focused on winning and pleasing people, I think that
was a lot of my problem. Now I know I can't please everybody so I
quit trying that.
</P>
<P>
   I was trying to please everybody and I found out the people I
was probably hurting the most were the people who loved me the
most, trying to please the people who could care less. Once I got
those priorities in order, I was able to let go some other things.
</P>
<P>
   I get frustrated and I hurt after a tough loss. I struggle
mentally when we lose a ballgame I feel we should have won. But I
think I'm able to put it away quicker than I used to and get ready
to come back the next day. If I do the best of my ability to manage
this ballclub, then the won-loss record is out of my control.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally I'd like to say I don't worry about it but I do think
about it. I think what can I do, what button can I push, what can I
say to someone to motivate them, what changes in the batting order
can I make, how can I create some offense.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's just walking through a clubhouse with my head up
after a tough loss letting everybody know it's going to be all OK.
The last thing the crew of a ship wants to see is their captain
start panicking.

 &HT;    Proposed gun control legislation abounds in Columbine aftermath
 &HT;    By Shannon Joyce Neal
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ More than 20 gun-related bills have been
filed during the current session of the Legislature, the first full
session since the shootings at Columbine High School. They make up
a small fraction of the more than 700 bills filed, but for many,
they carry the promise of righting a horrible wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Their passage, some say, would somehow ease the pain inflicted
when two teen-agers April 20, 1999, killed 12 students and one
teacher before taking their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   While that might be debatable, it is certain that the shootings
catapulted Colorado's gun laws into the national spotlight, pitting
the ferocious defense of a constitutional right against those
calling on the Legislature to control access to a product that, in
the wrong hands, can devastate a community.
</P>
<P>
   Two Grand Junction residents for whom the Columbine killings
evoked particular horror typified the gun debate. They were among
the more than 100 western Coloradans who responded to the The Grand
Junction Daily Sentinel's request for thoughts and comments about
the first-year anniversary of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot understand the resistance to the idea of a waiting
period and background check before every gun sale,'' wrote Carolyn
Latham, whose daughter was murdered. ``This should include gun
shows. Any law-abiding citizen with a conscience should be in favor
of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The highest law was on the mind of Ron Taylor, whose nephew was
a student who escaped uninjured from Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law-abiding gun owners don't need to have their constitutional
rights infringed further, the lawbreakers and all those who misuse
firearms need to have the existing laws enforced and applied and to
be come down upon like the fist of God,'' Taylor wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has drawn the attention of President Clinton, who
campaigned in Colorado last week for tighter gun control, including
a proposed voter initiative that would close the ``gun-show
loophole.'' Despite it having the support of Republican Gov. Bill
Owens, the GOP-controlled Legislature earlier this session rejected
a bill that would have required all buyers of guns at gun shows to
undergo a criminal background check.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the gun bills introduced since the Columbine
shootings have met the same fate. At least two _ including one
approved last week that would make it a misdemeanor to give someone
under 18 a gun without their parents' permission _ have made it to
Owens' desk to be signed into law.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the bills first came to the Legislature
(www.state.co.us/govdir/stateleg.html) before Columbine, such as
one that would create specific statewide standards for concealed
weapons permits and another that would prevent the state and local
governments from suing gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Gayle Berry, R-Grand Junction, said many of the gun
control and Columbine-related bills wouldn't have prevented what
happened at Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Legislature has done some reasonable legislation
around the Columbine issue,'' Berry said. ``But not specifically
gun control.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Pascoe, executive director of Sane Alternatives to the
Firearms Epidemic, or SAFE Colorado (www.safe.org), said many
people in the state saw the Columbine shootings as a wake-up call
for more gun control. While many of the bills would not have
prevented the Columbine tragedy, some may have made a difference,
Pascoe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just SAFE, the people of Colorado are clamoring for
gun laws,'' Pascoe said. ``The Legislature has turned a deaf ear
toward that effort.''
</P>
<P>
   SAFE member Tom Mauser, whose son Daniel was killed at
Columbine, said two statewide polls conducted after the shootings
showed up to 94 percent of Coloradans support mandatory background
checks for gun-show buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the attack, support was about 60 percent, according to
Marshall Kaplan, director of the Institute for Public Policy
</P>
<P>
   Gun-rights advocates, meanwhile, say it has been more difficult
to campaign for their cause in wake of Columbine, but it has helped
solidify their position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gun owners are between a rock and a hard place here,'' said
Dudley Brown, executive director of Rocky Mountain Gun Owners
(www.rmgo.org).
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to go through an election cycle and see what
happens,'' he said. ``I think November will be a huge test for gun
rights in Colorado and across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   SAFE is leading the effort to get the gun-show loophole proposal
on the November ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would require a background check on all gun show
sales. Under current laws, background checks are required only for
gun show sales by a federally licensed dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Robyn Anderson, who purchased one of the guns used in the
Columbine shootings at a Denver gun show, told a state House
committee she would not have bought the gun if she had had to go
through a background check.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the political debate, guns really aren't the problem,
some Grand Valley residents said.
</P>
<P>
   If gunmen Klebold and Harris hadn't had guns, they would have
found another way to kill, such as the bombs they planted around
the school, wrote Tony R. Martinez of Grand Junction, who said more
gun control would be only an ``emotional response.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't we take a look at why so many people are becoming
violent in the first place and then maybe we can deal with the real
problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents of gun control say the state already has too many
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Linn Armstrong, of the Pro-Second Amendment Committee in Grand
Junction, said Americans wouldn't tolerate such restrictions on
other freedoms guaranteed in the Bill of Rights. Such laws only
chip away at the rights of the law-abiding citizens and their
ability to protect themselves, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But to come away from such a tragedy and do nothing to try to
prevent it from happening again is a greater wrong, wrote Dave
Murphy of Grand Junction.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the issue of handgun control, very little is clear except
for this: in 1996, handguns were used to murder two people in New
Zealand, 15 in Japan, 30 in Great Britain, 106 in Canada and 9,390
in the United States. In 1997, 10,369 people were murdered with
firearms in this country, and in the same year there were only 190
justifiable handgun homicides by private citizens in the United
States,'' Murphy said, citing Justice Department figures and
statistics from similar agencies in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want our elected leaders to do something proactively to
protect my child from getting her head blown off under a table in a
high school library. I don't expect or even want all that much from
my government, but I do expect that.''

Havana. These are the true believers, the fanatics and worshipers

   STUDENT-DRUG-TESTS (Lockney, Texas) _ For three years, people in
this tiny farming town fretted that stopping the local drug problem
was like trying to lasso the winds that blow day and night off the
flat Texas plains. Eventually, the school board enacted what is
considered the toughest school drug testing policy in the nation.
It requires that all of the 388 junior and senior high school
students take a mandatory drug test. Now, with more and more school
districts across the country instituting drug tests, Lockney, with
only 2,200 residents, has become an unlikely constitutional
battleground. By Jim Yardley.

   HITECH-JANITORS (San Jose, Calif.) _ From 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. each
night, Guadalupe Herrera vacuums carpets and cleans bathrooms at
that pinnacle of high-technology success, Cisco Systems, and then
she heads home to the garage where she, her husband and two sons
live. When Maria Godinez returns late each night from her
$8-an-hour janitor's job at Sun Microsystems, she slips quietly
into the bedroom she shares with her husband and five children _
all part of a single-family house where four families and 22 people
live. High-flying companies like Cisco and Sun can rightfully boast
that they have created a new class of millionaires, but they have
spawned another class of workers: the invisible, nonstock-optioned
high-tech toilers, for the most part janitors, who earn too little
to afford decent housing in a booming region. By Steven Greenhouse.

   COLUMBINE-LITTLETON (Littleton, Colo.) _ The school shootings a
year ago had an impact on the nation, but the most lasting effect,
and the most dramatic, has taken place in the suburban town where

   VICTIMS-SHIRTS (New Orleans) _ In New Orleans, where death is an

subject of a rap song by hiphop star Master P.

   BUSH-DEMOCRATS (Washington) _ The similarities of the Bush
campaign with the Clinton campaign of 1996 go far beyond the mirror
image events to tactics. Clinton outflanked the new Republican
congressional majority by signing the GOP's welfare overhaul bill,
coming up with his own family values agenda, and agreeing that the
federal budget should be balanced. Now it is Bush who boldly talks
about issues usually associated with Democrats, thus making it
harder for Democrats to mount some of their usual lines of attack

   GORE-CLINTON (Hollywood) _ For the first time since December,
Gore and Clinton are together on the same stage, raising money in a
place that adores the president, Hollywood. Not only did the two
raised $2.8 million, more than the night before in Silicon Valley,
but they lavished each other with praise and affection. Gore was
especially flattering, tying himself closely to the president, a
departure from Gore's campaign tactic of putting some distance

   MARKET-MARKETPLACE (New York) _ Nearly 13 years ago, investors
stunned by the worst stock market week in memory spent the weekend
pondering whether a great bull market was over. On the following
Monday, so many of them decided to sell that the Dow Jones
industrial average plunged 22.6 percent, or 508 points. Oct. 19,
1997, became known as Black Monday. In the years since, there have
been many bad days for the stock market, but no week as stunning in
its devastation as the past week. Now, as then, investors have
large profits they could choose to protect by fleeing a market that

 &HT;    Heat deaths linked to medicationsBy Steve Bennish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Findings from health authorities have doubled the
number of deaths related to psychiatric medications taken by the
mentally ill during last summer's fierce Midwestern heat wave.
</P>
<P>
   New figures from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta
and the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office in Chicago show that
at least 23 of the estimated 300 dead were mentally ill people who
took medicines that made them especially vulnerable to death from
intense summer heat. The total number could be higher still since
not all coroners where heat deaths occurred performed toxicology
tests.
</P>
<P>
   A Dayton Daily News review of coroner reports immediately
following the July 21 to Aug. 3 heat wave found that at least 10
who died from heat stroke in Ohio, Missouri, Wisconsin and Kentucky
took such medications. The medications interfere with the body's
thermo-regulatory system, hazards known to physicians but seldom
publicized.
</P>
<P>
   Toxicology results from autopsies of 86 of the 116 reported dead
in Chicago _ test results not available last summer _ found that 10
had anti-psychotic or anti-depressant medications in their
bloodstreams at the time of death. Common drugs included Mellaril,
Elavil, Prozac and Zoloft.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question people on anti-psychotic drugs have to be
more cautious in the sun and heat,'' Chicago chief medical examiner
Edmund Donoghue said. ``They are vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   The test results also found 20 with alcohol in their systems,
four with cocaine, and two with morphine.
</P>
<P>
   In Cincinnati, a case study by the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control examined 17 of the 18 reported heat deaths. It found that
four of the dead had prescriptions for medication with heat risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Results of a case-control study showed a particularly high
risk among young people with mental problems,'' the CDC report
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had four people on medication that can cause heat stroke,''
said Carl Parrott, Hamilton County Coroner. ``The goal now is to
help refine the response to these heat emergencies.''
</P>
<P>
   The CDC found that all of the Cincinnati dead had known risk
factors besides mental illness, including social isolation and no
air conditioning at their residence. None of the victims had
visited an official or private cooling shelter.
</P>
<P>
   In all, eight of the 17 had mental problems, the CDC said.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio's 24 fatalities prompted Ohio Rep. Samuel Britton,
D-Cincinnati, to propose a bill requiring air conditioning in group
and nursing homes and assisted living centers. The bill also
requires air conditioning in housing for those older than 65. House
Bill 474 is currently awaiting action in the house Health,
Retirement and Aging Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC report recommended an emphasis on tracking people at
risk and increasing outreach, tightening regulations to limit
temperatures in assisted care facilities, and providing more
training for those who deal with heat-sensitive people.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Rubin, acting chief of the CDC's Health Studies Branch,
said air conditioning is a key factor in surviving a heat wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the one overwhelmingly protective factor,'' she said.
``Even limited exposure to air conditioning. It's part of most city
heat plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati Health Commissioner Adcock, who requested the CDC
study, said he supports Britton's legislation because a deadly heat
stroke can suddenly affect those on medication without many obvious
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the lessons we learned is that it is not enough to
simply monitor,'' he said. ``We need a preventive strategy that
would allow temperatures to be maintained appropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   As yet, the state Department of Health, which inspects group
homes, hasn't taken a position on Britton's bill. Marijean Siehl,
director of public affairs, said the department is concerned air
conditioning could cost group home operators too much and that
residents might squabble over the air conditioning and that the
department would also have to inspect the air conditioning units.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's news: Some of the Internet's uncertainties have nothing
to do with stock prices. Take the vagaries of surfing the Web, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has ever watched a complex Web page paint itself onto
the computer screen, image by grudgingly slow image, can attest
that the World Wide Web should be faster. On that simple
proposition there is virtually unanimous agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Where there is disagreement is over how to accomplish this
worthy goal _ and how to get paid for doing it. On that, the
Web-performance industry splits into two factions, whose leaders
are divided by technologies and an entire continent: Inktomi, based
in Foster City, Calif., and Akamai, in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Inktomi, with America Online as a trophy customer, aims to make
Web traffic flow faster by storing or ``caching'' the most
frequently requested material on network server computers nearest
to the people who request it. Last year, for example, when a
zillion or so AOL users clicked on the Starr report, there were no
delays or crashes. That is because the readers were not linking to
the government server, but to a battalion of Inktomi caches that
duplicated and delivered the document.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai, which counts Yahoo among its big clients, takes a
different approach to the same problem, with a technique called
content distribution. When a user in Singapore, say, clicks on a
popular page in Yahoo, only the first request goes to Yahoo's
server in Palo Alto, Calif.; the balance of the page is then
delivered from an Akamai server with the shortest, fastest
connection to the person in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Inktomi and Akamai each have a pack of competitors, snapping at
their heels and hoping to bite off bigger and bigger chunks of the
Web-performance market, which is expected to grow from about $4.5
billion last year to $25 billion in 2003, according to Andrew C.
Brosseau, an analyst with S.G. Cowen.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Inktomi and Akamai executives assert that they
really do not compete with each other and have little in common _
which of course means they compete vigorously and have more in
common than either will let on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Akamai is just doing one of a multitude of things you would
want to do to interact with content,'' said David C. Peterschmidt,
president and chief executive of Inktomi, whose stock price is up
nearly 14 percent so far this year, despite the market's recent
turmoil. ``Caching allows a whole set of stuff, of which content
distribution is just one thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Akamai sees things, ``there's a lot of content that's
uncacheable, because caching doesn't ensure freshness,'' said Paul
Sagan, Akamai's president and chief operating officer. ``In
entertainment or news you have to make sure the content is fresh
for each user.'' Akamai's stock price, despite a plunge from the
stratospheric heights it occupied in January, is still up nearly
150 percent from the offering price last October.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their technical differences, Akamai and Inktomi in some
ways have followed remarkably parallel paths. Each, for instance,
has an odd name derived from a Native American language: Inktomi,
pronounced INK-tuh-mee, is the name of a clever spider in Lakota
legend; Akamai (AK-uh-migh) is Hawaiian for intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   Each was founded by a pair of math whizzes from a leading
university, but is now managed by a computer industry graybeard.
</P>
<P>
   Each company, moreover, received venture funding from leading
technology companies, Intel in Inktomi's case, Apple Computer and
Cisco Systems in Akamai's. And each has ridden an initial public
offering into a high stock market valuation for the company _
$100.8125 a share for Inktomi and $64.875 a share for Akamai.
</P>
<P>
   And each, of course, tries to address perhaps the most vexing
quirk of the Web. Some sites sprint while others crawl. But
sometimes a site will sprint on one visit only to crawl on the
next. In such cases the disparity is more likely caused not by the
Web site itself, but by the underlying architecture of the
Internet, which was originally intended to deliver e-mail reliably
_ not to broadcast complex media at high speed.
</P>
<P>
   For a user, calling on any Web page requires downloading
multiple ``objects'' _ a banner ad, a photo or a set of activity
buttons, for example. Any or all such objects must be broken down
into packets of digital bits, sent across the Internet and
reassembled at the end user's computer.
</P>
<P>
   During this downloading, even for the delivery of a single Web
page, there is a tremendous amount of dialogue between the user's
browser software and the source computer server. All the
communicating bits must travel _ often across the country, or even
around the globe _ hopping across multiple networks and traffic
routers. At each hop, a few packets may get lost and have to be
resent.
</P>
<P>
   Inktomi's approach, caching, and Akamai's mainstay, content
distribution, both seek to streamline things by taking the material
on the original server and moving it closer to the user. But the
approaches differ, as do the trade-offs.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of caching comes from the semiconductor industry;
chip makers commonly put a small amount of memory, called cache,
directly on a microprocessor. Frequently used bits of data can be
stored in this cache memory, to be easily summoned when needed,
speeding the computer's operation.
</P>
<P>
   Inktomi has a software product, called Traffic Server, that runs
on server computers around the Internet, working essentially the
same way as cache memory on a computer chip. Traffic Server
monitors network traffic to identify the most frequently requested
objects, then stores, or caches, them closer to the requesting
users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Networks were very dumb,'' Peterschmidt said. ``They would
send the same packet over and over again to the same location.
Traffic Server was the first step at making the network smarter. It
would recognize that you'd already requested that information, and
store it closer to the user.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 52, Peterschmidt, formerly president of Sybase, the
database software company, is Inktomi's graybeard. The company was
founded in 1996 by two researchers at the University of California
at Berkeley: Eric A. Brewer, now 33 and Inktomi's chief scientist,
and Paul Gauthier, who is 27 and currently on sabbatical from the
company. Their first product was a search engine, which Inktomi
still sells as a service to portals like Yahoo and Hotbot.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Traffic Server, introduced in 1998, was created as a stand-alone
software package to run on Sun Microsystems' Solaris version of the
Unix operating system. The product now also runs on other major
versions of Unix and on Microsoft's Windows NT network operating
system. Inktomi also publishes Traffic Server's application
programming interfaces, or APIs _ software specifications that
enable other companies to add functions, like network security or
so-called streaming audio and video.
</P>
<P>
   Excite(AT)Home, which became Inktomi's second customer for
Traffic Server after AOL, uses Traffic Server's programming
capability to customize the Excite(AT)Home Web service for
different devices _ one version for PCs, for example, another for
TV set-top boxes. But while this flexibility was nice, the real
draw was the improved performance, said Robert Keller, an
engineering manager at Excite(AT)Home.
</P>
<P>
   Inktomi, which counts 200 customers, sells Traffic Server for as
much as $24,000 a copy. And it requires a substantial piece of
hardware, like a Sun Sparc server, which is likely to cost as much
or more. These requisites have left an opening at the budget-minded
end of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing to fill this opening are companies like CacheFlow and
NetAppliance, which sell caching appliances _ small computers
preloaded with caching software. Novell, the office-network
software company, is also a player in this end of the cache market.
The company has deals with 13 major server manufacturers, including
IBM, Compaq and Dell, to sell hardware bundled with software.
Prices start as low as $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   CacheFlow, whose stock went public last November at $24 and now
trades at $34.25, says it will do for caching what Cisco Systems
did for routing _ even though Cisco has its own cache products.
CacheFlow offers a simple hardware box with its own operating
system and software that is designed to require little of the Web
operator's time or effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go out, do the installation and the customer never has to
think about us,'' said Brian M. NeSmith, president and chief
executive of CacheFlow, based in Sunnyvale, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   All of the cache vendors sell a product, be it hardware,
software or a mixture of both. Akamai, on the other hand, sells a
service, typically priced on a megabit-per-month basis.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai customers _ which include the Web sites of Apple
Computer, CBS, Microsoft and The New York Times _ must first run a
small program that selectively ``akamaizes'' portions of their
sites for delivering material over Akamai's servers. This process,
one that the individual user normally would not be aware of, takes
the URL, or address, that normally directs a browser request to the
server housing the information and converts the address to an ARL,
the designator for an Akamai server.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,750 or so Akamai servers worldwide are run for the company
by network operators like UUNet and Sprint. Akamai's software
determines which server is best suited for use by the person making
the request and then sends the ``akamaized'' content to that
server. Akamai officials contend that the process is much more
sophisticated than caching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Caching is 2 percent of the complexity of content delivery,''
said Daniel M. Lewin, who was a graduate student at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology when he co-founded Akamai in
1998 with Tom Leighton, a professor of applied mathematics there.
``The hard part of content delivery is figuring out what request
should go to what machine,'' said Lewin, 29, who is now Akamai's
chief technology officer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Akamai's president, Sagan, who is 41 and is a
former president of Time Inc. New Media, Akamai's executive suite
includes George H. Conrades, chairman and chief executive.
Conrades, 61, is the former chief executive of the networking
company BBN, now Genuity, and a former senior executive at IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say Akamai overstates the distinctions between
content distribution and caching, which they say is also a big part
of Akamai's service. ``Akamai deployed $4 million worth of caches
and accelerated Yahoo's performance,'' said Peter Christy, an
analyst with Jupiter Communications. ``Any of the caching companies
could have done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he concedes that Akamai has some truly innovative
technology, Christy said the company's real brilliance lay in its
business model, which might be described as caching plus network
management, all sold as a pay-as-you-go service.
</P>
<P>
   Christy says Akamai's pitch, that it can improve performance for
content providers, has more sizzle than Inktomi's claim that it can
reduce costs for Internet service providers. ``None of Inktomi's
customers can figure out how to get a consumer to pay more for
higher performance,'' he said. Akamai asks content providers, ``Are
you willing to pay to have your site perceived better by the
consumer?'' he said, ``and the answer is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Akamai's service is now used by more than 400 Web customers. But
the company is challenged by a pack of players, like Adero, Digital
Island and Exodus, that act as network hosts for companies that
operate Web sites and that have all formed partnerships with
Inktomi.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Akamai's potential rivals are even more daunting, like
mighty Intel, which started its own Web-hosting business last year
and has begun selling Inktomi's software with an Intel cache
server.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, many of these hosting companies own their own
networks. Akamai does not, instead piggybacking on network carrying
capacity from UUNet, Sprint and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Akamai has content distribution, which is good, but that's
just one piece,'' said Ruann Ernst, chairman and chief executive of
Digital Island, a company in San Francisco that went public last
June at $10 and whose stock closed on Friday at $25.875. Its
notable customers include CNBC.com, Intuit and The Los Angeles
Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are especially good at putting it all together in an
integrated way so they don't all look like different solutions,''
Ernst said. ``It's a huge market, and there will be room for a lot
of different business models because different customers will want
to buy in different ways.''

CIGAR AFICIONADO TRIES A NEW BLEND 
FIRST STEPHEN KING. NOW VLADIMIR PUTIN. 
FASHION EDITOR TO LEAVE FOR ARTISTS' HIVE
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, and sometimes a cigar
magazine, confronting the disappearing cigar-smoking fad, has to
make the word ``cigar'' almost disappear from its title.
</P>
<P>
   With the dwindling cigar market in mind, Marvin R. Shanken, the
founder, editor and publisher of Cigar Aficionado _ a magazine for
men who smoke cigars _ has redesigned the monthly. First published
in 1992, Cigar Aficionado became a hot title and won a National
Magazine Award for best Web site in 1999. But circulation peaked in
1997 at 384,000, and has since dropped to 291,000.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the June issue, which arrives on newsstands this
week, the title of the magazine has been altered: The word
``cigar,'' which was once about as big and fat as a Hoyo de
Monterrey Double Corona, is now barely the size of a half-smoked
cheroot. The word ``Aficionado'' dominates the cover, and Shanken
has added a new subtitle, ``The Good Life Magazine for Men.''
Coverage of cigars is relegated to its own penned-off section; the
June issue features an article about ``nine great spas,'' an
article by Camille Paglia on women in politics, and an essay by
Erica Jong on dogs. (``Poochkin died on the vet's operating table
... On rainy nights I seem to hear him scratching at the back door
to be let in.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that a lot of people, men, were not picking up the
magazine and giving it a chance because the name that came out was
Cigar, and Aficionado was underplayed,'' Shanken said. ``We wanted
to reposition it so that if you are a man who seeks the joys of the
good life you would at least give us a look. This way, if you're in
an airport and you're walking by, what jumps out at you is
`Aficionado.'''
</P>
<P>
   Shanken said that he would not rule out removing ``cigar''
completely from the magazine's cover.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel Goldman, a consumer products analyst at Merrill Lynch
and an observer of Cigar Aficionado magazine, said that cigar sales
have slumped dramatically in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bloom is off the cigar rose,'' Goldman said. ``It was a
huge fad that peaked about two years ago. And as far as I can tell,
the size of the word `cigar' on the cover of the magazine is
proportional to cigar sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanken said last week that he had not yet shown the redesign to
tobacco advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They trust us,'' he said.
</P>

<P>
   First Stephen King. Now Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   First came horror, then instant history: Russia's new president
Vladimir Putin is taking an electronic page from Stephen King and
is preparing to issue his translated memoirs in a digital book that
will be available at the end of April.
</P>
<P>
   The new age Russian president and former KGB spy is also
considering another technical innovation to drop the veil on the
facts of his own life: chat room discussions with Internet users on
the MSNBC Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way things are going,'' said Peter Osnos, Putin's
American publisher at PublicAffairs. ``The new president of Russia
is publishing in the U.S. through this array of digital channels
that represents how the world is changing.''
</P>
<P>
   To publish the book in bytes, PublicAffairs struck a deal with
netLibrary, the Boulder, Colo.-based digital bookseller. NetLibrary
obtained the exclusive rights to issue Putin's memoirs, ``First
Person'' in electronic form. That means that the book will be
available for reading online on a personal computer or on a Palm
Pilot or similar device from netLibrary's Peanut Press Web site.
</P>
<P>
   NetLibrary is also in final discussions to sell titles through
other e-book manufacturers that offer portable devices for reading.
And with this alliance to publish Putin's memoirs, the company is
poised to spend over $250,000 to market the book, a sum that a
small company like PublicAffairs could not afford.
</P>
<P>
   The book is not a weighty tome of history but a chatty personal
memoir that seeks to humanize the Russian president with
information on everything from his KGB past to his wife's shopping
habits to quality time with his young daughters, Masha and Katya
(``They see him more often on television than at home.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought this was absolutely the best way to show the true
power of an e-book,'' said netLibrary's chief marketing officer,
David Melancon. But that's just the English version; the wait for
the original Russian translation could last much longer than a
Moscow winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian version?'' said Melancon. ``I can tell you right
now that serving something in Cyrillic is not something we're able
to do.''

<P>
   Fashion Editor To Leave For Artists' Hive
</P>
<P>
   John Cheever once wrote that Yaddo, the 107-year-old artists'
colony in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., attracted ``all kinds _ lushes
down on their luck, men and women at the top of their powers,
nervous breakdowns, thieves, geniuses, cranky noblemen, and poets
who ate their peas off a knife.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, all those nervous breakdowns and pea-eating poets are going
to have a new president: Elaina Richardson, the editor in chief of
Elle magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Come again? The editor of a fashion magazine is going to run the
country's most august arts colony and temporary home to writers,
artists and composers like Truman Capote, Dorothy Parker, Aaron
Copland and Eudora Welty?
</P>
<P>
   Linda Collins, the head of the Yaddo search committee, points
out that Richardson, 38, has advanced degrees in literature from
Edinburgh University and Oxford University. And though her
credentials are a little different from those of Yaddo's current
president, Michael G. Sundell, who is retiring _ he is a former
English professor _ Collins said that no one had doubts after they
met with Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the fashion magazines go, Elle is really the most
intellectual and artistic of them,'' Collins said. ``But some of us
did stop to think: `But what about the fashion world. Is that what
we want?' But her background, her true nature and her personality
are intellectual. Just to be with her and hear her talk, we felt
that she was one of us, not one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Also important, Richardson convinced the group that she had
innovative ideas about fund-raising for Yaddo, which must
supplement its endowment every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said some interesting things that made us all sit up
straight on the subject of fund-raising,'' Collins said. ``We
thought, `Gosh, we are babes in the woods compared to this
woman.'''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said that she would stay at Elle until September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this might have appeared strange if I had come up
through the fashion side of the magazine world,'' Richardson said.
``But my background is much more from the arts and culture side of
things. I first found out about Yaddo from knowing a lot of the
attending artists, so I have always felt close to the ideas of the
place and what it is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Cheever, a writer who regularly attends Yaddo, said that
she could not anticipate any opposition to Richardson. ``There are
a lot of old fogies at Yaddo, but they're not fogies in that way,''
said Cheever, the daughter of John Cheever. ``They're writers, for
heaven's sake. It's not a bank!''

A PASSION FOR HARPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Ill.)  (Eds.: Please note that the word AT within parentheses has been
used in the 11th graf instead of the symbol, which is
non-transmittable to many newspaper systems.)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 1890s, a man named George Durkee lived in Chicago and
worked as a shop foreman at Lyon &AMP; Healy Harps Inc. Not much is
known about him _ at one point, a fire destroyed company records _
except that he supervised workers who assembled harps. Some elegant
concert harps were built from Durkee's own designs, and he won
several patents just as the 19th century came to a close. Over the
next few decades, and especially after the fire, his name
disappeared from company documents and his contribution to harp
design was forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year. Mary Jo Clogston made a mistake while browsing
on eBay, the Internet auction site, and found herself the shocked
owner of a $15,000 antique Lyon &AMP; Healy harp. It was a beautiful
harp, to be sure, one of the few covered in 24-karat gold leaf. But
Clogston, a 78-year-old widow with a passion for folk harps, had
not planned to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was aware of the reputation of Lyon &AMP; Healy's gold harp,''
Clogston said from her home in Boerne, Texas, outside San Antonio.
``I saw the reserve price and knew it was out of my range, so I
thought I'd just have the fun of bidding and let someone else have
the harp.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By accident I went beyond the reserve price and I got the
harp,'' she said, with a low laugh. That mistake eventually led her
to discover Durkee's work at Lyon &AMP; Healy (www.lyonhealy.com), and
to four of his harp patents from the 1890s.
</P>
<P>
   Clogston already had nearly a dozen folk harps _ smaller
counterparts to the antique 6-footer that was on its way to her
from a Florida dealer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really intend to become a collector,'' she said. ``I
get a little music catalog, and several years ago it had a little
harp in it that was in my price range, so I bought it.''
</P>
<P>
   That first harp turned out to be badly made, so Clogston got on
the Internet and discovered harp chat groups. The members advised
her to return the harp.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing led to another,'' she added. ``I was hooked, and I
started to find out about different types of harps. I bought
another one and thought, gee, I'll learn to play.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, she may have been following her family's example. Her
mother enrolled at the University of Texas at age 75 to study
music. Her son is a doctor, lawyer, pilot and real estate agent.
She devoted her life to keeping a home and raising her child, and
when she told her son she was spending $15,000 on a harp, he didn't
chide her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taken some chances and come out ahead,'' Clogston said,
``so I think he considers risk a part of the family history.''
</P>
<P>
   The Florida dealer who sold the gilded concert harp on eBay had
bought it at an estate sale and knew nothing about its background.
The instrument arrived intact, but Clogston found that at some
point it had been clumsily repaired and incorrectly reassembled.
Determined to play the harp, she went back to the Internet, where
she participates in two harp mailing lists:
harplist-(AT)onelist.com and harpcircle(AT)onelist.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harplist is kind of stiff,'' Clogston said. ``They hew to the
line and don't digress. But harpcircle is a lot of fun. Both are
very serious about harps.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one on either list knew anything about Clogston's newest
acquisition. The harp bore a brass plate that read ``Lyon and Healy
Makers Chicago No. 203 Manufactured Under Five Patents.'' So
Clogston went back to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a good friend, Harold Dayton, whom I have never met
face to face,'' she said of a Web pen pal. ``I'm not sure whose
idea it was first to check the patents, but we both went after it
with vim and vigor _ to find the patents, the history of the harp,
who made it and where it was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harold checked with the patent office and I tried looking on
the Internet under `patents.' The serial number is on the harp, so
I contacted Lyon &AMP; Healy and they told me the style number.''
</P>
<P>
   But they found no trace of the patents. The Patent and Trademark
Office offers patents online dating only to the 1970s. Then a
keyword search turned up a reference to MicroPatent, a patent and
trademark research company.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton sent an e-mail message inquiring about the harp patents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The documents they were looking for were very old,'' said Lynn
Tellefsen, a vice president for marketing at Information Holdings,
the parent company of MicroPatent (www.micropatent.com). ``You
can't get them digitally anywhere, though the patent office has
something on paper somewhere. But they are part of the MicroPatent
database that isn't available to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Tellefsen said that a researcher at MicroPatent started with
Lyon &AMP; Healy and the patent class codes that existed in the late
19th century, and narrowed the search through a process of
elimination until she found the patents Clogston was looking for.
``As you can imagine, there aren't too many patents in that
category from that time, so the database was very small,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   MicroPatent sent copies of five patents to Clogston free, and
she was thrilled to learn that four of them covered the design of
her harp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The patents told me that the different components of the harp
were invented by one man, George Durkee,'' Clogston said. ``They
have drawings of the different parts he invented. I learned just
enough about the harp's construction because he spells it out,
movement by movement. I can look at the drawings and tell where
they are different from my harp.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The patents made a lot of sense,'' she added, ``and I can see
how my harp evolved.''
</P>
<P>
   The patents also allowed Clogston to date the 77-pound harp to
1895.
</P>
<P>
   It is currently in pieces on her floor, and she is teaching
herself how to restore it, using the patents, manuals and advice
from experts. A professional restorer wanted $500 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me what books to get, how to start the work, and said
he'd answer my questions,'' she said, ``until I pestered him with
so many that he asked me to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   George Durkee won patent numbers 437,917, 437,918 and 437,919 on
Oct. 7, 1890, and patent 438,038 on April 23, 1895. The patent from
1895, Clogston said, is ``the one that looks the most like my
harp.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to learn to play it,'' she added. ``My harp, when new,
was a jewel with a beautiful tone, and I expect it to be the same
when I get through with it.''
</P>
<P>
   (Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.)

`SEINFELD' SECOND BANANAS ARE ENJOYING SECOND CAREERS 
BY STUART ELLIOTT  
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost two years after America watched the final episode of
``Seinfeld,'' the second bananas on that popular series are
enjoying second careers in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Avenue has long been enamored of the actors who took the
principal roles on ``Seinfeld'': Jason Alexander, who played
George; Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Elaine; Michael Richards, Kramer; and
Jerry Seinfeld, who in a demonstration of his extraordinary range
and ability portrayed Jerry Seinfeld. Among the blue-chip brands
they have peddled are AT&AMP;T, American Express, Clairol, Tommy
Hilfiger, Pepsi-Cola, Rold Gold and Visa.
</P>
<P>
   But now, many of the actors who played supporting characters on
``Seinfeld'' are also turning up in campaigns for products ranging
from automobiles and candy to soft drinks and prescription drugs.
The sidekicks taking center stage include Estelle Harris, who
played George's mother; Wayne Knight, Newman; Phil Morris, Jackie
Chiles; and Patrick Warburton, Puddy.
</P>
<P>
   Such interest among marketers and agencies in characters with
smaller roles is unusual after a show ends production. Typically,
ad work goes to the actors who were the better known stars of a
series, even though it almost always costs more to hire them than
their supporting cast. Examples include Barbara Billingsley, June
Cleaver on ``Leave It to Beaver''; Sherman Hemsley and Isabel
Sanford, George and Louise Jefferson on ``The Jeffersons''; and
Florence Henderson, Carol Brady on ``The Brady Bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Seinfeld'' broke rules for the content of TV sitcoms;
conventional wisdom held that viewers would not warm to characters
who were whiny, New Yorkers or identifiably Jewish. Now the show is
breaking rules on the selling front.
</P>
<P>
   ```Seinfeld' was so long running,'' said Tom Lom, managing
director at Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi Health Care in New York, which is
using Knight at his Newmanian worst to personify the flu bug in a
campaign for the prescription drug Relenza sold by Glaxo Wellcome.
``And it's still on the air in reruns.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So people remember the characters from the prime-time run,''
he added, ``and still get exposed to the characters through the
reruns.''
</P>
<P>
   The first episode of ``Seinfeld'' appeared on NBC in May 1990
and the last episode appeared in May 1998. The reruns, syndicated
by the Columbia Tristar Television Distribution unit of Sony
Pictures Entertainment, are shown on 224 stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the show is not on, the familiarity is there,''
said John Clarke, chief advertising officer at Dr Pepper/Seven Up
in Plano, Tex., part of Cadbury Schweppes. For the Diet Dr Pepper
soft drink brand, Young &AMP; Rubicam Advertising in New York created a
commercial with a courtroom theme featuring Morris in his persona
as the slick lawyer Chiles.
</P>
<P>
   Morris also donned his Chiles regalia _ mustache, glasses,
stylish suit _ for two humorous spots for the Odyssey minivan sold
by the American Honda Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plenty of people in the minivan category, young families,
watched or are watching `Seinfeld,''' said Larry Postaer, executive
vice president and creative services director at the Honda agency,
Rubin Postaer &AMP; Associates in Santa Monica, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In creating the commercials, ``we thought it might be fun to
bring on a celebrity lawyer as a surprise,'' Postaer said. ``But
the real ones don't do that _ or shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This gave us someone who is recognized,'' he added, ``and
funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris is not the only ``Seinfeld'' second banana doing double
duty for advertisers. Warburton has worked for the Cadillac
division of General Motors and the M&AMP;M's line of candy sold by a
division of Mars Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed all the shows he was on, but when he played a cop in
the Cadillac commercial I came into the office and asked my group:
`That guy is great. Who is he?''' recalled Charles R. Miesmer, vice
chairman and senior executive creative director at the M&AMP;M's
agency, BBDO New York, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the
Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every so often, like in sports, a team gets assembled that has
four or five Hall of Famers on it,'' Miesmer said. ``That show had
so many actors who were so good.''
</P>
<P>
   One benefit of using secondary characters was described by
Patrick Sherwood, president of the Los Angeles and Troy, Mich.,
offices of the Cadillac agency, D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles, part
of the B Com3 Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a little bit below the radar in a commercial
context,'' he said, ``which was important for us because we wanted
a different voice for the Cadillac brand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick Warburton was seen as engaging, entertaining and
credible, not a shill,'' he added. ``Coming from an ensemble cast,
he had an ability to react and a degree of spontaneity that was
really refreshing. He was so successful, he did several spots for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the appeal of the ``Seinfeld'' second-stringers, not all
of them can expect to be on the first team for advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Clarke at Dr Pepper/Seven Up said he would not
consider a commercial with Larry Thomas, who played the unwelcoming
proprietor of a soup store.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to encourage people to come in,'' Clarke said,
laughing, ``not chase them out.'' &QL;

A WOMAN'S TALE OF CHILDHOOD NEGLECT SURPRISES HER PARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The article ``Party's Over,'' in the April issue of Allure, is a
rich tale, full of family intrigue, sex and alcohol abuse. It reads
with the breathy pace of a Danielle Steele novel, complete with
liquor-soaked boat excursions in the Caribbean and a heroine who
wakes up woozily in a series of strangers' beds on expensive
linens.
</P>
<P>
   In the article, Taylor Stein _ blonde habitue of the Manhattan
party circuit, daughter of the nightclub owner Howard Stein and
granddaughter of Charles (Ruby) Stein, a loan shark connected to
the mob _ speaks at length about how the childhood neglect she
suffered at the hands of her parents contributed to her alcoholism.
As told by Judith Newman, a veteran magazine writer who has written
for publications like Harper's and Mademoiselle, it is a sad story,
woven with family history and psychological abuse.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one question of journalism ethics raised by the
article: The magazine never checked out Stein's stories with her
parents, and in fact, as it points out in the article, obtained the
interview on the condition that it would not do so. Now both
parents charge that the piece is a fabrication by their daughter, a
cynical bid for attention in a world where any press _ no matter
how embarrassing _ is considered good press.
</P>
<P>
   Allure's editor in chief, Linda Wells, said the agreement was
legitimate under the circumstances and that it checked her story
with other sources ``in a position to know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our real objective was to provide readers a piece about one
woman's triumph over alcoholism,'' she said. ``The intention was to
have her point of view and recollections come through.''
</P>
<P>
   The charges leveled by Stein vary. She is quoted saying her
father was a playboy and ``every woman, every celebrity, every
hooker came first.'' Stein characterized her mother as an abusive
adulterer whom the pre-adolescent Stein once found in the living
room at 4 a.m., music blaring, dancing with a man other than Stein.
When she was 13, she said, after two months away from home, her
parents neglected to pick her up from the summer-camp bus, and she
walked home to an empty apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Stein said in the article that she began drinking soon after,
sneaking alcohol to school in her ``Herbie Rides Again'' thermos.
And when her drinking problem got serious her parents appeared to
ignore it.
</P>
<P>
   It is an eventually inspirational story _ Stein attended
Alcoholics Anonymous and says she no longer drinks _ even if the
allegations against her parents are harsh.
</P>
<P>
   Stein, a restaurateur and nightclub owner who owns Au Bar, said
that the article took him completely by surprise. He said he was
most shocked by the fact that the magazine agreed to publish
``terrible, horrifying things'' about him, without considering
whether his daughter was angry or disturbed or had a vendetta
against her parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complete fiction,'' Stein said. ``It's so depressing
that people who don't know me will think that this is the kind of
father I was, and that Helen was that kind of mother.'' Stein said
that the story about summer camp was ``hallucinatory.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein, the article reads, ``had a taste for'' liquor, ``but he
was always in control.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't `have a taste for' liquor, with all that phrase
implies,'' Stein said. ``I drink one cognac after dinner with a
cigar as I have done for 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The article said, ``Stein grew up in a drinking family,'' where
she says, two or three bottles of wine were consumed at meals.
Stein said he did not drink wine, nor was wine a staple at family
meals.
</P>
<P>
   The Steins are now divorced, and the former Mrs. Stein, Helen
Glasser, lives in Puerto Rico. She did not hear about the article
until her son called her from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a state of shock,'' Glasser said. ``This all makes me
very sad, and I do not want to fight with my daughter. She made us
sound like uncaring, unsupervising parents, and I wish someone from
the magazine had called us to check that out.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Stein, Stein's brother, said that he and his sister were
raised in a largely happy home, its security only threatened by the
divorce of their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then we had a wonderful stepfather,'' he said. Michael
Stein offered a psychological explanation for his sister's stories:
``I think the problem is that she runs with a crowd where
publicity, of any kind, has a certain value.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stein stood her ground last week, and said she had no
intention of hurting her parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, you tell your
story and people don't question whether it is true or whether it is
not true,'' she said. ``It is just your story. I did not lie, and
my parents have a right to defend themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein did not answer a question about why they were not allowed
to defend themselves in the article.

   MARKET-MARKETPLACE (New York) _ Nearly 13 years ago, investors
stunned by the worst stock market week in memory spent the weekend
pondering whether a great bull market was over. On the following
Monday, so many of them decided to sell that the Dow Jones
industrial average plunged 22.6 percent, or 508 points. Oct. 19,
1997, became known as Black Monday. In the years since, there have
been many bad days for the stock market, but no week as stunning in
its devastation as the past week. Now, as then, investors have
large profits they could choose to protect by fleeing a market that
had seemed so promising only weeks before. The decisions made over
the weekend by investors will largely determine whether last week's
slide in stock prices continues. By Floyd Norris.

 &HT;    EDS: 2nd graf contains fix on U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention
 &HT;    Heat deaths linked to medicationsBy Steve Bennish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Findings from health authorities have doubled the
number of deaths related to psychiatric medications taken by the
mentally ill during last summer's fierce Midwestern heat wave.
</P>
<P>
   New figures from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta and the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office
in Chicago show that at least 23 of the estimated 300 dead were
mentally ill people who took medicines that made them especially
vulnerable to death from intense summer heat. The total number
could be higher still since not all coroners where heat deaths
occurred performed toxicology tests.
</P>
<P>
   A Dayton Daily News review of coroner reports immediately
following the July 21 to Aug. 3 heat wave found that at least 10
who died from heat stroke in Ohio, Missouri, Wisconsin and Kentucky
took such medications. The medications interfere with the body's
thermo-regulatory system, hazards known to physicians but seldom
publicized.
</P>
<P>
   Toxicology results from autopsies of 86 of the 116 reported dead
in Chicago _ test results not available last summer _ found that 10
had anti-psychotic or anti-depressant medications in their
bloodstreams at the time of death. Common drugs included Mellaril,
Elavil, Prozac and Zoloft.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question people on anti-psychotic drugs have to be
more cautious in the sun and heat,'' Chicago chief medical examiner
Edmund Donoghue said. ``They are vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   The test results also found 20 with alcohol in their systems,
four with cocaine, and two with morphine.
</P>
<P>
   In Cincinnati, a case study by the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control examined 17 of the 18 reported heat deaths. It found that
four of the dead had prescriptions for medication with heat risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Results of a case-control study showed a particularly high
risk among young people with mental problems,'' the CDC report
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had four people on medication that can cause heat stroke,''
said Carl Parrott, Hamilton County Coroner. ``The goal now is to
help refine the response to these heat emergencies.''
</P>
<P>
   The CDC found that all of the Cincinnati dead had known risk
factors besides mental illness, including social isolation and no
air conditioning at their residence. None of the victims had
visited an official or private cooling shelter.
</P>
<P>
   In all, eight of the 17 had mental problems, the CDC said.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio's 24 fatalities prompted Ohio Rep. Samuel Britton,
D-Cincinnati, to propose a bill requiring air conditioning in group
and nursing homes and assisted living centers. The bill also
requires air conditioning in housing for those older than 65. House
Bill 474 is currently awaiting action in the house Health,
Retirement and Aging Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC report recommended an emphasis on tracking people at
risk and increasing outreach, tightening regulations to limit
temperatures in assisted care facilities, and providing more
training for those who deal with heat-sensitive people.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Rubin, acting chief of the CDC's Health Studies Branch,
said air conditioning is a key factor in surviving a heat wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the one overwhelmingly protective factor,'' she said.
``Even limited exposure to air conditioning. It's part of most city
heat plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati Health Commissioner Adcock, who requested the CDC
study, said he supports Britton's legislation because a deadly heat
stroke can suddenly affect those on medication without many obvious
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the lessons we learned is that it is not enough to
simply monitor,'' he said. ``We need a preventive strategy that
would allow temperatures to be maintained appropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   As yet, the state Department of Health, which inspects group
homes, hasn't taken a position on Britton's bill. Marijean Siehl,
director of public affairs, said the department is concerned air
conditioning could cost group home operators too much and that
residents might squabble over the air conditioning and that the
department would also have to inspect the air conditioning units.

CANADIAN PRESS BARON ASSAILS BISHOP AS WELL AS STRIKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain)  (Eds., $17,000 figure is CQ; amount is U.S. dollars) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta _ Conrad Black, Canada's mightiest press baron,
has long delighted in a muscular give-and-take of insults. But in
his latest round, he may have overreached, going beyond usual
left-wing and unionist targets, and landing a punch on the
hierarchy of his adopted faith, Roman Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   In his newspaper here, The Calgary Herald, Black wrote early
this month that the local bishop was a Leninist-style ``useful
idiot,'' telling readers: ``If your jumped-up little twerp of a
bishop thinks I'm not a very good Catholic, I think he's a prime
candidate for exorcism.''
</P>
<P>
   The sin of the bishop, Frederick B. Henry, was to publicly urge
Black to negotiate with workers in a five-month strike at the
newspaper. Joining the attack, The National Post, Black's new
national newspaper, printed a column by Ted Byfield, a conservative
western Canadian journalist, calling the bishop ``Red Freddy'' and
bemoaning, ``The west seems fated to have at least one pinko
bishop.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Calgary's Christian leaders said in a statement
Wednesday: ``We condemn that defamatory and libelous statement
calling Bishop Fred Henry a `jumped-up twerp,' an `idiot,' and a
`pinko Commie'. These statements are so outrageous and un-Christian
as to merit no further comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Canada's oil-boom city, a conservative stronghold, the
strike at Black's newspaper has become a cause celebre of labor _
overshadowing even the grievances of the 206 striking workers.
</P>
<P>
   A lightning rod for liberal Canadians who detest Black's caustic
conservatism, the picket line has drawn the novelist Margaret
Atwood; Maude Barlow, chairwoman of the Council of Canadians, a
nationalist group, and leaders of the left-wing New Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   The press lord has obliged the left by playing the role of
capitalist ogre. When Andy Marshall, a striking Herald reporter,
asked Black, on a visit here, why ``do you insult your once-valued
employees?'' Black responded: ``We're not. We're amputating
gangrenous limbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Across Canada, union members and their allies have called for a
boycott of The Calgary Herald and The National Post, Black's
18-month-old paper. Unmoved, Black wrote a letter in January to Jim
Sinclair, British Columbia's top union leader, saying, ``If you
wish to cancel a subscription to The National Post (presumably as a
result of lip strain after too ambitious a foray into bisyllabic
reading), contact its circulation department.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from London, Black said ``the
commercial impact of the strike is virtually zero,'' far below the
25 percent drop in circulation union leaders here have claimed. He
added, ``We have not lost any of the advertising, except for some
from happy-clappy '60s churchmen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bishop overreached by sticking his episcopal nose in
things he didn't know anything about,'' he asserted. As for the
labor dispute, he predicted, ``The strike will go for two years and
then we won't have to keep their jobs anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Accustomed to using great leverage over union, corporate and
political opponents, Black, 55, operates from a formidable power
base. His Southam chain owns 61 Canadian daily newspapers, or 57
percent of the total number, the largest concentration of newspaper
ownership in any major Western nation.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the religious leaders' press conference here showed, he
increasingly encounters checks on his press power. Last June, Prime
Minister Jean Chretien moved to block Queen Elizabeth II from
granting a lifetime peerage to Black, who holds dual
Canadian-British citizenship. Outraged, the billionaire press baron
sued the prime minister for about $17,000, charging abuse of power
in denying him the chance to sit in the British House of Lords.
Last month, an Ontario judge dismissed Black's claim, but he is
appealing.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Black recognized limits on his ability to expand in
Canada when he turned down an opportunity to buy The Winnipeg Free
Press, the largest of five Canadian newspapers put up for sale by
Thomson Corp. Acknowledging that the newspaper would be ``a nice
fit,'' he told analysts, ``but I think in general we don't need
more political controversy than we already have.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Black, who also owns The Daily Telegraph of London
and The Jerusalem Post, aborted a foray into the New York newspaper
world when he abandoned an attempt to buy The New York Observer. In
the interview, he said, ``Just before we were going to get serious
about an agreement, we got a good look at the numbers, and they
were in stark contrast to how they had been presented.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Arthur L. Carter, publisher of The Observer, said:
``It's hard to believe, because he knew the numbers for six months.
I think the issue dealt around editorial control.''
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, Black, though awaiting audits, said The Post had
passed The Globe and Mail of Toronto in national sales, going over
the 300,000 mark. The new paper's losses have dropped in half, he
said, predicting that it would turn a profit in the last quarter of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Strikers here charge that the Southam chain subsidizes The Post,
much the way that Gannett subsidized USA Today until it turned a
profit, a decade after its appearance in 1982. Referring to Black's
Hollinger Corp., the owner of the Southam chain, Marshall charged:
``The Herald has been a cash cow for Hollinger in Canada. They bled
it, and they intend to bleed it, for The National Post.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Dan Gaynor, publisher of The Calgary Herald, said
at the newspaper's modern new building here, ``Southam and
Hollinger have had significant profits, certainly enough to launch
a successful new product.''
</P>
<P>
   By Gaynor's count, 40 percent of the striking workers have
returned to work. But the attack on local church people seems to
have given those who are on strike a fresh ally.
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly is very aggressive and he usually gets his way so
he was surprised to see a bishop stand up to him,'' said Bishop
Henry, the spiritual leader of 200,000 Catholics in southern
Alberta. ``But, so far he hasn't been able to intimidate me. And I
have not backed down.''

 &HT;    PIVOTAL WEEK IN ELIAN CASE HAS PAINFUL ANNIVERSARIES
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ What could be a pivotal week in the long-running Elian
Gonzalez saga will also be a week of painful anniversaries for the
main players in the drama, with both sides hoping they won't add a
new unpleasant date to their calendars.
</P>
<P>
   With the stalemate on hold awaiting a key court ruling, Cuban
exiles will pause Monday to recall the failed U.S.-backed invasion
of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs, a disaster that took place on April 17,
1961, leaving 200 invaders dead and 1,200 captured.
</P>
<P>
   The exiles have already been reminding Attorney General Janet
Reno of the April 19, 1993 tragedy at Waco, Texas, when Reno
ordered FBI agents to storm the compound of the Branch Davidian
religious cult. A horrible fire ensued, killing about 75 Davidians
</P>
<P>
   The two black days in U.S. history have come together in the
Elian saga in a strange nexus, at least for the exiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans don't know about the history and the reality of
Cuba,'' said Eliseo Rodriguez(cq), a former Cuban political
prisoner who has joined the protests outside Elian's Little Havana
home. ``They don't understand what a big mistake the government is
making. But I fear what will happen if they try to force things.
There will be trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno has made it clear she wants to avoid any confrontation over
the boy, and even flew to Miami last week to try to broker a
compromise by negotiating personally with the Florida family.
</P>
<P>
   But her bid failed, and both sides are now awaiting a ruling by
the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, which could set
the stage for a resolution to the stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, the court issued a temporary ban on Elian's
removal from the United States. The court is expected to rule early
this week on whether the ban should stay in force until a May 11
hearing stemming from the Miami family's lawsuit in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have asked the court to order the family to
turn Elian over to his father, even if the court rules that the boy
should remain in the United States pending the outcome of the May
11 hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, who has been living in the home of a top Cuban
diplomat in the Washington, D.C. area since April 6, has promised
in court documents to remain in the United States until after the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the Atlanta court grants the government's request,
the Miami relatives insist they will never take Elian out of their
Little Havana home, although they won't resist if federal officers
come for him.
</P>
<P>
   That sets up a potentially violent confrontation with vehement
Cuban exile protestors who have maintained a vigil near the home
for months, and vow to form a human chain to protect Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when Reno's first deadline for handing over the boy
approached, thousands of protestors packed the streets surrounding
the house, creating a nightmare scenario for any extraction effort.
The deadline fell moot after the Atlanta court issued its temporary
ban on Elian's removal from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for a compromise remain dim, as key players for both sides
held to their positions in Sunday television interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to try to do this in a peaceful manner,'' White House
Chief of Staff John Podesta told CNN. ``But ultimately the rule of
law must prevail and the administration is prepared to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials have reportedly been preparing a
plan to take the boy from the house should the family continue
refusing to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   But the family shows no signs of backing down.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Reno's insistence that Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro
Gonzalez, is now violating the law by withholding the boy, the
family believes it is within its rights, said Spencer Eig, one of
their attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lazaro Gonzalez will comply with the law,'' Eig said. ``He
will stand aside and cry and his heart will break if they come for
Elian. But he is a legal resident of this country and he can't be
ordered to do their dirty work.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the bad blood between the branches of the family
continues to simmer.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami family has outraged Elian's father by accusing him of
abusing Elian and the boy's mother. They also released a
controversial home video showing the boy telling his father he
doesn't want to go back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Elian's father say the Miami family has made it
difficult for Gonzalez to talk to his son by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Miami relatives allowed a Miami Herald reporter
into their home while Elian spoke with his father in a call. They
boy spent 20 minutes talking with his father, and then blew kisses
into the telephone as he hung up, the Herald reported.
</P>
<P>
   The father, Juan Miguel Gonzales, attended church services in
Washington on Sunday and, speaking in Spanish through an
interpreter, thanked parishioners for their support.

A FRESH SPIN ON `AFFINITY PORTALS' TO THE INTERNET 
BY BON TEDESCHI  
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, with Internet merchants projecting losses well
into the foreseeable future, it seemed the only consumer-oriented
companies that might actually profit from the World Wide Web were
portals like Yahoo and America Online, the popular gateways to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs saw the coming pileup in that market, and quickly
migrated to so-called ``affinity portals'' _ gateways aimed at
every imaginable slice of the Internet population. Hobbies,
vocations, political parties and sexual orientations all soon had
their own portals _ if not several of them.
</P>
<P>
   But those businesses, too, have proven generally unprofitable,
given the proliferation of such Web sites and the mammoth marketing
budgets required to attract users. Now, with financing for new
portals dried up, a fresh spin on the idea is emerging. And
analysts said the approach could breathe new life into the
``affinity portal'' concept.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than spend millions persuading Republicans or union
members, for instance, to come to a portal designed for them,
companies are now working with associations that already cater to
such groups to build portals aimed at their own memberships. In
theory, at least, this approach puts a sane ceiling on marketing
costs, ensures a loyal user base and promises a free flow of
revenue from advertising and commercial transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The company with the most momentum in this area, analysts said,
is iBelong, which began operating in 1998. The business was
co-founded by Shikhar Ghosh, the chairman of Open Market, a
software company, and Howard Kessler, chief executive of Kessler
Financial Services, which is a leading marketer of affinity credit
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Since November, iBelong has rolled out 41 portals on behalf of
organizations that include the AFL-CIO, the National Federation of
Republican Women, and the National Association of Underwater
Instructors. It is wrapping up agreements with other national
organizations with memberships exceeding 100,000 people, Ghosh
said.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO, for example, has opened an umbrella site for the
organization and 13 sites for individual labor unions, like the
Teamsters and the Communications Workers of America. IBelong serves
as the group's Internet provider, selling wholesale Internet access
to each organization at about $12 a month a user, which the groups
can then price as they wish.
</P>
<P>
   IBelong also builds and maintains a Web portal for each group,
at no additional charge. That portal, which becomes the start-up
page for subscribers, includes the kinds of features that users
would find on other portals, including e-mail, shopping, chat
areas, news and financial information, among others. The difference
is that the content for each organization is tailored to that
group's interests.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's sports news on the Teamsters site
(http://teamsters.workingfamilies.com), for example, included
information not on scores, but on sports labor disputes, including
the story of a $50 million lawsuit brought against ABC by a
sportscaster, Donna deVarona. In the shopping area, users find
``worker friendly'' items sold by manufacturers with unionized work
forces. For example, union-friendly shoppers can purchase Callaway
golf clubs, which are made by members of the United Steelworkers of
America, or Easter candy from See's, whose workers also are
unionized.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosh said iBelong pays marketing costs to raise awareness of
each group's site among its membership. In return, the groups sign
a five-year contract, give iBelong 75 percent of the revenue
generated from shopping and advertising on the site, and agree to
help iBelong market the site within their organizations. Internal
marketing is typically done through newsletters, e-mail and
publicity at trade shows, executives said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Leslie Tolf, assistant to the president of the
AFL-CIO, the organization's iBelong portals will serve primarily as
a communication vehicle, rather than a revenue source. ``Ideally,
we'd like to get activists interested in a much deeper level of
involvement through this,'' Tolf said. ``This would be great for
things like organizing, political campaigns and spreading the word
about bargaining agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, the ``worker friendly'' shopping areas have been
highly successful so far, even though the organization has yet to
begin its marketing campaign. Roughly 20 percent of those who visit
the shopping area buy something, Tolf said, a so-called conversion
rate that dwarfs that of many other online retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Tolf said one of the obstacles to developing acceptance among
the AFL-CIO's 13 million members is that just 60 percent of the
membership own computers. Of that group, 70 percent have Internet
access. To solve this problem, iBelong and the AFL-CIO are
negotiating with Gateway and IBM to sell their computers at
undisclosed, ``but large,'' discounts to members, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, analysts said one of the strengths of iBelong's approach
is that, by aggregating many users, it can extract bulk discounts
from Internet providers, content partners and manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBelong's whole approach makes a lot of sense,'' said Charlene
Li, analyst with Forrester Research, an Internet consulting firm.
Since these affiliated groups already exist, she said, ``you don't
have to go out and create them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only problem is,'' she said, ``executing is a little
harder than these companies expect.''
</P>
<P>
   One Web-affinity company, WebGalaxy, suspended operations on
March 31, just three weeks after announcing that demand for its
United Labor Online affinity portal had ``exceeded initial
estimates.'' The company's Web site, and that of United Labor
Online, were not operating last week, and WebGalaxy's president,
John Irvine, did not return calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies, including MyWay.com, MyPersonal.com and the
Netscape-Sun Microsystems venture iPlanet, are faring better in
this field. MyPersonal.com, which is based in Emeryville, Calif.,
has rolled out about 20 affinity portals on behalf of college
alumni associations. (MyPersonal.com distributes news from The New
York Times on the Web, among other material.
</P>
<P>
   IPlanet, meanwhile, says it is testing its new Portal Server
product with more than 40 customers, whose names the company
declined to disclose. The iPlanet effort differs from others in
that it features a software package that permits groups and
businesses to create and maintain their own portals. But like its
competitors, iPlanet allows customers to choose from a host of
portal features _ including chat and news _ that they can tailor to
a specific group or company's interests.
</P>
<P>
   According to John Fanelli, iPlanet's director of product
marketing, the software will cost between $50,000 and $180,000,
depending on the number of users it is intended to serve. At the
lowest price level, the software serves a minimum of 5,000 users,
Fanelli said, adding that the commercial version would be
introduced in May.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a captive audience to rely on, the affinity portals
may have a difficult time retaining a consistent and active user
base, said Li, of Forrester. That, in turn, could undermine their
long-term revenue hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest risk of all is that they do all this work and no
traffic materializes,'' she said. ``They're betting that users will
start and stay with their groups, but my bet is that they'll start
there, then develop their own habits.''

ISRAELI MINISTER COULD FACE SEXUAL ASSAULT CHARGES
</HEADLINE>
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Israeli police Sunday recommended that
Transportation Minister Yitzhak Mordechai be prosecuted on three
counts of sexual assault, dealing a humiliating blow to the former
general, who ran for prime minister last year as the first
Sephardic candidate in Israel's history.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai, 55, stepped down temporarily from his post when the
police began their investigation of a complaint by a 23-year-old
employee in the Transportation Ministry. He said Sunday that he
would resign from the cabinet if the attorney general followed the
police recommendation to file charges against him. That is
considered likely but not definite.
</P>
<P>
   It is a sad tumble for Mordechai, an Iraqi-born career soldier
who fought his way up through the ranks, facing down discrimination
against Middle Eastern immigrants, until he reached the pinnacle:
army chief of staff and then defense minister.
</P>
<P>
   He is the leader of the new Center Party, a group of six members
of parliament who chose him as their candidate for prime minister
in a failed attempt to break the hold of the two major parties,
Labor and Likud. Mordechai, expecting a very poor showing, bowed
out of the race at the 11th hour and threw his support behind Ehud
Barak, the Labor candidate and now the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am innocent and guiltless,'' Mordechai said in a statement
Sunday. ``I intend to fight with all my might for justice and my
good name.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli police began their investigation with the complaint
by the woman, who had worked as Mordechai's subordinate. When their
investigation became public, they received many other allegations
that Mordechai had ``forcibly performed indecent acts'' on women
during his army career and subsequent political life, the police
report said.
</P>
<P>
   In several instances, the statute of limitations had expired,
the police said. But they gathered evidence that seemed to validate
claims by three women. Two involved alleged assaults that took
place in Mordechai's home, one in 1996, when he was already defense
minister, and the other in 1992, when he was a general. The third
was the Transportation Ministry worker. The women said Mordechai
had attempted to force himself on them, kissing them and trying to
fondle them.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-old-woman originally turned for help to Zehava Gal-on, a
leftist lawmaker. Gal-on and Avraham Burg, the speaker of
parliament, urged the woman to file a complaint with the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has done two things,'' Gal-on said of the woman. ``She has
strengthened herself. And she has conveyed a message to women that
you have to complain, that things are not to be swept under the
carpet any longer, that the rules of the game have changed _ one
may not attack women simply because one is in a senior position and
no one would dare file a complaint.''

NEW ECONOMY COLUMN: DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGY FOR INTERNET MUSIC
SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The major record companies BMG and Sony Music Entertainment
recently announced long-awaited plans to sell their music online
via digital downloads. But the fine print suggests that mainstream
Internet users are not going to buy their music digitally any time
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the promise of digital downloads for the masses, the
technical challenges could continue to confine the audience mainly
to that breed of technology-minded, time-wealthy human known as the
college student.
</P>
<P>
   Take the statement from BMG, which focused on the fact that the
company had selected a half-dozen _ count 'em, six _ different
technology partners to put its music online and to protect it from
pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Even describing BMG's approach is rather complicated. But if you
can imagine having to download a different piece of software,
depending on whether you want to buy a digital single by Christina
Aguilera, Dave Matthews or Carlos Santana, then you begin to get a
sense of the friction-free digital economy, BMG-style. (By the way,
the portable devices for playing the music in the various
anti-piracy formats are not yet widely available.)
</P>
<P>
   The record companies, though, say they have no choice but to
concede such complications if they want to start making music
available online. ``We want to make sure our artists' music is
widely available, accessible and protected,'' said Kevin Conroy,
senior vice president of new technology for BMG. ``We don't believe
that any single technology can deliver on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ready or not, the record companies are under pressure to make
their music available over the Internet. They need to be responsive
to investors, to take advantage of a potentially huge market
opportunity, and to head off the persistent problem of online music
piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Forcing the issue are some Internet users who are freely
trafficking in copyrighted music online, seemingly oblivious to the
concept of theft. The music labels say that such trafficking _
often involving copyrighted music that is digitally copied and
distributed via the Internet's infiniteness _ costs the labels and
the recording artists tens of millions of dollars a year in lost
sales and royalties.
</P>
<P>
   College students, while not the only ones to blame, have become
piracy's poster children. They have motive: an abiding interest in
recorded music. And they have the opportunity: the time and
technical skills to navigate the Net for music, download it and
``rip'' their own CDs to place on the Net for others in an easily
traded software format called MP3.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for the record industry has been to find a way to
encode its own intellectual property so that, once paid for and
downloaded by a buyer, the music can be stored and listened to only
by the buyer. In other words, it cannot be easily pirated.
</P>
<P>
   Developing this copyright protection turns out to be no small
technological challenge. The record industry, in concert with
electronics makers in a forum called the Secure Digital Music
Initiative, has spent over a year working out technical standards
to achieve such a goal. The real fruits of that effort are
scheduled to be on the market in the next six months in the form of
portable devices that will not play songs that have been pirated.
</P>
<P>
   So it represents no small victory for record labels and fans of
their mainstream music that Sony and BMG have decided that they are
ready to start selling music online. Sony Music, home to Pearl Jam
and Lauryn Hill, among others, plans to start selling singles from
its Web site later this month. The songs will cost $2.49 to $3.49,
roughly equivalent to prices of singles on CD or tape.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, BMG says it plans to sell singles online by this
summer, with entire albums to be available later in the year. BMG
has not disclosed pricing, but in its tests and promotions in
recent months singles have sold for $1.99.
</P>
<P>
   But for customers, at least in the early going, the psychic
costs could be much higher. BMG announced that it would make music
available in three different copyright-protecting formats from
three competing companies: IBM, InterTrust Technologies and
Microsoft. To process secure sales transactions, BMG chose to
license competing technologies from Reciprocal and Digital World
Services.
</P>
<P>
   The BMG announcement drew criticism from operators of Web sites
that both sell songs and offer them free in the MP3 format. These
sites do not traffic in pirated material but in music from
independent artists who are worried more about building an audience
than about preventing piracy. Operators of these sites contend that
the record labels are trying to treat consumers as guinea pigs for
testing different secure formats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to support three different word-processor programs
on your computer?'' said Gene Hoffman, president and chief
executive of e-music, a Web site that sells MP3 songs for 99 cents
a song and $2.99 an album. ``It's great they're entering the
market,'' Hoffman said. ``But they make it very confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   Conroy of BMG conceded that, for the near term, consumers might
need to have software capable of processing more than one format,
depending on which one any given song is encoded in. But longer
term, he said, ``we want to move as quickly as possible into
narrowing the choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he said the consumer could win, because the keepers of
the different formats will be forced to compete to prove they offer
the most user-friendly and secure way of downloading and buying
music.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit of a bake-off,'' said Andrea Cook Fleming, vice
president of Liquid Audio, the sixth of BMG's technology partners
in digital music. BMG has licensed Liquid Audio to merge the
different digital rights systems under a single umbrella system to
make it easier for BMG to coordinate the various formats. ``They
want to create a competitive marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   All this raises the question of what Sony's technical plans are.
For its part, Sony chose to go with a single digital rights
management system, Microsoft Windows Media, and a single
transaction company, Reciprocal. Sony's rationale is that the
Windows Media system is the only one now supported by a portable
device that complies with the Secure Digital Music Initiative
approach. Incidentally, that device is made by Sony.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, the prototype that Sony is showing off seems
relatively simple to use. Consumers so inclined can point and click
their way to music downloads as easily as they might order a book
on Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Sony Music officials said that as more devices emerge, they
would support other secure formats favored by the various
manufacturers, potentially creating confusion for consumers and
online retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's promise to publish music in other formats may sound more
like a threat. But Al Smith, a senior vice president at Sony Music
Entertainment, predicted that before long, users will not care
about the type of format in which music is digitally compressed and
encoded, because the devices will probably have a common interface.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers can only hope he is right. Otherwise the music
industry can expect to continue to do business mainly on that
bastion of time-wealthy, technology-wise, format-forgiving
humanity: the college campus.

JAN FULLER REFUSES TO LET MS BEAT HER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When Jan Fuller was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis
in 1994, her head filled with frightening images about the disease.
Memories of public service announcements featuring a wheelchair set
against a black background flashed through her mind. She could
practically hear the solemn voiceover: ``MS the crippler of young
adults.''
</P>
<P>
   As she struggled with the twist her life had taken, Fuller
remembered that half of Dr. Jack Kevorkian's patients had suffered
from MS. She looked at her Woburn home and wondered how it could
become wheelchair accessible.
</P>
<P>
   When her doctor advised that she stop running, Fuller got angry
and frustrated. She knew MS would change the way she led her life,
but Fuller was not ready to give up long-distance running. She
found a new doctor and adopted a new philosophy to deal with the
disease. Fuller also continued her successful running career.
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning, Fuller, 46, will stand at the starting line in
Hopkinton as an official entrant and fund-raiser for Marathon
Strides against MS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a gritty sort of person, but I will admit to having three
or four months that were really, really hard,'' said Fuller, who
learned she had MS after the third bout of sensory loss in her
legs. ``I kept doing everything that I was doing, but I was trying
to figure out what it meant. Three months after my diagnosis, I was
still going around saying, `How do I get through this?'
</P>
<P>
   ``The real metaphor that I came up with for my life is: MS is
absolutely not going to drive the car of my life. It's not even
allowed to ride in the interior most of the time. It's relegated to
the trunk. Occasionally, like the past month or so, it hangs out in
the car, but I keep insisting that I'm in charge here. And things
that I can't do, I just ask for help with.''
</P>
<P>
   Performing small tasks such as opening jars, typing, and
stirring cookie dough often reveal her disease and prove
problematic. She experiences weakness in her right arm and leg,
mild coordination difficulties on her right side, and fatigue. When
Fuller runs, she often drags her right heel. But bigger challenges
such as finishing a 20-mile training run or logging 35 miles a week
are always met.
</P>
<P>
   Since her diagnosis, Fuller has finished seven marathons (five
Boston, two Bay State). On average, she completes the race in 4
hours. This year, three runners will be participating with MS,
though Fuller is the only one who met the qualifying standard
(3:53:12 in Boston last year) for her division.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thankful everyday that she can do it (run marathons) and
that she keeps doing it,'' said husband Tom Fuller, who will will
root for Jan alongside their two sons, 20-year-old Jason and
17-year-old Darryl, on race day. ``I'm not exactly an athlete. I
just see her get up at 4:30 in the morning and go out and be
dedicated to it and it's amazing. She takes care of herself and
she's healthy because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, shortly after her diagnosis, Fuller sent a ``whining
letter'' to the Boston Athletic Association. Fuller begged for a
number, fearing she might not be able to compete in the Boston
Marathon in the future. Race officials put Fuller in touch with the
National Multiple Sclerosis Society and, ever since, she has run
for charity with results that have surprised her doctors and
delighted family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until last year, I did not walk around publicly saying, `I
have MS.' I said publicly, `I'm running for MS.' Then, someone
would ask me why I was running the marathon for MS. I would say, `I
have it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I hit a point where I thought I could be sort of an
ambassador for those of us with MS, who live with question marks in
our lives. Is this going to be the day? Is tomorrow going to be the
day I need a wheelchair?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a whole population of people with MS who are not in
wheelchairs and continue to have very profitable, wonderful, active
lives . . . It's not something to be embarrassed about. It's
something to be proud of that we can run in the Marathon. I can do
these things becasue I'm fortunate.''

FREI, NIETLISPACH APPROACH THE RACE DIFFERENTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When the wheelchair racers hit full stride in the early
going Monday, you can bet Heinz Frei won't be out in front. He
doesn't expect to be. In fact, he prefers trailing at the outset.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the Boston Marathon's wheelchair division in 1994
and '96 _ setting course and world records in '94 _ the Swiss
resident proved that it's not where you start, but how you finish.
He usually lurks behind the pack, watching the race unfold, then he
pounces like a tick at a dog pound, weaving his way to the front,
often before the opposition can react.
</P>
<P>
   The approach works best for him. The strategy employed by
four-time winner Franz Nietlispach is to get to the front of the
pack, gaining as big a lead as possible, then challenging everyone
to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   The contrasting strategies have made for the best matchup since
the hare and the tortoise _ and it is one of the reasons a Swiss
has been in the winner's circle since 1994: Each won two races from
1994-97, and Nietlispach has won the last two. (Frei hasn't raced
in Boston since 1997, opting for the event in Hamburg.)
</P>
<P>
   This race will be one of the most compelling in years, matching
two 42-year-old Swiss competitors who have been as dominant in the
wheelchair as the Kenyans have been in the men's able-bodied
division.
</P>
<P>
   ``We push one another step by step to the top level,'' said
Frei, who also won the Berlin Marathon nine consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every race,'' said Frei, ``we have big fights and high
levels that make the difference in the other. But, in the last two
or three years, at least others came closer and closer, and it's
more open now.''
</P>
<P>
   The toughest competitor for the two will be Mexico's Saul
Mendoza, who finished third to Nietlispach in 1998 and second last
year. But, make no mistake, the two Swiss are the frontrunners.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Frei said one of the reasons he is returning is to
attempt to protect his course and world records, which he first
captured in 1994 at 1:21:23. Nietlispach has been coming closer to
that mark, and last year won Boston with a time just 13 seconds
away.
</P>
<P>
   But then Frei captured last year's Oita (Japan) Marathon with a
1:20:14. ``That was one of the ideas for me to do this race,'' said
Frei, about maintaining his records. ``I am in really good shape
this year, and I hope when I have tailwind conditions to break the
record.''
</P>
<P>
   After his record performance, Frei was the favorite in 1995, but
Nietlispach triumphed with a time of 1:25:59. Frei came in second
almost two minutes later. In 1996, however, Frei proved that he is
capable of making up a lot of ground to catch and pass a strong
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Nietlispach took the lead by as many as 100 meters, but Frei
caught him at the 8-mile mark and slowly pulled away. His 1:30:14
beat runner-up Philippe Couprie by almost four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time Frei beat (Nietlispach), you're talking about
maybe being a kilometer behind, when you cannot see the
competition,'' said Bob Hall, the division's pioneer and the first
men's wheelchair winner. ``That's where the mental games take
place.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Nietlispach exacted his revenge in convincing fashion.
He took control early and was never challenged. Since then, he has
dominated the event; no one has come within three minutes of his
finish.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Mendoza led after the first two splits (miles 1 and
2), and it was all Nietlispach after that. But afterward, he was
quoted as saying he knows he is closing in on the record, ``but 13
seconds is a lot of time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of Franz, he has tremendous, tremendous speed,''
said Hall. ``He's a great sprinter. He is truly an endurance
person, but he's good enough to hang in there. What he tries to do
is sit back and kick and win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heinz tries to burn you. In a race, you've got 10 guys, and
Heinz would fall back 10 meters behind the pack, wind it up, catch
up, and before the leaders could realize the move was made, they're
left behind trying to scramble to catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   Frei said he fares well against Nietlispach elsewhere but that
the Boston course favors Nietlispach, whose heavy frame enables him
to move downhill fast and whose strength helps him bolster his
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Nietlispach is) a minimum of about 20-25 kilos more
than me,'' said Frei, who said he weighs about 129 pounds. I think
he is about (198 pounds). That makes it difficult in the downhill
part.''
</P>
<P>
   The course starts downhill for 5 miles and then it's mostly
rolling hills to flat until mile 15, when it takes a steep downhill
drop. Then there are four hills miles 16-21, the last being
Heartbreak Hill which ends at mile 21. After that, it's pretty much
downhill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a challenge to try one more race in Boston, but it's not
my favorite course because it's fast downhill and it makes it
difficult in terms of security,'' said Frei. ``For Franz, it's
especially good for him, but when I am in good shape and I get the
conditions I want, no rain and tailwinds, I can have a good race.''
</P>
<P>
   Frei, who became a quadriplegic 22 years ago when he broke his
back in a fall in a mountain-run race, said he is not certain how
many marathons he will do after this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I can do a lot of marathons the next few years, but
not on this level,'' he said. ``I need to have a good fix this year
and after that see what the future is then.''
</P>
<P>
   In other wheelchair news, race officials anticipate the 1,000th
finisher. Through the 1999 race, the wheelchair division has
recognized 992 finishers.

FOURTH STRAIGHT VICTORY WOULD PUT ROBA IN A CLASS BY HERSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the Boston Marathon's first 103 years, only four
have had the chance _ and all fell short. It takes speed, strength,
talent, toughness, nerve, and, oh yes, more than a little luck.
</P>
<P>
   Four straight wins. Four consecutive laurel wreaths.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Fatuma Roba will be running after when she toes the
line in Hopkinton. If she's successful, she will take one more
giant step toward being regarded as one of the greatest female
marathoners of all-time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would put her on the top,'' said Joan Benoit Samuelson,
considered by many to be the one who now holds that honored spot.
``It has to.''
</P>
<P>
   But before she can ascend, Roba has to conquer 26.2 more miles,
a cadre of talented challengers who want nothing more than to deny
her the throne, and the little matter of precedent. There is none.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to (win) four,'' said Bill Rodgers, who did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another to get four in a row,'' said Bill Rodgers, who
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, going after the magic No. 4, he finished third behind
Toshihiko Seko and Craig Virgin.
</P>
<P>
   Roba, the 26-year-old Ethiopian who stunned the world by winning
a gold medal at the 1996 Olympics as a virtual unknown, insists she
is neither nervous nor thinking about her role in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I win four times, I am really happy,'' she said in her
improving English. If that makes her the best ever, she implies,
that's for others to decide. ``Me, I only run.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Rodgers (1978-'80), the others who have won three
straight Bostons are Clarence DeMar ('22-'24), Cosmas Ndeti
('93-'95), and Uta Pippig ('94-'96), although both Roberta Gibb
('66-'68) and Sara Mae Berman ('69-'71) did so before women were
allowed to run officially.
</P>
<P>
   In the wheelchair division, Jean Driscoll won seven straight
('90-'96) and her rival, Louise Sauvage, has won the last three.
</P>
<P>
   Roba's agent, Mark Wetmore, has been through this before: He
also represents Ndeti, who won his trio by starting out cautiously
and then coming from behind. He switched strategies and ran from
the front in 1996 _ and finished third.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in shape to go for the world record and didn't think of
the consequences of running into a headwind,'' said Wetmore. ``He
was so in love with the Boston Marathon that (setting a record) was
what he thought he had to do. Anything short of that would have
been failure for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Roba, he said, is also in the best shape he's ever seen. ``But,
coming in, is more low-key, settled,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The three-time defending champion seems more at ease than she
has in her last three Aprils. ``Either she's a great actor or she's
really relaxed and confident,'' said Kathrine Switzer Saturday as
Roba, in stylish black boots and black trousers accented by silver
rivets, breezed by in the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Few had heard of Roba before she became the surprise gold
medalist in Atlanta, beating Valentina Yegorova by a full two
minutes. The next April, she was invited to Boston for the first
time and didn't disappoint, becoming the first black African woman
to win when she crossed the line in 2 hours 26 minutes 23 seconds,
ironically denying Pippig her chance at four straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Fatuma, obviously it's hard but maybe I think it's
possible,'' said Pippig, who finished fourth that year after
struggling with injuries. ``Mentally, I don't know if she's
thinking about it. Maybe we are all thinking for her.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Roba set her personal best with a 2:23:21 victory
despite a painful tendon behind her right knee. In becoming the
third-fastest woman ever to run this course, she came in almost
four minutes ahead of the runnerup. Last year, Roba finally shook
Catherine Ndereba of Kenya in the Newton hills to win in 2:23:25.
</P>
<P>
   ``She runs wonderfully,'' said Ndereba, back to try again.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyan Lornah Kiplagat, who is making her Boston debut this
year, added, ``We are so proud of her. She is the only woman from
Africa to win a gold medal and the Boston Marathon three times. She
shows we can do it. She's been a great inspiration for us. If she
wins it four times, it gives (all of us) the potential to do it six
times, and many more.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Roba concedes that her quest is a difficult one, she
said she has seen nothing this week to alter her plans for laurel
wreath No. 4 and a place of honor in the roll call of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any new faces,'' she said.

CHEBET RUNNING FOR A SPOT ON THE OLYMPIC TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The thin man sits at a conference table and begins to
speak. He smiles a lot. He answers your questions fully and
completely, but also quickly. He doesn't waste time. You would
guess _ correctly _ that he is a runner if you didn't know that
already.
</P>
<P>
   He is not just a runner. He is 29-year-old Joseph Chebet, the
runner who won marathons last year in Boston and New York. He
became the third person in history to accomplish that. He also won
(and set course records) in the first two marathons he ever ran,
Amsterdam in 1996 and Turin in '97. Now he will try to become the
10th consecutive male from Kenya to win Boston.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, Chebet does marathons well. But he doesn't do them
naturally nor effortlessly. In fact, these 26.2-mile jogs are a
pain in his back side. They are a pain in his neck, arms, and legs,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a marathon, I can go to bed but I can't go to sleep,''
he says. ``There is no sleep for five or six hours. All muscles are
sore. It lasts for days. Sometimes two days; sometimes three.''
</P>
<P>
   Chebet vividly describes the pain of running. He is so
descriptive you expect him to rise from the table and declare he is
withdrawing from Monday's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me?'' he says, the smile returning. ``I wish to win. The
course is one that I should know.''
</P>
<P>
   If Chebet repeats in Boston, he will be able to book a September
flight to Sydney. Boston is an Olympic qualifier for the Kenyans,
so the win is worth more than the $80,000 payout for first place.
The top two finishers will represent the East African country in
Australia. Chebet, whom some consider No. 1 in the world, has run
twice in Boston and has a first and second.
</P>
<P>
   But even if this weren't an Olympic year, winning would
transcend cash. It's usually like that for Kenyan runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like Europe or the United States,'' says Federico
Rosa, a friend of Chebet's. ``In Kenya, people don't press you if
you are famous. You can live a normal life.''
</P>
<P>
   Chebet has noticed that more people have acknowledged him since
his Boston victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some come up to me and say, `Hi. All the best to you,' '' he
says. ``Then they shake my hand. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Intrusive neighbors? Not a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the people who live close to him are his friends,'' Rosa
says.
</P>
<P>
   Chebet describes his home _ in Elmarakwet _ as rural. After he
won New York and Boston, he went home and ``relaxed for a month.''
Then he began training to defend his title. Although many believe
athletes in Kenya's Great Rift Valley have some type of advantage,
Chebet shrugs off the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some are successful because they train very well,'' he
says. He adds that the reverence for the Kenyans ``can also be an
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not, however, go into detail about his training
schedule. ``It's always different,'' he explains. ``Sometimes it's
five days; sometimes it's three days.''
</P>
<P>
   You listen to him. It is obvious he is a runner. He always has
been. He says he began running as a small child. He knew he was
good at it then, and he could always observe a good runner: his
father. But as much running as Chebet did, he didn't begin to take
it seriously until he was in his early 20s. Maybe his neighbors
knew his skill and perhaps other Kenyans knew, as well. But if he
was going to make a career out of running, he knew he would have to
leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   As the statistics from Boston show, there are many talented
runners in East Africa. The money to support them, though, is not
there. You can be a great marathoner in Kenya, but you will be in
the nonprofit, for-the-love-of-the-sport category if you don't
pursue races in Europe and the US.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he is taking his work seriously, Chebet is a favorite
to win Boston. So is his friend, countryman, and two-time winner
Moses Tanui. The numbers seem to indicate someone from Africa will
win; the last non-African champion was Italy's Gelindo Bordin in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   In a lot of ways, Chebet knows what to expect. He knows
commentators will refer to the layout as a downhill course although
``it's not all downhill. It goes like this . . . '' He positions
his hand as if outlining an imaginary camel. ``I'm glad it's not a
flat course.''
</P>
<P>
   He also knows that during such a long race, one's mind can
drift. Even if you are a defending champion. Fans tend to think a
champion's mind is obsessively focused on winning and the finish
line. Not so, says Chebet. Sometimes he thinks of his family.
Sometimes there are thoughts of the course and conditions.
Sometimes, he says with a smile, there are thoughts of women. There
are times when he thinks of the response he gets when he walks the
streets of London and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will say, `Are you from Kenya?' '' he says. ``I will
say yes. And they say, `Ohhh.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That's respect.
</P>
<P>
   The thin man begins to speak even faster. His friend, Rosa,
checks his watch. What, somewhere to go?
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinner is over in 20 minutes,'' Rosa explains.
</P>
<P>
   The men want to make sure they have enough time to get to the
cafeteria in the John Hancock Conference Center. Maybe they are
being humble. They should know they have time to spare. Remember,
the thin man is a runner. Not an effortless one. Not a natural one.
Simply a very good one. Twenty minutes of travel time for a guy
like this? That's probably 18 minutes more than necessary.

DRISCOLL, SAUVAGE GEAR UP FOR ANOTHER ELECTRIFYING FINISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Talk about painful losses.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago in the women's wheelchair division of the Boston
Marathon, Jean Driscoll was just raising her hands in victory at
the tape when, much to her astonishment, another wheelchair whizzed
past her to claim the victory by .2 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll, the 33-year-old seven-time champion of this race from
Champaign, Ill., was beaten by Louise Sauvage, a 26-year-old rising
star from Sydney. It was the second of three straight victories for
Sauvage, who won in 1997 when one of Driscoll's tires got caught on
an MBTA train track and ended her bid for an eighth consecutive
title.
</P>
<P>
   As defending champion, Sauvage said Thursday, she was glad to
see Driscoll was back to keep ``a great rivalry'' going.
</P>
<P>
   But for her part, Driscoll said the race is about much more than
another crack at her Australian rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the last one alive with a chance of breaking seven wins at
Boston and getting eight,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll's eighth victory would break the record held by legend
Clarence DeMar of Melrose, who won seven Boston Marathon titles
from 1911 to 1930.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a calm confidence right now,'' said Driscoll. ``I see
myself winning No. 8. I hunger for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The last three years were not run-of-the mill losses for
Driscoll.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's photo finish, Driscoll trailed Sauvage by about
50 yards when she tried to close the gap beginning around
Brookline. She came as close as she could, but needed just a few
more yards to get by Sauvage.
</P>
<P>
   But the most painful loss _ literally _ came in 1997 when
Driscoll spotted Sauvage a slight lead, then stayed close behind in
Sauvage's slipstream as the two rolled into Cleveland Circle.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that one of Driscoll's wheels got caught in a
streetcar track, overturning the chair, and sending her sprawling
in the street. After making repairs, she finished the race, though
she lost about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After last year's disappointment, Driscoll said she considered
not racing in Boston again. But after three months off from racing
and six weeks off from training, she had time to reassess her
feelings and ponder the possibility of an eighth victory.
</P>
<P>
   Soon she was training again, and the routine got her focused.
She also studied videotape of her past performances and noted
``dozens of places'' she could have pressed the pedal harder to
make up precious fractions of seconds. ``I've made them up
easily,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I still have the passion in my gut,'' said Driscoll,
who has proven she can go more than the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, she wheeled into a stiff headwind for 377 miles in a
monster Alaskan race from Fairbanks to Anchorage. ``I learned a lot
about myself,'' she said. ``But I don't know if I'll go back or
not. I don't even know why I did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Following that ordeal, Driscoll ran into hellacious weather when
she competed in Falmouth last August and again in a Los Angeles
race in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Sauvage is a good wheeler downhill and Driscoll's strength is
uphill; so both women say this race will be about minute advantages
in specific spots along the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a great rivalry,'' said Sauvage, who has competed in
Boston seven times, beginning at age 19. She has also won the
Honolulu Marathon, the Carlsbad 5000, and the National 10K
Championships, and has earned her the title of International Female
Wheelchair Athlete of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   If Sauvage wins, giving her a string of four victories at age
26, she could be in the position Driscoll now holds before she
reaches 30. So far, Sauvage has not seen herself in terms of
winning a string of Boston Marathons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just very happy to compete, and give the others a good
race,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to racing Jean wherever, but especially in
Boston because Jean is the queen there, and it's sort of her race.
So it's fun for me to come up there and try to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll's take on her rival is somewhat curt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louise,'' she said, ``is a very worthy opponent.''

<P>
   DENVER _ Almost a year has passed since a killing rampage here
by two students thrust an ordinary high school into the vortex of
national debates over gun rights, parental responsibilities,
cultural violence and the nature of evil.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the discourse, as well as the symbolism of 15 deaths
_ including the shooters, who killed themselves _ inside a school,
little beyond the walls of Columbine High School in suburban Denver
has changed since last April 20. Congress is still wrestling with
how to reduce the wrongful use of guns. The parents of the killers
have not spoken publicly about what happened. Disagreements remain
over the influence of violent movies, television, lyrics and
computer games in the everyday life of teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Here, though, the world changed forever.
</P>
<P>
   Scarcely a day goes by without some reminder of the carnage
caused by Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, who ended their own lives
after killing 12 students and a teacher and wounding 23 other
people, several of whom are confined to wheelchairs. Columbine is
now more than a school; it is part of the lexicon, a new shorthand
for the terror of kids killing kids.
</P>
<P>
   Both of Denver's daily newspapers, The Denver Post and The Rocky
Mountain News, won Pulitzer prizes last week for their coverage of
the shootings. But, as editors at both papers said, the honor was
bittersweet. As a further measure of the tragedy's impact,
relatives of victims asked news organizations not to mention the
killers' names in anniversary stories. Some agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not going to be a normal year,'' said Frank DeAngelis,
principal at Columbine. ``I think if people felt just because we
walked into this building and it had different paint, it had
different floor coverings, that everything was going to be back to
normal. Then, I think they were very unrealistic. What I told the
students last April 21 was that what we have experienced in the
last 24 hours is something that will remain with us for a lifetime.
We have learned to cope.''
</P>
<P>
   Coping has been hampered by a continuing search for answers and
an unlikely series of wrenching events in the months following the
shootings. Last fall, the mother of Anne Marie Hochhalter, a
student who was paralyzed below the waist by the shooters,
committed suicide by shooting herself inside a pawnshop after she
had asked to see a handgun. Around the same time, the high school
was closed for a day after a Florida teen-ager sent an e-mail
message to a Columbine student, threatening ``to finish the job''
started by the killers.
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, two other Columbine students were shot and
killed in a sandwich shop just blocks from the school.
</P>
<P>
   All this, in a middle-to-upper-class neighborhood of spacious
homes and tree-lined streets _ a snapshot of American aspirations
fulfilled. Yet now, tour buses glide by the school, filled with the
ghoulishly curious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to move on when you see vanloads of people on the
parking lot, asking where the library is so that they can take a
picture of family reunions on places where people died,'' said
Sarah Bay, a senior who lost three friends in the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Students, teachers and administrators say the shootings changed
the fabric of the school, drawing them all together by the shared
experience of tragedy. DeAngelis said it has not been uncommon for
students to hug in hallways, even to tell each other, ``I love
you.''
</P>
<P>
   But strength in numbers has not reached every corner of emotion
for many of the school's 2,000 students. Courtney Shakowski, a
senior, said she now only feels safe ``with help from my parents
and teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey White, another senior, said she did not feel in danger,
``but my trust factor has gone down. I don't trust very many things
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Katie Beer, a 10th-grader, said quietly, ``I feel like my bubble
is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Leland Andres, a music teacher at Columbine since it opened in
1973, said many students have had trouble concentrating in class
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Trauma experts say these are common feelings, even this long
after the event. ``With adults, we have an idea of what the world
is like, and that world includes bad things, your car getting
stolen, sexual assaults, muggings,'' said Robin Fudge Finegan, a
consultant who has worked with victims of mass tragedy, including
Columbine and the Oklahoma City bombing five years ago. ``A kid
hasn't really formed that definition of the world. To blast them
with that seriousness of life, it's a more intense violation.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some in the Columbine community have turned the shootings into a
cause. Tom Mauser, a former state transportation official whose
son, Daniel, was killed in the shootings, took a leave from his job
to lobby state lawmakers for tighter gun-control measures. He has
become a highly visible figure in Colorado, and even nationally. He
sat in the gallery as President Clinton gave his last State of the
Union Address, a guest of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Al and Phyllis Velasquez, whose son, Kyle, was killed, are
selling silver pins they designed that say, ``Never Forgotten,''
and donating the money to helping turn the library, where most of
the students were killed, into an atrium. ``It's a very personal
journey,'' said Mrs. Velasquez.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take each day as it comes, and you move forward,'' she
continued. ``We're walking through unfamiliar landscape and we're
looking for something that is familiar. You just take one day at a
time. You get over the morning, and if you've made it through that
day, you congratulate yourself for making it through one more
day.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Members of most of the victims' families have been visible in
some way since the shootings, offering opinions on a range of
developments, like the release of videotapes on which the two
shooters displayed their weapons and hatreds. It is less clear how
the parents of the killers are enduring the aftermath of the
shootings, given that many in the Columbine community hold them at
least partly responsible for their sons' actions. The parents of
one victim, Isaiah Shoels, have filed a wrongful death lawsuit
against the Klebolds and Harrises.
</P>
<P>
   Both couples issued statements last week through their
respective lawyers but conveyed little about how the last 12 months
have passed for them. Tom and Susan Klebold apologized for their
son's role in the killings and said, ``The pain of others compounds
our own as we struggle to live a life without the son we
cherished.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne and Kathy Harris, whose son kept weapons and ammunition
stored in his bedroom, echoed those sentiments. And, perhaps, with
the Shoelses' lawsuit in mind, they made it clear they knew nothing
of their son's plan for causing mayhem, saying they ``search our
souls daily for some glimmer of a reason why he would have done
such a horrible thing.''
</P>
<P>
   They added, ``What he did was unforgivable and beyond our
capacity to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Kechter, whose son, Matthew, was among those killed, said
she could imagine a time that the Klebold and Harris families might
be forgiven by others. ``I know that they are suffering a lot of
pain and, I'm sure, a lot of guilt,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But time might bring more important changes, she said, changes
that could provide benefits well beyond one traumatized community.
``People need to get back to basics of society, family and God,''
she said. ``It sounds like I'm grand-standing, but Columbine has
caused a lot of people to look inward to say, `Am I doing the right
thing as a parent? Am I spending enough time with my children?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids have lost that innocence in their eyes.'' She added.
``Yet they have this wisdom. I think there is going to be a
generation of change.''

REM KOOLHAAS WINS TOP ARCHITECTURE PRIZE 
</HEADLINE>
   By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rem Koolhaas, perhaps the most influential architect of his
generation, has been awarded the Pritzker Architecture Prize for
2000, which the Hyatt Foundation, sponsors of the award, plans to
announce Monday. The prize includes a $100,000 grant and will be
presented in Jerusalem on May 17.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Koolhaas, 56, brings distinction to the Pritzker
Prize as well as to the architect. Founded in 1979, the prize has
been described as architecture's Nobel. Previous recipients include
Philip Johnson, Luis Barragan, Richard Meier, I.M. Pei, Aldo Rossi
and Tadao Ando. In recent years the Pritzker jury has ventured
cautiously toward recognizing the work of architects born since
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Christian de Portzamparc and Ando, who received the prize in
1994 and 1995, respectively, are architects of considerable talent
whose work has had scant influence on their peers. Koolhaas, by
contrast, has been a guiding figure in architecture since 1978,
when he published ``Delirious New York,'' an urban history of the
20th century's capital city. Reissued in 1994, the book changed the
way many architects, students and historians regard modern
architecture. While some architects were prepared to dismiss the
modern movement as a conspiracy to replace everything with glass
boxes, Koolhaas reinterpreted modern New York from a contemporary
point of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``S, M, L, XL,'' a book he published in 1994, also provided an
excursion into the architect's sensibility, but this time
illustrated with work by Koolhaas and his firm, the Office for
Metropolitan Architecture, based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. As
advertised by its title, the book presented projects ranging in
scale from private houses to the convention hall and master plan
for Euralille, a trade and transportation center in Lille, France.
Designs for the Netherlands Dance Theater (1987) and the Rotterdam
Kunsthal (1992) helped fill out the middle range.
</P>
<P>
   In many projects Koolhaas creates a unique sense of space by
combining spiral and three-dimensional grid forms within a single
building. One of the strongest examples of this is the Jussieu
Library, an unbuilt project for the Left Bank in Paris. He
conceived the building's floors as an interior street, made from a
squared-off spiral of sloping ramps. The Rotterdam Kunsthal uses a
similar device.
</P>
<P>
   These and other projects show the influence of Ludwig Mies van
der Rohe and Wallace K. Harrison, who helped inspire Koolhaas'
formal vocabulary. The rigor of Mies' Seagram Building in Manhattan
and the theatricality of the Trylon and Perisphere, designed by
Harrison for the 1939 World's Fair in New York, are polar opposites
that Koolhaas has sought to reconcile. In 1980 he organized the
first retrospective of Harrison's work at the Institute for
Architecture and Urban Studies in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Since the publication of ``S, M, L, XL,'' Koolhaas has received
commissions to design an expansion of the Universal City complex in
Los Angeles, the new public library in Seattle and a student center
for the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Koolhaas has been a local hero in New York since the 1970s. This
is partly because of the grace with which he has reconciled the
values of the '60s counterculture with the reality of professional
practice in changing times.
</P>
<P>
   He is not a social reformer. Some are repelled, in fact, by his
acceptance of the more dubious aspects of urban life. ``Delirious
New York'' celebrated what he called the culture of congestion, a
phenomenon unlikely to be cheered by New Yorkers stuck in rush-hour
traffic. Today he takes evident delight in the global monoculture
and the proliferation of its characteristic building types:
convention centers, hotels, airports, malls and such. Koolhaas
would make a bad poster boy for protesters against the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund. (An exchange between architect
and protesters could be fruitful for both.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as Mies put it, the new era exists. It is a fact,
regardless of our yes or no. Of course our new era differs from
that of Mies. It presents different opportunities, different
challenges and the possibility of different forms. What makes
Koolhaas exceptional is his developed awareness of these
differences and the talent that enables him to translate this
awareness into architectural form. For Mies, the era was defined by
the rationalism of the Industrial Age, to which he brought the
value of formal clarity derived from the neoclassical architecture
of the 18th-century Enlightenment. For Koolhaas the era is defined
by the irrationalism of the Information Age. To it, he brings the
analytic tools developed by Marx and Freud.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Harvard Guide to Shopping,'' scheduled for publication
later this year, Koolhaas uses these tools to explore the
phenomenon of mass consumption. A team project, the work was
produced by students in an urban studies course he leads each year
at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. This volume, produced in
1998, is obsessive, smart, hilarious. There are chapters on the
history of the escalator, on Frank O. Gehry's background in mall
design and the economic struggle between urban and suburban
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Like a Borges story, the ``Harvard Guide'' takes reason to the
point of insanity. This was a standard practice of the Surrealists,
whose work also drew on social and psychological analysis in an
effort to merge the two. But the extension of reason into madness
is also standard practice for advanced capitalism, which has
largely reduced rationalism to corporate accounting. The bottom
line, in turn, has recomposed reality into the incoherent,
fragmented world that we experience in dreams.
</P>
<P>
   The Surrealists wanted to change consciousness. In this sense,
Koolhaas is a social reformer. Though he may embrace monocultural
institutions, he insists that architecture is a medium for
heightening our awareness of them. It can be used to render rather
than disguise their destabilizing effects.
</P>
<P>
   Some institutions, even culturally enlightened ones, feel
threatened by this insistence. This is the disheartening moral to
be drawn from an episode that occurred in April 1997, when Koolhaas
was eliminated from a competition to design the expansion of the
Museum of Modern Art. Invited, along with nine other architects, to
submit an initial proposal that would focus on concepts rather than
forms, he responded with a precise analysis of the institution that
apparently offended some members of the selection committee.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal included an analysis of what he called the aura of
the Modern. By this he meant the museum's power to confer aesthetic
value on particular artists, movements and interpretations, and the
conversion of that value, in turn, into prestige, fame and other
worldly forms of currency. In one diagram, Koolhaas depicted the
aura as a golden rectangle at the top of an office tower. Evidently
this feature did not go over well at the Modern.
</P>
<P>
   But for anyone who has tracked this architect's work, the
proposal was classic Koolhaas. Like others of his generation he has
a complicated relationship to authority. He is by turns playful,
blunt, skeptical and romantic. His clients have found this a useful
combination for producing designs of great integrity.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a clear explanation for Koolhaas' influence, it is
his determination to bridge the gap between architecture and city
planning. This was the founding mission of the Office for
Metropolitan Architecture, established in London in 1975 by
Koolhaas, Madelon Vriesendorp and Elias and Zoe Zenghelis. It is
also the goal of the research projects Koolhaas directs at Harvard.
The projects focus on the impact of globalization in individual
cities worldwide. A study of Lagos, Nigeria, is also scheduled for
publication. These are not touristic celebrations of foreign
places, but efforts to demystify the built environment by exploring
topics like security devices, economic segregation and
transportation systems.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this year's Pritzker selection will trigger another
much-needed study on the decline of New York as a center for
outstanding building. Indeed, the entire roster of Pritzker
laureates can be seen as an index of this decline. The prize was
established by the Pritzker family of Chicago, owner of the Hyatt
hotel chain. Of the 22 Pritzker laureates, only six have completed
major projects in New York. (Koolhaas has done two projects in
Manhattan: the interior for the Second Stage Theater last year and
the Lehmann Maupin Gallery in SoHo in 1996.) Most of these six are
over 70 or dead.
</P>
<P>
   A New York project by Rossi, a seventh winner, will be completed
posthumously this year. Until the completion last year of
Portzamparc's LVMH Tower on East 57th Street, Manhattan had not
seen a first-rate skyscraper in decades. But a new millennium is
here, and the Pritzker jury has stepped into it boldly.

THE HIDDEN WAYS OF GOD IN THE MYSTICAL CABALA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Note change in slug) 
(Publication notes at end of review) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cabala is not easy and it wasn't meant to be. The name
itself, standing for the various strands of Jewish mysticism,
suggests something deep and esoteric, something that one knows more
by experience than by the intellect. Comprehension is not made easy
by the nature of the main books that make up the cabala, especially
the five-volume Zohar. A 13th-century forgery of a supposedly much
earlier masterwork, the Zohar contains a bewildering mixture of
rabbinical sayings, diagrams of divine emanations, Talmudic
commentaries, myths and fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason alone those who want to grasp the cabala might
well look with hope to David Rosenberg's new book, ``Dreams of
Being Eaten Alive.'' Rosenberg is a poet and translator of biblical
texts _ his best-known work is ``The Book of J,'' which he wrote
with Harold Bloom _ and he promises to give us the ``literary
core'' of the cabala. Or, as Rosenberg puts it, to translate
cabalistic excerpts that will reveal ``the body beneath the garment
of its own text.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg explains this further: ``I have attempted a form of
dream, a serial narrative, in which episodes are woven together by
threads of similar intensity, focus and bearing.'' It is a worthy
ambition, but unfortunately Rosenberg produces at best a mixed
result. It is illuminating in an appropriately mystical way to read
some of the passages that he has rendered into English, and his
commentaries, which precede and follow the translations, contain
useful insights. But his explication of the text is more often than
not pretentious, self-indulgent and in places downright
unfathomable.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it is not clear if the cabalistic texts he
presents are really translations or quirky, personal re-imaginings
inspired by his theories. Not that I have anything against quirky
personal re-imaginings. Still, one wants to know if Rosenberg is
revealing the literary core of the cabala or the self-consciously
postmodern core of Rosenberg himself, and not knowing that produces
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   The main text that Rosenberg uses is the Zohar _ meaning
radiance _ which most scholars attribute to a 13th-century Spanish
cabalist named Moses de Leon, but which de Leon presented as a
long-lost manuscript composed a millennium earlier by the legendary
rabbi Shimon ben Yohai. Thus, as Rosenberg puts it, the Zohar is
``purposefully in disguise'' and that adds to its mystical nature.
Acknowledged but underplayed in Rosenberg's analysis is that the
Zohar is a religious document aimed at showing the hidden ways in
which God is revealed in the Jewish canon, in particular the Torah,
the first five books of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   For Rosenberg, the cabalists were ``our first postmodern
writers,'' and to substantiate this notion he presents a medley of
fashionable concepts _ the importance of the body in literary
criticism, the Freudian interpretation of dreams, what Rosenberg
describes as a cabalistic ``evolutionary ecology,'' and others. He
lays out his view in an introduction in which the occasional
arresting insight alternates with New Ageish pronouncements on such
things as the interconnectedness of all things and the way ``the
creation of souls is seen as the offspring of a divine
intercourse.'' For Rosenberg, in other words, the cabala is less
about the search for God than about expressing our deepest and
wildest fears, especially about sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cabala is obsessed with failed sex, especially the
spilling of semen in sleep or masturbation,'' Rosenberg writes
early on. It reveals, he says a few pages later, ``that sex is
messianic, future-oriented, and that it is a yearning for unity and
for the body of the mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there is sexual imagery in the cabala, as well as
stories of seduction of the patriarchs by sexual demons, and an
erotic symbolism connected with the Tree of Life. Still, when
Rosenberg declares that the cabala ``sexualized the soul long
before our current scientific attempts,'' one suspects more an
eagerness to be intellectually hip than to plumb the true meaning
of a 13th-century text.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Rosenberg's psychologically tuned-in vision is accurate,
the passages he offers to demonstrate his view _ passages about
Adam and Eve, Isaac and Rebecca and the female and male evil
spirits Lilith and Samael _ seem closer to ``Pulp Fiction'' than,
say, to the secret names of God. The stories are of dismemberment,
the eating of infants (hence Rosenberg's title), procreation with
snakes, a good deal of released semen and various sexual fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg gives no exact references for the source of these
passages, unlike other passages that he translates, and, indeed,
one isn't sure if he is translating texts or imaginatively
extending them to encompass his sexualized vision. ``I have
elaborated the scene of dream interpretation by folding the dreams
into a further narrative layer,'' he writes, explaining a passage
of translation in which the patriarch Isaac dreams that he has a
child by a kind of she-demon and the matriarch Rebecca cuts up the
infant and serves her for dinner. This ``further narrative layer''
has passages of dialogue right out of a bad screenplay:
</P>
<P>
   ``As Rebecca put down her fork, her brows were knit. `But,
Isaac, this is dangerous. You should not think of it. Put it out of
your mind.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gershom Sholem called the Zohar ``in some measure inaccessible
and silent,'' which, as Rosenberg sensibly avers, creates a problem
for ``any translator or interpreter.'' Rosenberg's solution is to
see the cabala as a way of reading ``in a more natural or wild way,
unconfined by the inhibitions of human culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, to demonstrate what he calls ``creative cabala''
and ``frontier cabala,'' he cites a bizarre host of contemporary
cultural figures, from Jacques Derrida to Oprah Winfrey to Buffy
the Vampire Slayer. My feeling is that to cite Buffy the Vampire
Slayer as a way of making the cabala speak to us today is to take
something sublime, if difficult, and make it into something
accessible but ridiculous.

EDITORS STRUGGLE TO INCREASE ETHNIC MIX OF NEWSROOMS
</HEADLINE>
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rick Rodriguez, the executive editor of The Sacramento Bee, got
the bad news shortly after arriving at the annual convention of the
American Society of Newspaper Editors last week. Twice in the last
few months he had fended off competitors who wanted to hire away
one of his best young reporters; now the same reporter was calling
to say he was leaving to join a flourishing magazine, with salaries
much higher than The Bee's.
</P>
<P>
   For Rodriguez, as a former head of the editors' task force on
diversity, the phone call crystallized all the worry and talk that
were again a dominant theme of the annual editors' convention. The
reporter in question is black; his departure means The Bee _ where
minority journalists make up 28 percent of the newsroom _ will be
that much further from reflecting the demographics of its
community. Sacramento County is about 37 percent nonwhite.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's fight to hold on to his staff reflects the inherent
frustrations of editors trying to fulfill their organization's
commitment to make America's newsrooms reflect the country's ethnic
and demographic mix by the year 2025.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is a two-pronged attack,'' Rodriguez said in an
interview. ``You have to develop new journalists and you have to
retain them.''
</P>
<P>
   The same simple prescription also undergirded the announcements
by two major journalism foundations _ the Freedom Forum and the
John S. and James L. Knight Foundation _ that they are underwriting
at least $5.5 million of new efforts to widen the pipeline of
black, Asian-American, Native American and Latino journalists
entering the profession.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom Forum, an organization based in Arlington, Va., that
was established nine years ago as a successor to the Gannett
Foundation, has placed 128 young minority journalists in summer
intern jobs around the country, and is paying the $350 weekly
salary of 33 of them. These 33 reporters are being placed at
medium- and small-sized newspapers that have already committed to
hire other interns from the program, in part to ease possible
feelings of isolations in communities like Huntington, W.Va. or
Lafayette, La.
</P>
<P>
   That commitment, along with the establishment of a journalism
training program at Vanderbilt University, represents a commitment
of at least $5 million by the Freedom Forum, including $1 million
earmarked for a minority recruitment program in partnership with
ASNE and the Associated Press Managing Editors organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Knight Foundation last week pledged $500,000 to the editors'
group _ with a possible $4.5 million to follow _ to design programs
to reinvigorate high school journalism.
</P>
<P>
   N. Christian Anderson 3rd, the publisher of The Orange County
Register, and the president of the editors' group, said at a press
conference, ``As we looked at this issue over the past three or
four years, we found kids are not being exposed to journalism in
high school because high school newspapers are fading away.''
</P>
<P>
   He also argued that ``unless you increase the pipeline, there is
just no way'' for newsrooms to mirror the diversity of their
readership.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of change, however, was not just frustrating but
infuriating for one group, the National Association of Black
Journalists. In the last year, while minority employment in
newsrooms overall rose three-tenths of a percent, to 11.85 percent,
or 6,700 people, in a work force of 56,200 journalists, the
percentage of black journalists declined for the first time, from
5.4 percent to 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows a crisis of confidence in the newspaper industry,''
said Will Sutton, the president of NABJ and a managing editor of
The Raleigh News and Observer in North Carolina. A failure to
increase the number of black reporters, he said, will mean coverage
less likely to appeal to black readers. In turn, the young people
among those readers will be less interested in journalism, he
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of young black folks are thinking about other''
professions, he said. ``They are not thinking about media and
certainly not about newspapers.'' A Freedom Forum survey, released
at the beginning of last week's meeting, showed that, given the
industry's current hiring and retention rates, one of every two
journalists hired for the next 24 years would have to be a member
of a minority group for the industry to meet its stated goals.
</P>
<P>
   Among other minority groups, the annual employment survey did
show progress. The percentage of Hispanic journalists rose to 3.7
from 3.5 in 1999; Asian-American journalists made up 2.4 percent of
the work force this year compared with 2.3 percent in 1999. Native
Americans are now 0.5 percent of the country's journalists, up 0.1
percent in 1999.

CHINA MAKES GAINS IN SPURRING GROWTH 
BY CRAIG S. SMITH  
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ China's economy showed surprising signs of
strength in the first quarter, suggesting that a slide in the
nation's economic growth rate may be ending.
</P>
<P>
   The gross domestic product grew 8.1 percent in the first three
months of the year compared with figures in the quarter a year
earlier, a senior government official said Sunday. That rate of
growth is up sharply from the 6.8 percent registered in the fourth
quarter of last year. For all of 1999, the Chinese economy grew 7.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The upturn in the nation's economic growth is a vindication for
China's chief economic planner, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, who many
Western economists doubted could stave off the effects of the Asian
economic crisis. Two years ago, economists talked of the sorry
state of China's banks, which remain technically insolvent, and
some press reports contended that the nation's economy was
deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year so far, the Chinese economy has maintained good
momentum,'' said Li Rongrong, vice chairman of the State Economic
and Trade Commission, speaking at the World Economic Forum in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   While the growth rate sounds impressive, actual growth is spread
unevenly across the country. Most economic activity is concentrated
in a handful of large cities and along the eastern coast.
</P>
<P>
   Large pockets of the country have slipped into recession, and
many economists warn that if growth falls much further, the
government could face significant unrest in the industrial
northeast, where unemployment exceeds 30 percent in some places.
Protests there are not rare. In February, the army quelled a riot
by an estimated 20,000 miners after the government closed a
bankrupt mine.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has vigorously tried to revive economic growth for more
than two years by pouring money into huge infrastructure projects.
It has also cut bank-deposit rates, increased government workers'
salaries and lengthened national holidays to encourage consumer
spending. Such spending remains weak, but retail sales have picked
up, and a two-year slide in prices appears to be ending, partly
because of government-imposed price controls.
</P>
<P>
   Exports and foreign investment are driving the faster economic
growth: exports, which slumped after the Asian crisis, leaped 39
percent in the first quarter, giving China a $5.2 billion trade
surplus for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investment rose 10 percent in March, compared with
figures in the month a year earlier, one of the first monthly
increases since the regional downturn scared investors. And the
value of contracts signed for future foreign investment surged 27
percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The revival in export revenue and foreign investment seems to
have removed the threat of a Chinese currency devaluation. Fears
that China would devalue the yuan to increase export revenue had
haunted regional markets for much of the last two years, despite
Beijing's frequent pledges to hold the currency firm.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese economy still has deep structural problems, but a
revival of the growth rate gives the government leeway to push
ahead with stalled economic reforms. Sunday, for example, a
government research group advised the liquidation of public
holdings in listed state companies, with the proceeds to be used
for workers' pensions.
</P>
<P>
   China's underfinanced and spotty national pension scheme has
left millions of workers without adequate retirement benefits.
Protests by disgruntled pensioners have become a common occurrence
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The government has already begun reducing its stake in listed
companies, the first step in what could turn into privatization on
a grand scale. At the end of last year, the state owned about 68
percent of the 285 billion outstanding shares in China's 1,007
listed companies, according to the official China Daily's business
weekly.

CHAT ROOMS PIN THE BLAME ON ANALYSTS AND THE MEDIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MARKET-STRATEGY, MARKET-ASSESS, MARKET-MARKETPLACE,
MARKET-MOOD, MARKET-ASIA) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the technology-heavy Nasdaq market rose to stratospheric
heights, nowhere was the cheering harder than in the investing chat
rooms on the Internet. The many investors who helped propel new
Internet shares to great heights crowed about their trading
successes in these online forums.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many of those same stocks have tumbled, and the mood in the
chat rooms has shifted. Web sites like Silicon Investor, a
financial site that serves as an online water cooler of sorts, are
full of angry commentary about falling prices. And over the last
week, chat rooms and message boards on the Internet have begun to
fill with investors chastising television channels like CNBC and
CNNfn for hyping the change in sentiment among investors that has
caused a bear market for technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a simple and healthy correction in tech stocks, or
a correction due to problems with fundamentals. It is a
media-induced selling panic,'' said a note on one of Yahoo's
message boards by a user identified only as ``full-of-bull-2000.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time the tech stocks start a small recovery, CNBC puts
on another bearish analyst that smears all tech and dot-com stocks
as being overvalued,'' full-of-bull-2000 added.
</P>
<P>
   Another investor, identified as ``porsche947,'' chimed in,
``Turn to another channel. I only look at the charts and cut out
the TV press. The charts don't lie and have no editorial hype.''
</P>
<P>
   Another user, ``Night Owl Creative,'' added: ``In general, the
media treats viewers as if they are dumb and it is their job to
show them what to think.''
</P>
<P>
   The influx of novice investors during the market's climb may be
one reason for the outcry against the media; many investors began
to rely on the media for stock tips and market advice, several
market analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's natural that the media has been a market cheerleader,''
said Robert J. Shiller, an economics professor at Yale and author
of ``Irrational Exuberance'' (Princeton University Press). ``There
was always this intuitive feeling that the media should keep that
warm feeling going about the market _ like it was almost
unpatriotic not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Shiller, a self-described bear, was scheduled to appear on CNBC
last Friday to promote his book. As the market plummeted, he
appeared as scheduled but was also asked to appear a second time
during the network's prime-time market wrapup. Shiller acknowledged
that appearances by people like him ``have an impact on the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruno Cohen, senior vice president for business news for CNBC,
said that the network's coverage was not slanted. ``We're not
cheering it up or down,'' he said. ``Sure we're concerned about
anybody losing money, but we believe more information is better
than less. People have blamed the messenger for centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors in chat rooms are also blaming industry analysts at
brokerage houses for the decline. ``A lot of people got hurt in the
process, a lot of lives ruined JUST BECAUSE some of these fund
managers wanted to get some of their tech stock cheap resulting in
a retail blood bath,'' a user called ``ciVic'' wrote on a message
board on Silicon Investor. ``This recent market
correction/crash/valuation _ whatever you want to call it _ had A
LOT to do with the media and analyst comments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of investors believe the market's downturn was a result
of predictions of a market downturn,'' said Jill Munden, a
spokeswoman for Silicon Investor, referring to many in the chat
rooms. ``They want to blame somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Shiller argued that even if they complained, ``most
people will do nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only the few who are on Prozac that have the impulse to
trade,'' he said. ``They are the ones who are most overconfident in
their own abilities. They typically think the market has to go
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many investors who frequent chat rooms and Internet
message boards try to use the medium to bolster their stocks. A
user called ``telecomguy'' said on a message board devoted to Cisco
Systems on Silicon Investor: ``I still firmly believe high-tech is
THE growth industry to be in for the foreseeable future. I will be
scavenging for more buys in the High-Tech VALUE sector (which will
be less of an oxymoron as the good companies will be punished along
with the flakes in the next few months!).''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost a year after Barnes &AMP; Noble became the first traditional
book retailer to spin off its Internet store and take it public,
the online bookseller is searching for a new chief executive and
peace and stability within its own ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the recent plunge in technology stocks, Barnes &AMP;
Noble.com's stock price had plummeted. It ended on Friday at $8.50
_ well off the $26.625 high the stock reached shortly after the
company's $18-a-share initial public offering last May.
</P>
<P>
   And while it hunts for a new chief to replace the three that
came before, the second-ranked online bookstore is also coping with
an exodus of employees in what has been an overheated New York
market for new media workers.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties have tested the stoic alliance of the
electronic venture's partners _ Barnes &AMP; Noble and the media
conglomerate, Bertelsmann. On Wall Street, the problems have also
created the perception of a leadership vacuum, as investors have
been eagerly waiting for a permanent replacement for Jonathan
Bulkeley, the company's chief executive who left abruptly in
February and was paid almost $11 million for his one million stock
options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, it will help if they can bring in a chief executive
with vision who can move them to the next level to gain more market
share,'' said Mark J. Rowen, a senior analyst who tracks e-commerce
for Prudential Securities and who is recommending the stock and
considers it undervalued. ``I think that until there's actually
somebody in place, investors consider it out of sight, out of mind.
There's a perception there's a void there.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to the company's parent, Barnes &AMP; Noble, the
online bookseller is simply taking its time to anoint a new leader
who can offer a long-range solution in a market where many Internet
retailers are trading below their opening prices.
</P>
<P>
   Since its founding in 1997, Barnes &AMP; Noble.com has had a habit
of shuffling its executives like a sheaf of pages. There have been
four chief financial officers, including one who lasted about four
months. And three people have handled the chief executive duties,
including Bulkeley who left after about a year on the job.
Bulkeley, who declined to comment on his departure, announced in
January that he would leave the following month. But the strains
with the top leadership of the parent company were such that he was
asked to leave sooner than he intended, according to Barnes &AMP;
Noble.com employees and former employees.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the company's vice-president for technical
infrastructure departed for a new job. And within the last four
weeks at least eight technology employees have resigned, trailing
employees in corporate communications, community services and
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those departures may reflect the intensifying
competition among Internet companies for employees in New York,
where the Internet workforce has more than doubled since 1997 to
250,000, according to a recent survey by the New York New Media
Association. But some former Barnes &AMP; Noble.com employees, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, also said it was trying and
exhausting to work through so many shifts in the upper ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, control of the online operation is firmly in the
hands of executives from the bookstore chain. Stephen Riggio _ the
founder of the online bookstore and a former chief operating
officer at Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc. _ is the acting head of the company,
which employs a staff of more than 1,200 employees at the Manhattan
office and the distribution warehouse in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   His brother is Leonard Riggio, the chief executive of Barnes &AMP;
Noble Inc., who declined to be interviewed directly about the
online bookseller, but issued a statement that the search continues
for ``someone very, very capable, and we are in no hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize the CEO search is an element in our stock price,
but we are seeking a long-term solution, not a short-term patch,''
Riggio said, adding that his brother ``is brilliant, and no one in
this world knows the Internet better than he does. The employees
are delighted he is in this position.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year Barnes &AMP; Noble spun off its electronic offspring in a
public offering after the media conglomerate, Bertelsmann, bought a
50 percent stake in the unit for $200 million. After the offering,
the partners each kept about a 41 percent stake in the online
venture and Barnes &AMP; Noble took operating control. (Barnes &AMP; Noble,
as part of its online presence, has a business tie to The New York
Times, selling books through links from the newspaper's Web site.)
</P>
<P>
   But with the decline in the online company's stock price, the
strains have been building within Bertelsmann to take a more active
role, according to some executives. They note privately that there
are three options: maintain the status quo, sell out, or seek a way
to participate more aggressively in the operation of a company that
it considers a gateway into the electronic future.
</P>
<P>
   In two weeks, on May 1, Barnes &AMP; Noble.com has scheduled a
conference call to discuss its first-quarter financial results. But
it is not clear whether the company will have any announcement
about a new chief executive. Publishing executives said that talks
had stalled with Jonathan Newcomb, the chief executive of Simon &AMP;
Schuster, whose name emerged as a potential candidate almost
immediately after Bulkeley resigned.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to evaluate the partnership, Bertelsmann's chief
executive, Thomas Middelhoff declined to comment about Barnes &AMP;
Noble.com or the search for a new chief executive. He is one of
three Bertelsmann executives on the board of Barnes &AMP; Noble.com
with a personal investment of more than $500,000, that he made at
the time the stock was selling for $18 a share.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past, Middelhoff has lavished praise on the online
bookstore's financial progress, which for the quarter that ended in
December reported sales of $82 million _ more than double the
amount for the comparable period a year earlier. Its annual sales
for 1999 were $203 million, up from $62 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com still remains the dominant leader in the online book
market, with more than fives times the revenue that Barnes &AMP;
Noble.com has. But the analysts who cover Barnes &AMP; Noble.com
generally recommend its stock and say the company is steadily
chipping away at its archrival's market share.
</P>
<P>
   Rowen, of Prudential, said that he was impressed with the online
bookseller's progress, noting that its share of the combined book
revenues for Barnes &AMP; Noble.com and Amazon grew to 19 percent in
its most recent quarter, up from 16 percent in the previous
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan B. Alexander, an analyst with Wit Capital Corp., said that
he also took comfort from Barnes &AMP; Noble.com's relationship with
Bertelsmann, which provides the company with ``inherent advantages
over strict booksellers.'' He noted that Bertelsmann boasts a list
of millions of book club customers and that Barnes &AMP; Noble.com had
the support to leverage an existing brand and mindshare that's been
previously established with customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Riggio said that this same alliance also offered an
explanation why morale issues did not plague Barnes &AMP; Noble.com as
much as at other e-commerce companies. Employees, he said, ``know
Barnes &AMP; Noble and Bertelsmann are not going anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   However, a number of former employees who spoke on the condition
of anonymity said that they felt pushed and pulled by a variety of
forces.
</P>
<P>
   With their stock options worth less with present prices, they
said it was a temptation to move to other Internet companies where
jobs are plentiful and compensation is higher. To account for that,
in February Barnes &AMP; Noble.com actually repriced almost 6,000
outstanding options from an exercise price of almost $16 to $8.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to compensation issues, others said they left in
part because of working conditions that they described as chaotic
because of revolving executives at the upper tiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your public relations people are leaving and chief
operating officers are rolling out, how can you have a consistent
voice?'' said one former employee who left this year. ``The first
wave of people started leaving in June and July, and then it
started to seem like three or four people a week were leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   When top executives leave it has even larger ripple effect. Last
summer the company's chief technology officer, John Kristie, left
for the same position at Online Retail Partners in New York. Online
Retail has recruited more than 25 former Barnes &AMP; Noble.com
employees who now work in almost every department from senior
management and production to technology and development.
</P>
<P>
   Another wave, about 12 departures, followed Robert Dykman's
shift in March from vice president of technical infrastructure at
Barnes &AMP; Noble.com to Saks Direct, where he also became chief
technology officer.
</P>
<P>
   Riggio said that all Internet companies _ particularly in New
York's Silicon Alley _ may face shortages of Internet engineers.
But he said the market conditions may actually help the company in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there remains considerable job-hopping among this
group,'' he said, ``we believe the current fall-out in the market
bodes to our advantage. This is to say that our own people, as well
as those we are successfully recruiting, realize that short-range
prospects do not always add up to long-range results.''

AS THE `RING' CYCLE CONTINUES, A TEST FOR A TENOR

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Whenever an opera company decides to present a
production of Wagner's four-part ``Ring'' cycle, the major
stumbling block is always the same: who will sing the title role of
the third opera, ``Siegfried,'' the toughest dramatic tenor role in
the entire repertory? Wagner admitted after the fact that he was so
swept up with his vision for the ``Ring'' and his struggle to
complete it that he lost sight of what was vocally possible.
</P>
<P>
   The opera has nearly four hours of music, and Siegfried sings
during most of it. He must portray an impulsive and brawny youth.
Yet it takes most tenors years to develop the vocal heft and
stamina to handle the music.
</P>
<P>
   Only one tenor in the 20th century sang it with the kind of
heroic sound and command than Wagner envisioned: Lauritz Melchior.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday another Danish tenor, Stig Andersen, made his
Metropolitan Opera debut in the title role of ``Siegfried'' in the
first of the company's three complete ``Ring'' cycles this season.
And if he is no threat to the Melchior legacy, Andersen is a
creditable Siegfried, which is no small accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   He does not have a true heroic tenor voice like, say, Ben
Heppner, a great Tristan who has avoided Siegfried, probably
sensibly. Andersen's fine-grained sound, if not enormous, is robust
and backed with solid technique. By skillfully pacing himself, he
managed to summon enough power in the big moments to be heard over
the thick orchestrations, though James Levine, an astute
accompanist of singers as well as a great Wagner conductor, helped
out by keeping the instrumental textures light and clear wherever
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen started his career as a baritone, and his lower voice
is still stronger than his top notes. Vocally this was a solid and
intelligent account of the role, sung with rhythmic incisiveness
and crisp diction.
</P>
<P>
   Everything else about his portrayal was exceptional. He made
this blockhead of a boy seem genuinely sympathetic. When he
questioned Mime, the conniving dwarf who has reared him, about who
his real parents were, this Siegfried seemed painfully vulnerable.
With his reddish-blond hair, husky athletic build and youthful
energy, Andersen looked great.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview he was unwilling to reveal his age. But
during intermission last Saturday, a friend of his, a Danish
journalist, said he was 50. If so, that would mean this performance
is probably the most complete account of the role he will give us.
No backhanded compliment is intended by saying that Andersen is
probably the best Siegfried we have right now.
</P>
<P>
   The final cruelty that Wagner inflicted on Siegfried occurs in
the last 30 minutes of the opera. He arrives on the fire-surrounded
rock where Bruennhilde has been under a sleeping spell since ``Die
Walkuere.'' He wakes her, and they proceed into one of the most
vocally taxing love scenes ever. He has been singing for hours; she
is fresh as a daisy. As Bruennhilde, the soprano Jane Eaglen
certainly sounded fresh, singing with her customary vocal plushness
and presence. Levine seems to elicit the most dramatically involved
work from this sometimes stolid singer.
</P>
<P>
   The great bass James Morris was once again a vocally commanding
and deeply affecting Wotan (here called the Wanderer), surely the
great achievement of his career. The tenor Graham Clark gave a
wily, spry and wonderfully nasal-toned portrayal of Mime. Singing
Mime's bossy brother, Alberich, the baritone Ekkehard Wlaschiha
offered bellowed growls and pitchless shouts in place of honest
singing. The fine mezzo-soprano Birgitta Svenden sang Erda. The
offstage voices of the bass Eric Halfvarson as Fafner the dragon
and the soprano Heidi Grant Murphy as the Forest Bird were
effective.
</P>
<P>
   Eaglen and Andersen return next Saturday as the first cycle
concludes with ``Goetterdaemmerung.'' Here Wagner more evenly
distributed the vocal demands on his ill-fated hero and heroine. &QL;

MARKET PLACE: MONDAY'S OPENING BELL COULD BE A TEST CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly 13 years ago, investors stunned by the worst stock-market
week in memory spent the weekend pondering whether a great bull
market was over. On the following Monday, so many of them decided
to sell that the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 22.6 percent,
or 508 points. Oct. 19, 1987, became known as Black Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, there have been many bad days for the stock
market, but no week as stunning in its devastation as the last
week. Now, as then, investors have large profits that they could
choose to protect by fleeing a market that had seemed so promising
only weeks before.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions made over the weekend by investors, whether at
kitchen tables or in conference rooms at money-management firms,
will largely determine whether last week's slide in stock prices
continues on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1987, many investors have come to view that year's crash
as the greatest buying opportunity of their lives, and market
setbacks have usually been quickly followed by rebounds. But if the
crash of 1987 is well remembered, what led up to it is not.
</P>
<P>
   The prior week saw the Dow plunge 9.5 percent, capped by the
first-ever 100-point daily decline on Friday. That was the worst
week for the index since 1940, when the fall of France to Hitler's
invading army terrified investors.
</P>
<P>
   There was no such obvious reason for the 1987 decline, which in
a way made it all the more terrifying. News articles blamed a bad
trade report, which put pressure on the dollar, and a legislative
proposal to use tax policy to discourage takeovers, but neither
seemed enough to explain such a big fall. The Federal Reserve Board
had been raising interest rates and there had been numerous
warnings that stocks were overvalued, but neither factor was new.
</P>
<P>
   There are numerous similarities now. The Fed is raising interest
rates, there have been plenty of warnings of overvalued stocks, and
a bad economic report, this one on inflation, played a role last
week, when the Dow fell 7.3 percent while the Nasdaq composite
plunged 25.3 percent in its worst week ever.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the crash was brought on largely because selling simply
overwhelmed the markets. The worst selling came from professional
money managers. Some were reacting to redemptions by mutual-fund
investors, but others were trying to get ahead of redemptions that
were expected but did not occur.
</P>
<P>
   The most important selling, however, came from money managers
who had bought into a brand of hooey known as portfolio insurance.
The theory was that a pension fund or other institution could stay
fully invested in stocks but be protected against declines by
hiring a manager who would react to price falls by selling
stock-index futures.
</P>
<P>
   It was assumed that there would always be buyers for such
futures contracts. But there weren't, and demands to sell at the
market price, when there was no real functioning market, drove
prices far lower than they would otherwise have fallen.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to fully assess the sources of selling last
week. Some no doubt came from individuals who borrowed money to buy
stocks, and were forced to sell when prices fell. Margin debt rose
rapidly beginning last fall, just as the Nasdaq market took off on
an explosive surge that has now been largely reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Some also may have come from fund managers who were trying to
raise cash to meet redemptions, real or anticipated. The latest
mutual-fund cash-flow estimates from AMG Data Services, however,
indicate that for the week ended Wednesday investors were putting
money into mutual funds that buy technology stocks. It is not clear
whether that reversed late in the week.
</P>
<P>
   The stock-index futures that the portfolio insurers dumped in
1987 are a relatively simple and visible type of derivative
security _ a security whose value is based on the behavior of
another security. The whizzes of Wall Street have since designed
many more exotic securities, along with computer models to ensure
that they are used safely and that any firm's exposure to risk is
limited.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these securities are traded privately, with no public
disclosure, and the strategies being used are closely guarded.
Portfolio insurance, by contrast, was well known to market watchers
before the 1987 crash, although the way it could devastate prices
was not fully appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   If the stock market does continue lower, we may learn whether
some of the computer models used to assess and control risk now are
able to function under extraordinary circumstances, or whether they
may have exposed some firms to large losses. There is no way to
know whether strategies that did not work out will lead to more
selling.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As individual investors contemplated their finances this
weekend, some of them needed to raise cash to pay 1999 income taxes
that were due Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who bought high-flying mutual funds last year, or who
traded in the hot initial public offerings of Internet companies,
wound up with large short-term capital gains, which are taxed at
ordinary income-tax rates. For some of those investors, the profits
may have been wiped out last week, when some mutual funds that
specialized in technology stocks lost more than a third of their
value. But the taxes are still due.
</P>
<P>
   For the Dow, the week was the worst since Oct. 13, 1989, when
the collapse of a takeover plan for UAL, the parent of United
Airlines, led to a 7.8 percent slide that culminated on a Friday.
Over the weekend, however, investors assessed the situation and
decided that it was a good time to buy. The Dow rose 4.7 percent
the next week.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, people remembered 1987 and concluded that buying after
a plunge was a good way to make money. The fate of stocks on
Monday, and over the next several weeks, may hinge on how many
investors still believe that this theory is a good one.

A YEAR AFTER SCHOOL SHOOTINGS, STUDENTS AND RESIDENTS FIND WAYS TO
COPE 
</HEADLINE>
 
(REPEATING to delete photo note)   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Almost a year has passed since a killing rampage here
by two students thrust an ordinary high school into the vortex of
national debates over gun rights, parental responsibilities,
cultural violence and the nature of evil.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the discourse, as well as the symbolism of 15 deaths
_ including the shooters, who killed themselves _ inside a school,
little beyond the walls of Columbine High School in suburban Denver
has changed since last April 20. Congress is still wrestling with
how to reduce the wrongful use of guns. The parents of the killers
have not spoken publicly about what happened. Disagreements remain
over the influence of violent movies, television, lyrics and
computer games in the everyday life of teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Here, though, the world changed forever.
</P>
<P>
   Scarcely a day goes by without some reminder of the carnage
caused by Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, who ended their own lives
after killing 12 students and a teacher and wounding 23 other
people, several of whom are confined to wheelchairs. Columbine is
now more than a school; it is part of the lexicon, a new shorthand
for the terror of kids killing kids.
</P>
<P>
   Both of Denver's daily newspapers, The Denver Post and The Rocky
Mountain News, won Pulitzer prizes last week for their coverage of
the shootings. But, as editors at both papers said, the honor was
bittersweet. As a further measure of the tragedy's impact,
relatives of victims asked news organizations not to mention the
killers' names in anniversary stories. Some agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not going to be a normal year,'' said Frank DeAngelis,
principal at Columbine. ``I think if people felt just because we
walked into this building and it had different paint, it had
different floor coverings, that everything was going to be back to
normal. Then, I think they were very unrealistic. What I told the
students last April 21 was that what we have experienced in the
last 24 hours is something that will remain with us for a lifetime.
We have learned to cope.''
</P>
<P>
   Coping has been hampered by a continuing search for answers and
an unlikely series of wrenching events in the months following the
shootings. Last fall, the mother of Anne Marie Hochhalter, a
student who was paralyzed below the waist by the shooters,
committed suicide by shooting herself inside a pawnshop after she
had asked to see a handgun. Around the same time, the high school
was closed for a day after a Florida teen-ager sent an e-mail
message to a Columbine student, threatening ``to finish the job''
started by the killers.
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, two other Columbine students were shot and
killed in a sandwich shop just blocks from the school.
</P>
<P>
   All this, in a middle-to-upper-class neighborhood of spacious
homes and tree-lined streets _ a snapshot of American aspirations
fulfilled. Yet now, tour buses glide by the school, filled with the
ghoulishly curious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to move on when you see vanloads of people on the
parking lot, asking where the library is so that they can take a
picture of family reunions on places where people died,'' said
Sarah Bay, a senior who lost three friends in the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Students, teachers and administrators say the shootings changed
the fabric of the school, drawing them all together by the shared
experience of tragedy. DeAngelis said it has not been uncommon for
students to hug in hallways, even to tell each other, ``I love
you.''
</P>
<P>
   But strength in numbers has not reached every corner of emotion
for many of the school's 2,000 students. Courtney Shakowski, a
senior, said she now only feels safe ``with help from my parents
and teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey White, another senior, said she did not feel in danger,
``but my trust factor has gone down. I don't trust very many things
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Katie Beer, a 10th-grader, said quietly, ``I feel like my bubble
is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Leland Andres, a music teacher at Columbine since it opened in
1973, said many students have had trouble concentrating in class
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Trauma experts say these are common feelings, even this long
after the event. ``With adults, we have an idea of what the world
is like, and that world includes bad things, your car getting
stolen, sexual assaults, muggings,'' said Robin Fudge Finegan, a
consultant who has worked with victims of mass tragedy, including
Columbine and the Oklahoma City bombing five years ago. ``A kid
hasn't really formed that definition of the world. To blast them
with that seriousness of life, it's a more intense violation.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some in the Columbine community have turned the shootings into a
cause. Tom Mauser, a former state transportation official whose
son, Daniel, was killed in the shootings, took a leave from his job
to lobby state lawmakers for tighter gun-control measures. He has
become a highly visible figure in Colorado, and even nationally. He
sat in the gallery as President Clinton gave his last State of the
Union Address, a guest of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Al and Phyllis Velasquez, whose son, Kyle, was killed, are
selling silver pins they designed that say, ``Never Forgotten,''
and donating the money to helping turn the library, where most of
the students were killed, into an atrium. ``It's a very personal
journey,'' said Mrs. Velasquez.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take each day as it comes, and you move forward,'' she
continued. ``We're walking through unfamiliar landscape and we're
looking for something that is familiar. You just take one day at a
time. You get over the morning, and if you've made it through that
day, you congratulate yourself for making it through one more
day.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Members of most of the victims' families have been visible in
some way since the shootings, offering opinions on a range of
developments, like the release of videotapes on which the two
shooters displayed their weapons and hatreds. It is less clear how
the parents of the killers are enduring the aftermath of the
shootings, given that many in the Columbine community hold them at
least partly responsible for their sons' actions. The parents of
one victim, Isaiah Shoels, have filed a wrongful death lawsuit
against the Klebolds and Harrises.
</P>
<P>
   Both couples issued statements last week through their
respective lawyers but conveyed little about how the last 12 months
have passed for them. Tom and Susan Klebold apologized for their
son's role in the killings and said, ``The pain of others compounds
our own as we struggle to live a life without the son we
cherished.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne and Kathy Harris, whose son kept weapons and ammunition
stored in his bedroom, echoed those sentiments. And, perhaps, with
the Shoelses' lawsuit in mind, they made it clear they knew nothing
of their son's plan for causing mayhem, saying they ``search our
souls daily for some glimmer of a reason why he would have done
such a horrible thing.''
</P>
<P>
   They added, ``What he did was unforgivable and beyond our
capacity to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Kechter, whose son, Matthew, was among those killed, said
she could imagine a time that the Klebold and Harris families might
be forgiven by others. ``I know that they are suffering a lot of
pain and, I'm sure, a lot of guilt,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But time might bring more important changes, she said, changes
that could provide benefits well beyond one traumatized community.
``People need to get back to basics of society, family and God,''
she said. ``It sounds like I'm grand-standing, but Columbine has
caused a lot of people to look inward to say, `Am I doing the right
thing as a parent? Am I spending enough time with my children?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids have lost that innocence in their eyes.'' She added.
``Yet they have this wisdom. I think there is going to be a
generation of change.''

<P>
   The Internet industry may believe that self-regulation is the
best way to handle online privacy, but consumers apparently do not.
</P>
<P>
   According to a new survey by Odyssey, a market research firm, 82
percent of online households agree strongly or at least somewhat
with the statement, ``The government needs to step in and regulate
how companies can use personal information.''
</P>
<P>
   Trust in the Internet industry, it seems, does not run deep
among the online masses. A notable 92 percent of online households
agree or agree strongly with the statement, ``I don't trust
companies to keep personal information about me confidential, no
matter what they promise.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Donatiello, president of Odyssey in San Francisco, says
the attitudes of online households point to how difficult it may
prove to be for the industry to head off government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's striking is how many people already want the government
to intervene,'' he said. ``The wired households of America are not
a group whose first response is that the government should step
in.''
</P>
<P>
   He described it as a warning shot across the bow of companies
involved in the Internet. ``If they don't do something pretty
quickly to address these concerns, Congress will,'' said
Donatiello, who once worked in Congress as a Senate staff member.
</P>
<P>
   Despite qualms about privacy, though, online shopping continues
to surge, according to Odyssey, which polls 3,000 American
households every six months.
</P>
<P>
   Odyssey says that the 41 percent of the American households that
were online made an estimated 191 million purchases in the last six
months of 1999, dwarfing the 17 million in the comparable six-month
period two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many people, the benefits of online purchasing outweigh
their privacy concerns,'' Donatiello said. ``But privacy is a
serious issue that can slow the development of this medium.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FINDING THE ALIGNMENT FOR E-COMMERCE IMPACT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Web site not sticky enough? Might be its yin and yang.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Stark, an expert in feng shui, the ancient Chinese art of
harmonious balance, took on a case in cyberspace last week. He
performed a feng shui ceremony at the Web site of Corcoran.com,
which sells luxury homes, concluding that the site's bits were not
aligned to promote harmony _ or e-commerce. Dissonant elements
included misplaced ``help'' and ``dream'' buttons.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Corcoran, whose Corcoran Group runs the site, said that
after the ceremony she asked her Web designer to retune the site.
Corcoran, who once had her Madison Avenue office ``smudged'' _ a
Native American cleansing ceremony _ is pragmatic about her
rituals. ``Feng shui is all about energy, and a Web site is pure
energy,'' she said. ``If we do $50 billion in sales in the first
month after our relaunch, we'll know what to attribute it to.'' &QL;

FED EXPECTED TO CONTINUE SAME COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the markets reopen Monday, one of the biggest questions
weighing on investors' minds is what the Federal Reserve might do.
The answer: no change in policy.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly that is the expectation on Wall Street. Alan
Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has committed the central bank to a
series of small interest rate increases until the economy slows and
stock markets, in response, calm down. The sell-off last Friday
does not alter that policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there is evidence that the financial markets are under
more strain than we have seen so far, there is no reason to believe
that the Fed will alter course,'' said John Lipsky, chief economist
at Chase Manhattan Bank. What is required is evidence of a panic in
which lending and borrowing dry up and markets cease to function.
</P>
<P>
   That did not happen last Friday. As Albert Wojnilower, an
economist at Craig Drill Capital and the Clipper Group, put it,
``As long as you were willing to sell at $5 or $10 or $15 down,
there were buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Through statements and actions, Greenspan has locked the Fed
into a fairly predictable approach. He has argued that investors'
enthusiasm for stocks is largely a rational response to rising
productivity and to expectations of rising profits. But even
rational markets can get ahead of themselves, and investors' gains
from rising stock prices have created more demand for goods and
services than the economy can continue to supply. The result is
likely to be inflationary pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Or so Greenspan has argued. As a result, the Fed has raised
rates by a quarter of a percentage point on five occasions since
last June. In this context, last Friday's sell-off can be viewed as
part of the change that the rate increases are intended to bring
about.
</P>
<P>
   Even after last Friday's tumble, the major indexes are still far
from reversing the gains of the 1990s. The Dow Jones industrial
average and the Wilshire 5000, a broad stock measure, are only back
to where they were a year ago, Lipsky noted, and the Nasdaq is up
nearly 34 percent since last spring.
</P>
<P>
   For the Fed to change course _ either cutting rates or even
failing to go up another quarter point at the next Fed
policy-making meeting on, on May 16 _ would be a signal to
investors that the Fed stands ready to bail them out, Roach and
others on Wall Street argued Sunday. That would cause stock prices
to shoot up again, most analysts believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical risk taker will say, `Oh, that is nice, the Fed
will bail us out,''' said David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey
G. Lanston, a Wall Street bond firm.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has supplied relief to offset past panics, which it has
defined as moments in which markets seize up. In panics, buyers all
but disappear despite plunging stock prices. Lenders also pull back
or seek the safe haven of Treasury securities. And markets, in
effect, cease to function.
</P>
<P>
   ``Borrowers won't borrow, lenders won't lend and investors find
themselves unable to buy and sell securities in the desired
volumes, regardless of price,'' Lipsky said.
</P>
<P>
   That happened on Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones industrial
average fell by 21 percent _ far beyond the 5.66 percent decline
last Friday. Reversing course _ then like now, Greenspan had been
trying to slow the economy through interest rate increases _ the
Fed cut rates and promised lenders plenty of liquidity to stay
afloat if borrowers defaulted.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, appointed Fed chairman only a few months earlier,
fashioned that strategy, and he invoked the same rate-cutting
policy again in the fall of 1998, after Russia defaulted on its
debts and Long Term Capital Management, a hedge fund, almost
failed. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ People who always insist that where there's smoke
there's fire probably haven't spent much time at the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever artificially generated clouds of gray start drifting
moodily across a stage, abrading the eyes and throats of the
audience while bringing to mind spook houses at school carnivals,
it's usually an indication that the flame of imagination is burning
low. This doesn't mean that your instinct to bolt for the nearest
exit isn't a good one.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of smoke in the new revival of ``Jesus Christ
Superstar'' that opened Sunday night (Palm Sunday, if you please)
at the Ford Center for the Performing Arts, even though Jerusalem
was never, to my knowledge, famous for its fogs.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless there it is, that catchall symbol for the mystical
and the ominous that seeps across the proscenium, causing
theatergoers to wave their programs before their faces and think
that there must be something sinister afoot.
</P>
<P>
   There will be other sensory assaults in the show, staged by the
Australian director Gale Edwards in the wake of her successful
touring production in Britain, from the giant crucifix, made of
hundreds of high-wattage light bulbs, that glares right into your
eyes to the oversize video image of a battered, bloody Jesus just
before his death.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the aggressive but uncertain amplification of the
orchestra, which sometimes suggests that someone is fiddling idly
with a volume knob. What there isn't, through the whole of this
30th-anniversary staging of the epochal rock opera by Tim Rice and
Andrew Lloyd Webber, is a single original idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus Christ Superstar,'' which began as a concept record
album in 1970 before its varied reincarnations on stage and film,
has never been easy to translate into visual terms.
</P>
<P>
   The 1971 Broadway version, directed by the iconoclastic Tom
O'Horgan (fresh from his success with ``Hair''), was notorious for
its extravagant, whimsical and largely irrelevant-seeming
stagecraft, the total effect of which the critic Clive Barnes,
writing in The New York Times, compared to ``the Christmas
decorations of a chic Fifth Avenue store.'' And does anyone still
talk about the Norman Jewison film version?
</P>
<P>
   Edwards has chosen a fairly straightforward approach, clearly
aimed at young audiences and awash in emblems of youth-courting
topicality.
</P>
<P>
   The action starts with 12 disciples, many of them in camouflage
fatigues, painting graffiti across the columns of Peter J.
Davison's set, which brings to mind the underpass of an urban
bridge. The temple from which Jesus drives the money-changers has
LCD displays quoting stock figures. And the Roman centurions, of
course, evoke storm troopers.
</P>
<P>
   These are images that most adolescents are familiar with from
MTV, where they are deployed with far more sophistication, giving
the unfortunate impression that live theater is no match for film
or television. The choreography by Anthony Van Laast brings to a
mind a group of maverick high school students hopping around
subversively at their prom.
</P>
<P>
   The singing is performed by a mostly young cast with the ardor
of kids in a karaoke bar, though lyrics are not always
distinguishable. The acting is big on grimaces, with the blond,
spiky-haired Judas (Tony Vincent, who took over the part less than
two weeks ago) looking like a pretty-boy rocker in anguished search
of a band, and Jesus (Glenn Carter), registering as pale, passive
and petulant, giving a sort of Jewish-princess air to the
character.
</P>
<P>
   The cast members invest so much energy in their performances
that you wish you could return it. This is doubly the case since
``Jesus Christ Superstar'' is the freshest and most audacious of
the Rice-Lloyd Webber creations. (I confess that I grew up
listening to it and can still recite most of the lyrics.)
</P>
<P>
   The idea of looking at Jesus as a celebrity icon, who wore his
fame ambivalently, was inspired and prescient. So was making Judas,
the opera's narrator, a figure forced to play a fatal role that he
didn't really want to take on.
</P>
<P>
   There is a remarkable melodic verve in the Lloyd Webber score,
without total sacrifice of a pure rock edge. And Rice's lyrics are
irresistibly loose and impudent. (From the Last Supper scene:
``Always hoped that I'd be an apostle/Knew that I could make it if
I tried/Then when we retire we can write the gospels/So they'll
still talk about us when we've died.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Superstar'' works better as a chain of virtuosic songs than as
a sustained piece of theater. It doesn't fully follow through on
most of its themes, and the disjunctiveness is much more evident in
performance. This is not a problem that Edwards resolves, and when
she recreates the torture and crucifixion of Jesus in the familiar,
iconic ways (despite the intrusions of news cameras), it feels
unearned.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Moments of electricity that are not of the stage-lighting
variety are few. But Paul Kandel, who plays King Herod as a cross
between a Las Vegas comedian and the master of ceremonies of
``Cabaret,'' at least has some bite. Kevin Gray brings a vicious
authority to Pontius Pilate. And Maya Days is a lovely Mary
Magdalene, sweet-voiced and earthy.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who was brought over from the London cast, is not
terrible, but he seems to disappear before your eyes in even the
early scenes. On the other hand, it has never been easy portraying
Jesus, and it is hard to remember any actor (other than Willem
Dafoe) who became famous playing the role. For whatever reasons,
one of the ultimately charismatic figures of Western civilization,
so memorably evoked in music and painting, tends to elude
representation in the flesh.

TRIMBLE SEEKS REMOVAL OF MILITANTS FROM UNIONIST PARTY COUNCIL 
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a determined move to free himself from growing
internal opposition to the Northern Ireland peace agreement, David
Trimble, Ulster's most prominent Protestant politician, said Sunday
that he would rid his party governing council of members of the
traditionally militant Orange Order.
</P>
<P>
   The 80,000-strong fraternity, whose parades of marchers in
bowler hats and orange sashes have convulsed Northern Ireland in
recent summers, opposes the peace agreement, which seeks to
establish a Catholic-Protestant power-sharing government in the
conflicted British province. The Orange Order also has backed
recent attempts to overthrow Trimble's moderate leadership of the
Ulster Unionist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Control of the council by Trimble, 55, was threatened last month
in a vote that showed surprising support for his challenger, the
Rev. Martin Smyth, a 68-year-old former Worshipful Grand Master of
the order. Of the 348 ballots cast against Trimble _ 43 percent of
those voting _ 120 came from the Orange Order, whose block
membership he now plans to eliminate.
</P>
<P>
   The change is to be taken up by the party's rules committee in
June before the kickoff of the annual ``marching season'' and will
most likely succeed since Trimble needs only a majority to put it
through. The July parades commemorate the victory of the Protestant
King William III over the Catholic King James II at the Battle of
the Boyne in 1690.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Sunday, made in an interview with The Sunday
Telegraph, marks the first significant forward motion in stalemated
talks since the eight-week-old home rule administration was
suspended on Feb. 11. The parties to the talks are the British and
Irish governments and the two principal adversaries, the Ulster
Unionists and their Catholic rivals, Sinn Fein, the political ally
of the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   Britain put the government on hold and reimposed direct rule
from London when the IRA did not make expected moves on
disarmament. Peter Mandelson, Britain's secretary for Northern
Ireland, said he had to take the action to forestall a situation in
which Trimble would be pressured into resigning his leadership of
the Ulster Unionists. The British believe that Trimble is essential
to any overall settlement and that any successor to him would come
from the rejectionist ranks of the party _ those opposed to the
peace accord, which passed its second anniversary April 9.
</P>
<P>
   Ending the block membership of the Orangemen and of another,
smaller dissident group, the Young Unionists, would give Trimble
the flexibility he says he needs to negotiate a resumption of the
government on terms that moderate unionists would accept. Unionists
are so-called because they believe Ulster should remain part of the
United Kingdom and not move toward becoming part of Ireland, the
goal of republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks reported Sunday, Trimble compared his plan for
his party with the British Labor Party's moves in the 1990s to
modernize its practices by ending block voting by unions and other
left-wing groups. But unionists who object to what they see as
Trimble's continuing concessions to Sinn Fein saw it as a specific
attack on them and predicted it would further divide their
quarrelsome party.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Paisley Jr., an official of the hard-line Democratic
Unionist Party headed by his father, the Rev. Ian Paisley, accused
Trimble of conducting a ``witch hunt'' and said, ``He is out of
touch with grass-roots feeling in his party, who will be angered at
this attempt to strip the UUP of its Orange roots at a time when
our British culture is being stripped away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orange Order has enjoyed a close relationship with the
Ulster Unionists since the party was formed in 1905, and Trimble
himself was once a prominent member. He famously danced a jig of
joy in 1995 with the elder Paisley at the Orange hall in the town

   Ireland and Britain, sponsors of the original talks, have been
working this spring to come up with a new formula to get around the
disarmament problem that has continually deadlocked progress in
putting the peace accord into effect. The goal of disarmament by
May 22, as outlined in the settlement, is no longer attainable, and
the current effort focuses on obtaining from the IRA and Protestant
paramilitary groups a clear statement that they will never again
resort to violence _ or, in shorthand, that ``the war is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble has said he would be willing to re-enter government with
Sinn Fein if a credible guarantee of a commitment to peace short of
actual delivery of arms, now considered an impossibility, were
forthcoming. It was that statement, made in Washington in March,
that brought the leadership challenge from the hard-line Ulster
Unionist rump that rejects any watering down of the ``no guns, no
government'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Sinn Fein leader, Gerry Adams, however, cast doubt on the
outcome of the new strategy in an interview Saturday with The Irish
Times in Dublin. ``I don't think we can any of us say _ which is
why I don't say it _ with any certainty,'' he said. ``And if we
were moved, or tricked into saying it, or made the mistake in
saying that the war was over, what would happen is someone would go
out to try and prove that it wasn't.''

WHEN MARKET REOPENS, INVESTORS EXPECT A VOLATILE DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX BERENSON and LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors large and small looked ahead over the weekend,
nervously wondering if the selling that tore through U.S. stocks
last week will resume when the markets reopen Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   With markets closed, Wall Street only appeared quiet during the
weekend. But behind the scenes, securities firms and many investors
were making preparations for Monday, which at the least promises to
be volatile. Investment bankers said mergers and initial public
offerings are likely to be put on hold until the market settles
down. Already, dozens of initial offerings have been canceled or
postponed, including one for the AltaVista Internet portal.
</P>
<P>
   Big mutual fund companies like Fidelity Investments mobilized
employees to handle an expected surge in telephone calls from
nervous investors. Money managers found themselves in their offices
Sunday, talking to clients and considering whether to take
advantage of last week's plunge to buy shares _ or preserve their
remaining gains by selling more of their portfolios. In Silicon
Valley, home to many of the New Economy stocks that have suffered
the biggest declines, investors and technology company employees
largely shrugged off their losses as to be expected in their
volatile sector.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, outright panic was hard to find over the weekend, except
among the minority of investors who have bought stocks with
borrowed money and are facing margin calls, or demands from their
brokers that they put more cash into their accounts as collateral.
</P>
<P>
   But if hysteria was scarce, so was optimism about a quick
turnaround. Many conservative investors still think that technology
stocks are too expensive, and more aggressive investors are reeling
from their enormous losses in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   Frederic E. Rowe, a general partner in Greenbrier Partners, a
money management firm in Dallas, said from his office Sunday that
he was there ``licking his wounds.'' Rowe, a value-oriented
investor, said his conservative posture had helped him Friday, when
his portfolio fell less than the 5.8 percent drop posted by the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index. Still, like many investors, Rowe
said the speed and ferocity of the plunge had left him stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened so fast,'' he said. Instead of acting abruptly on
Monday, Rowe said, he planned to ``just sit there there and hold my
breath.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Rowland, an Atlanta money manager who has avoided buying
the new technology names that led the Nasdaq market up last year
and are leading it down this month, said that the that market
remains expensive, despite its huge decline. ``We used to sell
dollar bills for $2,'' Rowland said. ``Now we've cut the price to
$1.50. An elevator dropping from the 100th floor to the 50th floor
is not the bargain basement.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many cautious investors, Rowland said the Nasdaq sell-off
was an important lesson for inexperienced investors whose
aggressive bets on technology have been rewarded over the last
couple of years. They are finally learning that stocks can drop as
well as rise, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market is an expensive place to go to grad school,''
Rowland said. ``For the ready-fire-aim crowd, they need to do a
little homework.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only Wall Street types who were working less than
usual this weekend were investment bankers, who suddenly find few
buyers for the companies whose shares they underwrite, or sell to
the public. Their merger work has also faded, with many corporate
executives reluctant to do deals when their share prices are
swinging wildly.
</P>
<P>
   Deal makers who would usually be working spent the weekend
playing golf, attending Palm Sunday services, or soothing clients
by telephone. But most bankers were saying the merger pace will not
slow dramatically unless the sell-off continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain sectors that will be disrupted but, in
general, we are looking to the overall, real economy,'' Steve
Munger, co-head of global mergers and acquisitions at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, said. And while the downdraft in Internet
stock values has to be dealt with, he added, ``it's not like it was
unanticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   A rapidly declining market can also cause deals that have
already been struck to unravel. But few blockbuster deals are
pending, and the most notable of this year, January's announced
combination of America Online and Time Warner, seems immune to
market turmoil. One deal that could hit snags if the stock prices
fall further and stay down is MCI/WorldCom's announced acquisition
of Sprint, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some money-losing Internet companies are already
concerned that they may have difficultly lining up new investments,
bankers said. Several companies, have called venture capitalists in
search of new capital _ including eToys, according to a person
close to that company.
</P>
<P>
   Larger companies that do have spare cash are meanwhile deciding
whether to buy or invest in the Internet companies whose shares
have fallen. But few are likely to rush in Monday, opting instead
to see if prices of Internet companies fall further. Traditional
retailers, for instance, have already embarked on plans to build
their own Internet sites, and have less need to acquire fledgling
Web retailers.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A big difference is expected in the weather along the Northeast
coast with chilly onshore winds and periods of rain. The
combination of a very cold high pressure system over Quebec and a
strong disturbance moving southeast from the Ohio Valley will draw
colder, moist air inland from the North Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   A few strong thunderstorms will form over the Carolinas and
Georgia in the sultry air mass ahead of the disturbance. Florida
will be dry, but very warm.
</P>
<P>
   Inclement conditions will dominate the Great Lakes and Middle
West as low clouds and light rain linger over the region. Wet snow
or sleet will fall in northern Michigan as colder air arrives on
brisk winds from the north.
</P>
<P>
   Hot air will surge north into the western Plains on balmy winds.
Late-day thunderstorms may erupt near the Rio Grande Valley. A
large disturbance moving into Nevada will promote cooler air and
showers in the West.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: KANSAS CONTRASTS
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the temperature in Goodland, Kan., rose to a record
86 degrees. On Saturday, the mercury reached only 29 for a maximum,
marking a 57- degree change in high temperature in just one day.
Even across the Sunflower State, the temperature varied from the
middle 70s in southeast Kansas to the middle 20s in northwest
sections on Saturday. These large temperature variations are the
fuel that powers strong spring storms, like the one that will
affect the East Monday.

AMERICAN OPERA HAS A NEW CLASSIC IN `COLD SASSY TREE' 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSHUA KOSMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON &LR;   &LR; _ Carlisle Floyd's opera ``Cold Sassy Tree,'' which
had its world premiere at the Houston Grand Opera on Friday night,
is a minor masterpiece of musical storytelling and assured
theatrical know-how.
</P>
<P>
   The score boasts passages of radiant, lyrical beauty, including
a striking number of self-contained arias, as well as stretches of
utilitarian wheel-spinning. But what lingers in the listener's
imagination is not so much the musical specifics as the opera's
overall dramatic mastery _ the efficiency and cunning with which
Floyd shapes this tale of the American South.
</P>
<P>
   In three acts spanning more than three hours and encompassing
comedy and pathos, group dynamics and individual emotion, he never
puts a foot wrong or misjudges a dramatic emphasis. Each scene
plays out with unerring focus, and the work as a whole moves
confidently through its entire arc.
</P>
<P>
   Never underestimate the benefits of a lifetime in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cold Sassy Tree'' marks the culmination of a distinguished
operatic career for the 73-year-old composer-librettist, one that
began in 1955 with his first and still most popular opera,
``Susannah.'' Since then, Floyd has created such landmarks of
American opera as ``Of Mice and Men'' _ after ``Susannah'' his most
secure addition to the repertoire _ as well as three Houston
commissions, ``The Passion of Jonathan Wade,'' ``Bilby's Doll'' and
``Willie Stark.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd's outlook is distinctively American (only his ``Wuthering
Heights'' is set elsewhere), and the regional strains that first
showed up in ``Susannah'' infuse ``Cold Sassy Tree'' as well.
</P>
<P>
   The opera is based on Olive Ann Burns' best-selling 1984 novel
about a hardheaded old widower, Rucker Lattimore, who scandalizes
the inhabitants of his turn-of-the-century Georgia town by marrying
Miss Love Simpson _ a young employee in his general store _ just
three weeks after the death of his first wife.
</P>
<P>
   Burns' novel was a commodious, rather flabby collection of
reminiscence, period detail, exuberant yarn-spinning and sheer
cornpone sentimentality. What is immediately impressive about
Floyd's opera is the ruthless efficiency with which we has
extracted a stage-worthy libretto from that mass of detail.
</P>
<P>
   Characters by the dozen have been left on the cutting-room
floor, while others have had their identities merged (one of the
novel's more admirable figures, a dirt-poor ``linthead'' employed
in the town's cotton mill who is determined to complete his
education, becomes a villain out of dramatic necessity).
</P>
<P>
   By nudging young Will Tweedy (the opera's narrator and the
widower's grandson) into a romance with another linthead, the
ambitious and lovely Lightfoot McClendon, Floyd creates a telling
dramatic parallelism missing from the source. Other strokes too,
both large and small, help turn Burns' crowded canvas into a
crisply focused tale.
</P>
<P>
   That in turn makes room for the elegantly crafted lyric set
pieces, half a dozen or more of them, that represent the opera's
real glories. Chief among these is ``Rented rooms,'' in which Love
_ who has agreed to keep house for Rucker in exchange for ownership
of his home and furniture _ details her impoverished past to the
scandalized family. The melody is a long-breathed, gorgeously
arching affair, driving to a Puccinian climax before subsiding in a
little coda reminiscent of ``Mi chiamano Mim &LR; i &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   But there are others as well _ a heart-tuggingly tentative love
duet for Will and Lightfoot, Rucker's wonderfully vital and
homegrown sermon when the small-mindedness of the townspeople
compels him and Love to hold a makeshift church service in their
parlor, and another, even more wrenching revelatory aria for Love
later in the opera.
</P>
<P>
   Setting these off are zestful comic elements, from the quartet
of female busybodies who represent the town's judgmental side to
Love's caddish former beau Clayton McAllister, a swaggering Texas
cowboy who bursts on the scene to the strains of a Copland parody.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston production is sheer delight, staged on Michael
Yeargan's picture-postcard sets and directed by film director Bruce
Beresford with the closely observed sense of detail that informed
his 1983 film ``Tender Mercies.''
</P>
<P>
   Music director Patrick Summers (also the San Francisco Opera's
principal guest conductor) led a vigorous, sensitive performance,
briskly paced through the narrative sections (``Cold Sassy Tree''
is a little full of ``Our Town''-style expository voice-overs) but
with plenty of time for the score's more effusive outpourings.
</P>
<P>
   And the cast was nothing short of superb, led by Dean Peterson
as the irascibly appealing Rucker and Patricia Racette as a
luminous Love Simpson. John McVeigh was charm itself as Will
Tweedy, and Margaret Lloyd's beautifully clear soprano gave extra
allure to Lightfoot's music.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Alexander and Beth Clayton made a wonderful team as Will's
mother and aunt, and Christopher Schaldenbrand caught Clayton's
self-infatuation perfectly. Judith Christin contributed a gem of a
comic turn as Miss Effie Belle Tate, the leader of the town's
virtuous crusaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cold Sassy Tree'' is the 25th world premiere by the Houston
Grand Opera, an astonishing track record that is testament to this
company's farsighted enterprise under its visionary general
director, David Gockley.
</P>
<P>
   From here it will go on to revivals by its four co-commissioning
companies in San Diego, Baltimore, Austin and North Carolina. And
after that, watch out _ we may well have another American repertory
staple on our hands.

 STOCK BUBBLE FINALLY BURSTS  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Investors' weeklong skittishness turned to
outright panic Friday as inflation fears sparked the biggest
one-day point losses ever for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and
Nasdaq composite index.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of money has gone to money heaven,'' said Bill Meehan,
chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. ``It won't
be coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow plunged 617.78 points, or more than 5 percent, to finish
the day at 10,305.77. At one point in the last hour of trading, the
blue-chip index was down 722 points.
</P>
<P>
   The tech-heavy Nasdaq, meanwhile, experienced a complete
meltdown, dropping 355.49, or almost 10 percent, to 3,321.29.
</P>
<P>
   Although this represents a slight rebound from the Nasdaq's
411-point low for yesterday's session, the cascading losses still
bring the index down more than 1,000 points for the week. The
Nasdaq has plummeted more than 34 percent since hitting a record
high on March 10.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 83.95, or almost 6
percent, to 1,356.56.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost like investors believed in a magic spell, that
tech could only go up, up and away,'' said Alfred Kugel, senior
investment strategist at Stein Roe &AMP; Farnham in Chicago. ``That has
pretty much come to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say it's anyone's guess how the market will behave on
Monday. While some insist that the Nasdaq has just about reached
bottom, others say it could fall by as much as 15 percent more.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's sell-off was fueled in part by a government report
showing that consumer prices rose at their strongest clip in nearly
a year during March. This rekindled fears that the Federal Reserve
will move to slow the red-hot U.S. economy by once again boosting
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Price Index, the leading benchmark of inflation,
climbed 0.7 percent last month. Economists had been expecting a 0.5
percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding volatile energy and food prices, the CPI was up only
0.4 percent, but that was still twice the expected amount.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the CPI is only part of the story. The wider and, for many
investors, more worrying trend is a growing disenchantment with
technology stocks that has spread from Wall Street to Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a rethinking about the inevitability that you
will make money any time you buy technology,'' Kugel said.
</P>
<P>
   He traced much of this revisionism to the collapse of antitrust
negotiations between the government and Microsoft Corp. earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was the most successful technology company ever invented
and the government was going after them,'' Kugel said. ``People
realized that if it could happen to Microsoft, it could happen to
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychologically, that really affected the invincibility of
technology,'' he observed.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of many market pundits, the revelation that tech
stocks actually can shift into reverse, as opposed to possessing
nothing but forward gears, served as a wake-up call for numerous
investors.
</P>
<P>
   And once these investors looked closer at the sky-high
valuations and shaky bottom lines of most leading tech outfits,
they quickly realized that, in many cases, there was little more
than wishful thinking propping up share prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is good,'' said Steve Adams, managing director of First
Security Van Kasper in San Francisco. ``People were unbelievably
cocky and didn't understand risk.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, they sure do now.
</P>
<P>
   This was the worst week in the 29-year history of the Nasdaq _ a
25-percent decline since Monday. Most traders consider a 10-percent
drop to represent a market ``correction.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq is down more than 18 percent for the year. However,
it doesn't hurt to remember that the index surged a whopping 84
percent last year. Many investors, in other words, are still ahead
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   It might not feel that way, though. Some of the biggest losers
in the tech camp this week were also among the sector's brightest
stars.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, Oracle Corp. and National Semiconductor Corp.
each lost about a quarter of their market value over the past five
days.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless technology leader Qualcomm, last year's highest-flying
stock, fell almost 17 percent yesterday alone, to $105.19, while
chipmaker Intel Corp. slid nearly 9 percent, to $110.50.
</P>
<P>
   Such carnage did not sit well with the investors who crowded
into the Charles Schwab office in San Francisco's Financial
District to see how the day's devastation was playing out in their
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Fay Wu arrived at 10 a.m. and remained at one of the lobby
computers for the next three hours. ``I'm trading'' was all she had
to say to a reporter as tech stocks flew by on her screen in the
last few minutes before the closing bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go away,'' said a young man in a black vest who was intensely
scouring the market for bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Archie Thomas, a San Francisco lawyer, said he sold off a number
of stocks early in the morning once he sensed how the wind was
blowing. ``But I'm not selling my long-term holdings,'' he said.
``I'd have to pay too much in taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors shouldn't look to Fed chief Alan Greenspan for a quick
fix to the market's woes. After persistently declaring stocks to be
overvalued, he said in a speech yesterday that ``financial
institutions should expect to look to the central bank only in
extremely rare situations.''
</P>
<P>
   The comment was taken by many to mean that the Fed remains
unsympathetic to the plight of investors and may in fact be
planning to jack up rates again in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people who are new to the market believed it just
couldn't go down,'' said Cantor Fitzgerald's Meehan. ``They thought
Greenspan just wouldn't let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lehmann, an economics professor at the University of San
Francisco, blamed part of yesterday's collapse on a recent increase
in margin calls by securities houses _ a demand that customers
return borrowed funds that had been used to buy stocks.
</P>
<P>
   This caught many investors off-guard, he said, and forced them
to sell off holdings to raise cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very gloomy about the prospects for the stock market,''
Lehmann said. ``I think there's going to be a major bear market and
maybe a recession.''
</P>
<P>
   But Janet Yellen, a professor at the University of California at
Berkeley's Haas School of Business and former chairwoman of the
President's Council of Economic Advisers, rejected the notion that
recent market turbulence signals an increased risk of recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy can absorb a correction of this size,'' she said.
``The belief that a recession is around the corner is highly
misguided.''
</P>
<P>
   Yellen, who also has served on the board of governors of the
Federal Reserve, added that investors' losses in the stock market
come ``at a time when the economy is extremely strong. It's
certainly not something I would panic about.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investors, however, will nevertheless require fortification
before facing the damage yesterday's rout did to their nest eggs
and retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to look,'' said Tim Colen, a geologist who was
enjoying a cup of coffee at a downtown cafe shortly after the
market closed. ``Or maybe after a couple of beers.''

 A SOBER LOOK AT DAY'S SCARY NUMBERS  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Looking at the raw numbers, Friday the 14th
could very well join 1987's Black Monday and 1929's Terrible
Tuesday as one of the scariest days in stock market history.
</P>
<P>
   However, in percentage terms, the worst single-day point drops
for the Nasdaq, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 do not look quite so terrifying. On Friday, the Dow fell
5.64 percent and the S&AMP;P 500 fell 5.76 percent, a far cry from
their respective 22 percent and 20.5 percent declines on Oct. 19,
1987.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the two closely watched indices fell more than they did
Friday as recently as Aug. 31, 1998. That's when, alarmed by
Russia's political crisis, the Dow skidded 6.37 percent and the S&AMP;P
dipped 6.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, the damage to the Nasdaq is less easy to downplay or
dismiss. The index of close to 5,000 stocks lost 9.66 percent
Friday. That was second only to the 11.35 drop on Oct. 19, 1987.
But the loss came at the end of a bad run for the index.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq stocks have lost more than $2 trillion in market value _
a whopping 34.2 percent _ since peaking at 5,048.62 on March 10.
That's more than the $1.83 trillion U.S. budget plan approved by
Congress this week. By contrast, the Dow index of 30 large
companies has shed only 12 percent of its value since peaking on
January 14.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of yesterday's decimation, Robertson Stephens
investment banking director Todd Carter said, ``I've been holding a
lot of hands.'' Many investors are worried but few are totally
surprised by the recent market jitters.
</P>
<P>
   After all, interest rates and concerns about inflation have been
creeping up.
</P>
<P>
   So has awareness that stock prices, especially for Internet
startups with more promise than profits, have defied traditional
price-earnings models. ``The pendulum in the market has been
swinging to extremes,'' said Carter.
</P>
<P>
   For example eToys, a recent IPO that soared as high as $86 a
share is down to $4.75. Commerce One, a Web-based business services
company and last year's top-performing initial public offering, has
skidded from $331 to $66 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Carter figures that some sectors may have farther to slide, but
he also believes that some issues have already been ``oversold.''
However, as a sign of caution, Carter said the 27 IPOs that his
firm hopes to bring public currently are in a ``holding pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   Many other analysts and investors remain apprehensive about
where stocks will go next week. Some self-described experts feel
tech stocks should be avoided for years and the Nasdaq could give
up another third of its value.
</P>
<P>
   But Rick Eakle of Eakle Associates in Fair Haven, N.J. expects
things could settle down early next week after the first few hours
of margin calls on Monday. ``Since the inception of Nasdaq in 1971,
there have been eight corrections and the average decline is 32.7
percent,'' he said. ``Nasdaq is down 34 percent in a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current market has a lot of characteristics of the bottoms
in 1987, 1990 and 1998 when there was a period of unrelenting
declines and a lot of speculation was squeezed out of the market.
An attack on the strongest stocks like American Express, Cisco,
Dell, Intel and Hewlett Packard also typically comes at the end of
a selling phase.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Consumer Price Index was up sharply yesterday,
Eakle figures inflation fears are overblown. For example, he said
oil prices are on their way down since the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to increase production last
month.

BEAT THE HUMDRUM WITH SAVORY BAKED DRUMSTICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Flagmen on highway construction projects don't stand around as
long as ``birders,'' and they probably earn $18 an hour. Pay is
poor for birders and the results match the reward. A good day for a
birder is one that ends with a minimum of pigeon droppings on your
new Eddie Bauer jacket.
</P>
<P>
   My wife is a birder.
</P>
<P>
   I told her I might one day share her enthusiasm, if the Audubon
Society ever endorses an activity like ``speed birding.'' Under my
incomplete rules, speed birding would involve a lot of running,
flailing of arms and crashing into bushes. The entrant who creates
the most flapping and squawking while flushing the most birds gets
the blue ribbon.
</P>
<P>
   It's my guess that I would garner a lot of honors in the sport
of speed birding. This guess is based on the fact I can smell a
fried chicken three miles away.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, there was no standing around when the chicken was
served. In those days, a family of four shared one (1) fried
chicken. A family of 14 also shared one (1) fried chicken. Those
were the rules of the game. In the post-Depression era, there was
no such thing as an ungnawed chicken neck. Chicken wings were as
treasured as angel flappers.
</P>
<P>
   These days, cooks buy chicken parts. Everybody gets a fat thigh
or half a chicken breast as their portion of the feasts. There are
often ``seconds'' on the platter. And nobody eats drumsticks.
</P>
<P>
   Check that. I eat drumsticks and because nobody else does I can
often purchase a dozen of them for about $2.50. When that happens I
am liable to bake some:
</P>
<P>
   Speed-Birder Legs
</P>
<P>
   12 drumsticks
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-half cups fresh bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons onion powder
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon paprika
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons poultry seasoning
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   I make bread crumbs by tossing two slices of whole wheat bread
into a food processor. Hit the button, then pour the crumbs onto a
sheet of wax paper and add the Parmesan, parsley, onion powder,
paprika, poultry seasoning, salt and black pepper. Mix well.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the olive oil and stir in the mustard until you have a
smooth paste.
</P>
<P>
   Brush each drumstick with the olive oil mixture, roll in the
seasoned bread crumbs and place on a greased oven pan.
</P>
<P>
   When you have a dozen on the pan, shove it into a preheated,
350-degree oven for about 50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   If you insist upon chicken breasts for dinner, cook them like my
friend Joanne Booth cooks them.
</P>
<P>
   Las Cruces Chicken
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons jalapeno jelly
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons white wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons honey
</P>
<P>
   4 chicken breast halves, skinned and boned
</P>
<P>
   2 whole, canned green chilies
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces Monterey jack cheese, sliced
</P>
<P>
   Salt, pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Combine jelly, vinegar, mustard, honey, and salt and pepper and
spread over the bottom of an oven dish big enough to hold the four
chicken pieces with room to spare. Shove dish into 375-degree oven.
When the gloop has liquefied, remove dish from oven. Roll each
piece in the sauce, saying ``hot damn!'' every time you burn a
finger. Return dish to oven for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Remove dish again, lay half a chili over each breast, cover with
cheese slices then spoon some sauce over the top. Return dish to
oven for 15 or 20 minutes. Serves four.
</P>
<P>
   If you can prepare this dish without uttering ``hot damn'' even
once, you're a birder, not a golfer.

 WORKERS CAN SHOP ON COMPANY INTRANETS  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Last week, Oracle Corp. employee Amy Odum did
something that could have gotten her fired at some companies. Using
her office computer, she went online and bought health insurance
for Buster, her miniature schnauzer.
</P>
<P>
   Odum didn't get in trouble shopping on company time because
Oracle allows her to buy discounted goods and services at a new
employees-only shop on the company's internal computer network.
It's all part of an employee Web portal designed and run by San
Francisco startup Perksatwork.com.
</P>
<P>
   Odum isn't alone. Workers at other companies are using similar
employee portals to find real estate agents, arrange to have their
dog walked or buy movie tickets. Almost anything they can buy on
the Internet is available in these shops.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the average Internet mall, the shops are incorporated
into their companies' internal Web sites, and the employees pay as
little as 50 percent of normal prices.
</P>
<P>
   Why would a boss make it easier for the staff to conduct
personal business at work? Perksatwork.com chief executive Jim
Greene says it's all about retaining employees. ``The war for
talent is being lost by companies of all sizes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 percent of Northern California workers left their
jobs or were fired in 1998 and 1999. With turnover this high,
employers are going all out be known as nice places to work.
</P>
<P>
   Employee portals aren't new. Companies such as Epicentric and
Plumtree have been making them for several years. What makes the
new generation of portals different is that they have added
shopping and services to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Perksatwork.com's employee portal makes it easy for
employees to set up discussion groups around topics such as
neighborhood child care. The site also hosts virtual bulletin
boards and classified ads, where employees can advertise for
carpool members or sell a used bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   Another employee portal provider, Seattle's ServiceStop, focuses
on linking employees with local providers of such services as auto
detailing. ServiceStop is now setting up a second office in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The employee shopping portal market is still a tiny niche in
e-commerce, with only a handful of young companies vying against
each other. Still, it is getting a vote of confidence from venture
capitalists. Perksatwork.com recently netted $67 million in
funding, while EmployeeSavings.com, a Bellevue, Wash., competitor,
just got $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   At Oracle's Redwood Shores headquarters, online discount
shopping is just one of a multitude of conveniences available to
its workers. It also provides other services such as on-campus
photo processing, a car wash and dry cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller companies that can't afford to build a staff-cradling
village like Oracle's can still offer their workers a shopping
portal, because Perksatwork.com and its competitors are offering
their services for free.
</P>
<P>
   They can do this because they make their money on sales
commissions. Every time a customer uses EmployeeSavings.com or
Perksatwork.com to buy something, the portalmaker gets a
commission, usually ranging from 1 to 5 percent of the item's
price.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ordinary online shopping malls, employee portals can
deliver large numbers of potential customers _ like Oracle's 20,000
employees nationwide _ all at once. In exchange for this influx of
people, the retailers offer their goods at a discount.
</P>
<P>
   For ServiceStop, the formula is a little different. Employees
pay the going rate for services, but the service providers often
throw in extra conveniences _ like picking up a car and taking it
to the service garage _ for free.
</P>
<P>
   Employee shopping portals have a competitive edge over generic
Web malls because the portals have ``a more captured audience,''
said Mike May, a senior analyst for Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   A customer may use an online mall once to buy books from
Amazon.com, but the next time that customer wants to buy books
online, they're likely to go straight to Amazon.com, instead of
returning to the online mall.
</P>
<P>
   The discounts at employee portals are ``an incentive for
customers to make every single transaction through them,'' May
said.
</P>
<P>
   The only cloud on the horizon is the lack of unique technology
behind the employee portals, said Joshua Walker, an analyst with
Forrester Research. For example, if Perksatwork.com makes its idea
look attractive enough, established makers of human resources
software _ such as its client Oracle _ could simply mimic the idea
and beat Perksatwork.com at its own game, Walker warned.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the portals have been popular with employees. Since
Oracle started offering a Perksatwork.com portal March 15, about
half of the corporation's 20,000 employees nationwide have signed
up, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Human resources managers like the employee portals too, because
they make their jobs easier. The portal can be a place to
consolidate a company's existing corporate discounts.
</P>
<P>
   They are also an easy way for companies to reward workers. For
example, a manager using ServiceStop could authorize the employee
of the month to get $50 worth of dry cleaning, charged to the
company's account.
</P>
<P>
   Perksatwork.com plugs itself as promoting a balance between the
demands of work and personal life, but some might wonder if
employers are using the portals to push employees to work longer
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ServiceStop founder Jon Clemens acknowledges that one reason
employers use his service is that they don't want high-paid
employees taking an extended lunch or coming in late if they have
to deal with a problem such as getting a leaky sink fixed at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to see people have some time off,'' said Gloria Dunn,
who wrote ``From Making a Living to Having a Life,'' a book about
balancing work and personal life. ``I don't believe it's good for
an employee to spend 24 hours in front of a computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Employers who install shopping portals also run the risk that
some workers will abuse the privilege. Shopping at work is already
more common _ and time consuming _ than some employers might
realize. For instance, Internet users who visited auction site eBay
in January from an office computer typically spent a whopping 157
minutes on the site, while visitors from home only spent an average
of 126 minutes, according to Nielsen/NetRatings, a firm that
measures Internet use.
</P>
<P>
   For some companies, such as Oracle, it's a matter of trust. They
simply count on their employees to responsibly manage their own
time. Other firms monitor their workers' use of the shopping
portals and other nonwork-related Web sites, and intervene if the
employees are spending too much time online.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're excessively shopping on Perksatwork, we would
consider that abuse,'' said Kristi Graning, who directs Web
services at ReMax, a Denver real estate company and a
Perksatwork.com customer. ``But a 10-minute break to buy movie
tickets is fine with us.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of offices where an employee shopping portal
would not be welcome. Indeed, ``stricter'' employers spend lots of
money on software that lets them monitor their employees' use of
the Internet _ often with the express purpose of preventing online
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   According to International Data Corp., employers bought $53
million worth of employee monitoring software last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even an hour of unproductive surfing (a day) is costing
employers hundreds of thousands of dollars a year,'' said Ted Ladd,
spokesman for Websense, a software application that monitors
workers' Web surfing.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of a client, Websense can prevent office
computers from accessing certain categories of Web sites. Although
the company also filters out pornography, stock trading and chat
sites, more and more employers want shopping sites blocked, Ladd
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ladd suggested that employee shopping portals might help
employers limit Internet use.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're controlling where they're shopping, maybe it's
better than having people free surf,'' Ladd said.
</P>
<P>
   But Perksatwork.com chief executive Greene bristled at the idea
that his technology could be used as a tool to control employees'
activities. The point, he said, isn't control, it's employee
retention.

RUSHDIE CREATES A SENSATION ON HIS RETURN TO INDIA 
</HEADLINE>
   By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ The long, hurtful exile of Salman Rushdie has
ended. Barred from India for more than a decade after it banned his
novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' a playful, bantering Rushdie is back
with a long-sought visa in hand.
</P>
<P>
   He came, he said, to repair his broken relationship with the
native land that has inspired much of his fiction.
</P>
<P>
   For a full week, Rushdie and his son, Zafar, 20, who has not
been in India since he was 4, roamed freely around many of the
tourist sites of north India _ the Taj Mahal in Agra, the Red Fort
in Delhi, the City Palace in Jaipur _ with nary a whisper about
their presence in the country's cacophonous riot of newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``India rushes in on you from every direction,'' Rushdie said in
an interview last Saturday. ``I'm suffering from a kind of
overload. I just wanted to put myself back in the place and bring
my son, Zafar. He was very keen to come. And that became the
meaning of the trip for me, this father and son moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Their anonymous trek finally dissolved in a blaze of popping
flash bulbs last Friday evening when Rushdie and his son made a
grand entrance at the Commonwealth Writers Prize ceremony here with
all of New Delhi's literati looking on.
</P>
<P>
   Rushdie was promptly swarmed by journalists and well-wishers.
His latest novel, ``The Ground Beneath Her Feet,'' lost the best
book prize to ``Disgrace'' by the South African writer J.M.
Coetzee, but Rushdie was still the star of the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you didn't find me, you shouldn't assume that I'm
in hiding!'' Rushdie gleefully told the reporters who crushed
around him.
</P>
<P>
   As the news of Rushdie's arrival spread, Muslim organizations
that said they had been offended by ``The Satanic Verses''
organized protests. One group burned him in effigy. But earlier
threats of violence did not materialize, and the demonstrations
were relatively small.
</P>
<P>
   Rushdie thanked his critics for the civilized nature of their
protests. ``If they don't like what I write, I'm sorry,'' he said.
He also spoke of India in tones of reconciliation. The Congress
Party government that banned his book is history, he said. And
while he would love to see the ban lifted, he said he had done no
lobbying on the current visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to leave behind the past to be able to go on,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rushdie's security seemed almost as relaxed as he was. A crowd
of reporters showed up last Saturday at the Taj Palace Hotel in
hopes of talking to him. None were searched before they reached the
first floor, where he was holding court. He emerged for a few
minutes to talk to all assembled, then entertained some one-on-one
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   As a clutch of people pressed in on him, Rushdie, wearing a
long, loose shirt known as a kurta and pajama-style pants, said
wryly that he would feel less regretful about the banned novel ``if
people would just read my 11 other books.''
</P>
<P>
   Rushdie, with his acute eye for life in India, has been cut off
from the country where he was born since ``The Satanic Verses'' was
published in 1988, one of the many blows he sustained after the
book came out. The most disastrous, of course, was the fatwa, or
religious edict, issued by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeni in 1989. The
Iranian leader, now dead, charged Rushdie with blasphemy against
Islam and called for his death.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than a year ago, India finally granted Rushdie,
who now lives in London, a visa to enter the country, with approval
coming from the highest levels of the Hindu-nationalist-led
government in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   This was his first visit since he got the visa, and it has had a
kind of Rip Van Winkle quality. The dozen years he has been gone
have seen India undergo major changes. The Congress Party, which
ruled India through the Nehru-Gandhi family dynasty, has fallen
low, and the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has risen.
The government-dominated economy has had almost a decade of greater
openness to foreign investment and market forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very clear there's a lot more money sloshing around,''
Rushdie said. ``In the newspapers there's a lot of coverage of the
high life of the rich middle class. Almost daily there are color
supplements detailing the antics of the gilded age.''
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Trunk Road seemed to him wider and smoother, but it
carried him past the rich roadside life more quickly than he would
have liked. The omnipresence of Coca-Cola ads made him hopeful, he
said, that Thumbs Up _ a local cola drink he despises _ has been
eclipsed. (It is still alive and well.)
</P>
<P>
   In politics, a subject Indians love to chew on, he bemoaned what
he saw as the Congress Party's tilt rightward under Sonia Gandhi,
the dynasty's latest steward. ``One can't help feeling the old gang
_ the dynastic group and its supporters _ is preventing the
emergence of new kinds of leaders in the Congress Party,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Rushdie, who comes from a Muslim family, said the Hindu
nationalists were more moderate under the aging Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee. But Rushdie predicts that the coalition government
will fall apart once Vajpayee ceases to lead it _ and that the
Hindu nationalists will revert to an intolerant Hindu triumphalism,
which he likened to fascism.
</P>
<P>
   As Rushdie introduced his son to the intense smells and sounds
and street life of India, he took him to the family's peaceful
ancestral property at Solan in the northern state of Himachal
Pradesh. He said he hoped to turn the family home, Anees Villa,
into a small writer's colony if he could find someone to administer
it.
</P>
<P>
   And Rushdie, who was to leave India on Sunday, said he planned
to return often.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to make it extremely boring,'' he said. ``Instead of
everyone flocking to see Rushdie, it's going to be, `Oh, there he
is again.' Boring people is the best way to regain normal life. I
intend to bore India into submission.''

FORMER COKE WORKERS START TRIP TO PUBLICIZE RACIAL DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A busload of about four dozen former employees of the
Coca-Cola Co. and activists began a five-day trip on Saturday to
draw attention to their frustrations with the soft-drink company.
Their journey will end Wednesday at the Coca-Cola annual
shareholder meeting in Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   The group wants Coca-Cola to settle a racial discrimination suit
brought by eight employees nearly a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the plaintiffs are seeking class-action status for
as many as 2,000 past and current employees. They contend that the
company discriminates against African Americans in pay, promotions,
and performance evaluations. The company has denied the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Delaware, we hope to say to Coke, it's time,'' said Larry
D. Jones, a laid-off Coca-Cola manager who organized the trip. ``We
will not go into the 21st century with the same problems.''
</P>
<P>
   At the departure rally outside an Atlanta church, roughly 100
supporters, many wearing red hats emblazoned with ``Freedom
Rider,'' held hands and sang: ``We are riding for justice. Lord,
come by here.''
</P>
<P>
   They bowed their heads in prayer as the Rev. E. Randel Osburn,
vice president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,
vowed, ``We are not going to keep spending money where people
disrespect us.''
</P>
<P>
   But just before the passengers boarded the bus, Jones said, ``We
won't call for a boycott unless things don't work out the way they
should.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there were signs that a boycott of Coca-Cola might be
called at some point as the bus stops for rallies in Greensboro,
N.C., Richmond, Va., Washington and finally Wilmington, where Jones
plans to address shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   At the departure rally, one sign held by a little girl asked,
``Will the Real Thing Do the Right Thing?''
</P>
<P>
   The threat of a boycott has loomed over the company since ``The
Ride for Corporate Justice'' held its first news conference and
called for an equitable settlement of the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   A Coca-Cola spokesman, Ben Deutsch, said, ``We continue to work
toward an expeditious and equitable resolution of the lawsuit.'' He
declined to comment on the prospect of a boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Douglas N. Daft, Coca-Cola's chairman, told
employees that he would work ``toward an expedient and equitable''
resolution of the lawsuit.

considered the toughest school drug testing policy in the nation.

ETHIOPIAN WOMAN SEEKS HER FOURTH CONSECUTIVE BOSTON MARATHON
TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZ ROBBINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Fatuma Roba's hair is pinched back, and small gold
ovals dangle from her ear lobes, framing a regal face, with eyes
that seem constantly fixed on the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   When the Ethiopian runner smiles _ sharing a joke with her male
teammates flanking her at the interview table _ she softens the
serious point of her chin and flashes a glimpse of her sly wit.
</P>
<P>
   Roba is confident and proud of her success. But she would never
tell you that.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy and humility is utmost in her culture, especially for
women, even one of the most famous ones in her country.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old from Addis Ababa is trying to win her fourth
straight Boston Marathon, something no woman or man has ever done.
``I am hoping to make history,'' she said simply, through a
translator. ``I feel like I have made good preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   Her remarkable quest highlights the 104th Boston Marathon, but
the men's race also offers an extra incentive. Joseph Chebet of
Kenya hopes to defend his 1999 title (he is also the reigning New
York champion) while accomplishing another goal: Boston serves as
the Kenyan men's Olympic Trials. Two runners will be chosen here,
and another will be chosen later by committee, to compete in
September in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Add the pressure to qualify with the mystique and infamous hills
of the Boston Marathon and Chebet understands the challenge. ``To
win for the second time,'' he said, ``I would be very, very
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   To win for the fourth time would even make Roba's competitors
happy. ``We're very proud of her,'' said Kenya's Lornah Kiplagat,
making her Boston debut. ``She is the only woman from Africa who
has won the Olympics and Boston Marathon three times. She is an
inspiration for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she can win four times, it gives us much more potential to
think we can do it, maybe six times.'' Then, with a smile, she
added, ``After she stops running.''
</P>
<P>
   That will not happen soon, especially since Roba is aiming to
repeat as the Olympic gold medalist. In 1996, she surprised the
field in Atlanta to become the first African woman to win the
Olympic marathon.
</P>
<P>
   The following spring, she proved it was no fluke. She followed
her Olympic title with a victory in Boston, spoiling Uta Pippig's
bid for her fourth straight laurel wreath. In 1998, Roba overcame
pain behind her right knee for a personal best of 2 hours 23
minutes 21 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Roba dominates in Boston (she has won no marathon outside of the
United States) because the maddening hills resemble the terrain she
trains on in Ethiopia. There, she has become an icon. Her portrait
is emblazoned in the five rings in Addis Ababa Stadium, alongside
legends like Abeba Bikila, who became the first black African to
win the Olympic marathon in 1960, and followed it with another gold
in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not really want to be famous,'' Roba said with a shrug.
``But it's nice to be among the renowned athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Before her victory in Atlanta, few knew of her in Ethiopia.
``Then something has happened,'' she said. ``Very many people,
small and big come up to me and thank me.''
</P>
<P>
   She was rewarded by the Ethiopian government with the equivalent
of $7,000 after Atlanta. Last year, like this year, the prize for
the Boston winner is $80,000. With her earnings, Roba built a
three-story house. But for now she stays in her older, smaller
house with four relatives.
</P>
<P>
   She bought a Mercedes, but does not drive it. Her brothers do.
``Definitely everybody likes it,'' she said with a smile. She just
likes to run.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of eight children, Roba grew up in the farming
village of Bokeji and ran the six miles to and from school for one
reason: ``I didn't want to be late,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At 12, she moved to Addis Ababa, but her parents disapproved of
her running. ``They thought I should be doing women things,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, Roba was chosen to run for the national prison
police team. Today, she is a paid major in the military, but her
only job is to train. Her parents understand. `` `Now that we see
what the results are, now we're wrong,' they say,'' Roba said,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Her competitors know, too. ``She's especially tough in Boston,''
said Elena Meyer of South Africa, who finished second to Roba in
1997. Last year, China's Sun Yingjie began with a blistering pace,
leading at the halfway mark, but Roba caught her and then passed
Kenya's Catherine Ndereba in the Newton Hills to finish in 2:23:25.
</P>
<P>
   In the final six miles, thousands from New England's Ethiopian
community lined the course, waving their green, yellow and red
flags. One threw out a headband for Roba, who wore it to the finish
line. ``It gave me energy,'' Roba said.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling is reciprocal. ``I think she is an example for a lot
of women who are discouraged by the culture because it does not
reward you,'' said Misrak Assefa, co-owner of the Addis Red Sea
Ethiopian restaurant in Boston, who left Ethiopia 23 years ago.
Every year she hosts a party for Ethiopian runners after the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``For women, she seems like a very special person, she's very
determined,'' Assefa said. ``If she wins four, we don't need
anything else. Someone else can start winning.'' &QL;

 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas McManus, equity strategist at Bank of America Securities,
spent a lot of time on the phone over the weekend talking to
clients and some time thumbing through two books from his library:
``The Great Crash, 1929'' by John Kenneth Galbraith and
``Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds,''
Charles Mackay's 19th-century classic about investment mania.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for an analogous time,'' McManus said Sunday from
his home. ``The behavior of individual investors at this juncture
is a very important thing to consider, and all we have is anecdotal
reports and our own conversations with clients.''
</P>
<P>
   McManus and other strategists are trying to divine what owners
of technology stocks are likely to do Monday, after a weekend of
brooding about the market's decline. But because their behavior is
so hard to forecast, those in the predicting business are sticking
with the outlooks they held before the market plunged on Thursday
and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The technology rout sent the Nasdaq down 25.3 percent last week,
its worst weekly decline. But many technology stocks have plunged
much farther. Qualcomm, which makes wireless communications
products, has fallen 33 percent the last two and a half weeks.
Palm, which makes hand-held personal digital assistants, was down
to $31.625 on Friday, off almost 67 percent from its March high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some investors have seen a major portion of their investments
vaporize,'' McManus said. ``What does this cause them to do?''
</P>
<P>
   He expects that the low prices of old-economy stocks _ the
established industrial and consumer products companies _ will draw
investors' attention and help offset further declines in technology
stocks. And he will advise clients to raise the weighting of stocks
in their portfolios to 80 percent from 75 percent. But, he
acknowledges, big losses in technology might force some to sell
other stocks to cover or offset losses.
</P>
<P>
   Now is not the time to panic, said Jeffrey M. Applegate, chief
U.S. strategist at Lehman Brothers and a longtime stock market
bull.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not gearing up for Armageddon,'' he said, noting that
Lehman would not depart from routine Monday morning, beginning with
a 7:45 meeting on the market's outlook. At 8:45, the firm's
risk-management committee plans to hold its regular meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Applegate said he did alter his routine on Friday by
sending a note to clients as the Nasdaq was heading to a 9.7
percent decline and the Dow Jones industrial average was losing 5.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them this is not the end of the bull market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Byron R. Wien, U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, spent the weekend deciding what he would say at Morgan
Stanley's Monday morning strategy session. ``Some of us were
looking for this for a long time,'' he said, alluding to his
longstanding view that the stock market was just too overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to say that the market is much less overvalued than
it was, but that I think that technology has further to go and that
the overall market has farther to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the market's performance Monday, Wien said, would be
whether last week's drastic plunge had finally ``broken the
psychology that every dip is a buying opportunity.'' The sharp
declines of the last several years did not accomplish that, he
acknowledged, since they were followed by significant recoveries.
``But this looks more like the kind of move that could break that
psychology.'' If it does, it will take away a cushion for stocks,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Merrill Lynch, David Bowers, chief investment strategist, and
Richard McCabe, chief market strategist, will join the regular
morning meeting of analysts, according to James Wiggins, a
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins added that Merrill would urge its brokers to ``remind
their clients that the best investment approach is to take a
long-term view and to keep their long-term objectives in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been in periods of volatility before,'' he said, ``and
this is the approach we take.''
</P>
<P>
   Abby Joseph Cohen, chief market strategist at Goldman, Sachs,
said on Friday that she was sticking to her modestly bullish
outlook. ``As we look at our expectations for earnings, economic
growth and so on, nothing has changed during the past two weeks,''
she said in an interview on CNBC. Cohen's always careful comments
will be scrutinized because some investors think that she helped
sour the mood in the market.
</P>
<P>
   On March 28, she said she had cut the share of stocks in
Goldman's model portfolio to 65 percent from 70 percent. At the
same time, she said that technology stocks were ``no longer
undervalued.''
</P>
<P>
   In the CNBC interview, Cohen said, ``We are very comfortable
with the mainline technology companies with fabulous product
development, revenue and earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Her comfort, apparently, does not include the dot-coms, which
had led the market higher and are now threatening to pull it even
lower.

</P>
<P>
   That unexplained commemorative sculpture next to the Beach
Chalet at San Francisco's Ocean Beach finally got its due Friday
with the unveiling of a plaque identifying it as a tribute to
 &UR; Roald Amundsen &LR; . In 1903, the Norwegian explorer completed his
navigation of the Northwest Passage in a converted herring boat,
ending the trip at Point Bonita, just outside the Golden Gate.
</P>
<P>
   Amundsen's boat remained in Golden Gate Park until 1972, when it
was returned to Norway, along with its identifying label. The
remaining sculpture of the explorer puzzled tourists and park
users, including one who told jogger  &UR; Morris Kadish &LR;  that he
thought it was the image of ``that guy who floated on a raft to
Peru.''
</P>
<P>
   Kadish and his wife,  &UR; Ruth &LR; , enlisted the Art Commission and the
Norwegian Consulate in a campaign for the new plaque, which
features an explanation and map _ drawn by  &UR; Dugald Stermer &LR;  _ of
Amundsen's voyage.

   - Petaluma stonemason  &UR; Edwin Hamilton &LR;  used 800-year-old stones

the Strybing Botanical Library's patio garden. Pieces of the
monastery, bought in Spain and brought to San Francisco in the

wall were in a pile behind the Japanese Tea Garden.

FEAR OF PROSECUTION HINDERS CRASH INQUIRIES, SOME SAY
</HEADLINE>
  By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fear of prosecution or civil liability is stopping
people in transportation industries from cooperating with crash
investigators and making them hesitate to collect data that could
aid safety efforts, senior accident investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   As prosecutors are becoming increasingly likely to get involved
with accident investigations and press charges against people for
violating laws and regulations, safety officials are worried that
the trend may hamper their search for the facts after plane crashes
and other accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen a slow but steady and growing presence of the law
enforcement authorities in our investigations,'' James Hall,
chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said in an
interview. He said the threat of prosecution was creating difficult
questions.
</P>
<P>
   To sort through the issues of balancing law enforcement and
safety investigations, the board, which investigates accidents and
makes recommendations but does not have enforcement powers, is
organizing a symposium for April 24-25.
</P>
<P>
   In March, after the safety board finished its investigation of
the 1997 cargo plane crash near Miami International Airport that
killed five people, two companies involved, Fine Air Services Inc.
and Aeromar Airlines, pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice.
Fine Air acknowledged that its supervisors had ordered subordinates
to doctor cargo manifests after the crash, and Aeromar acknowledged
that it had erased the tape from a warehouse surveillance camera
and destroyed forms, both of which would have shown what was loaded
on the doomed plane.
</P>
<P>
   Safety board officials said they were glad to see companies
prosecuted for falsifying information. Hall said the threat of
prosecution was a deterrent to those who might flout safety rules.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators were dismayed that in their investigation of a
rupture of a gasoline pipeline in Bellingham, Wash., in June,
officials of the pipeline company, apparently anticipating
indictments, refused to let safety board investigators meet with
company personnel. The fire in that accident killed a man and two
boys.
</P>
<P>
   And in the investigation of the crash of Alaska Airlines Flight
261 off Los Angeles in January, maintenance personnel have arrived
for interviews with lawyers in tow.
</P>
<P>
   Hall emphasizes before each hearing of the safety board that his
agency tries to find cause, not fault. People in the aviation
industry have long contended that the openness needed to gather
information and find out why a plane crashed will disappear if
those concerned think they could be prosecuted or sued for what
they say.
</P>
<P>
   But others say the threat of punishment is essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're seeking to obtain compliance with health and safety
and environmental regulations,'' said Steven P. Solow, chief of the
environmental crimes section of the Justice Department, ``the
government needs to have a range of possible responses to
violations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a continuum of responses,'' said Solow, who is scheduled
to speak at the symposium. ``That includes education, compliance
assistance, administrative and civil enforcement, and it includes
criminal enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Solow helped obtain a guilty plea from American Airlines in
December in a case that grew out of a spill at Miami International
Airport. American pleaded guilty to mishandling hazardous
materials, a felony, and as part of the plea bargain, Solow said,
American agreed to accept recommendations that the safety board
made after a 1988 accident, a cargo hold fire aboard an American
Airlines DC-9.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board's mandate may be to find the cause of an
accident and make recommendations so it does not happen again,
Solow said, but he added that ``if what happened is that people
were making conscious decisions to violate the law, that is part of
the cause.'' And the remedy is prosecution, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem does not only arise after airplane crashes. Trucking
companies, for example, may be avoiding installing monitoring
equipment on their vehicles that would help identify unsafe
conditions, like drivers who work too many hours or drive too fast,
Hall said, because doing so could provide prosecutors or plaintiffs
with damaging evidence later.

 &HT;    MOSTLY PEACEFUL PROTEST FAILS TO SHUT DOWN WORLD FINANCE
MEETINGS
 &HT;    By BOB DART and ALEC SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defiant hordes of dancing and chanting protesters
blockaded part of the nation's capital Sunday but failed in their
quest to shut down meetings of the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were scattered instances of angry demonstrators
being dispersed by police clubbings, pepper spray and smoke
grenades, the long day of constant confrontation was mostly
peaceable and often festive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ain't no power like the power of the people 'cause the power
of the people don't stop,'' young protesters sang to an audience of
police in riot gear.
</P>
<P>
   Police reported only about 20 arrests _ far fewer than the more
than 600 taken into custody late Saturday for parading without a
permit.
</P>
<P>
   However, police may face a greater challenge Monday morning when
protestors are scheduled to stage more mass demonstrations as tens
of thousands of federal and other workers return to work in
downtown Washington.
</P>
<P>
   District of Columbia Police Chief Charles Ramsey said that
Molotov cocktails were found in the back pack of one protester who
was arrested Sunday. He also said his officers had dispersed
demonstrators earlier in the day when ``they tried to remove
barrels of gasoline from a construction site'' downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, there were sporadic clashes. One one point,
police on motorcycles drove into a small crowd of protesters who
were blocking part of an intersection. At mid-afternoon, police on
horseback trotted into a crowd that had disrupted traffic and
quickly dispersed the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, some of these same activists _ who range from
environmentalists to anarchists _ clashed with police and smashed
windows at international trade meetings in Seattle. But their mood
was more mellow on this sunny Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've tried to do ... was try to prevent a replication of
what happened out in Seattle,'' said Mayor Anthony Williams on CBS'
Face The Nation. ``I think the vast majority of these demonstrators
want to demonstrate peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Police cordoned off a 50-block section of downtown _ including
the White House, the World Bank and IMF Headquarters _ so the
protesters were unable to achieve their goal of sealing off every
street leading to the financial meetings. With the help of decoy
buses and early arrivals, the world's finance ministers bypassed
the human chains of demonstrators. Authorities did not elaborate on
how the ministers were transported.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meetings are going on, and staff are performing the usual
tasks,'' said IMF spokesman Graham Newman.
</P>
<P>
   But the protesters also claimed victory in focusing national
attention on what they claim are oppressive policies of the
international financial organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Bank and IMF are hiding under the guise of helping
countries while their projects really have an atrocious impact on
both poor people and the environment.'' said Shefali Sharma, a
student from New York. ``More people will know that now.''
</P>
<P>
   Police estimated that there were 10,000 protesters, but they
were spread over a wide area of the city. There were dozens of
marches on the streets and separate protests at every corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every intersection has its own flavor, `` said Patrick
Reinsborough, a spokesman for Mobilization for Global Justice, the
umbrella group for the protestors. ``Unlike most Washington marches
where everyone follows a few leaders, this is a bottom-up movement
with a bunch of creative people using arts and culture to get their
messages out on the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the corner of 19th St. and Pennsylvania Ave., near the IMF
and World Bank headquarters and only a few blocks from the White
House, protesters were chained to a huge pink pig labeled ``Greedy,
the World Bank.'' A block away, a trio of women wearing red evening
gowns and matching goggles sang from a communist manifesto. Masked
members of the Revolutionary Anti-Capitalist Bloc, another protest
group, guarded another street. They said they were dressed in black
because ``that's the color of anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere the protesters danced to the beat of drums fashioned
from plastic trash cans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody In. Nobody Out. That's what the line is all about,''
they chanted, referring to their goal of preventing the IMF and
World Bank representatives from entering or leaving their meetings.
With their arms linked inside of plastic pipes, they blocked the
streets with human chains called ``sleeping dragons.'' Webs of
colored strings were stretched between sign posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's Streets? Our Streets,'' they shouted joyously.
</P>
<P>
   The contrasts in clothing on the street corners were stark.
Police were outfitted in riot gear _ helmets, gas masks, protective
black gloves extending up their forearms, shin guards, plastic
handcuffs attached to belts, billy clubs in hand.
</P>
<P>
   To protect against tear gas, many protesters covered their
mouths and noses with bandanas soaked in vinegar, giving them an
image of pungent outlaws. However, as sunshine replaced the early
morning drizzle, the demonstrators shed their goggles, hoods,
jackets and other makeshift protective gear and paraded in tube
tops and T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after his forces had arrested about 600 protesters
and shut down their training center, Chief Ramsey chatted with
demonstrators and diffused tension in a couple of situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very, very organized,'' he said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   With the protesters promising to return on Monday, Ramsey urged
commuters to stay away from downtown, which had been left largely
to the demonstrations on a Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping for bigger numbers tomorrow,'' said Kevin
Danaher, a protest organizer.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators are united in their belief that the World Bank
and IMF are destroying the environment and burdening impoverished
countries with crushing debt payments.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the protesters came in all ages, shapes and causes.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Engnoth (CQ) and his 14-year-old daughter, Emily, were
dressed as turtles.
</P>
<P>
   The world trade organizations are destroying the breeding
grounds for turtles, said Engnoth, from nearby Springfield, Va.
</P>
<P>
   And a young California woman who said her name was Monkey Dog
said she was wearing a butterfly costume because ``I want to spread
a little bit of beauty and positive energy.''

ZIMBABWE PRESIDENT BACKS SQUATTERS IN LAND DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Overruling his own deputy,
President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe announced Sunday that his
government would not ask black squatters to leave hundreds of
white-owned farms despite escalating political violence this
weekend that left three people dead.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's statement came just three days after Vice President
Joseph Msika announced that the squatters should abandon the farms.
The country's high court had ordered the police last week to evict
the squatters if they would not go peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   But Mugabe, who returned to Zimbabwe on Sunday morning from a
weeklong meeting of third world leaders in Havana, vowed to defy
the court order and distanced himself from Msika. Mugabe described
the farm invasions as ``a problem,'' but said that only his
government could correct it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a problem that can be corrected by the courts,''
said Mugabe, as he addressed cheering supporters in Zimbabwe's
capital, Harare, in remarks that were broadcast on local radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a problem that must be corrected by the government and
the people of Zimbabwe,'' Mugabe said. ``We will correct it, and
correct it in the interest of the people of Zimbabwe.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's comments and Saturday's killings of a white
farmer, the beating of several others who came to his defense, and
the killings of two opposition party members dashed the hopes of
many people in Zimbabwe that tensions would ease after Msika's
announcement last week.
</P>
<P>
   The white farmer, David Stevens, was abducted from his farm in
the Virginia farming area and shot to death, said Tim Henwood, the
president of the Commercial Farmers Union, which represents the
4,000 white farmers who own more than half of Zimbabwe's fertile
land.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition party members, Tihaona Chiminya and Talent
Mabika, were killed as they drove away from a party meeting in the
town of Buhera. The assailants, riding in a truck, hurled a
gasoline bomb into their car, said Nomore Sibanda, a spokesman for
the opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens was the first white farmer to be killed since the
squatters started invading white farms in February.
</P>
<P>
   But three other people died in political violence last month,
including a black police officer, who was killed on a farm that
squatters had invaded, and two other black opposition party
members, who died after clashes with government supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week, we thought peace and justice was starting to take
hold in this country,'' Sibanda said in a telephone interview from
Harare, referring to the court ruling and the vice president's
decision to urge the farm invaders to go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are now wondering which way Zimbabwe will go. The
president is encouraging all of this anarchy. He seems to be
condoning violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposition party supports land reform but contends that it
should be accomplished by a means other than land invasions.
</P>
<P>
   The escalating violence comes as Zimbabwe prepares this week to
mark the 20th anniversary of its independence from the white-led
government of what was then known as Rhodesia.
</P>
<P>
   And the government's about-face on the farm invasion issue seems
to suggest that this year's Independence Day will be marred by
continued divisions within the governing party.
</P>
<P>
   Some party members have already voiced concern about the land
invasions and the international outcry that followed. And in
February, some members even suggested that Mugabe announce plans to
retire at the end of his term, in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe dismissed that suggestion, which came after voters handed
him his first major defeat, rejecting a draft constitution that
would have expanded his powers and allowed the government to take
white-owned land without compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Mugabe revived the land issue in an effort, political
analysts say, to win rural votes in the upcoming elections for
Parliament, which are scheduled for May. In recent weeks, Mugabe
has blamed whites for the slow pace of land redistribution, even
though his own government is partly responsible for the slowdown in
the program.
</P>
<P>
   He has vigorously supported the squatters, who have invaded more
than 1,000 white-owned farms, appealing an order last month by a
lower court requiring their eviction. And he persuaded Parliament
to pass a constitutional amendment that for the first time would
allow the government to seize land without compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Msika mentioned that constitutional amendment, which was passed
earlier this month, in his statement last Thursday when he told the
squatters that their presence on white farms was no longer
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   He also mentioned the upcoming talks with the British,
Zimbabwe's former colonial rulers, who say they are willing to
finance land reform if Zimbabwe promises that land will not end up
in the hands of government officials, as it has in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Msika had also sent a team of three government ministers to
address the squatters to make sure the new message was clear.
</P>
<P>
   George Charamba, a spokesman for Mugabe, said Sunday that those
ministers were still talking to the farm invaders. But he said the
high court, which ordered the police to evict the squatters last
Thursday, had no right to meddle in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   He said Mugabe had decided that the squatters should stay put
until he can actually sign the constitutional change into law
sometime in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until that has happened there's no point in asking the war
veterans to leave,'' said Charamba in a telephone interview from
Harare, referring to the squatters, who are led by veterans of
Zimbabwe's guerrilla struggle for independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no demonstration which lasts forever,'' Charamba said.
``At some point, the war veterans will leave. What we are differing
on is the method. What the president rejects is the option of
having to send arms of force against the war veterans. That option
is out.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ People who always insist that where there's smoke
there's fire probably haven't spent much time at the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever artificially generated clouds of gray start drifting
moodily across a stage, abrading the eyes and throats of the
audience while bringing to mind spook houses at school carnivals,
it's usually an indication that the flame of imagination is burning
low. This doesn't mean that your instinct to bolt for the nearest
exit isn't a good one.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of smoke in the new revival of ``Jesus Christ
Superstar'' that opened Sunday night (Palm Sunday, if you please)
at the Ford Center for the Performing Arts, even though Jerusalem
was never, to my knowledge, famous for its fogs.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless there it is, that catchall symbol for the mystical
and the ominous that seeps across the proscenium, causing
theatergoers to wave their programs before their faces and think
that there must be something sinister afoot.
</P>
<P>
   There will be other sensory assaults in the show, staged by the
Australian director Gale Edwards in the wake of her successful
touring production in Britain, from the giant crucifix, made of
hundreds of high-wattage light bulbs, that glares right into your
eyes to the oversize video image of a battered, bloody Jesus just
before his death.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the aggressive but uncertain amplification of the
orchestra, which sometimes suggests that someone is fiddling idly
with a volume knob. What there isn't, through the whole of this
30th-anniversary staging of the epochal rock opera by Tim Rice and
Andrew Lloyd Webber, is a single original idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus Christ Superstar,'' which began as a concept record
album in 1970 before its varied reincarnations on stage and film,
has never been easy to translate into visual terms.
</P>
<P>
   The 1971 Broadway version, directed by the iconoclastic Tom
O'Horgan (fresh from his success with ``Hair''), was notorious for
its extravagant, whimsical and largely irrelevant-seeming
stagecraft, the total effect of which the critic Clive Barnes,
writing in The New York Times, compared to ``the Christmas
decorations of a chic Fifth Avenue store.'' And does anyone still
talk about the Norman Jewison film version?
</P>
<P>
   Edwards has chosen a fairly straightforward approach, clearly
aimed at young audiences and awash in emblems of youth-courting
topicality.
</P>
<P>
   The action starts with 12 disciples, many of them in camouflage
fatigues, painting graffiti across the columns of Peter J.
Davison's set, which brings to mind the underpass of an urban
bridge. The temple from which Jesus drives the money-changers has
LCD displays quoting stock figures. And the Roman centurions, of
course, evoke storm troopers.
</P>
<P>
   These are images that most adolescents are familiar with from
MTV, where they are deployed with far more sophistication, giving
the unfortunate impression that live theater is no match for film
or television. The choreography by Anthony Van Laast brings to a
mind a group of maverick high school students hopping around
subversively at their prom.
</P>
<P>
   The singing is performed by a mostly young cast with the ardor
of kids in a karaoke bar, though lyrics are not always
distinguishable. The acting is big on grimaces, with the blond,
spiky-haired Judas (Tony Vincent, who took over the part less than
two weeks ago) looking like a pretty-boy rocker in anguished search
of a band, and Jesus (Glenn Carter), registering as pale, passive
and petulant, giving a sort of Jewish-princess air to the
character.
</P>
<P>
   The cast members invest so much energy in their performances
that you wish you could return it. This is doubly the case since
``Jesus Christ Superstar'' is the freshest and most audacious of
the Rice-Lloyd Webber creations. (I confess that I grew up
listening to it and can still recite most of the lyrics.)
</P>
<P>
   The idea of looking at Jesus as a celebrity icon, who wore his
fame ambivalently, was inspired and prescient. So was making Judas,
the opera's narrator, a figure forced to play a fatal role that he
didn't really want to take on.
</P>
<P>
   There is a remarkable melodic verve in the Lloyd Webber score,
without total sacrifice of a pure rock edge. And Rice's lyrics are
irresistibly loose and impudent. (From the Last Supper scene:
``Always hoped that I'd be an apostle/Knew that I could make it if
I tried/Then when we retire we can write the gospels/So they'll
still talk about us when we've died.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Superstar'' works better as a chain of virtuosic songs than as
a sustained piece of theater. It doesn't fully follow through on
most of its themes, and the disjunctiveness is much more evident in
performance. This is not a problem that Edwards resolves, and when
she recreates the torture and crucifixion of Jesus in the familiar,
iconic ways (despite the intrusions of news cameras), it feels
unearned.

<P>
   Moments of electricity that are not of the stage-lighting
variety are few. But Paul Kandel, who plays King Herod as a cross
between a Las Vegas comedian and the master of ceremonies of
``Cabaret,'' at least has some bite. Kevin Gray brings a vicious
authority to Pontius Pilate. And Maya Days is a lovely Mary
Magdalene, sweet-voiced and earthy.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who was brought over from the London cast, is not
terrible, but he seems to disappear before your eyes in even the
early scenes. On the other hand, it has never been easy portraying
Jesus, and it is hard to remember any actor (other than Willem
Dafoe) who became famous playing the role. For whatever reasons,
one of the ultimately charismatic figures of Western civilization,
so memorably evoked in music and painting, tends to elude
representation in the flesh.

 &HT;    Clock ticks for procrastinating tax filers
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Last-minute filers can run into all kinds of
calamities.
</P>
<P>
   But most of them boil down to two problems: Running out of time
or running out of money.
</P>
<P>
   There are alternatives. They may not be attractive, but they
will get the harried taxpayer through the night.
</P>
<P>
   NOT ENOUGH TIME
</P>
<P>
   Some taxpayers discover they don't have all the paperwork they
need. Others find out just how much time it takes to fill out the
forms.
</P>
<P>
   For the basic Form 1040, the IRS estimates the average taxpayer
will need 2 hours and 39 minutes to learn what to do and another 6
hours and 22 minutes to fill out the form.
</P>
<P>
   If you just can't finish, you can get an automatic four-month
extension, until Aug. 15, by filing Form 4868 before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   You won't be alone. The IRS expects 8 million taxpayers to ask
for an extension.
</P>
<P>
   You can get a copy of the form at the IRS Web site, www.irs.gov.
Click on ``Forms and Pubs,'' then click on Search for a Form or
Publication.
</P>
<P>
   But note that the extension covers only the paperwork, not the
tax bill itself. You can estimate how much you will owe and send in
a check with the Form 4868. But you will have to pay interest, and
maybe a late-payment penalty, on any amount you still owe after
April 17.
</P>
<P>
   NOT ENOUGH MONEY
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the average balance due was about $3,000. If you
can't raise that much cash, you have three alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   1. An installment plan. The IRS generally accepts installment
payments, assuming you owe less than $25,000 and submit a plan to
pay your bill in less than five years.
</P>
<P>
   You request an installment plan by filling out Form 9465 and
attaching it to the front of your tax return. You can download a
copy from the IRS Web site.
</P>
<P>
   You will have to pay interest and a late-payment penalty on the
unpaid balance.
</P>
<P>
   If you are already making payments under an installment plan,
you won't be eligible for a second installment plan.
</P>
<P>
   2. Charging it. To pay your taxes with a credit card, call
1-888-272-9829 and follow the directions. You can use American
Express, Discover or MasterCard, but not Visa.
</P>
<P>
   You will have to pay a fee to the company that processes the
payments. The fee varies with the amount you owe. It is $25, for
example, for a charge of $600 to $999.
</P>
<P>
   3. Leaving it to the IRS. Some taxpayers can put off the payment
by asking the IRS to figure how much tax they owe.
</P>
<P>
   The details are in Publication 967, available at the IRS Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS will send you a bill. If you pay it within 30 days, you
avoid interest and late-payment penalties.

ETHIOPIAN HUNGER: ANOTHER DISASTER AHEAD?

<TEXT>
<P>
   GODE, Ethiopia _ The truly hungry are still the exception, but
that makes little difference here. On Sunday morning, a 2-year-old
boy named Abdi Muhammad Farah died. An old woman covered a hole in
the hut with a dirty pair of pants so the other children could not
peek in as they washed his body. He was very thin, so there was not
much to wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be off!'' another woman shouted at the children. They
scattered, but only for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   Abdi is the fourth child of Muhammad Farah _ who has 10
children, by two wives _ to have died in the last three months here
in the hot southeastern corner of Ethiopia, where once again
chronic poverty and the worst drought to hit the Horn of Africa in
nearly two decades have combined to create hunger, and war has
hampered its solution. Ethiopia's leaders argue that lives might
have been saved if the outside world had been quicker to help.
</P>
<P>
   But no one is calling it a famine yet. And what has already
happened here, everyone hopes, will be as bad as it gets, though
there are no guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days the world's rich nations have pledged what
experts say should be enough food to stave off a far greater
disaster: At least 8 million people in Ethiopia face a shortage of
food _ the same number affected in the famine of the mid-1980s that
killed thousands. Another 6 to 8 million in neighboring countries _
Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan, Djibouti, Kenya and Uganda _ also face
hunger.
</P>
<P>
   But much could still go wrong: The next rains may be inadequate.
Relief food may not arrive on time. The war between Ethiopia and
Eritrea may ignite again. So relief officials are urging a
worldwide effort to keep Ethiopia well stocked with food, rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a big problem,'' said Catherine Bertini, head of
the World Food Program and a U.N. envoy to the Horn of Africa. ``We
want to make sure it is not a big problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does need to be done very quickly,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Famine announces itself long before fully arriving, in small
pockets that foretell greater disaster and, when local governments
and the rest of the world are engaged, with enough time to prevent
it. The area around Gode, 750 miles southeast of Addis Ababa, the
capital, is where the messengers of widespread hunger made their
first call.
</P>
<P>
   It has not rained here in three years, but the problems reached
the point of crisis only recently. According to local authorities,
more than 200 people have died of malnutrition in the last three
months around this town, which is dusty and scattered with the
carcasses of hundreds of cows and sheep. Another 500 have died from
conditions related to hunger, such as pneumonia, diarrhea or
measles. Almost all the dead are children, the first to fall sick
without food.
</P>
<P>
   Abdi Ali is 1 year old, so thin and weak that he can barely push
out a cry; what happened to him and his family tells the story of
many people here. Like most others in the Ogaden region of
Ethiopia, his family are nomads of Somali origin who depend on
cows, goats and camels for food and milk.
</P>
<P>
   Abdi's mother, Hani, a 30-year-old mother of six, said their
family's 200 goats and 60 cattle began to die late last year for
lack of water and grazing land. When the last died, in January, the
family walked to the town of Denan, about 50 kilometers north of
here.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are 6,000 refugees here, and another 15,000 in Gode.
Abdi was fine when they arrived, his mother said, but since then he
has slowly withered for lack of food. His top front teeth are just
coming in, but otherwise he is not growing but shrinking inside his
ever-baggier skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we had cattle, he was drinking milk,'' she said. ``Now we
have no cattle, and he has no milk.''
</P>
<P>
   While children have been the hardest hit, adults are suffering
too. Four days earlier, Mariama Mose, 35, stopped speaking, and on
Saturday she lay staring up at the top of their hut in Denan. One
of her nine children, a 1-year-old boy, Wali Abdi, died last month.
Her husband, Abdi Sheik Hussein, said she had not eaten for many
days and he did not know if she would live. ``Only Allah knows,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the huts, there were the mounds of at least 250 graves,
some small ones for children; most were covered with thorn bushes
to keep away the hyenas and foxes, who were as hungry as the
people.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   There has been much contention between Ethiopia and other
nations about whether its government has done enough to help the
starving people. Most of the focus has been on the money spent on
Ethiopia's two-year war with its neighbor, Eritrea, which experts
say cost roughly $1 million a day. Because of the war, Ethiopia has
refused an offer to use the port of Assab in Eritrea, which U.N.
officials say would speed the delivery of relief food.
</P>
<P>
   But here the government did deliver food, most of it wheat, in
January, February and early March, said Muhammad Ugas, the area
manager for a local charity group, the Ogaden Welfare Society,
which has headed the relief effort here. But it was not enough, he
said, and there were no international groups to help.
</P>
<P>
   By late February, the crisis had intensified, and the Ogaden
Welfare Society, along with Save the Children, an international
charity group, opened the first feeding center in Gode for the
worst cases of malnutrition. By Sunday, 280 children had been
treated; 28 of them, or 10 percent, died. The last one was Abdi
Muhammad Farah, who was buried Sunday afternoon in a grave next to
his sister's.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Ethiopia has been criticized, its leaders have harshly
condemned the outside world for not reacting fast enough,
particularly after an assessment in December showed that 7.8
million people were facing food shortages. The United States
responded with large donations of food in January, but Ethiopian
officials criticized the European Union for not making a definite
pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Harbo, the European Union's delegate in Ethiopia, strongly
denied that it had delayed, saying that it had begun to buy food
inside Ethiopia in February but backed off after the government
said there was little food to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the European Union did commit last week to 430,000
tons of food by the end of the year _ just as Bertini began her
visit to the region and the world's news media beamed out images of
the people around Gode who had begun to starve.
</P>
<P>
   Bertini and many other Western officials say they believe that
the outside world did react promptly _ at least before the severe
food shortages moved into actual famine not only here but in the
highlands in northern Ethiopia, which are also suffering from
drought. ``It's not because there has been a slow response,'' she
said. ``It is because there are more people to feed.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of her trip, Ethiopia's prime minister, Meles Zenawi,
who had strongly criticized the West, said he too was satisfied.
``Now all the indications are that the food aid which will avert
disaster may be forthcoming,'' he said in a news conference last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Just as famine follows a more or less predictable cycle, so does
the institutional strategy for overcoming it. Bertini's trip was
meant to spur the outside world to action. Coming as it did when
people here began to die, her appeal seems to have brought results:
Aid groups are coming slowly but in greater numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, any comparison to the 1984 famine is premature. Dr. J.W.
Lee, the medical representative on Bertini's trip, noted that most
of the deaths in the Gode region were not from hunger specifically.
Although the people need food, he said, many are in greater need of
medicine, clean water and vaccinations. ``The situation is
precarious, but it's not catastrophic,'' Lee said. ``A lot of
people are talking about this from television images and sound
bites, not data.''
</P>
<P>
   The fear, though, is that it could get worse. The major worry,
officials say, is that there will not be enough rain this summer.
Moreover, the food pledged so far will feed Ethiopia only through
June, World Food Program officials say.
</P>
<P>
   With a lag of two to five months between a nation's pledge of
food and the actual delivery _ over terrible roads and through
inadequate ports _ the concern is how to keep what aid officials
call the ``food pipeline'' full.
</P>
<P>
   ``The promise is adequate,'' said Ugas, of the Ogaden Welfare
Society. ``It depends on how quick and urgently it reaches here.''

COLLEGE STUDENT LEARNS FREE-SPEECH LESSON DURING MASS ARREST 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM WEINER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As he sees it, Mike Saltz spent Saturday night in
jail for exercising his natural-born rights of free speech and
peaceable assembly.
</P>
<P>
   A man who appears both sweet-tempered and thoughtful, Saltz, 22,
a student at the University of Oregon in Eugene, was swept up in a
mass arrest of roughly 600 people near the International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   He was trying to find some friends at a rally, he said, when he
was corralled, arrested, cuffed wrist to ankle and charged with
parading without a permit, an infraction legally less serious than
a misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really shocked,'' he said. ``When it comes to
disagreeing with the dominant view, your rights are really out the
window. They can do whatever they want _ they're the police.''
</P>
<P>
   It was his first arrest. He spent Saturday night and Sunday
morning in a holding cell in the bowels of the District of Columbia
Superior Court before he paid a $50 fine and was freed.
</P>
<P>
   He had had no water to drink, he said, and only a doughnut to
eat. But he had plenty of time to ponder his part in the weekend
street protests in Washington, in the diffuse movement for
``economic justice'' _ if it is a movement _ and the police
reaction to it.
</P>
<P>
   Saltz was raised in Yorba Linda, Calif., not far from Richard
Nixon's family home. His family is a pure product of the ``American
Dream,'' he said. But he began getting ideas about politics in
grade school that were a little outside the mainstream in southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started getting interested in activism in the third grade,''
he said. Sprawling developments cutting into mountain lions'
habitat first fired his imagination. He became interested in the
Sierra Club and the radical ecology group Earth First! He started a
political magazine as a high school freshman. His work drew
anonymous death threats, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1994, before I went to college, there was the Zapatista
uprising'' in southern Mexico. The small but politically savvy
rural guerrilla movement, linked to the outside world by e-mail,
demanded land rights for Mexican peasants and protested the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   This set Saltz studying, as he put it, ``how globalization
creates a movement like the Zapatistas, a globalized activism.''
</P>
<P>
   When he went off to the University of Oregon, his thinking
connected with what he calls ``this strange coalition'' that drew
thousands of protesters like him to Seattle in November and to
Washington during the weekend. It is a collection of advocates for
the ecology and self-declared anarchists, traditional leftists and
mainstream labor unions and dozens more groups deeply skeptical of
the forces of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a park bench Sunday in the middle of downtown
Washington, two blocks from the White House and four blocks from
the World Bank, he reflected on his experience in Seattle, where he
was not arrested, and on the crowd in Washington, and said, ``I'm
beginning to call this a movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could break apart as easily as it came together,'' he said,
``but it feels like it's coming together. In Seattle it was just
forming. Now there seems to be a coherent, cohesive idea _ economic
justice. The World Trade Organization was something to latch onto.
It represents what we reject: an economy that is becoming less and
less democratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governments are repressing movements for economic democracy
like the Zapatistas. In this country, the government is cutting
social spending. We're doing away with welfare, doing away with job
security. There's more and more temporary work, jobs that don't
provide a living wage. The economy's creating more billionaires but
there's a huge, growing gap between the rich and poor.''
</P>
<P>
   And he continued: ``My dad was asking me the other night, `This
is the greatest economy in the history of America _ why is this
happening?'''
</P>
<P>
   Answering that question _ coming up with an alternative to
``global capitalism,'' based on a model of ``economic justice'' _
would require ideas that would not fit onto a bumper sticker or a
banner, Saltz conceded with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the movement is at the point of proposing a
model,'' he said. ``Maybe it's fair trade. Maybe it's getting
people to think about what they buy, whether whatever they're
buying is made in sweatshops or under exploitative conditions.
Maybe it's getting people to see they have the power to change
things.''
</P>
<P>
   For himself, in the future, it may be a career as a labor
organizer, or working abroad in poor villages, maybe in Mexico, he
said. For Sunday, it was enough to get out of jail and back into
the streets and their continuing political carnival tinged with
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still trying to figure out for myself what the answer
is,'' he said.

 &HT;    Last call for tax filers
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At last count, 50 million Americans had yet to file
their income tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight they'll have to get serious. The deadline for filing
federal and Georgia tax returns is midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Post offices will stay open until then to accommodate
last-minute filers.
</P>
<P>
   Free help in filling out the forms is available this year, as
the Internal Revenue Service continues its struggle to become a
partner with taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   IRS employees will be stationed at Kroger stores to help with
the paperwork. A spokesman warned that last-minute crowding would
limit how much the volunteers can do for any individual.
</P>
<P>
   As of April 8, IRS employees had helped 47,638 Georgians prepare
their returns.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, a total of 127.5 million returns are expected. About
half of them will be filled in by certified public accountants and
other paid professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Do-it-yourselfers can file online, using low-cost software.
Three of the most popular sites are www.hrblock.com,
www.turbotax.com or www.macintax.com.
</P>
<P>
   Deferring tax returns until the last minute is an American
tradition, only partly because of procrastination. ``Some people
are put off by the perceived complexity of the tax law,'' said Al
Brooke, a former Georgia director of the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Others delay because they owe more taxes. ``The returns that
taxpayers are going to attach a check to _ they tend to come in
later,'' Brooke said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Last week, with Syrian peace talks in a deep stall,
Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel cleared his desk of Damascus,
unfroze construction on the Golan Heights and swiveled his focus to
the impending deadlines on the Palestinian peace track.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, he began a new week with declarations intended to
prepare Israelis for potential concessions to the Palestinians and
to alert the Palestinians to his increased concentration on their
peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Barak indicated that he would be offering a few sweeteners to
break the ice with the Palestinians, who have felt insulted and
neglected by Barak's nearly exclusive focus on Syria. He said he
might tender them immediate gains _ recognition of a Palestinian
state and a ``down payment'' on a future transfer of land _ if the
two sides reached a ``framework'' final peace agreement by the end
of May.
</P>
<P>
   He also pledged publicly, for the first time, that Israel would
not seek to annex the Arab villages near Jerusalem. The right wing
has tried to portray Israeli withdrawal from those towns as a
concession that would endanger Jerusalem itself. On Sunday, Barak,
clarifying a position that he had left artfully unclear, told his
Cabinet that those villages were not important to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always prayed toward Jerusalem and have never directed
any prayer toward el Azariyya and Abu Dis,'' Barak said Sunday,
mentioning two of the Palestinian villages. ``The annexation of
those 50,000 to 70,000 Palestinians serves neither the security nor
any other national interest of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leaders did not respond directly to Barak's
gestures. But they dismissed them generally as ``trial balloons''
and pointed out what they were not hearing: a readiness to withdraw
from all of the West Bank, to dismantle Israeli settlements, to
acknowledge the right of return of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinian state is a Palestinian right that already has
international support,'' said Nabil Abu Rudeineh, an adviser to
Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian Authority's president. ``What we
demand of the Israelis is to be committed to the deadlines.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak did not specify whether the Jerusalem area towns would be
turned over to the Palestinians as a ``down payment'' with the May
framework agreement. At any rate, the next land transfer _ which
could entail from 10 percent to 12 percent of the West Bank _ is
supposed to take place in June.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Barak emphasized on Sunday that he intended to
transfer territory in a way that would allow the Palestinians to
have a continuous land mass, and not disconnected islands of
sovereignty. That would require abandoning some Jewish settlements,
although Barak did not say this explicitly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is portraying these feelings to the other side, the
Palestinians, saying he's willing to pay a price,'' said Yossi
Beilin, the justice minister. ``The question is whether this price
is big enough.''
</P>
<P>
   By revealing what he would be willing to give, Barak is seeking
to nudge the Palestinians out of a stalemate on the core issues
that divide the two sides and to improve the chances that the May
deadline _ unlike past deadlines _ will be met. The final
comprehensive deal is supposed to be concluded by September.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel and the Palestinian Authority, some politicians are
saying the final deal cannot be completed and are advising their
leaders to resolve some issues, put aside the thorny question of
Jerusalem's future status and settle on another long-term interim
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we can bridge the gap on all the issues but
Jerusalem,'' said Haim Ramon, the Israeli minister who oversees the
Jerusalem issue. ``It would be very clever of both sides to agree
not to agree and delay this issue for the future, maybe five or 10
years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Others disagree strongly. ``That would be the biggest mistake on
earth,'' Beilin said. ``What is needed is for both sides to touch
the fire, to say, `This is the compromise, this is the peace.' For
that, we need but two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is to travel to Washington this week to meet with
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has just returned. The Americans are deeply and directly
involved in the substance of the negotiations for the first time
since Barak took office in July, an indication that he has given up
his original ambition to forgo direct U.S. involvement. U.S.
mediators are preparing proposals to bridge the gaps between the
two sides, Barak told the Cabinet on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It cannot be said that Barak lingers in the doldrums when his
plans fall through. Last week, his ambitious hopes of making peace
with Syria were essentially _ but not explicitly _ pronounced dead,
and along with them the grand blueprint for a new Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``While everyone is recovering from the shock and grieving over
the deceased, the prime minister has already gotten up from the
mourning period, moved on from page one to page two, activated the
switch in his brain, changed channels, and zapped to the
Palestinians,'' Chemi Shalev wrote in his column in the newspaper
Maariv. ``The same way he totally immersed himself in the Syrian
issue, he will now immerse himself in the Palestinian issue. Barak
is a person with a single goal, and the present project is Yasser
Arafat.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While the stillbirth of the Syrian peace deal seems to open the
way to progress on the Palestinian track, it is not so simple. Some
think that it will complicate dealings with the Palestinians,
speculating that Arafat will not want to make concessions after
President Hafez Assad of Syria stood firm.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian experience certainly affects the road ahead with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Critics here say Barak at once overestimated and underestimated
Assad, gambling that he was so hungry for a deal that he would
suddenly turn malleable. In retrospect, the critics say that Barak
may have mishandled the negotiations in Shepherdstown, W.Va., in
January, embarrassing the Syrians into a harder line.
</P>
<P>
   Arab-world critics also saw a failure by Barak _ a failure of
nerve and a political weakness that held him back from making the
key concession that would allow the momentous peace deal of his
aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   If he were a stronger leader, they said, he would have found a
way to compromise on the sliver of territory _ along the northern
rim of the Sea of Galilee _ that lies between continued conflict
and peace.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and many others here portray it differently. He is not a
magician, his advisers say. He went with Syria as far as he could,
taking a variety of creative concessions to the table. Even the
Americans believe that the ball was left in Syria's court, they
say.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, said Gadi Baltiansky, Barak's spokesman, even an
impasse is ``a historic accomplishment.'' Previous negotiations
with Syria were interrupted _ first by the assassination of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and then by a wave of terrorism under his
successor, Shimon Peres. This time, Baltiansky said, Israel will
have learned how far Assad is willing to go.

 &HT;    Talk cheap to Claridge, who just wants to play
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Upon listening to Travis Claridge, the first
inclination is to worry that he might be an oddball similar to
another famed Southern Cal football player.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Marinovich, the former Trojans quarterback, was talented
but aimless, at least when he got to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Claridge, the Falcons' first selection in the draft Saturday,
likewise seems to be polished at giving ambiguous, meandering, even
disinterested answers.
</P>
<P>
   But the more Claridge talks, which apparently is never much, the
more obvious it is that he speaks with a unique conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood grows that he's not a man lacking answers as much
as he happens to have a very simple agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to play,'' he said Sunday, when the Falcons
trotted out the 6-foot-5, 305-pound offensive lineman for his first
news conference. ``I just like playing football. Football has
always been a real constant thing in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his strengths, his weaknesses and so on, Claridge
said, ``I don't know'' at least half a dozen times after the
Falcons picked him in the second round, 37th overall.
</P>
<P>
   But one look at him, with his broad shoulders, high cheekbones
and buzz haircut, and Claridge looks every bit like a football
player from years past, before image meant so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never sat on the bench before in my life,'' he said,
explaining that the three hours of sleep he got on the red-eye
flight Saturday night from Los Angeles was the most he got in two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nerves. Everything you have worked for your whole life.
Everything you ever dreamed of playing was professional football.
It was judgment day.''
</P>
<P>
   Falcons coach Dan Reeves fell in love with the simplicity and
mean streak in Claridge. The fact he's a two-time, first-team
Pac-10 selection is a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Travis is impressive to me because it is important to him,''
said Reeves, who will give Claridge an opportunity to compete with
Ephraim Salaam for the starting job at right tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not all about money. It is about loving to play the
game. It excites me to listen to Travis talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Claridge's ability to move from right guard to right tackle as a
senior and then be named the most outstanding offensive lineman in
the Pac-10 was icing on the cake.
</P>
<P>
   Toughness?
</P>
<P>
   He was a starter at USC less than two weeks after arriving on
campus. He has required two shoulder surgeries and an ankle
surgery, but played through the injuries and had the operations
after seasons ended.
</P>
<P>
   He did something no Trojans offensive lineman _ not Anthony
Munoz or Tony Boselli _ has ever done. He started every game of his
USC career, beginning as a true freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first game, in the Kickoff Classic against Penn State,''
he said, ``the center had to tell me what to do every play because
I just got there.''
</P>
<P>
   So how did he end up a starter?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was better,'' he said. ``I came into camp in shape, and I
wanted to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Claridge has a reputation for strength, bench-pressing 225
pounds 29 times.
</P>
<P>
   He's definitely candid. He wrote a couple of diaries for
FoxSports.com. On-line last week, he ripped the concept of mock
drafts.
</P>
<P>
   Check out this entry: ``What really upsets me are the `in-depth'
evaluations that are on these (Web) sites. I can run a 4.86-second
40-yard dash, vertical jump 35.5 inches and out-lift a bunch of
guys, and the next week I'm reading that, `Travis Claridge lacks
athleticism.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding me?''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, he said, ``Hardly any of those mock drafts came true,
did they?''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, he wrote for Fox- Sports.com again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promised I wouldn't watch the draft. I didn't lie. I refused
to sit there and listen to a bunch of guys who think they are
experts, but who really don't know anything ... because they never
played the game. Instead, a few of my friends and I ... played
video games, mostly NCAA 2000. Don't worry, I never played with
USC.''
</P>
<P>
   Claridge began his journey to this point long ago, living in
Michigan, where his father was a high school football coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played Pop Warner football,'' he said. ``I only played one
year because I couldn't make the weight limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Next came a divorce, then a move to California, and then a move
to Vancouver, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   His nickname of ``Trapper'' came from an eighth-grade coach who
lauded him for sacking quarterbacks while playing defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Claridge is engaged to be married, and his brother, Ryan, is a
linebacker at UNLV.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Claridge is a pro football player who is still working to
earn a college degree. He took a 4:10 p.m. flight back to Los
Angeles Sunday to finish work on a history major with a geography
minor.
</P>
<P>
   He's not worried that his answers are bland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say,'' he said. ``I'm 22 years old and
I've just been thrown into professional football. It's like, OK,
what do I do now? The strangest thing is that I'm sitting here
talking to you. I just want to play.''

ANGRY SUPPORTERS FORM A SECURITY BLANKET FOR CUBAN BOY 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK BRAGG    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The true believers say they cannot sleep while evil
waits just outside the strobe lights to steal their miracle child
away. So, in the hours between midnight and dawn, they sip rich,
black Cuban coffee to stay alert, and occasionally scream
``Elian!'' and ``Libertad!'' just to remind the United States
government that it better not try to break into the house in Little
Havana and take Elian Gonzalez on their watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get paid to be here,'' said Orlando Maldonado, 42,
who was born here but has lived his life immersed in hatred for
Fidel Castro's government.
</P>
<P>
   It is 3 a.m. Palm Sunday, and he is still angry _ at the
Attorney General Janet Reno, at the president of the United States,
at the reporters who ask why he is here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone here sees Elian as their son, their grandson, their
nephew,'' he said, referring to a crowd of 200 to 300.
</P>
<P>
   At 4 a.m., only a few demonstrators have gone away. Lazaro
Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle, stands in the yard, an ever-present
Marlboro smoldering between his fingers. People in the crowd shout
to him and praise him, and he responds in Spanish, reassuring them
that the boy is still inside, safe.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators are often told the child is sleeping, but that
does not stop people from chanting, singing or screaming his name
between midnight and dawn.
</P>
<P>
   A few will hold candles, but the effect is lost in the
television lights.
</P>
<P>
   People watch the sky for helicopters. Some think that, when the
time comes, federal officials or perhaps even the Marines will drop
from the sky. Almost everyone is convinced that it will happen at
dawn, or just before. It is, people here say knowingly, how Fidel
would do it, and the United States officials are just puppets of
Fidel.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez, a body-and-fender car mechanic who was not
particularly political before this confrontation, has flatly
refused to hand over the boy, creating a bunker here, not of
concrete but of human bodies and resolve. The federal government
has revoked his legal custody of a child, but people here laugh at
that. Together, they keep watch around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   The daytime crowd of demonstrators, which ranges between 50 and
a few hundred, depending on the rain, heat and rumors of the day,
is partly protest and partly party, with the aroma of grilling pork
and the tinkling music from ice cream trucks mixing in the air with
cries of ``Janet Reno es comunista.''
</P>
<P>
   The late night is often filled with younger people on their way
back from South Beach or the clubs on Calle Ocho, one more stop on
their lists of things to do. They may or may not die for Elian, but
they are dressed to kill.
</P>
<P>
   But in the predawn, when the comfortable demonstrators have
slipped away, the hatred for Fidel Castro almost glows on Northwest
Second Street.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that the people there are the ones who suffered in
political prisons or lost their businesses or relatives when they
went into exile _ the revolution was 40 long years ago, and many of
those Cuban-Americans are in old age or have died. The older
demonstrators tend to go home early, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   These are their sons and daughters, and the new arrivals who
have a fresh reason to hate Castro, people like Miguel Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, 23, kept watch in the night. He came to the United States
from Cuba two years ago, not on a raft but as a winner in a visa
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were like slaves in the fields,'' said Lopez, who worked
the sugar cane fields. ``I made good grades in school, but I
couldn't go to college because I missed one day of work in the
fields.''
</P>
<P>
   He was sentenced to a life of manual labor and knew that he
could not say a word about it, because his life would only worsen _
maybe he would even be sent to prison. ``We had to choose every
word carefully,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nobody,'' he said. ``I was worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   In the predawn, it is almost as if the emotion has been boiled
down to its most dense concentration.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, once a haven from persecution, is now an
enemy, pure and simple, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban Americans are, at 3 a.m., Cuban.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born here because of Fidel Castro,'' said Alberto
Gonzalez, 27, a college student. His parents came to the United
States in 1962, just three years after Castro seized power.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are bodies on the bottom of the ocean floor,'' he said,
passionately. ``There is a history of death. And no one seems to
care.''
</P>
<P>
   Vivian Trigo, 41, is a social worker in Miami. She was born
here, but Sunday morning that does not matter at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Cuba you cannot be what you want to be and do what you want
to do,'' Trigo said. ``I know it like I lived there. This child may
be on a raft again in a few years and we'll be in the same boat.
This is a freedom issue, not a custody issue. Every American should
be down here defending Cubans if they believe in their country.''
</P>
<P>
   No one really answers the question: what would they do if they
were Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez. A few said they would
rather have their child live free in the United States than live in
Communist Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube off the coast of Fort
Lauderdale on Nov. 25. His mother and 10 others died when their
boat capsized crossing the straits from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   This is a city with monuments to Cuban rafters, none as famous
as this one, Elian. Storefronts on Calle Ocho (Eighth Street) in
Little Havana and on Coral Way, a scenic main connecting road
between downtown and the nearby city of Coral Gables, have murals
of Elian on his inner tube, tossed by the waves.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few blocks from the house where people keep their vigil,
Milagros Cruz, blind since she was 10 years old, holds a tiny
protest of her own in a tent just off Flagler Street. Cruz, 32,
came here from Cuba in October, believing that she would send for
her daughter after she got here.
</P>
<P>
   But the Castro government has refused to let her daughter join
her, she said. She is tired and faint, from a hunger strike since
March 21, and wonders why all the attention is focused on Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz used to play her guitar and speak out against the Castro
government, and was put in prison and insane asylums in Cuba, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the state police would pick the change up from her cup
that people had tossed down, shake it in her face so she could hear
it jingle, then walk away.
</P>
<P>
   The Castro government told her she could leave earlier this
year, she said, but when she sent for her daughter she was told no.
</P>
<P>
   Though she dreams that someone, anyone, would come to her aid
the way thousands have come to Elian's, ``I'm not angry about the
attention he's getting,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She would be with them, if she did not have her own quiet little
fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``His father is an unscrupulous man,'' she said of Juan Miguel
Gonzalez. ``I can't understand how a man can sell his child, and
that's what he's doing with Fidel. They're letting communism win.''

 &HT;    PIVOTAL WEEK IN ELIAN CASE HAS PAINFUL ANNIVERSARIES
 &HT;    EDS: After 5th graf, adds father's comments from ``60 Minutes''
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ What could be a pivotal week in the long-running Elian
Gonzalez saga will also be a week of painful anniversaries for the
main players in the drama, with both sides hoping they won't add a
new unpleasant date to their calendars.
</P>
<P>
   With the stalemate on hold awaiting a key court ruling, Cuban
exiles will pause Monday to recall the failed U.S.-backed invasion
of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs, a disaster that took place on April 17,
1961, leaving 200 invaders dead and 1,200 captured.
</P>
<P>
   The exiles have already been reminding Attorney General Janet
Reno of the April 19, 1993 tragedy at Waco, Texas, when Reno
ordered FBI agents to storm the compound of the Branch Davidian
religious cult. A horrible fire ensued, killing about 75 Davidians
</P>
<P>
   The two black days in U.S. history have come together in the
Elian saga in a strange nexus, at least for the exiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans don't know about the history and the reality of
Cuba,'' said Eliseo Rodriguez(cq), a former Cuban political
prisoner who has joined the protests outside Elian's Little Havana
home. ``They don't understand what a big mistake the government is
making. But I fear what will happen if they try to force things.
There will be trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   On CBS' ``60 Minutes'' program Sunday, Elian's father accused
said the boy's Miami relatives of ``child abuse'' for turning his
son against him. Juan Miguel Gonzales was especially angered by a
videotape of Elian, released last week by the relatives, in which
the child tells his father he wants to remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is child abuse and mistreatment what they're doing to
this boy,'' the father said, adding that Elian ``hasn't had time to
mourn for and feel for the death of his mother'' who perished at
sea last November as they were trying to escape to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what message should be conveyed to his son, the father
said: ``Give him a big kiss and tell him not to worry. He'll be
with me soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno has made it clear she wants to avoid any confrontation over
the boy, and even flew to Miami last week to try to broker a
compromise by negotiating personally with the Florida family.
</P>
<P>
   But her bid failed, and both sides are now awaiting a ruling by
the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, which could set
the stage for a resolution to the stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, the court issued a temporary ban on Elian's
removal from the United States. The court is expected to rule early
this week on whether the ban should stay in force until a May 11
hearing stemming from the Miami family's lawsuit in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have asked the court to order the family to
turn Elian over to his father, even if the court rules that the boy
should remain in the United States pending the outcome of the May
11 hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, who has been living in the home of a top Cuban
diplomat in the Washington, D.C. area since April 6, has promised
in court documents to remain in the United States until after the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the Atlanta court grants the government's request,
the Miami relatives insist they will never take Elian out of their
Little Havana home, although they won't resist if federal officers
come for him.
</P>
<P>
   That sets up a potentially violent confrontation with vehement
Cuban exile protesters who have maintained a vigil near the home
for months, and vow to form a human chain to protect Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when Reno's first deadline for handing over the boy
approached, thousands of protesters packed the streets surrounding
the house, creating a nightmare scenario for any extraction effort.
The deadline fell moot after the Atlanta court issued its temporary
ban on Elian's removal from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for a compromise remain dim, as key players for both sides
held to their positions in Sunday television interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to try to do this in a peaceful manner,'' White House
Chief of Staff John Podesta told CNN. ``But ultimately the rule of
law must prevail and the administration is prepared to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials have reportedly been preparing a
plan to take the boy from the house should the family continue
refusing to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   But the family shows no signs of backing down.

<P>
   Despite Reno's insistence that Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro
Gonzalez, is now violating the law by withholding the boy, the
family believes it is within its rights, said Spencer Eig, one of
their attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lazaro Gonzalez will comply with the law,'' Eig said. ``He
will stand aside and cry and his heart will break if they come for
Elian. But he is a legal resident of this country and he can't be
ordered to do their dirty work.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the bad blood between the branches of the family
continues to simmer.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami family has outraged Elian's father by accusing him of
abusing Elian and the boy's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Elian's father say the Miami family has made it
difficult for Gonzalez to talk to his son by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Miami relatives allowed a Miami Herald reporter
into their home while Elian spoke with his father in a call. They
boy spent 20 minutes talking with his father, and then blew kisses
into the telephone as he hung up, the Herald reported.
</P>
<P>
   The father attended church services in Washington on Sunday and,
speaking in Spanish through an interpreter, thanked parishioners
for their support.

   LOCKNEY, Texas _ For three years, people in this tiny farming
town fretted that stopping the local drug problem was like trying
to lasso the winds that blow day and night off the flat Texas
plains. Teachers complained of students getting stoned at lunch.
Parents worried that their children were getting high without their
knowing it.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, after an emotional public meeting and demands that
something be done, the school board here enacted what is considered
to be the toughest school drug testing policy in the nation. It
requires that all junior and senior high school students take a
mandatory drug test. There is no choice; refusal by a parent or
student draws the same punishment as failure to pass the test, an
in-school suspension for first offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as many other school districts across the country institute
drug tests, Lockney, with only 2,200 residents, has become an
unlikely constitutional battleground. A parent, aided by the
American Civil Liberties Union, filed a lawsuit in March asserting
that the policy violated his and his son's Fourth Amendment rights
against unreasonable searches. Arguments in the case could be heard
as soon as this summer by a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cannot tell me how I'm supposed to believe,'' said the
parent, Larry Tannahill, 35, whose 12-year-old son, Brady, attends
the junior high. ``I believe in the Constitution. And because I
believe in our Constitution and our rights, you're going to punish
my son? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, when the U.S. Supreme Court opened the door to drug
testing in schools by permitting the testing of athletes, the
unanswered question has been where would schools, and ultimately
the court, draw the line. Until now, school districts had been
tentative in pushing the boundaries, particularly because legal
challenges to wider testing are pending in Oklahoma, New Jersey and
other states. But Lockney's policy of testing every student has
shattered any boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the policy has no teeth, there's no use having it,'' said
Donald G. Henslee, the lawyer representing the Lockney Independent
School District. Henslee said that at least a dozen other Texas
districts had inquired about instituting a similar policy.
</P>
<P>
   For Tannahill, the controversy has made clear the tensions that
can arise when an individual challenges the will of the majority,
particularly in a small town. He and his wife, Traci, are the only
parents who are fighting the policy. He was dismissed from his job
as a farm worker, though his former employer says the firing was
unrelated to the lawsuit, and he has found a threatening note
outside his home. Some people have invited the Tannahills to leave
town.
</P>
<P>
   Up and down the fraying, red-bricked Main Street, people say
they do not wish Tannahill any harm, but they cannot believe that
one person should stop them from doing what they believe is in the
best interests of their children. To many parents, the drug test is
a ``tool'' to provide students a reason to resist peer pressure to
drink or do drugs. The debate over constitutional rights seems
secondary to many people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like it's violating my rights for my kid to be
tested,'' said Kelly Prayor, 35, who has two children and is a
teller at the local bank. ``As far as my kids' rights, they're not
responsible. What rights do they have? They don't have a right to
drink or do drugs.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   About halfway between Lubbock and Amarillo, Lockney is situated
in the agricultural sea of the Texas south plains, which stretch to
the horizon, interrupted only by telephone poles and windmills and,
occasionally, a tree. The local schools are the biggest employer,
and the red logo of the high school is painted on the two water
towers and displayed in the rear windshields of many of the trucks
rumbling through town.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   People in Lockney do not believe that drugs are any worse here
than in other small towns, but the issue has generated attention
for several years. In 1997, nearly 300 people attended a public
meeting to discuss drugs. A year later, investigators arrested 12
people for selling cocaine, an event that stunned the town.
</P>
<P>
   By then, school officials were studying drug testing policies,
including those in several surrounding towns. Most of the policies
involved testing students so that they could participate in
extracurricular activities. One nearby town with such a policy,
Tulia, is continuing the testing even as it is under challenge in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   But Lockney officials were intrigued by another town, Sundown,
which instituted a mandatory testing policy for all students in
1998 that has yet to be challenged. In December, the Lockney school
board approved its own mandatory policy and notified parents that
testing would begin in February. Under the plan, all junior and
senior high students would take a urine test and submit to random
follow-up urine tests. Employees of the district also undergo the
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Today, all 388 students in junior and senior high schools in
Lockney have taken the test except Brady. School officials would
not say how many tested positive, other than to describe the number
as a ``Texas handful.'' The in-school suspensions given to
first-time offenders last three days and require students to
complete their class work in a separate room. They also undergo
drug counseling and are suspended from all school activities for
three weeks. Repeat offenders face longer suspensions, though not
expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Underwood, general counsel for the National School Boards
Association in Washington, called the Lockney policy ``about as
broad as it could ever be,'' saying it was the result of the
``slippery slope'' created by the Supreme Court's ruling that
allowed testing of athletes. Since then, Underwood said, the court
has resisted clarifying the limits for testing and instead has sent
mixed signals.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998, the court let stand a lower court ruling
enabling an Indiana school district to require a drug test for
students participating in after-school activities. But last March,
the court dealt a blow to another Indiana school by leaving intact
a lower court ruling that prohibited the school from requiring
suspended students to take a drug test before resuming classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``School districts don't know exactly how far they can take
this,'' Underwood said. ``There hasn't been a definitive ruling by
the Supreme Court on mandatory testing or random drug testing by
school districts.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric E. Sterling, president of the Criminal Justice Policy
Foundation, a nonprofit group in Washington specializing in
criminal justice issues, predicted that more districts would
emulate Lockney as more parents felt helpless to prevent their
children from using drugs. Sterling said the policy could be a
deterrent for some students but cautioned that it could further
alienate students at risk of taking drugs. He said the
``presumption of guilt'' created by the policy flies in the face of
the pledge of allegiance that students recite every morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their sense of liberty and what liberty means will be offended
every time they're asked to provide a urine specimen without any
cause that they're using drugs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A lanky, laconic man, Tannahill says he is hardly a rebel, but
he fears that his neighbors are too willing to give up their
rights. His family has lived in Lockney for four generations, and
he calls the town ``a good little community.'' Yet he was incensed
that under the school testing policy his refusal to sign a parental
consent form meant that Brady was considered guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of letting our rights just be taken away,'' said
Tannahill, whose younger son, Coby, 11, attends the town's
elementary school. ``They are taking my rights away as a parent,
telling me I had to do this or my son would be punished. That's
what really got to me.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tannahill, who graduated from Lockney High, added, ``The teacher
taught me that if you give up your rights, and you're not going to
fight for them, you'll lose them.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Henslee, the school district's lawyer, said the board was
reconsidering its stance on parents who refuse to give consent. He
said the board remained committed to mandatory testing but was
considering alternatives to the punishment stipulated by the
Tannahill case. Brady has been allowed to continue his normal
classes and activities, pending the result of the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Tannahill, meanwhile, is struggling with life as a pariah. He
said he had gotten friendly phone calls or quiet nods from some
people, but few people support him publicly. His wife works as a
records clerk at a nearby prison. Unemployed, he builds miniature
barns and windmills at home that he hopes to sell on the Internet.
He said his sons had been treated well at school, as if nothing had
happened, but he remained wary.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, the family's pet boxer, Ranger, was sprayed
with orange paint from a paint gun. Tannahill said he found a note
outside his house that read, ``You're messing with our children,
and next time maybe this won't be a paint gun.''
</P>
<P>
   At a school board meeting in March, Tannahill and his lawyer
unsuccessfully asked the board to change its policy. Hundreds of
people packed into the Lockney Independent School District's high
school gymnasium for the meeting, many of them wearing T-shirts
that read: ``We asked for it. LISD delivered it. We appreciate
it.'' Speaker after speaker extolled the policy to loud applause
until Tannahill's lawyer was greeted with stony silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If looks could kill, me and my family would have been dead a
long time ago,'' Tannahill said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Graham Boyd, the civil liberties union's drug policy project
lawyer, who is representing Tannahill, asserted that the policy had
a host of failings, including that a urine test does not detect all
drugs. But beyond the legal questions, Boyd said he was surprised
by the tensions that had arisen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about race or religion or one of the things you
would expect to inflame a community,'' he said. ``This is about
drug testing a 12-year-old boy.''
</P>
<P>
   People in Lockney say Tannahill is not in any danger, though a
few concede that they would not mind if he left. Again and again,
residents described the drug policy as a common-sense solution to
help children resist drugs. A few people expressed doubts about the
policy, but an overwhelming majority of parents and students agreed
with Jordan Lambert, 18, a senior and the quarterback of the
football team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great,'' Jordan said. ``I don't see how we're
being forced to when we're more than willing. Ninety-eight percent
of the student body is more than willing. Nobody is being forced
to.''

 &HT;    Talk cheap to Claridge, who just wants to play
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Upon listening to Travis Claridge, the first
inclination is to worry that he might be an oddball similar to
another famed Southern Cal football player.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Marinovich, the former Trojans quarterback, was talented
but aimless, at least when he got to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Claridge, the Falcons' first selection in the draft Saturday,
likewise seems to be polished at giving ambiguous, meandering, even
disinterested answers.
</P>
<P>
   But the more Claridge talks, which apparently is never much, the
more obvious it is that he speaks with a unique conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood grows that he's not a man lacking answers as much
as he happens to have a very simple agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to play,'' he said Sunday, when the Falcons
trotted out the 6-foot-5, 305-pound offensive lineman for his first
news conference. ``I just like playing football. Football has
always been a real constant thing in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his strengths, his weaknesses and so on, Claridge
said, ``I don't know'' at least half a dozen times after the
Falcons picked him in the second round, 37th overall.
</P>
<P>
   But one look at him, with his broad shoulders, high cheekbones
and buzz haircut, and Claridge looks every bit like a football
player from years past, before image meant so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never sat on the bench before in my life,'' he said,
explaining that the three hours of sleep he got on the red-eye
flight Saturday night from Los Angeles was the most he got in two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nerves. Everything you have worked for your whole life.
Everything you ever dreamed of playing was professional football.
It was judgment day.''
</P>
<P>
   Falcons coach Dan Reeves fell in love with the simplicity and
mean streak in Claridge. The fact he's a two-time, first-team
Pac-10 selection is a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Travis is impressive to me because it is important to him,''
said Reeves, who will give Claridge an opportunity to compete with
Ephraim Salaam for the starting job at right tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not all about money. It is about loving to play the
game. It excites me to listen to Travis talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Claridge's ability to move from right guard to right tackle as a
senior and then be named the most outstanding offensive lineman in
the Pac-10 was icing on the cake.
</P>
<P>
   Toughness?
</P>
<P>
   He was a starter at USC less than two weeks after arriving on
campus. He has required two shoulder surgeries and an ankle
surgery, but played through the injuries and had the operations
after seasons ended.
</P>
<P>
   He did something no Trojans offensive lineman _ not Anthony
Munoz or Tony Boselli _ has ever done. He started every game of his
USC career, beginning as a true freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first game, in the Kickoff Classic against Penn State,''
he said, ``the center had to tell me what to do every play because
I just got there.''
</P>
<P>
   So how did he end up a starter?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was better,'' he said. ``I came into camp in shape, and I
wanted to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Claridge has a reputation for strength, bench-pressing 225
pounds 29 times.
</P>
<P>
   He's definitely candid. He wrote a couple of diaries for
FoxSports.com. On-line last week, he ripped the concept of mock
drafts.
</P>
<P>
   Check out this entry: ``What really upsets me are the `in-depth'
evaluations that are on these (Web) sites. I can run a 4.86-second
40-yard dash, vertical jump 35.5 inches and out-lift a bunch of
guys, and the next week I'm reading that, `Travis Claridge lacks
athleticism.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding me?''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, he said, ``Hardly any of those mock drafts came true,
did they?''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, he wrote for Fox- Sports.com again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promised I wouldn't watch the draft. I didn't lie. I refused
to sit there and listen to a bunch of guys who think they are
experts, but who really don't know anything ... because they never
played the game. Instead, a few of my friends and I ... played
video games, mostly NCAA 2000. Don't worry, I never played with
USC.''
</P>
<P>
   Claridge began his journey to this point long ago, living in
Michigan, where his father was a high school football coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played Pop Warner football,'' he said. ``I only played one
year because I couldn't make the weight limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Next came a divorce, then a move to California, and then a move
to Vancouver, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   His nickname of ``Trapper'' came from an eighth-grade coach who
lauded him for sacking quarterbacks while playing defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Claridge is engaged to be married, and his brother, Ryan, is a
linebacker at UNLV.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Claridge is a pro football player who is still working to
earn a college degree. He took a 4:10 p.m. flight back to Los
Angeles Sunday to finish work on a history major with a geography
minor.
</P>
<P>
   He's not worried that his answers are bland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say,'' he said. ``I'm 22 years old and
I've just been thrown into professional football. It's like, OK,
what do I do now? The strangest thing is that I'm sitting here
talking to you. I just want to play.''

THIS WEEK'S TV HIGHLIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
TODAY 
Work with us here - in their playoff history, the Kings are
!ital!unbeaten!off! at the Office Depot Center. And Stephan Fiset
is !ital!unscored!off! upon there. Great to see Ziggy not only back
but puttin' the rubber in the net and pumping up everyone else, but
it'll take more than that (how about no more sloppy D) if the Kings
want to stretch this past the weekend. NHL playoffs: Detroit at
Kings Game 3, Fox Sports Net, 7 p.m. (FSN has Game 4 and, if
necessary, Game 5 Wednesday and Friday; ABC has Game 6 Sunday). 
TUESDAY 
Imagine the look on Shaq's face when he pulls up to see his old pal
DRod and then finds out the freak's been evicted from Mark Cuban's
pad for weeks. NBA: Lakers at Dallas, Channel 9, 6:30 p.m.
(delayed). (KCAL also has the final regular-season game Wednesday
at San Antonio, 5 p.m.) 
WEDNESDAY 
In that Sports Illustrated story that goes out on an artificial
limb to pick the Clippers as ``The Worst Franchise in Sports
History,'' our favorite owner offers this sterling analogy: ``At
times I feel as if I were a scientist making progress toward the
cure of a disease, yet the lab mice keep dying of cancer.'' Well
put, Donald T. Kevorkian. That OT loss to Denver the other night
had us believing the Clips were playoff-hungry. But like Da Man
says, just when they start peaking ... bam, their season's over.
They'll have to wait all summer before they can add to that
double-digit losing streak. NBA: Clippers at Seattle, Fox Sports
Net 2, 7 p.m. 
THURSDAY 
The kids get one more chance to win. After that, we take our ball
and go outside. Arena Football: Avengers vs. Carolina, Fox Sports
Net 2, 7:30 p.m. 
FRIDAY 
Since the Stanley Cup champ will come out of the West, these Game
5s ought to hold some key info as to who'll be around for the
conference's finale in a couple of weeks. NHL playoffs: San Jose at
St. Louis Game 5, ESPN2, 4 p.m.; Phoenix at Colorado Game 5, if
necessary, ESPN2, 6:30 p.m. 
SATURDAY 
Nothing set yet, but the Lakers' playoff opener could be
pigeonholed here if the Kings and Red Wings need the downtown
clubhouse for a sixth game in their series. If not, then NBC will
move this one to Sunday. (Kinda like the Staples' playoff ticket
lottery - no one knows what the heck's goin' on). The Sonics,
meanwhile, have asked the league to have the series start never.
NBA playoffs: Series openers, Channel 4, 9:30 a.m., noon and 2:30
p.m.; TNT, 5:30 p.m. (Same times and channels for games Sunday). 
SUNDAY 
Imagine a double-play combo with Pee Wee Reese at short and Pokey
Reese at second. Better yet, the endorsement potential for ``Pee
Wee 'n' Pokey's Reeses Pieces.'' Dodgers at Cincinnati, Channel 5,
10:15 a.m. (KTLA also has Saturday's game from Cincinnati at 10:15
a.m.)

IN NEW ORLEANS, MOURNERS WEAR THEIR TRIBUTES ON T-SHORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., eliminated earlier, this story is now restored)

<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Most of the people who gathered for Donald Ray
Davis' funeral were dressed in their Sunday best. But younger
mourners, like Tara Lewis, 21, wore matching white T-shirts printed
with a picture on the front of Davis, 25, who died in a motorcycle
accident last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're young,'' Lewis said Sunday, ``and we're not used to all
that dressing up and stuff. Wearing the T-shirt helps us remember
him.''
</P>
<P>
   In this city where rituals surrounding the dead are often more
plentiful and more elaborate than anywhere else, the T-shirts,
sometimes called ``dead man shirts,'' have become commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   The shirts, which commemorate the lives of young murder victims
who often have died in gang-related killings, are especially
popular with younger blacks, and began to be seen here in the late
1980s. By 1994, when New Orleans had one of the highest murder
rates in the country, the shirts had become ubiquitous here and
have since become popular in other cities as well, like
Philadelphia and Detroit. Today, when the murder rate in New
Orleans has dropped substantially, by 55 percent since 1994, many
say the shirts are even more popular here.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first we would see the T-shirts only when young people were
killed,'' said the Rev. Norwood Thompson, pastor of the First Zion
Baptist Church in New Orleans. ``Now it has escalated into a kind
of tradition and you can see T-shirts when anyone dies, it's almost
like an obituary.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Rhodes, owner of Rhodes Funeral Home, said, ``The
T-shirts have become a part of African American culture in New
Orleans. Each step of the way, the time people take to prepare for
a funeral helps them let the person go. The T-shirt is now often
one of those steps.''
</P>
<P>
   The shirts are designed and made at shops like Video Images on
the east side of the city, where Ricky Lewis, 44, has been
producing the memorial shirts since 1989. Lewis also used to make
buttons and bandannas to match the shirts. But now, solely making
the shirts is keeping him in business.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis stores the template design for his shirts in his computer.
It includes space above and under the picture of the deceased for
song lyrics or other sayings, like ``Thuggin Eternally'' or ``The
Wrong Man Died.'' The name or nickname goes at the bottom of the
shirt along with a gravestone that says ``RIP'' and the words,
``sunrise'' and ``sunset,'' accompanied by the birth and death
dates.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Wiltz, a professor of sociology at Dillard University in New
Orleans said: ``The whole notion of the dead man T-shirt might have
gotten its impetus in rap music. Because there is a tendency in rap
to sanctify the deceased and make them almost bigger in death than
they were in life. The shirt is a way of expressing that in
something tangible.''
</P>
<P>
   The shirts are so popular they have figure in the lyrics of rap
artists in New Orleans. Master P, perhaps the city's most famous
rapper, mentioned the shirts in his song ``Is There a Heaven 4 a
Gangsta.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has hopped on the trend. Thelma Washington, 55, a
nursing assistant, said her family chose not to make T-shirts when
her cousin, who she said was a major drug dealer, died. ``I don't
approve of the shirts,'' she said, ``because of where they came
from. It started with gang members, I wouldn't want to accept
anything coming out of that world. I don't see the point of wearing
the T-shirts. It doesn't change anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis recently moved his T-shirt business into a new building.
On Friday morning, he and his son, Torrey, 21, were unpacking. As
they sifted through hundreds of shirts and buttons with faces and
dates and names of dead people on them, Lewis was remembering the
details behind his collection's morbid chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drive-by. Drive-by,'' he said, placing two buttons on a
display case. Holding up a third button with the picture of a
smiling toddler on it, he said, ``This was a three-year-old kid,
killed in a drive-by.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to the picture of another teen-ager on a memorial
T-shirt from a few years ago, Lewis said, ``He was real bad. He
killed a lot of people, and they finally got him.''
</P>
<P>
   One T-shirt showed a young man in his coffin with his mouth sewn
open to display his gold teeth. Another T-shirt of a dead teen-ager
showed him holding his AK-47 and smiling.
</P>
<P>
   But those were the most extreme examples. Just as common now are
T-shirts like the one commemorating the death of Davis, who was a
barge cleaner in New Orleans, and by all accounts had no gang ties.
</P>
<P>
   For Tara Lewis, wearing Davis' shirt this morning was nothing
new. She said she had 16 other dead men shirts at home,
memorializing friends and family. She always wears them to
funerals, she said, but also puts them on whenever she wants to
keep her memories of the person on the shirt alive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she said, ``It makes me sad, every time I wear one.''

 &HT;    Mulholland's win gives Braves warm feeling
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Once their hands thawed from the 19-degree wind
chill Sunday, the Braves could start scratching their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Which to be more pleased about _ leaving the frigid Midwest or
finally getting a quality game from No. 4 starter Terry Mulholland?
</P>
<P>
   The Braves headed home to the warmer climate of Atlanta after
Mulholland's best start since being traded from the Cubs last July
31. It followed his two worst, and it helped the Braves salvage a
2-1 victory and finish the road trip with a 2-4 record. ``It was
bigger for me to pick up a win for the team (than for myself),
being able to leave Milwaukee on a winning note,'' said Mulholland,
who allowed one run in eight innings after giving up 13 runs and
six home runs in 8 1/3 innings in his first two starts. ``You want
to keep things rolling in a positive direction. That was the
biggest thing for me, coming in and giving us a chance to win the
ballgame and go home happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The game turned into a shocker of a pitching duel with
Mulholland taking on his recently released former teammate Everett
Stull, the Fort Riley, Ga., native who was making his first
major-league start. The Braves scrambled to get just two unearned
runs off him.
</P>
<P>
   Javy Lopez got the clutch hit, lining a single past Mark Loretta
to score Andres Galarraga in the fourth inning. It was the
difference in the game. In a similar situation in Saturday's loss,
Lopez grounded into a double play to Loretta.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves made the 2-1 lead stand up for the next five innings,
with Mike Remlinger working the ninth to earn his third save.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was ugly, but we'll take it right now,'' said Chipper
Jones, who went 1-for-4 in his return to the lineup from a sore
elbow. ``Terry did a great job of not letting them get anything
going. We still stink offensively, but we'll get better.''
</P>
<P>
   After unsuccessful outings against the Giants and the Cubs,
Mulholland switched tactics against the Brewers, not going after
every hitter inside. How well did it work? If it weren't for a
bobble by Galarraga that cost him an inning-ending double play in
the third inning, Mulholland would have allowed no runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty drastic change,'' Mulholland said. ``(When I
came inside) it was more for effect, more as a reminder. ''
</P>
<P>
   Stull, meanwhile, allowed only three singles over six innings
but had to settle for the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a feeling he would match up well against the Braves, and
he did,'' Brewers manager Davey Lopes said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The steep drop last week in the price of technology stocks,
punctuating a three-week slide, may mark a turning point in
perceptions. Unless the technology shares rebound quickly, the
Internet industry will no longer be seen as a sure thing for
investors and entrepreneurs hoping to cash in quickly.
</P>
<P>
   A few bad days were one thing. But with the shares of many
leading technology companies now down by 40 percent or 50 percent
in less than a month, the sell-off is causing anxiety across the
New Economy _ even if many experts predict that Internet technology
will continue its inexorable expansion into virtually all parts of
the old economy.
</P>
<P>
   The anxious include students at the Harvard Business School.
Last year's graduates plunged with abandon into the Internet
revolution, especially those who helped found 35 start-up companies
including Guru.com, UBUBU.com and eFrenzy.com. This spring, the
Harvard business class of 2000 seemed to be heading for a similar
number of start-ups and perhaps a few more _ until last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students are scared to death,'' William A. Sahlman, a
professor at the business school, said last Friday. ``The free fall
in the stock market this week shook their confidence and caused
people to reassess their career plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Sahlman, co-chairman of Harvard's entrepreneurial studies
program, noted that three groups of worried students considering
start-ups had visited him in recent days, seeking his advice.
``Right now, I'd say we'll have half the number of start-ups out of
this year's class, compared with last year,'' he said. ``And that's
probably not a bad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The long-predicted winnowing of dot-com companies now seems at
hand, according to venture capitalists, industry executives and
economists. The term ``Internet'' in a business plan, they say,
will no longer assure funding for a start-up or a quick welcome in
the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a more sober investment environment, they add, is not likely
to slow the development or spread of Internet technology across the
economy. The Internet, they point out, is a low-cost communications
network that promises to curb inflation over the next decade, lift
productivity and enhance the efficiency of business throughout the
economy _ benefits, they say, that will be as valuable when the
stock market opens Monday morning as they were a week, a month or a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying trend, though, may provide scant comfort for
investors. Fundamental technologies in the past _ railroads,
electricity and automobiles _ have been marked by investment
euphoria, waves of start-ups, fierce competition and harrowing
industry shakeouts.
</P>
<P>
   An investment mania in Britain in the 1840s helped build that
nation's railway system, but it eventually left a trail of
corporate bankruptcies. From 1900 to 1925, there were more than
3,000 automobile start-ups in the United States turning out all
manner of cars _ from three-wheel models to ones steered by tillers
like those on ships.
</P>
<P>
   And today's technology investors have no assurance that the
worst is over. Technology share prices have dropped sharply
recently, but they are still far higher than other sectors. As of
Friday's close, the ratio of the stock price to expected earnings
for the 72 information technology companies in the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index was over 41. That was nearly twice the level
for the S&AMP;P 500 index as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe technology stocks are still overvalued by 25 percent or
50 percent or more; only the stock market can give us that
answer,'' said Richard Shaffer, principal of Technologic Partners,
a research firm. ``But that fundamental shift of business onto the
Internet in the last few years is a direction that is here to stay
for years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   On Silicon Valley's Sand Hill Road, the Wall Street of the
venture capital industry, there is no panic. But there is the view
among venture-capital veterans that another industry cycle may well
be beginning _ as occurred in 1983, after the shares of
personal-computer companies swooned, and in 1987, after the
stock-market collapse in October, when the money pouring into
venture funds slowed.
</P>
<P>
   Such a prospect means that fledgling Internet start-ups without
profits may no longer be welcomed on Wall Street only a year or two
after they were founded.
</P>
<P>
   So venture capitalists _ who supply early funding to start-up
companies in return for an ownership stake in them _ may be taking
a more back-to-basics approach in the future. Venture capitalists
may begin picking fewer companies to back and nurturing them longer
to maturity, before they try to sell shares to the public in
initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime venture capitalists say this more measured approach
would be a positive development, even if it would also mean waiting
longer to cash in. Instead of investing $20 million in a start-up
that goes public a year later, they might have to invest $100
million over three or four years in a new company before selling
its shares to the public. And they may have to be ready to pull the
plug on less promising start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the recent crop of dot-com companies will go under,
and others will be sent to the fat farm,'' Michael Moritz, a
partner in the venture-capital firm Sequoia Capital, said. ``But
it's a tonic _ however painful its administration may be for some _
that is pretty healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors in venture-capital funds _ each of which typically
backs many companies _ normally have their money tied up for five
years or more. The funds are open only to wealthy individuals and
institutional investors, not to Main Street stock pickers. The
perspective of venture investors is a world apart from that of day
traders. So it would take time before a lasting reversal on Wall
Street affected the way business is done in the private
venture-capital industry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, venture-capital funds in the United States raised $46.5
billion, up from $27.9 billion the year before. The surge in
venture money actually invested in companies was even more striking
_ to $48.3 billion last year from $19.2 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the rate of venture investment has accelerated
further. In the last 30 days, there were 670 new venture-capital
investments totaling $10.2 billion, or a rate of roughly $2 billion
a week, reports VentureWire.com, which tracks the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the technology-stock euphoria fades, venture capitalists
say they expect the flood of money into venture funds to ease off.
And if there is a lasting slowdown in Wall Street's enthusiasm for
high-technology share offerings, then there could be an end to the
stratospheric annual returns that some funds have racked up by
taking companies public quickly and reinvesting in still more
start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the average annual returns of leading
venture-capital funds have been in the 20-percent range, compared
with the 100 percent or more that some have enjoyed in the last
year or two.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Experienced venture capitalists have long recognized that a
return to earth in technology companies was inevitable. But as
investors who have benefited enormously from the run-up, they have
mixed feelings about the recent steep falloff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm torn,'' said John Shoch, a partner in Alloy Ventures.
``Sure, it's healthy to take the froth out of the market. But at
the same time, we have four or five companies that are lined up to
go public over the next few months.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Internet companies including Alta Vista, the Web
directory and search site, have already postponed their plans to
sell shares to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Still, turmoil in the stock market does not mean that
venture-capital funding will dry up. Even at the end of last week,
some companies went public.
</P>
<P>
   One of the start-ups that Shoch's firm funded, Nuance
Communications, went public last Thursday. Its offering price of
$17 a share nearly doubled on the first day of trading, closing at
just under $34 a share. On Friday, when technology stocks
plummeted, Nuance rose slightly to close at $34.3125 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Nuance, based in Menlo Park, Calif., has developed technology
for making voice-recognition software work more efficiently. It is
a promising technology, since new companies are trying to make
human voices and telephones _ not computer keyboards _ the main
means of access to the Internet. At the same time, old-economy
companies like banks and telephone companies hope to use the
technology to further automate their customer-service operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environment is going to get more challenging,'' Shoch
said. ``But real companies with real technology and real businesses
will get funded _ rest assured.''
</P>
<P>
   Such start-ups, venture capitalists say, will attract funds,
because investors are willing to bet that they are promising
companies making technological building blocks for the Internet
economy, and thus are poised for strong growth.
</P>
<P>
   The big shakeout among dot-com companies is expected to be among
the consumer Web sites and services that raced _ and spent heavily
_ to establish themselves as Internet brand names, especially over
the last year or so. In selected market niches, they have all tried
to be the ``next Amazon,'' and most, of course, will fail.
</P>
<P>
   The economic impact of the winnowing will likely be healthy. As
one venture capitalist noted: ``It will mean we have two or three
Web sites selling pet supplies instead of seven. That's hardly a
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   That Darwinian process is familiar to many. In the early 1980s,
for example, there was a surge of investment in companies in the PC
industry, which ended abruptly in the summer of 1983 when the
market in technology stocks collapsed. Companies with now-forgotten
names like Eagle Computer, Northstar Computer, Kaypro, Word Star,
Vector Graphics, Priam and Miniscribe fell by the wayside during
the shakeout that followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But out of each one of these cycles of investment frenzy and
turmoil, a handful of tremendous companies have emerged _
Microsoft, Dell, Sun Microsystems, Cisco, Oracle and others,''
Moritz of Sequoia Capital observed. ``And the same thing will
happen this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The focus of venture-capital investments in the Internet has
already shifted from businesses that sell things directly to
consumers to businesses that enable other businesses to work more
efficiently. The so-called business-to-business market has long
been regarded as the largest _ and most economically significant _
market for Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   As a low-cost communications network linking businesses
worldwide, the Internet is expected to reduce the cost of buying
materials, managing inventories and developing new products.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet's impact in overhauling this ``back office'' of the
global economy is uncertain and is just beginning. But most
economists believe it will make a notable impact over time, just as
electricity only made a big difference to industry when factories
were reorganized for mass production. A recent study by the Goldman
Sachs investment firm concluded that business-to-business
electronic commerce could reduce average prices across the
economies of the five richest nations by nearly 4 percent over a
decade or more.
</P>
<P>
   It is no small irony, though, that the sure winners from the
continued spread of Internet commerce are old-economy companies _
whose operations are retooled. (Another big class of winners is
consumers, who benefit from lower prices.) As with past
innovations, from railways to cars, the companies that supply the
technology itself can be risky investments indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Back at Harvard, what did Sahlman say to the students who were
considering start-ups but were scared by the stock market's loss of
faith?
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them that if you have a good idea and a top team of
people and can attract the backing of a blue-chip venture-capital
firm, then there is no real personal risk,'' he said. ``Even if the
business fails, it can only be a great learning experience in a
part of the economy that is sure to become more and more important.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then,'' Sahlman noted, ``it is harder to take that advice
than to give it. After all, I'm a tenured professor.''

IN HAVANA, CONFLICTING EMOTIONS OVER CUBAN BOY 
</HEADLINE>
  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ Elian Gonzalez was not only shipwrecked but kidnapped,
in the official point of view here, which was on display in all its
revolutionary fervor during the weekend at a demonstration by
thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a downpour, protesters of all ages brandished Cuban
flags, danced, sang and spoke, with a sixth-grader, Yisel
Viamontes, taking on the question on many minds in the United
States and to some degree here as well. Would Elian have a better
life here or there?
</P>
<P>
   ``They say he could be a millionaire there,'' Yisel shouted from
the stage at a rally Saturday night in Las Tunas, 400 miles
southeast of here. ``Here he will be a millionaire, but with
millions much different than over there, with more dignified
millions. Here he has millions of brothers and sisters and friends
and classmates.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian is certainly a cause celebre here _ the 39th anniversary
of President Fidel Castro's proclamation of a socialist state
perhaps has added to the ferment _ but in everyday conversation
people do not speak about the case as much with revolutionary
passion as with apparently conflicting emotions.
</P>
<P>
   In the markets, squares and bustling streets of this capital _
its late 1950s cars and colonial buildings a backdrop both dreary
and charming _ the latest twists and turns in the case have
provoked a range of reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans acknowledge feeling frustration and confusion over the
American justice system, puzzled that one judge may rule one way
and another judge another way.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that has happened in the courts, it's very bureaucratic
and hard to understand,'' said Fernando Suarez, an engineer who,
like many professionals here weathering hard economic times,
supplements his income by selling books at a market. ``Can you
explain to me why not even the attorney general could take the boy
out of the house in Miami?'' Suarez asked about Attorney General
Janet Reno's failure last week to obtain the transfer of Elian from
his great-uncle to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Silvia Romay, 35, another vendor who is an engineer, said she
could relate to the case because her father left Cuba in 1980
during the Mariel boatlift in which 125,000 Cubans left for Florida
in a matter of months. Romay's father, with whom she has sporadic
contact, lives in New York City but she prefers to stay in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to be separated from your parent,'' Romay said.
``The situation is so politicized now. Elian is just an instrument
for all sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Hernandez, a construction worker, said the more time the
boy spends out of Cuba the more likely he will become a national
hero, ``although I do not know that he should be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is just a boy who by chance ended up in the United States
and, sooner or later, will come back and go on,'' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials have said there are no plans to parade the boy
when he returns, and few people doubt the case will end with Elian
living anywhere but in Cuba. Celebratory rallies welcoming him
back, however, seem inevitable, and a huge plaza was recently
completed on the grand Malecon, the famous seaside drive in Havana,
near the United States Interests Section.
</P>
<P>
   Some may celebrate reluctantly, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   For all the sympathy there may be for Elian's father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, there is also understanding of Elian's mother,
Elizabet Brotons, who took the boy with her on her fatal boat trip
to Florida. Those who say they understood why she took such a
drastic move mention the lure of bountiful, higher-paying jobs in
the United States and freedom merely 90 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, he made it out and that is where he may
belong,'' said a 24-year-old student who said he had thought about
rafting to Florida but feared drowning. ``Do you know how many
people would like to switch places with him?''
</P>
<P>
   Another man, a musician, referred to the increasingly prominent
``Liberan a Elian'' _ free Elian _ placards on display around town.
`` `Free Elian' has two meanings, you know,'' the musician said.
``There are people here who believe now he is free.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone here, despite the impression in much of the United
States, is clamoring to cobble together a raft and flee. Many here
appear to believe that the United States' economic embargo, now 40
years old, will ultimately end, opening the way to better economic
times.
</P>
<P>
   Castro, who has become closely involved in the Elian case, has
not addressed the subject in recent days. Castro was the host of a
summit meeting of third world leaders that ended here on Friday
night. Sunday he was concluding talks with President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika of Algeria, who extended his stay after the summit
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But the case did not escape the notice of some foreign leaders
here for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be happy, as will the Venezuelan people, the day that
child again breathes Cuban air and sets foot on this heroic Cuban
soil,'' said President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, whose hard-line
policies on the rich, affinity for military greens and criticism of
the United States have drawn comparisons to Castro.
</P>
<P>
   State-controlled media outlets like Granma, the official
newspaper of the Communist Party, provide a daily dose of
full-blown Elian news from the official standpoint. And for two
hours every afternoon Cuban television broadcasts round-table
discussions on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Said the moderator on Friday evening: ``Indignant and combative,
we continue the fight for a boy who is all the children of the
world.''

GORE HAS AWKWARD MOMENTS IN REAPPEARANCE WITH CLINTON AT
FUND-RAISER 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ The sweet scent of jasmine wafted up the
leafy hillsides, the lights of Los Angeles twinkled below, and the
cash register cachinged until it was stuffed with $2.8 million. The
Bill and Al Show reopened Saturday night, a star-studded gala under
the baton of the DreamWorks SKG trio, after being dark for five
months.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Vice President Al Gore has wrapped up the Democratic
nomination for president, his campaign has deemed it safe for him
to start reappearing with President Clinton. Wearing light brown
sports jackets and open-necked polo shirts, they ventured out
together for the first in a series of joint appearances to raise
money for the Democratic National Committee. (The show goes to New
York on April 24.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore is naturally relying on the successes of the Clinton
administration to sweep him into office. As he told his audience
here, the nation's prosperity is ``the wind at my back.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has also been campaigning at a slight distance from the
impeached president. And on Saturday night, Gore seemed still not
have resolved his feelings toward him.
</P>
<P>
   On the slate patio of the fortresslike Greystone manor, with
amber lanterns slung from overhanging branches and stars like Jimmy
Smits, Whoopi Goldberg, Kevin Spacey, Antonio Banderas, Melanie
Griffith and Jay Leno listening, an odd ambivalence toward the
president emerged in Gore's remarks. In trying to praise Clinton,
Gore seemed to give him the back of his hand.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he wanted to say that the president was a man of
big ideas. But he introduced that thought this way: ``Of all the
criticisms of President Clinton that I've heard, the one that rings
the most hollow is that he has pushed small ideas, little
proposals.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he said the job of president was so difficult, Clinton
had nearly snapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the good things I could say about President Clinton _ I
could tell you about the many, many times when I have seen him,
especially in the early years, nearly buckle under the pressure of
his office but never do so,'' Gore said. He paused here at length,
as if surprised by what he had just said and wondering how to
smooth it over.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I say this,'' he began anew, ``I don't want to pretend that
I know how heavy his burdens have been because there is no other
position like the one that he has held on our behalf. But I've been
close enough to it to see first-hand that those burdens are very
heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience was full of people infatuated with Clinton, and
they seemed a bit relieved when their man took the stage. He was
casual and charming and had them laughing almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   He played off a reference that Gore had made in which he
disparaged one of Hollywood's biggest flops, the $35-million 1986
disaster ``Howard the Duck.'' Noting that the news media was always
``obsessively'' seeking differences between Gore and Clinton,
Clinton said: ``I liked `Howard the Duck,''' bringing chuckles from
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Jokes aside, the buzz was whether Gore could ever live up to the
Hollywood-friendly standards set by Clinton, a natural performer
and movie junkie. (As one production executive said of Clinton:
``He is into the creative process.'')
</P>
<P>
   So far, Gore is doing just fine in the cash department. There
was an assumption that the vice president, because of his high-tech
proclivities and because DreamWorks is leaving the money-raising
field, might find Silicon Valley more lucrative. And on Friday
night, he raised an eye-popping $2.6 million from 70 venture
capitalists at the Silicon Valley home of Joel Hyatt, a party
fund-raiser and successful entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday night's Hollywood haul brought in $2.8 million from
100 people who paid at least $25,000 a couple _ more than any
recent event for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And in California, Gore appears ahead of Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, the likely Republican nominee. The latest Field survey put
Gore 10 points ahead, prompting speculation that Bush may be unable
to wage a serious contest here.
</P>
<P>
   That is essential in raising money. A top Democratic fund-raiser
put it this way: ``You have a tough act to follow with Clinton. But
poll numbers help a lot. When polls show you're going to win, it's
easier.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest problems for Gore, and other Democrats, is
that the DreamWorks trio of Steven Spielberg, David Geffen and
Jeffrey Katzenberg, longtime Clinton promoters and experts at
extracting millions from their friends in the entertainment
industry, plan to retreat from the fund-raising galaxy when Clinton
leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore is just not as natural a guest here as Clinton. While
Gore has visited California 66 times since he became vice president
seven years ago, Clinton seems more at home here. And there is talk
that he will spend much of his post-presidency in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton has a bond here, and Gore has just never worked
California the way he has,'' one insider said. ``There is no
question that Gore can never get to the level Clinton has here
among the two or three thousand people in the fund-raising world.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Clinton, Gore's biggest promoter, seemed a bit worried that
donors here might be lulled into a sense of complacency and flag in
their commitment to getting Gore elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think it doesn't matter, when you get tired, when you
wish somebody wouldn't call you again between now and November,''
the president told them, remember that the Republicans ended the
economic expansion of the 1960s. ``Take a deep breath and bear
down,'' he implored them.

COLLEGE STUDENT LEARNS FREE-SPEECH LESSON DURING MASS ARREST

 By TIM WEINER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As he sees it, Mike Saltz spent Saturday night in
jail for exercising his natural-born rights of free speech and
peaceable assembly.
</P>
<P>
   A man who appears both sweet-tempered and thoughtful, Saltz, 22,
a student at the University of Oregon in Eugene, was swept up in a
mass arrest of roughly 600 people near the International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   He was trying to find some friends at a rally, he said, when he
was corralled, arrested, cuffed wrist to ankle and charged with
parading without a permit, an infraction legally less serious than
a misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really shocked,'' he said. ``When it comes to
disagreeing with the dominant view, your rights are really out the
window. They can do whatever they want _ they're the police.''
</P>
<P>
   It was his first arrest. He spent Saturday night and Sunday
morning in a holding cell in the bowels of the District of Columbia
Superior Court before he paid a $50 fine and was freed.
</P>
<P>
   He had had no water to drink, he said, and only a doughnut to
eat. But he had plenty of time to ponder his part in the weekend
street protests in Washington, in the diffuse movement for
``economic justice'' _ if it is a movement _ and the police
reaction to it.
</P>
<P>
   Saltz was raised in Yorba Linda, Calif., not far from Richard
Nixon's family home. His family is a pure product of the ``American
Dream,'' he said. But he began getting ideas about politics in
grade school that were a little outside the mainstream in southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started getting interested in activism in the third grade,''
he said. Sprawling developments cutting into mountain lions'
habitat first fired his imagination. He became interested in the
Sierra Club and the radical ecology group Earth First! He started a
political magazine as a high school freshman. His work drew
anonymous death threats, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1994, before I went to college, there was the Zapatista
uprising'' in southern Mexico. The small but politically savvy
rural guerrilla movement, linked to the outside world by e-mail,
demanded land rights for Mexican peasants and protested the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   This set Saltz studying, as he put it, ``how globalization
creates a movement like the Zapatistas, a globalized activism.''
</P>
<P>
   When he went off to the University of Oregon, his thinking
connected with what he calls ``this strange coalition'' that drew
thousands of protesters like him to Seattle in November and to
Washington during the weekend. It is a collection of advocates for
the ecology and self-declared anarchists, traditional leftists and
mainstream labor unions and dozens more groups deeply skeptical of
the forces of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a park bench Sunday in the middle of downtown
Washington, two blocks from the White House and four blocks from
the World Bank, he reflected on his experience in Seattle, where he
was not arrested, and on the crowd in Washington, and said, ``I'm
beginning to call this a movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could break apart as easily as it came together,'' he said,
``but it feels like it's coming together. In Seattle it was just
forming. Now there seems to be a coherent, cohesive idea _ economic
justice. The World Trade Organization was something to latch onto.
It represents what we reject: an economy that is becoming less and
less democratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governments are repressing movements for economic democracy
like the Zapatistas. In this country, the government is cutting
social spending. We're doing away with welfare, doing away with job
security. There's more and more temporary work, jobs that don't
provide a living wage. The economy's creating more billionaires but
there's a huge, growing gap between the rich and poor.''
</P>
<P>
   And he continued: ``My dad was asking me the other night, `This
is the greatest economy in the history of America _ why is this
happening?'''
</P>
<P>
   Answering that question _ coming up with an alternative to
``global capitalism,'' based on a model of ``economic justice'' _
would require ideas that would not fit onto a bumper sticker or a
banner, Saltz conceded with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the movement is at the point of proposing a
model,'' he said. ``Maybe it's fair trade. Maybe it's getting
people to think about what they buy, whether whatever they're
buying is made in sweatshops or under exploitative conditions.
Maybe it's getting people to see they have the power to change
things.''
</P>
<P>
   For himself, in the future, it may be a career as a labor
organizer, or working abroad in poor villages, maybe in Mexico, he
said. For Sunday, it was enough to get out of jail and back into
the streets and their continuing political carnival tinged with
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still trying to figure out for myself what the answer
is,'' he said.

CAN YOU REWRITE `MRS. ROBINSON?'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's a couple of politicians, albeit
self-serving, in San Francisco who want to honor the memory of
favorite son Joe DiMaggio by naming a park after him, one in North
Beach where he and his brothers used to play as kids near their
house.
</P>
<P>
   At least they're not trying to name it after a computer chip or
a phone company.
</P>
<P>
   But you try to do somethin' nice and what happens?
</P>
<P>
   Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio's longtime lawyer whose only purpose
now in life is to protect the use of the DiMaggio name (in the post
Mr. Coffee-era), emphatically wheezes his objections to this
degrading idea.
</P>
<P>
   Havin' a piece of grass in your name where people let their dogs
run loose to you-know-what, parents let their buck-naked kids run
loose to you-know-what, that'll probably have restrooms where
someday George Michael may you-don't-wanna-know-what ...
</P>
<P>
   Say it ain't so, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   He was hopin' for maybe a Joe D bridge. Or a harbor. Heck, why
not an entire peninsula?
</P>
<P>
   Around here, we musta done a stupid thing by allowing some swing
sets and ballfields to be named for the memory of Jim Thorpe, Jesse
Owens, Jackie Robinson ... even Junior Gilliam. What a waste of our
time and cheapening of their names.
</P>
<P>
   The way Engelberg's reacting (is he related to the fat kid in
``Bad News Bears''?), you'd think S.F. wanted to name a buncha
movie houses after the Yankee Clipper.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sorry Magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real legal problem in this area,'' Engelberg explains,
``is how other athletes and celebrities can be affected if
municipalities keep naming public facilities after them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just picture a municipality naming a garbage dump after Dennis
Rodman.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohhhhhhh ... long pause by us ... we're thinkin' ... we're
thinkin' hard ... ya know, there's a couple of acres in Pacoima ...
</P>
<P>
   OK, Morris, now that you just killed your whole argument, how do
we start a petition for this proposed giant smelly ol' trash
receptacle? ...
</P>
<P>
   --Note to Kurt Russell: Next time you drag Goldie out to a
Dodger game and prop up her 50-something, not-so-hot body in a
luxury box, try to make sure she puts on a thread of clothing.
Can't wolf down a Krispy Kreme lookin' at that. ...
</P>
<P>
   --Todd Hundley loves the new stadium configuration since it
means he has to jog 20 feet less to chase down a Chan Ho wild one.
...
</P>
<P>
   --Mark Chmura, all over ``American Beauty'' in his Oscar pool,
can't wait to see the next flick based on his life, ``American
Psycho.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   --On ESPN's NFL meat-market coverage, someone actually hoisted a
boom mike over LaVar Arrington as he called a family huddle to say
a prayer of thanks after he was picked No.2 by Washington. ...
</P>
<P>
   --This Myron Piggie goes wee-wee-wee all the way to the slammer.
</P>
<P>
   What a swine ...
</P>
<P>
   --Pete Rose during his Q-and-A in the current Playboy, dragged
out this tired analogy again: ``If I had been busted for drugs
instead of gambling, I'd still be managing the Reds and baseball
would be paying for my therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there's the apology Jim Gray was lookin' for. ...
</P>
<P>
   --And it'll probably be the same sort of remorse shown by the
Bloomington Strangler, so stop pressing. ...

MODERN AND TATE TEAM UP FOR COMMERCIAL WEB SITE
</HEADLINE>
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an unusual marriage of the nonprofit museum world and the
money-hungry e-commerce industry, the Museum of Modern Art in
Manhattan and the Tate Gallery and its branches in Britain have
formed a partnership to create an Internet business for art,
culture and design.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the company include a Web site to sell commissioned
design products and to offer such educational programs as live
Webcasts of lectures and concerts. It will also carry archival
material on art.
</P>
<P>
   Profits from the site will help pay the museums' escalating
operating expenses. This will be the first time any art museum has
used its reputation, expertise and outreach to start a
profit-making company.
</P>
<P>
   But the Modern and the Tate are not the first nonprofit
institutions to do so. In the last few months several academic
centers _ Columbia University, the New York Public Library, the
British Library, the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of
Natural History, the London School of Economics and Political
Science and Cambridge University Press _ have teamed up to start
Fathom.com, a Web site designed to provide specialized information
and general knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   To preserve the museums' tax-exempt status as nonprofit
institutions, the venture by the Modern and the Tate (as yet
unnamed) will be a separate entity with its own staff, board of
directors and offices. A chief executive is being sought to run the
business from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``This venture is not just two guys dreaming in their garage,
but a company built on two institutions' history, stability and
knowledge,'' said Glenn D. Lowry, director of the Modern. ``The
Internet is a world of strange, overlapping and intersecting
interests. We're all exploring how to operate in that world, and
there's a scramble for the design and culture dot-com space.
Between us we have the engine to found this new company, which will
not only have a major presence in the United States but in England
and Europe too.''
</P>
<P>
   The project comes at a crucial time for both institutions. The
Tate is opening the $208 million Tate Gallery of Modern Art in
Bankside, just opposite St. Paul's Cathedral in London, next month,
while the Modern is embarking on a $650 million expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both realized that to have a steady stream of income to
ensure a strong future is crucial,'' Lowry said. ``This company
will have long-term value for both of us.'' Eventually, Lowry
added, the company could go public.
</P>
<P>
   While officials from both museums said it was too early to
project how much money they could expect from the company, they
expected revenues from advertising, licensing, merchandise sales,
pay-per-view for certain types of events and information, as well
as syndication of original content.
</P>
<P>
   Lowry said he and Sir Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate, had
been discussing ways they could collaborate beyond joint
exhibitions when they realized that each was separately
investigating the possibility of a profit-making Web site. ``We
were on parallel tracks,'' Lowry said.
</P>
<P>
   Serota said: ``I don't think one should underestimate what a big
move this is for us. For two fiercely independent institutions that
hitherto have been competitors to join forces like this takes a
huge degree of trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Though neither museum would discuss the costs needed to start
the company or the profits it expected to earn, a source close to
the venture said that the Modern had raised several million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The next stage would involve raising about $50 million from
investors.
</P>
<P>
   The company is scheduled to set up its Web site later in the
year or early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Both museums have independent Web sites (www.moma.org and
www.tate.org.uk) that they plan to keep. Each museum had more than
5 million visitors last year, and each institution's Web site
received an additional 4 million visitors. Together the museums
manage retail operations with $50 million in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   Their joint site would be drastically different from either
their Web sites or their stores, both directors said. For starters
it would have ads, which the museum Web sites do not have. It would
also sell products like furniture, design objects and books
exclusive to the site and commissioned by designers and architects
from many sources. The items would be more varied than those
available on the Modern's current Web site, which offers
merchandise mainly from its store on West 53rd Street. While the
site would not offer original artworks, it would sell
multiple-edition prints or photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Among the educational programs it would offer are customized art
tours, virtual-reality tours of collections and exhibitions,
archival material, Webcasts of live lectures, concerts and
performances from around the world and critical essays. There will
also be ticketing for art events and courses.
</P>
<P>
   Lowry does not see the venture as a conflict of interest to the
museums' missions as educational institutions. ``We have built in
all the appropriate fire walls,'' Lowry said. ``No trustee or their
family and no staff member of either museum can invest in this
company should it go public. It will have an independent board.
There will also be licensing arrangements to safeguard our
interests.'' Still, the museums intend to control the site's
content. Two members from the boards of the museums will sit on the
company's board.
</P>
<P>
   In the curatorial world the formation of such a company may be
looked down upon by some as being overly commercial, but Mary Lea
Bandy, chief curator of film and video at the Modern and its deputy
director for curatorial affairs, thinks otherwise: ``Museums, like
libraries and universities, are filled with curators, professors
and scholars who are eager to share their expertise to as many
people as possible, which is something a project like this can do.
For those of us in film, video, architecture, design or photography
_ any art form that exists in multiple forms _ the possibilities
are fantastic.''  &QL;

 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Sander Levin hardly fits the classic
free-trade profile. He is a liberal Democrat from the Detroit
suburbs who proudly owns a 94 percent career voting record with
organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with thousands of protesters in town to demonstrate against
the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and what they view
as the evils of globalization, Levin will be lucky if he isn't
hanged in effigy.
</P>
<P>
   The 68-year-old legislator is fine-tuning a plan that could give
wavering House Democrats the political cover they want to vote yes
on a the biggest trade deal in recent years. an accord with China.
If Levin succeeds, Congress will help hand Beijing a diplomatic
coup while opening new markets for American goods, but will still
keep leverage over China's behavior on human rights, religious
tolerance and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Members are searching for a way to both keep the heat on China
and get the benefits of what we negotiated,'' Levin said in his
Capitol Hill office, where photographs of Thomas P. O'Neill and
Robert F. Kennedy peer down from the wall. ``We have to strive to
combine active engagement with constructive confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years Congress has gone through the motions of an annual
debate and vote to grant China the same trading privileges that
Washington gives almost every other country. Congress has never
refused to provide this plum.
</P>
<P>
   But now China is on verge of joining the World Trade
Organization, and as part of a deal negotiated last fall, President
Clinton promised to try to lift the annual review and grant Beijing
permanent trading status.
</P>
<P>
   The House will vote just before Memorial Day, but the outcome is
too close to call. The fate of the agreement rests with about two
dozen uncommitted Democrats. Passage in the pro-business Senate is
considered certain.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Levin, a senior member of the House Ways and Means
Committee, who is one of the fence-sitters and has long wrestled
with trade issues. He voted against the North American Free Trade
Agreement in 1993 and opposed giving Clinton fast-track authority
to negotiate trade pacts. He has voted both for and against
granting China normal trading status.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an activist internationalist who's worked on both sides:
expanded trade and expanded issues of trade,'' said Levin, who
banged on Japan's doors in the 1980s to pry open its market to
American automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Levin came away from a 10-day trip to China in January convinced
that this trade agreement would influence the future of U.S.-China
relations for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came back feeling that changes in China are irreversible but
that the direction is not inevitable,'' said Levin, who talked to
students, artists and intellectuals about how free trade could open
up China's repressive society. ``You have to shape globalization.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin sees himself as an organizer and a problem-solver, and set
out to steer all sides to a middle ground. He has drawn up a plan
to monitor China once it joins the WTO, and to react swiftly to any
violations. The proposal sets up a congressional-executive branch
commission to monitor China's behavior on human rights and trade _
the biggest concern of opponents to giving up the yearly review _
and arm it with a quiver of rewards and penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would also write into law promises China made to the
United States to avoid surges of Chinese exports into the American
market.
</P>
<P>
   At first, no one on Capitol Hill paid much attention to Levin's
plan. But by the time lawmakers headed home last week for a recess
and the administration anxiously sought to nail down undecided
votes, the idea was catching on. Backers say Levin's plan could
swing 10 to 15 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Levin is not flashy, nor is the low-key, details approach he has
used in shopping his plan to about 40 undecided Democrats and
Republicans. A Democratic colleague once described him as ``a pit
bull with manners.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What Sandy is doing is extremely helpful because he's trying
to get some accountability over time,'' said Rep. Tom Allen, a
Maine Democrat whose vote is up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   The China trade wars have catapulted Levin into the limelight
somewhat to the chagrin of his party's leaders. Rep. Dick Gephardt
of Missouri, the House Democratic leader who is strategically
neutral on the vote, has been dismissive of Levin's efforts,
choosing to broker his own third way with the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 2 Democrat in the House, David Bonior of Michigan, is
leading the charge against the deal, and has called Levin's plan
toothless.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare flash of pique, Levin bristles at that criticism: ``It
has a lot of teeth in it, and I hope they're sharp and will bite
when they need to.''
</P>
<P>
   Sander Martin Levin, the grandson of Russian and Polish Jews,
was born and raised in Detroit. After earning degrees from the
University of Chicago, Columbia University and Harvard Law School,
he threw himself into the political arena.
</P>
<P>
   Levin served in the Michigan State Senate for five years, but
after two failed attempts to become governor in the 1970s, he
thought he was washed up in politics. He was assistant
administrator of the Agency for International Development during
the Carter administration.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1982, Michigan's 12th congressional district opened up
and Levin has occupied it ever since, forming the lesser-known half
of the Levin brother act in Congress. (Levin's younger brother,
Carl, is the senior senator from Michigan and ranking Democrat on
the Armed Services Committee.) Levin and his wife, Vicki, have four
grown children.
</P>
<P>
   For Levin, who worked one summer at a Dodge auto assembly plant,
the China pact brings his trade career full circle: ``My feeling on
trade is that it's more than the humdrum of tariffs. A key part of
economic life is rolling up your sleeves on a daily basis to work
it out and to avoid the extremes.''

IN CELEBRATION OF KOUFAX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Book title: ``Koufax,'' by Edward Gruver
</P>
<P>
   Info: Taylor Publishing, $24.95, 264 pgs.
</P>
<P>
   The intent: It's been more than 30 years since a book on the
Hall of Fame career and very private life of Sandy Koufax has been
done. Even then, Koufax agreed to an autobiography published in
1966 only because he was given a $100,000 advance by Viking Press
and wanted the security, knowing he was about to stage a famous
contract holdout with Don Drysdale that spring. Since the former
Dodgers great's name has come up in recent months - baseball's
All-Century team and ESPN's list of the 50 greatest athletes -
there's a window of opportunity to reintroduce the legendary
left-hander to a new generation.
</P>
<P>
   The execution: Gruver frames Koufax's life around his defining
moment - his Game 7 performance of the 1965 World Series against
Minnesota when, on two days rest and his curveball not working, he
threw a three-hit shutout to clinch the title for the Dodgers. It's
rich in notes and anecdotes about his upbringing, all-too-brief
playing career and his commitment to his Jewish beliefs (which
plays into Shawn Green's recent arrival to the Dodgers).
</P>
<P>
   In Koufax's words: He declined to be interviewed for the book.
</P>
<P>
   The author's words: ``It was pretty much understood that he
wouldn't talk,'' said Gruver, based in Philadelphia. ``The Dodgers
told me that he was aware of the book but wasn't interested in an
interview. I respect his privacy and spoke to as many friends,
neighbors and former teammates as I could. But he'll always have
what one friend called this `wall of amiability' around him.''
</P>
<P>
   What we still can't figure out: Why did a guy who wanted
anonymity immediately take an analyst job with NBC?
</P>
<P>
   Did you know: Buddy Hackett was one of the kids in his Brooklyn
neighborhood who played ball in the streets with Koufax, and the
comedian's older sister used to baby-sit Koufax. So maybe that's
where his code of silence makes sense.

 &HT;    Wreck finally arrives, takes 16
 &HT;    By Rick Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLADEGA, Ala. _ The Big Wreck is one of the trademarks of a
NASCAR race at Talladega Superspeedway. This time it came on lap
138 _ 50 laps from the finish of Sunday's DieHard 500.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen drivers were involved, including Bobby Labonte who
entered the race with the Winston Cup points lead but left in
second place, 24 points behind Mark Martin, who finished sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte drove his battered Pontiac to a 21st-place finish _ his
worst of the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been a lot worse,'' he said. ``We just lost one
lap and were able to get back some positions that we maybe didn't
deserve after being involved in a big wreck like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte said multi-car crashes are not unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to happen all the time, but the chances of it
happening are pretty big. And usually when it happens, it's pretty
big.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than half of Sunday's race, drivers had run three- and
four-cars wide without incident.
</P>
<P>
   But just after a restart, Scott Pruett appeared to cut in front
of Robby Gordon heading into turn one. When the smoke cleared, 16
wrecked cars were strewn across the track.
</P>
<P>
   Other drivers involved were Dick Trickle, Steve Park, Tony
Stewart, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Michael Waltrip, Mike Bliss, Stacy
Compton, Robert Pressley, Joe Nemechek, Ted Musgrave, Dave Blaney,
Ricky Rudd and Ken Schrader.
</P>
<P>
   Both Pruett and Gordon were at least a lap behind the leaders,
but were running in the lead draft.
</P>
<P>
   Pruett said he got hit from behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It lifted the car up, got it light and turned it, so I
corrected it,'' Pruett said. ``That was that. It was a bad day.
...We were just racing hard, and I feel bad about all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said Pruett made a miscalculation when he moved into the
left line of traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Scott thought he was clear or maybe he noticed I had a
run and he was trying to get in line before being left out,''
Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Several drivers were checked out at the track's care center.
Only Trickle, who suffered a swollen right foot, will require
further treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip, like most other drivers in the crash, also said he was
minding his own business up to that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just drove into me,'' he said. ``I was so proud of this
group of drivers for running three- and four-wide and trying to
take care of each other. Just one mistake and you get a wreck like
that. It's unfortunate.''

MIAMI POLITICIANS TESTED BY ELIAN GONZALEZ CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CUBAN-BOY-SUPPORTERS, CUBAN-BOY-HAVANA) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ What excites Miami's Cuban-Americans about the Elian
Gonzalez case is that it is the best opportunity since the failed
Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 to humiliate Fidel Castro. But
domestic conflicts are stirring this pot, too, and threatening
Miami and its two top politicians with their own Bay of Pigs.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Penelas, 38, a Democrat, was elected mayor of Miami-Dade
County four years ago with the huge support of normally
Republican-voting Cuban-Americans, as well as the support of many
blacks and Anglo whites. Once perceived as a future governor or
senator, Penelas faces a re-election race in the fall against a
Republican Cuban-American, Miguel Diaz de la Portilla, a county
commissioner who is more conservative than Penelas.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Carollo, 45, a Republican, was elected mayor of the city of
Miami three years ago. In a city where Cuban-Americans make up the
majority of the vote, he survived an attempt by his own city
commission to oust him in a special election last year that the
courts overruled. Accused of taking his Cuban-American support for
granted, Carollo faces a challenge next year from a former mayor,
Xavier Suarez, also a Cuban-American.
</P>
<P>
   In the local political arena, said professor Kenneth W. Goodman,
director of the ethics program at the University of Miami, ``Fidel
Castro is not even an issue.'' Alberto Duran, a board member of the
Cuban Committee for Democracy, which favors the boy's return to his
father, said, ``This is a political struggle, a show of political
muscle more than a stance against Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to prove they can keep this child here,'' Duran
said. ``Penelas is in a very tough political race, so he's taking
extreme stands to get the Cuban-American vote, and Carollo is going
to have a tough race in November next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The turning point in both mayors' participation in the dispute
came late last month when Penelas, with Carollo beside him at the
microphones on the steps of the federal courthouse here, lashed out
at federal law and its enforcers.
</P>
<P>
   Penelas, until that moment a man known as a consensus-building
moderate, declared that he would not let the Miami police help
federal agents move Elian from his temporary home and would blame
President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno for any ensuing
violence and civil disorder. He and Carollo, who is better known as
a firebrand, have since promised to maintain order. But they will
not let their police join federal marshals in moving Elian from his
great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez's white stucco house in Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the mayors have alienated all other ethnic groups,
sullied their images as emerging leaders of their national
political parties, and diminished the stature of their city. At
moments in the Elian saga, analysts say, the mayors have let
emotions trump federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they both have at stake,'' said Dario Marino, a pollster
and associate professor of political science at Florida
International University here, ``is the good name of Miami and the
ability to attract business. No one in the business elite wants
civil disobedience.'' But as passions over Elian have begun to boil
over, Marino said, ``their first priority is not to alienate their
Cuban-American base. If they alienate their Cuban base, they're
both gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Gladwin, director of the Institute for Public Opinion
Research at FIU, said: ``The first level of political impact, until
it's resolved and people start reflecting on it, is this huge
polarization. People are going to remember.'' Because of the
mayors' ``pandering to popular sentiment,'' said Mayor Neisen O.
Kasdin of Miami Beach, just across Biscayne Bay, ``Miami has taken
it on the chin. It's not going to stop Miami's emergence as the
capital of the Americas. But this is a setback for two or three
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The two mayors have impeccable Cuban and American political
credentials. Penelas' father, a labor organizer in Cuba, was in a
Castro prison facing a death sentence when he escaped with his
family to Florida, where Alex was born. Joe Carollo came at the age
of 5 or 6.
</P>
<P>
   They soaked up American culture, got educations and entered
careers in politics. Penelas was elected to the Hialeah city
council at 25. Carollo, briefly a Democrat and a police officer,
was elected a Miami city commissioner at 24. Both dress in the
crisp suits and tightly knotted ties of members of the board of a
chamber of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the Elian case, following Elian's rescue at sea in
November when he and his mother, who drowned, were fleeing Cuba,
the mayors stood on the fringe of the custody debate while their
Cuban-American constituents weighed the issues.
</P>
<P>
   As views coalesced to the point where many now support Lazaro
Gonzalez's defiance of a federal order to release Elian to his
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who awaits him in Bethesda, Md., the
mayors have declined to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll this month that stunned analysts here, The Miami
Herald found an acutely polarized city, with 85 percent of
Miami-Dade County's Cuban-Americans supporting efforts to keep
Elian in the United States and 92 percent of African-Americans and
72 percent of Anglos supporting his return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   With a Cuban majority in the city and a plurality in the county,
said Lisandro Perez, director of the Cuban Research Institute at
Florida International University, ``Carollo and Penelas want to
make sure they're in the front of this movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The 4,000 or 5,000 people who demonstrate in front of Lazaro
Gonzalez's home may represent only a small fraction of the county's
743,000 Cuban-Americans, Perez said, but when things get emotional,
Carollo and Penelas are going to have to take up the banner or get
trampled. ``The fact that this is foreign policy is academic,''
Perez said. ``They're doing what their constituency wants them to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   In responding to the passions of a single constituency, the
mayors have alienated blacks and Anglo whites. Marvin Dunn, a black
academic who is the author of a book about the black experience in
Miami in the 20th century, said the poll showing that 92 percent of
blacks want Elian repatriated was stunning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see far too many fathers abandoning their children,'' Dunn
said. ``When we see a dad stand up for his son, that's
impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   James W. Corey, a political scientist at the University of Miami
and a veteran of the Bay of Pigs, said of Penelas, ``I would say
strategically, he's put himself in a precarious position.''
</P>
<P>
   The only winners, said Susan MacManus, a professor of political
science at the University of South Florida in Tampa, are the
leaders of the Cuban exile community, who are aging and had been
losing influence. The Elian affair, she said, ``has galvanized them
and emboldened them.''

IN HAVANA, CONFLICTING EMOTIONS OVER CUBAN BOY 
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ Elian Gonzalez was not only shipwrecked but kidnapped,
in the official point of view here, which was on display in all its
revolutionary fervor during the weekend at a demonstration by
thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a downpour, protesters brandished Cuban flags, danced,
sang and spoke, with a sixth-grader, Yisel Viamontes, taking on the
question on minds in the United States and here as well. Would
Elian have a better life here or there?
</P>
<P>
   ``They say he could be a millionaire there,'' Yisel shouted at a
rally Saturday night in Las Tunas, 400 miles southeast of here.
``Here he will be a millionaire, but with millions much different
than over there, with more dignified millions. Here he has millions
of brothers and sisters and friends and classmates.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian is a cause celebre here, but in everyday conversation
people do not speak about the case as much with revolutionary
passion as with apparently conflicting emotions. The latest twists
and turns in the case have provoked a range of reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans acknowledge feeling frustration and confusion over the
American justice system, puzzled that one judge may rule one way
and another judge another way.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that has happened in the courts, it's very bureaucratic
and hard to understand,'' said Fernando Suarez, an engineer who
supplements his income by selling books at a market. ``Can you
explain to me why not even the attorney general could take the boy
out of the house in Miami?'' Suarez asked about Attorney General
Janet Reno's failure last week to obtain the transfer of Elian from
his great-uncle to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Silvia Romay, 35, another vendor who is an engineer, said she
could relate to the case because her father left Cuba in 1980
during the Mariel boatlift in which 125,000 people fled for
Florida. Romay's father, with whom she has sporadic contact, lives
in New York City but she prefers to stay in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to be separated from your parent,'' Romay said.
``The situation is so politicized now. Elian is just an instrument
for all sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Hernandez, a construction worker, said the more time the
boy spends out of Cuba the more likely he will become a national
hero, ``although I do not know that he should be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is just a boy who by chance ended up in the United States
and, sooner or later, will come back and go on,'' Hernandez said.

COMMENTARY: TWO CONTROL FREAKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The phrase most often used by friend and foe alike to
describe British Prime Minister Tony Blair is ``control freak.''
</P>
<P>
   He tightly controls the flow of all government information from
10 Downing St., and put in a financial supporter to chair the
British Broadcasting Corp. He ``devolved'' power to Scotland and
Wales so as to make most of that leadership loyal to him. He
abolished hereditary peers so that power in Britain's conservative
House of Lords would shift to his Labor appointees.
</P>
<P>
   Only when he sought to ram through his choice of a sheeplike
follower to be mayor of London did voters rebel. An old radical
lefty spurned by Blair is running as an independent and may well
become London's Jesse Ventura _ a rambunctious rebuke to Blair's
new ``third way'' establishment.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister, a Clinton political clone, knows that
Conservatives behind the feisty William Hague are likely to pick up
enough seats to become a formidable minority in next year's
elections. Like his American mentor, Blair seeks to bestride the
foreign-policy scene to bedazzle voters lest prosperity not
continue to obscure unfulfilled domestic promises.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Vladimir Putin. Blair, unlike other Western leaders, paid
an obsequious visit to Yeltsin's handpicked successor before the
Russian election. In a virtual campaign endorsement played up on
Russia's state-owned TV, Blair bestowed pre-emptive forgiveness on
the former KGB operative who had won popularity among Russians by
slaughtering the pesky Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's diplomatic payback time: Putin is in London on Monday
to take tea with Queen Elizabeth II, courtesy of Tony Blair. The
prime minister sees himself as the broker between the Russian
leader who needs Western money and Blair's trans-Atlantic sidekick,
Clinton, who is desperate for his own foreign-policy fix before
departure.
</P>
<P>
   To some, Putin's London visit will recall Mikhail Gorbachev's
meeting with Margaret Thatcher, who then announced the Russian was
``a man we can do business with.'' But Maggie had a card up her
sleeve: Gorbachev had been set up. He was briefed for the London
meeting by his trusted KGB station chief, Oleg Gordievsky _ who the
world later learned was spying on the Russian leader for Britain's
MI6.
</P>
<P>
   The tables are turned today: The KGB man briefing himself is the
Russian leader. He comes prepared to offer a fake concession: Now
that he no longer needs an invigorating war (and indeed needs to
reduce Russian casualties being inflicted by guerrillas), Putin
will agree to negotiate a face-saving form of surrender by the
Chechens. This will allow Blair to pose as peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Putin will get exactly what he wants from the prime
minister: British pressure on Clinton not to exercise the U.S.
right of withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty made
three decades ago with the now-defunct Soviet Union. Putin's goal
is to block any U.S. ability to deal with the threat of incoming
missiles from rogue states like Iraq or North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Putin came armed with his Parliament's long-delayed
ratification of the Start II treaty, which reduces by thousands the
long-range nukes held by the United States and Russia. Start II
saves Russia money _ many of its missiles are rusting anyway _ and
well serves the safety of both countries. But Putin conditions his
approval on Clinton's willingness to hold to the outdated ABM
treaty, thereby subjecting the United States to nuclear blackmail
by dictators like Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Will Blair play along with Putin to keep U.S. cities at risk?
Yes. ``Blair laid heavy emphasis on the importance of maintaining
the ABM treaty ...,'' wrote Jim Hoagland of The Washington Post
last week. Why? ``I heard him suggest, without quite voicing,
serious concern about the viability of Britain's own nuclear
arsenal if the 1972 treaty is abrogated and missile defenses
proliferate.''
</P>
<P>
   Strictly observing the interviewing rules of background,
Hoagland thus reported a stunning divergence in Blair's perception
of British and American strategic interests. If the United States
develops a system to protect America and its allies from terrorist
missiles, goes Blair's perverse notion of deterrence, it will
somehow lessen the value of nuclear weapons held by Britain, which
is not a terrorist nation.
</P>
<P>
   America may now have to go it alone on missile defense, as these
two control freaks, sipping her majesty's tea, strike up their
special relationship.

OFFICIALS PROPOSE RAZING FORMER VETERANS HOME TO EXPAND CEMETERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK WIEBE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEAVENWORTH, KAN. _ Reveille in the morning. Taps at night. A
brass band playing John Philip Sousa in the afternoons. Veterans
sitting in wicker wheelchairs, their tobacco-stained white beards
hiding their faces. A movie house. An ice cream parlor.
</P>
<P>
   These were the trappings of a community that once was called the
Western Branch of the National Home for Disabled Veteran Soldiers
in Leavenworth. That community has long since vanished. And now
many of the home's old buildings _ vestibules to a nearly
120-year-old history _ could vanish too.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at what is today known as the Eisenhower Veterans
Affairs Medical Center have proposed razing 39 structures.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-seven of those structures _ ranging from outbuildings to
a grand Romanesque Revival mess hall _ were put on the National
Register of Historic Places last year. Together they make up a
district that is one of more than 71,000 listings on the National
Register. Missouri has 1,336 listings, while Kansas has 703.
</P>
<P>
   Getting on the register requires demonstrating a site's historic
or architectural significance.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 39 structures stand vacant. So when officials
learned last year that the adjacent Leavenworth National Cemetery
would run out of grave space in about six years, they proposed
razing the buildings and transferring 54 of the acres they stand on
to the cemetery. The demolition would cost about $5 million, money
that would come from the national VA's major construction budget,
not the Leavenworth VA's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Preservationists and VA officials will meet Tuesday at the
medical enter to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Nieweg, a lawyer with the Mountain//Plains Region of the
National Trust for Historic Preservation, said that if the
demolition proceeds, it would be one of the largest of its kind in
recent years. But it's a distinction he thinks Leavenworth could
avoid if the community focuses on reusing the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want the Leavenworth VA to become a precedent for
downsizing by clear-cutting,'' he said. ``There are developers out
there who are experienced with historic projects.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Trust recently made the Leavenworth VA buildings a
candidate for inclusion on its annual 11 Most Endangered Historic
Places list. If they make the list to be announced in June, the
buildings will be featured on the History Channel, which had a
camera team in Leavenworth on April 2 to get footage of the
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The VA says it spends about $100,000 a year just to keep the
buildings in their current state. Its focus on outpatient care and
less hospital treatment is, to a large degree, what has forced the
VA to close most of the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, more than 1,000 veterans received long-term care
in Leavenworth. Today, fewer than 200 veterans get such care. As a
result, the Leavenworth VA and others around the country have
vacated many of their buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the VA say they want to work with
preservationists to come up with other uses for the buildings. But,
said Leavenworth VA spokesman Jim Gleisberg, ``we don't want to
spend health care money on empty buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren L. Reed Jr. counts himself among those who would lament
the loss of the VA's history. Reed was born at the Home for
Disabled Veterans in 1924, 12 years after his father accepted a job
there as secretary to the home's general. In those days, civilian
administrators lived on the home's grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who lived on those grounds until 1946, remembers
accompanying his mother to dances in the Ward Memorial Building,
whose conical metal roof distinguishes it from the VA's other
buildings. He remembers watching the veterans _ ``members'' as he
called them _ lining in military formation to eat at Franklin Hall.
He remembers seeing veterans lounging on the balcony of the
barracklike domiciliaries during the day, and the drinking some did
in an amusement hall, known as the Dugout, at night.
</P>
<P>
   To Christy Davis, with the Kansas Historic Preservation Office,
all those buildings have architectural and historic significance.
Most of them were the products of Leavenworth builder James
McGonigle, who built part of the Kansas Capitol and whose skills
would later achieve national renown. McGonigle began construction
shortly after Leavenworth was chosen as the National Home's Western
Branch site in 1884.
</P>
<P>
   It was a major project, an economic gem, for Leavenworth.
</P>
<P>
   McGonigle built 13 domiciliaries, plus Franklin Hall, which
Davis considers a good example of Romanesque Revival architecture,
and the Ward Building, which Davis says is one of the few examples
of a brick Queen Anne building in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The Dugout, which McGonigle did not build, has touches of Gothic
Revival architecture, giving it a haunted look. Built in 1898, the
building was, in 1901, a target for Carry Nation's protest against
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   The setting _ picturesque rolling hills and a lake _ added to
the buildings' appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was constructed, there weren't any city parks,'' Davis
said. ``So the landscape drew people from around the community. It
was an attractive place.''
</P>
<P>
   Today most of the buildings are still structurally sound. Only
the Ward Building, with a shifting foundation, suffers major scars.
Officials with the VA estimate it would cost $2.5 million to return
it to its former glory.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, neglect has led, at most, to chipped paint, some
rotting wooden porches and, in some cases, crumbling ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no matter what state the buildings are in, the VA cannot
order them demolished without first soliciting the concerns of
people or organizations that may have a stake in the demolition.
The National Historic Preservation Act requires that.
</P>
<P>
   To date, 16 ``consulting parties,'' ranging from the city of
Leavenworth to the National Trust, have joined the effort to save
the buildings. Among the first to join was the Preservation
Alliance of Leavenworth.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance proposed that Leavenworth offer the VA 80 acres of
underused park space that abuts the VA's property; its members see
it as an alternative site for the National Cemetery's expansion. In
March, the city said it would do just that, if donating the land
would prevent the demolition. VA officials in Washington are
reviewing the offer.
</P>
<P>
   But the alliance mostly focuses on finding alternative uses for
the buildings. A few years ago, the law wouldn't have allowed
private development on any VA campus, Gleisberg said. But new laws
do, provided that the development is compatible with the VA's
mission.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's members have floated ideas that range from
creating subsidized housing for veterans or the elderly to
establishing a culinary school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably have more reuse ideas than there is space to
reuse,'' said alliance member Sally Hatcher. ``We realize that some
of the old domiciliaries will have to be sacrificed for parking, if
some of these ideas work. But we're committed to saving as many of
the buildings as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   That's especially true of the Ward Building, Franklin Hall and
the Dugout. But Hatcher, other preservationists and the VA know
that saving the buildings depends largely on the will of potential
developers.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said numerous examples of developers taking on older
buildings existed. Tax credits, she said, often serve as an
excellent incentive for such projects.
</P>
<P>
   But the scale of the VA project is larger than most. What's
more, the VA can't advertise its properties, making it difficult to
let developers know that they exist.
</P>
<P>
   The Preservation Alliance of Leavenworth, however, is more than
willing to help spread the word. A Web site that it recently
posted, www.toto.net/leavenworthvalor, is designed for that
purpose. ``A great place to reclaim the past and reclaim your
future,'' the home page reads.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher invests her optimism in efforts such as these.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this can be worked out so everybody is happy,'' she
said. ``We can't afford to throw our history into a landfill.''

H&AMP;R BLOCK CORRECTS GLITCH IN COMPANY'S TAX CUT SOFTWARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL WENSKE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, MO. _ H&AMP;R Block has corrected a software glitch
that affected more than 3,000 customers who file their taxes
online, a spokesman for the Kansas City-based company said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Block, the nation's biggest tax preparer, on Friday notified the
customers, who were using the company's Tax Cut software. They each
owed more than $1,000 and had authorized the Internal Revenue
Service to take payments from their bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokesman Neil Getzlow said the glitch caused the
software to misinterpret the placement of a comma, so $1,000 could
be read as $1. As a result, the IRS could take the wrong amount out
of a person's account, and the taxpayer would be charged a penalty
and interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to note that (the problem) won't affect people
filing their returns today or Monday,'' Getzlow said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Block officials told the company's customers that they would
have to mail the correct payments to the IRS. Getzlow said Block
had already told the IRS about the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working with the IRS to make sure there are no
penalties,'' Getzlow said. He said Block would assume
responsibility for penalties and interest that resulted.
</P>
<P>
   Getzlow said Block officials learned of the glitch from a
customer who used Tax Cut. He said he didn't know why the glitch
occurred or how technicians corrected it.
</P>
<P>
   Block officials said affected taxpayers should include the
notification from Block with their tax payment.
</P>
<P>
   About 18 million people a year use Block to do their taxes.

 &HT;    Major changes urged for Coke
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ The Coca-Cola Co. needs to pay out more
settlement money and show greater respect for black employees or
face a national boycott of its products, supporters of a racial
discrimination lawsuit against the company said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of a five-day bus ride from Atlanta to
Coca-Cola's annual shareholders meeting in Wilmington, Del.,
protest organizer Larry Jones said Coke hasn't yet offered enough
money to settle the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a former Coca-Cola manager, also said the Atlanta-based
beverage giant needs to undergo a ``180-degree change'' that halts
discrimination against African-American employees in pay,
promotions and performance evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   The company has denied the suit's allegations and opposed
efforts to make it a class-action case. That would expand
representation beyond its original eight plaintiffs to 2,000
current and former black employees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola spokesman Ben Deutsch said the company is working
toward a ``fair and expeditious resolution'' but is prohibited from
talking about the negotiations. Attorneys for both sides are
scheduled to meet today and Tuesday in mediator-aided negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Greensboro rally took place a few blocks from the historic,
now-closed Woolworth's store where four college students demanded
counter service 40 years ago. Their nonviolent protest sparked the
1960s sit-in movement that brought an end to discrimination in
public accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling that era Sunday, the group of about 45 ``justice
riders'' bunched together for the benefit of TV cameras. They wore
red caps and red buttons and hoisted hand-written placards reading,
``Coke, discrimination hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Jones calls for a boycott of Coke products after
Wednesday's shareholders meeting could depend on how much progress
is made to settle the suit. Jones said Sunday at Bethel African
Methodist Episcopal Church in Greensboro that Coke's response is
insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   He said the plaintiffs are seeking back pay, bonuses and stock
options covering the period that employees claim to have been
discriminated against. Coke needs to pay all of the reparations in
cash, he said, even covering the stock options.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Coke plans to get anywhere close to where they
need to get to,'' said Jones, adding that his group is also seeking
guarantees of ``something that is very meaningful, a philosophical
change in the company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot afford to talk about appointing a few blacks here
and there, giving a few dollars to some people, promoting a few
vice presidents who are black, and then believe that we have done
something,'' Jones said. ``We need a 180-degree change in the
Coca-Cola Co.''
</P>
<P>
   Angela Graham, a former Coke employee who is riding the bus,
said the company can avoid a boycott if officials ``give fair and
equitable treatment among all the employees.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the boycott would be national in scope, reaching beyond
Coke products to restaurants, convenience and grocery stores and
other establishments selling the products.
</P>
<P>
   The suit already has damaged Coke's reputation and stock value,
says the trustee of the state of New York's common retirement fund,
which owns 7.4 million Coca-Cola shares. That large institutional
investor has urged Coke to settle the suit quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Bus rider Jean Long, a Coke employee for 8 1/2 years, said she
owns company shares in her 401(k) retirement plan. Despite the
stock's decline, she said, she would support a potentially damaging
boycott if her group, the Committee for Corporate Justice, called
for one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see change,'' said Long, who believes she has been
passed over for promotions because she is black. ``It is not going
to get better if we don't stand up and say, `Enough is enough.'''
</P>
<P>
   None of the eight plaintiffs is riding the bus, which after
traveling from Atlanta to Greensboro, is scheduled today to arrive
in Richmond. Tuesday, the group plans a rally in Washington, D.C.,
before proceeding Wednesday to Wilmington.

 &HT;    Major changes urged for Coke
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ The Coca-Cola Co. needs to pay out more
settlement money and show greater respect for black employees or
face a national boycott of its products, supporters of a racial
discrimination lawsuit against the company said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of a five-day bus ride from Atlanta to
Coca-Cola's annual shareholders meeting in Wilmington, Del.,
protest organizer Larry Jones said Coke hasn't yet offered enough
money to settle the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a former Coca-Cola manager, also said the Atlanta-based
beverage giant needs to undergo a ``180-degree change'' that halts
discrimination against African-American employees in pay,
promotions and performance evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   The company has denied the suit's allegations and opposed
efforts to make it a class-action case. That would expand
representation beyond its original eight plaintiffs to 2,000
current and former black employees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola spokesman Ben Deutsch said the company is working
toward a ``fair and expeditious resolution'' but is prohibited from
talking about the negotiations. Attorneys for both sides are
scheduled to meet today and Tuesday in mediator-aided negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Greensboro rally took place a few blocks from the historic,
now-closed Woolworth's store where four college students demanded
counter service 40 years ago. Their nonviolent protest sparked the
1960s sit-in movement that brought an end to discrimination in
public accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling that era Sunday, the group of about 45 ``justice
riders'' bunched together for the benefit of TV cameras. They wore
red caps and red buttons and hoisted hand-written placards reading,
``Coke, discrimination hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Jones calls for a boycott of Coke products after
Wednesday's shareholders meeting could depend on how much progress
is made to settle the suit. Jones said Sunday at Bethel African
Methodist Episcopal Church in Greensboro that Coke's response is
insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   He said the plaintiffs are seeking back pay, bonuses and stock
options covering the period that employees claim to have been
discriminated against. Coke needs to pay all of the reparations in
cash, he said, even covering the stock options.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Coke plans to get anywhere close to where they
need to get to,'' said Jones, adding that his group is also seeking
guarantees of ``something that is very meaningful, a philosophical
change in the company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot afford to talk about appointing a few blacks here
and there, giving a few dollars to some people, promoting a few
vice presidents who are black, and then believe that we have done
something,'' Jones said. ``We need a 180-degree change in the
Coca-Cola Co.''
</P>
<P>
   Angela Graham, a former Coke employee who is riding the bus,
said the company can avoid a boycott if officials ``give fair and
equitable treatment among all the employees.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the boycott would be national in scope, reaching beyond
Coke products to restaurants, convenience and grocery stores and
other establishments selling the products.
</P>
<P>
   The suit already has damaged Coke's reputation and stock value,
says the trustee of the state of New York's common retirement fund,
which owns 7.4 million Coca-Cola shares. That large institutional
investor has urged Coke to settle the suit quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Bus rider Jean Long, a Coke employee for 8 1/2 years, said she
owns company shares in her 401(k) retirement plan. Despite the
stock's decline, she said, she would support a potentially damaging
boycott if her group, the Committee for Corporate Justice, called
for one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see change,'' said Long, who believes she has been
passed over for promotions because she is black. ``It is not going
to get better if we don't stand up and say, `Enough is enough.'''
</P>
<P>
   None of the eight plaintiffs is riding the bus, which after
traveling from Atlanta to Greensboro, is scheduled today to arrive
in Richmond. Tuesday, the group plans a rally in Washington, D.C.,
before proceeding Wednesday to Wilmington.

RANGERS FALL AS WETTELAND FALTERS IN 9TH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Esteban Loaiza yesterday pitched what was possibly
his best game ever with the Rangers. John Wetteland knows that as
well as anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel terrible for him,'' Wetteland said. ``I don't know what
more you can do to win a ballgame. It's my responsibility, and I
didn't get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Wetteland gave up consecutive home runs to Manny
Ramirez and Jim Thome with one out in the ninth inning, two
devastating blows that gave the Cleveland Indians a 2-1 victory
against the Rangers at Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, after a weekend of near-brilliant pitching, took a
1-0 lead into the ninth but squandered a chance for both a sweep
and a winning road trip. The Indians, dominated by the Rangers
staff until the last moment, openly expressed their good fortune at
having pulled one out against Wetteland.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' All-Star closer had a 1.08 career earned-run
average at Jacobs Field and a career-high 21 saves against the
Indians before yesterday. He had also converted his past 18 save
opportunities dating to last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you would have said we were going to hit two home runs off
him, I would have said you're crazy,'' Thome said. ``He's had so
much success against us. He and \RMariano\S Rivera are the top two
closers in baseball, much less the American League.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers took two of three from the Indians, but Wetteland
said: ``I haven't forgotten we dropped two to the Yankees. A 2-3
road trip doesn't look as good as a 3-2 road trip. If I'd have
executed like I should, we would have come away with a pretty good
road trip. I'm very disappointed at that aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza pitched brilliantly for 71/3 innings, allowing two hits
and two walks. But Indians starter Chuck Finley, fulfilling his end
of a dazzling pitching duel, kept the Indians close by allowing one
run on five hits while striking out 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both pitchers made a lot of quality pitches, and neither one
would give in,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``You probably
won't see many games pitched that well from both sides, not in this
league anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Loaiza: ``You never knows what's going to happen in this
game. You just want to throw strikes and get people out. Sometimes
it goes the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez and Thome were as ineffective as any hitter in either
lineup, at least until the ninth. Ramirez struck out three times
against Loaiza, and Thome struck out twice and grounded out weakly
once.
</P>
<P>
   But their day took a turn for the better in the ninth after
Wetteland retired Roberto Alomar on a grounder to second to start
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland went 2-2 on Ramirez before throwing a slider that
barely missed, a pitch that more than one Ranger hinted later was
strike three. Wetteland came back with a fastball but not where he
wanted. He wanted it up, but it sank low, and Ramirez blasted it
into the bleachers in deep center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty good at hitting the low ball,'' Wetteland said.
``That's not where I've had success with him. You can be the
smartest pitcher in the world, but if you don't execute, it doesn't
do you any good.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland also went 2-2 to Thome and came in with a low slider.
Just like Ramirez, Thome went down and smacked it over the
right-center-field wall for the game winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I was just looking for a good pitch,'' Thome
said. ``Maybe getting two strikes helped ... make me cut down on my
swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland said he couldn't remember a game in which he gave up
two consecutive home runs to blow a save.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've given up home runs in my career; that's nothing new,''
Wetteland said. ``You hope to keep them to a minimum. You hope it
doesn't hurt you. ... This one hurt.'' / nn

   Gordon stops his skid
</P>
<P>
   By Michael Carvell
</P>
<P>
   TALLADEGA, Ala. _ NASCAR fans in Alabama are known for their
unabashed worship of Dale Earnhardt and for wearing the infamous
``Anybody But Gordon'' shirts in the stands at Talladega
Superspeedway.
</P>
<P>
   However, the tide turned neon green, red, yellow and blue after
Sunday's race in Earnhardt country. Jeff Gordon took the checkered
flag for the DieHard 500 to snap the longest winless streak of his
Winston Cup career. Earnhardt finished third as Chevrolets claimed
the top four positions.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was able to block runner-up Mike Skinner over the final
three laps and _ surprisingly _ was greeted with cheers by the
estimated crowd of 188,000. Hundreds of fans waited outside of
victory lane to cheer on Gordon and repeatedly chant loudly ``We
Want Jeff.''
</P>
<P>
   At least eight Alabama state troopers were required to escort
Gordon through the hordes of adoring devotees, something that even
astonished the driver himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow ... I'm not used to this here (Talladega),'' said Gordon
with a grin. ``But I guess everyone likes to root for an
underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   To win for the first time since last October at Charlotte,
Gordon enlisted a nifty ``pass almost in the grass'' on the fourth
turn with five laps remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Martin, who won at Martinsville a week earlier, looked to
be on the way to his second victory in a row when he assumed the
lead at lap 163 of the 188-race. Dale Jarrett _ who was barely on
the lead lap and just in front of the leaders _ appeared to be in
position to help Martin hold off his Chevy-driving challengers.
</P>
<P>
   But that all fell apart when Jeremy Mayfield tried to pass
Martin on the outside on lap 183. Martin shifted right, leaving
Gordon an opportunity to drive on the apron of the track and into
the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was Earnhardt's teammate, Skinner, who gave
Gordon the aerodynamic push in the draft to go in front. Skinner
inadvertently bumped Gordon over the final few laps, but choose not
to knock Gordon out if the way _ even if it would've given Skinner
his first career victory on the circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy (Skinner) didn't do anything to spin me out,''
Gordon said. ``It was emotional for me to win. I know it hadn't
been forever, but it had been a while.''
</P>
<P>
   By Gordon's own standards, this season had been a major
disappointment. He posted only one top-five finish in the eight
races before Talladega.
</P>
<P>
   It was his 50th career victory and first under crew chief Robbie
Loomis, who has been with the team since January. Loomis appeared
to be crying after the race, but claimed his eyes were teary after
Gordon sprayed champagne in the winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's win extended NASCAR's record of having no repeat
winners to start a season to nine races.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the weeks before the bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade last May, NATO was under tremendous pressure to
escalate its war against Yugoslavia. The alliance's supreme
commander demanded 2,000 targets in Serbia _ a number some aides
considered arbitrary and too high for a country the size of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Having begun the war for Kosovo with too few targets and the
unrealistic hope of a quick victory, NATO had to scramble for new
targets. According to a NATO official, the pressure was so intense
that a cook and a motor pool worker with sufficiently high security
clearances were drafted into NATO's targeting office in Mons,
Belgium, to help with paperwork on potential missions.
</P>
<P>
   In this atmosphere the Central Intelligence Agency submitted its
first targeting proposal of the war. It was chosen by its
Counter-Proliferation Division, which had no particular expertise
in either the Balkans or in picking bombing targets. The target was
accepted, officials said, without further vetting by the military.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was the Chinese Embassy. It was described in a
secret document given to President Clinton for his approval as a
warehouse that was headquarters of Yugoslav army procurement. The
document, provided to The New York Times by a military officer,
included a satellite photograph, a casualty estimate and a
description of the site.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that turned out to be accurate was the casualty
estimate. The description of the target's relevance to the war was
misleading and, one senior intelligence official said, it should
have been apparent to any imagery expert that the building shown
did not look remotely like a warehouse or any Serbian government
building.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the bombing of the embassy, Chinese officials have
angrily accused the United States of a deliberate attack, while
American officials have insisted that it was an error.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to unravel what really happened, spurred in part
by articles in two European newspapers suggesting that the bombing
had been deliberate, The New York Times interviewed more than 30
officials in Washington and in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   While the investigation produced no evidence that the bombing of
the embassy had been a deliberate act, it provided a detailed
account of a broader set of missteps than the United States or NATO
have acknowledged and a wider circle of blame than the government's
explanation of a simple error of judgment by a few people at the
CIA.
</P>
<P>
   None of the people interviewed at the Pentagon, CIA, the State
Department and the military mapping agency, or at NATO offices in
Brussels, Mons, Vicenza, Italy and Paris said they had ever seen
any document discussing targeting of the embassy, nor any approval
given to do so. No one asserted that he or she knew that such an
order had been given.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing resulted from error piled upon incompetence piled
upon bad judgment in a variety of places _ from a frantic rush to
approve targets to questionable reliance on inexpert officers to an
inexplicable failure to consult the people who might have averted
disaster, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, they said, the bombing, if not intended, could
have been avoided at several points along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, 11 months after the fact, the director of central
intelligence, George J. Tenet, dismissed a mid-level officer who
put the X on what turned out to be the embassy. He also disciplined
six other employees, saying that agency officers ``at all levels of
responsibility'' contributed to the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has not conducted its own investigation but
administration officials say the matter is now closed. China
immediately rejected Tenet's discipline as inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have tried to explain how such a bizarre
chain of missteps could have taken place in intelligence and
military organizations that pride themselves on technological
prowess.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an error compounded by errors,'' said Undersecretary
of State Thomas R. Pickering, who had the job of explaining the
attack to the Chinese last year.
</P>
<P>
   Even some NATO and American officials acknowledge that they
cannot explain how or why so many mistakes occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials have been particularly suspicious since the
attack actually hit the defense attache's office and the embassy's
intelligence cell. But what neither they nor American officials
have disclosed is that the bombs, Pentagon officials said, were
actually targeted throughout the building. At least one and maybe
two of the bombs did not explode, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Had the strike gone as planned, the embassy would have been
demolished, the death and destruction far worse.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of those who accept the American assurances that the
bombing was accidental say they believe that blame has not yet been
shared by all of those who contributed to the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a systemic problem,'' said Rep. Porter J. Goss, R-Fla.,
who is chairman of the House's Permanent Select Committee on
Intelligence. ``It was not a problem just at the CIA. The fact of
the matter is that, at least at the Pentagon, somebody should stand
up and say it isn't just the agency's fault. To fire one person and
let off all the other agencies _ including the White House _ isn't
doing justice to justice.''

</P>
<P>
   NATO's initial plan was to bomb Yugoslavia for two nights, with
daytime pauses to allow President Slobodan Milosevic to agree to
NATO's demands that he withdraw Serbian forces from Kosovo. ``You
show them some lead _ boom! boom! _ and they'll fold. That was
definitely the prevailing opinion,'' a NATO officer in Belgium
said.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said they had always been prepared for a
longer war, but when the bombing began on March 24, NATO had only
219 targets for all of Serbia, focused on air defenses and military
communications.
</P>
<P>
   On the first night, 51 of those targets were struck; by the
third night, NATO had exhausted nearly half the original targets,
even as Serbian forces began expelling Kosovo's Albanians en masse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We woke up to the fact that Milosevic wasn't going to come out
on the front lawn with a white flag,'' the NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
   That realization touched off a scramble to find more targets.
While diplomats wrestled over whether to begin bombing more
politically sensitive targets, NATO's military commanders, who for
four decades had planned for war against the Soviet Union, found
themselves grossly unprepared for the task of choosing targets for
this kind of air campaign, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance had only two targeting centers, at the Joint
Analysis Center in Britain and at the Air Force's European
headquarters in Germany, both run by Americans.
</P>
<P>
   American targeters were producing 10 to 12 new targets a day,
while allied pilots were striking at twice that rate.
</P>
<P>
   By early April, Lt. Gen. Michael C. Short, the alliance's air
commander, kept raising the problem during NATO commanders' morning
video conferences. ``I'm running out of targets,'' he barked one
morning, according to an officer who was there.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley K. Clark, NATO's supreme commander, asked why he did
not have 4,000 targets on his desk, a NATO officer said. By
mid-April, Clark halved his demand, and the Air Force's
intelligence director for Europe, Brig. Gen. Neal T. Robinson,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   According to several officials, the goal became an obsession _
derided by targeting officials as ``T2K.'' Each morning, Robinson
briefed commanders on progress toward the goal. A month into the
campaign, they still had only 400 fixed targets, not counting tanks
and other weapons pilots were trying to hit in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clark declined to be interviewed for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Picking targets is normally a painstaking process, involving
reams of intelligence reports checked and rechecked against
satellite photographs. By mid-April, NATO reached out to any
military command with targeting expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Clark began to expand the scope of targets to include electrical
grids and commercial facilities like tobacco warehouses and the
Yugo automobile car factory. ``You've destroyed virtually every
military target of significance,'' an aide to Clark said. ``Now
what do you do? You start looking for other targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, by the end of the war, NATO had produced only 1,021
fixed targets. Of those, they bombed roughly 650.
</P>
<P>
   Some senior officials played down the rush for targets, saying
that as chaotic as the process was, there were ultimately very few
errors in targeting. But officials in Europe and Washington
maintained that as the pressure for targets intensified, proposals
were not as thoroughly reviewed as they could _ or should _ have
been.
</P>
<P>
   Among those was the one received by fax from the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA had provided information on scores of targets throughout
the war, but it had not previously been asked to propose its own,
Pickering and other officials said. Its history of picking targets
has been checkered. During the Persian Gulf war, it sent bombers
after a supposed intelligence bunker that proved to be an air raid
shelter filled with women and children.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has its own targeting cell, but it was the
Counter-Proliferation Division, a small office whose focus was the
spread of missiles and nuclear, chemical and biological weapons,
that proposed this target.
</P>
<P>
   Officers there saw the war as an opportunity to destroy the
headquarters of the federal Directorate for Supply and Procurement,
long a concern because of its suspected involvement in smuggling
missile parts to Libya and Iraq, intelligence officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The directorate is an arm of Yugoimport, an ostensibly private
corporation but one, which like most industry in Yugoslavia, is
closely linked to the ruling elite around Milosevic. Several
officials conceded that it had only a tangential relation to the
war's objectives; the targeting document showed experts estimated
only civilian casualties inside, not military casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had nothing to do with the war in the Balkans,'' an
official said. ``They were thinking, `While we're bombing anyway,
here's a target that should have a great benefit to the nation and
what we're doing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Other officials disputed that, citing intercepted radio
transmissions and agents' reports that the directorate was
organizing truckloads of spare surface-to-air missile parts, as
well as artillery and mortar shells, for the Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, when agency officials talked about the proposed target
in at least three meetings, they spent more time discussing whether
they could legally justify the attack under the international rules
of war than they did about the location of the headquarters itself.
</P>
<P>
   The division's officers had no specific expertise in targeting
or the Balkans, the officials said. None of those involved have
been identified, but officials said the officer who has received
the most blame _ and was dismissed by Tenet _ was a retired Army
officer who had been contracted to work in the division.
</P>
<P>
   He had been told to locate the directorate's headquarters and
set to work, according to a person familiar with his task. On April
9, he called the National Imagery and Mapping Agency in suburban
Washington requesting a map of Belgrade. Using it and two tourist
maps, the officer tried to pinpoint the headquarters, equipped only
with its address.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A senior defense official said the address _ 2 Bulevar Umetnosti
in the New Belgrade section of the Yugoslav capital _ came from a
letter intercepted by intelligence officials, though the address
was easily available, including from the directorate's internet
site.
</P>
<P>
   The NIMA map, produced in 1997, shows major buildings and
geographic features. It does not specify street addresses, but it
identifies major landmarks. It was designed, a senior intelligence
official said, for ground operations, like the evacuation of
personnel from the American embassy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the landmarks on the map is the headquarters of
Milosevic's Serbian Socialist Party, which is on a parallel street,
Milentija Popovica, and which NATO bombed during the war. Knowing
that address, those of two hotels on the same street and that of
the Slovak Embassy on Bulevar Umetnosti, the officer used a
technique called ``resection and intersection'' to locate what he
thought was the headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The method involves finding addresses on parallel streets and
drawing lines to the targeted street on the presumption that
numbering schemes are uniform. It is used for generally locating
landmarks in a city for such things as search and rescue missions.
``To target based on that is incomprehensible,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   Having chosen what he thought was the directorate, the officer
called NIMA on April 12 or 13 and asked for satellite images of the
site, which he received on the 14th, officials said. At that point
a NIMA analyst assigned the building a number _ 0251WA0017 _ from
the military's ``bombing encyclopedia,'' a worldwide compendium of
potential targets and other landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   According to the officials interviewed, the satellite images did
not raise concerns. When Pickering, the Undersecretary of State,
briefed the Chinese about the bombing last summer, he said there
were no seals or flags that would identify it as a diplomatic
compound. An incredulous Chinese official asked why America's
satellites did not see it was an embassy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a senior intelligence official said, satellite images
contained clues that should at least have prompted questions _ not
necessarily that it was the embassy, but rather about whether it
was the headquarters of a Yugoslav arms agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look like an office building,'' the official said.
``It looks like a hotel. It's too nice a place. Given all the space
around it, I didn't see external fencing that I would expect from a
government facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the mistake, according to the officials, was the
initiative taken by the officer who located the target. He produced
what one official called a ``superficially perfect'' proposal by
downloading from the military's secure intranet a targeting form
and filling it out _ complete with the ``bombing encyclopedia''
number, as well as eight-digit longitudinal and latitudinal
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Impressively packaged, the proposal prompted no questions. The
CIA's Assistant Director of Intelligence for Military Support,
Brig. Gen. Roderick J. Isler, ultimately approved it, and it
arrived at the European Command and the Joint Chiefs of Staff
appearing to be a more advanced proposal than it was, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This target came with an aura of authority because it came
from the CIA,'' said John J. Hamre, who recently stepped down as
Deputy Secretary of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   Hamre said the Joint Chiefs never conducted a thorough review of
the target. The reasons for this have never been made clear.
Instead the joint staff received two proposals for the same target,
one from the CIA and another from European Command, which did not
note it originally came from the agency, and approved it. ``They
got false confirmation,'' an intelligence official said.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials said their officers never intended the target
to be viewed by the Pentagon as a complete proposal, but simply as
a nomination. Instead, as one NATO officer put it, ``it went
through like a cog on an assembly line.''
</P>
<P>
   By April 28, 10 days before the bombing, planners in Europe had
assigned the target, like every one in the war, a sequential
number. It was No. 493, and the essential information about the
target was boiled down to a single document to be presented to
President Clinton and other NATO political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The secret document identified the target as ``Belgrade
Warehouse 1,'' but under a heading called ``linkage'' called it the
``HQ for the Federal Directorate Supply and Procurement.'' The
objective was to ``destroy warehouse and contents,'' which it went
on to say would undercut the ability of the Yugoslav army and
Serbian police forces to receive new supplies.
</P>
<P>
   It also classified the possibility for collateral damage as
``tier 3 high,'' which an official said referred to the likelihood
of the impact of the bombs sending shards of glass flying
considerable distances. That indicated analysts were able to
distinguish the embassy's marble and glass structure. The
directorate's headquarters was made of white stone.
</P>
<P>
   Three red triangles on the image depict the points at which the
bombs were to strike. The document also estimated that casualties
would range from three to seven civilians, presumably those working
inside, while the estimate for unintended civilian casualties,
which also included those who might happen by at the time, ranged
from 25 to 50.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing, in fact, killed three and wounded at least 20.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet has said that the CIA proposed only one target during the
war. Actually, the agency proposed two or three more, but after the
embassy bombing, Pentagon officials refused to carry them out.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, despite its supposed military value, NATO never did
attack the intended target.
</P>
<P>
   As with most of attacks during the war, especially the strikes
in Belgrade, planning and execution were done by Americans. In
raids involving the stealthy B-2 bombers and F-117 fighters, many
details about the attacks were classified as ``U.S. only,'' mainly
for fear of revealing secrets about those aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, some allies questioned the practice. The French
Ministry of Defense's report on the war last November complained of
military operations ``conducted by the United States outside the
strict NATO framework and procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior NATO diplomat said the United States attacked 75 to 80
targets in this way. The Chinese Embassy was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   The control of information limited the number of allied officers
who might have been able to notice the targeting error.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Jean-Pierre Kelche, who as chief of the Defense Staff is
France's top military officer, said that in spite of the
restrictions on the military operations, all of the specific
targets were reviewed by the political and military leaders of the
major allies, including Prime Minister Jacques Chirac of France and
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was supposed to be an arms storage facility,'' Kelche said
in an interview in Paris. ``It's clear the nature of that target
did not ceate any problems for me.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the unilateral American operations were a political
problem, but not an operational one. He added, however, that the
militaries of each country were responsible for reviewing those
targets its forces were scheduled to strike.
</P>
<P>
   When Tenet dismissed the officer blamed for targeting and
disciplined six others, he singled out another for praise. That
officer, also not identified, raised questions about the target,
Tenet said. In the days before the bombing, he called analysts at
NIMA and at the NATO headquarters in Naples to express doubts,
Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
   Memories of his objections vary, and other intelligence
officials raised questions about them. The officer, who once worked
in the same proliferation office involved in targeting the embassy,
now works in the Technical Management Office, an operation involved
in highly classified operations, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   He had no authority to review targets, or even know what they
were, but heard informally that the directorate was being targeted,
officials said, adding that he then called the imagery analyst at
NIMA. On that day, April 29, he told the analyst that he had
recently spoken to a source who confirmed the directorate's actual
location, about 1,000 yards south of the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, a senior intelligence official said, the NIMA
analyst could have withdrawn the target's ``bombing encyclopedia''
number or alerted more senior officials. Instead, he promised to
call the officer who had identified the target in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The NIMA analyst tried unsuccessfully to arrange a meeting
between the two agency officers, who did not know each other,
officials said. On May 3, the analyst produced six more images of
the building and its surroundings, which confirmed to the skeptical
officer that the target was not the directorate, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, he raised his concerns with military officers in
Naples, Italy, but he did not make his questions official or sound
grave enough to remove the target from the list, the officials
said. Then, he left work for three days to attend a training
session.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned, on May 7, he learned _ again informally _ that
the target was on that night's list. He called Naples a second
time, through back channels, but spoke to a different officer, who
informed him the B-2 was already on its way from its base in
Missouri, according to officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't really raise the panic you think it would have,'' a
defense official said.
</P>
<P>
   While Tenet commended the officer's efforts, another senior
agency official was critical of the fact that the officer _ perhaps
out of fear that he was acting beyond his responsibilities _ had
never voiced doubts to the assistant director of intelligence for
military support, who was in a position to have put a hold
instantly on the target.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, The Observer of London, in conjunction with
Politiken, a Danish newspaper, published articles suggesting that
the bombing was deliberate. Their stories said that the strike had
been intended to silence transmitters at the embassy being used by
the Yugoslav armed forces or, later, by the Serbian paramilitary
leader known as Arkan.
</P>
<P>
   All of the officials interviewed by the Times said they knew of
no evidence to support the assertion, and none has been produced.
They said there was also no evidence that the Chinese had in any
way aided the Serbian war effort, though one NATO diplomat said it
was impossible to rule out the possibility that the Chinese shared
information with the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Officials rejected the idea that the Chinese Embassy was being
used for rebroadcasting and said they did not suspect during the
war that it was doing that. Kelche said photographs taken after the
strike showed ordinary antenna on its roof, not microwave dishes
that would have been used in military communications.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that after the bombing they did learn a great
deal about the embassy's intelligence operations, including the
background of the three Chinese journalists who were killed and who
American officials say were in fact intelligence agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is _ or was _ considered the major collection platform for
Europe,'' a senior defense official said. ``One could say it was a
silver lining to the bombing, but it was not deliberate.''
</P>
<P>
   The European newspapers also said there had been a list of
targets ruled off limits for air strikes that included the Chinese
Embassy, at its actual address, not the mistaken one and that the
embassy at some point was removed from the list.
</P>
<P>
   According to the officials interviewed by The Times, American
commanders in Europe did maintain such a list of buildings, like
hospitals, churches and embassies. The Chinese Embassy was on that
list, officials said, but at its old address and was not removed.
They said the embassy was also listed at the wrong address on a
similar list in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Roy W. Krieger, a lawyer who represents one of the supervisors
who was reprimanded by Tenet, said neither his client nor any of
the others intended to bomb the embassy. ``No sinister conspiracy
exists, only a systemic failure masquerading as a conspiracy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He criticized the punishment of the CIA officials alone, even
though the NIMA map contained a critical error and none of the
Pentagon's data bases included information on the embassy's actual
location.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CIA's action is even more troubling in the face of the
refusal of the Department of Defense to even acknowledge its
failures contributing to this tragic event,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the bombing, Hamre and the vice chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff at the time, Gen. Joseph W. Ralston, conducted the
Pentagon's review of the targeting, but it was never made public.
Officials from the Joint Chiefs of Staff refused repeated requests
to be interviewed, as did Air Force commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Goss, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, said
members of Congress had intensely questioned officials. In the end,
he said he was confident in their assurances it had not been a
deliberate strike.
</P>
<P>
   He paused, then added, ``unless some people are lying to me.''

THE GUGGENHEIM'S NEW VISION IS AN ICEBREAKER OF A DESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
 MUSEUM-2TAKES-NYT  (Architectural Appraisal) 
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ How many ways can you say ``Wow''? In the weeks ahead
New Yorkers will certainly find more articulate words to describe
Frank O. Gehry's design for a museum that the Solomon R. Guggenheim
Foundation hopes to build along the East River in Lower Manhattan.
Silence would be eloquent, too. But only for the repressed.
Otherwise, this is the moment to look for noisemakers left over
from New Year's Eve and give them one more toot. Here comes
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Models of the design by Gehry, the architect of the acclaimed
Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, will be presented in ``Project
for a New Guggenheim Museum in New York City,'' which opens on
Wednesday at the Guggenheim's main building on Fifth Avenue at 89th
Street, designed in 1959 by Frank Lloyd Wright. The featured
attraction is a large model, 12 feet long and 5 feet high, which
displays the design in close-up detail. Other models present the
project as it would appear in the Lower Manhattan cityscape, though
there is no guarantee it will ever be built. The proposed site,
near the foot of Wall Street, is occupied by three piers scheduled
for development by the New York City Economic Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Even as a purely speculative idea, however, this museum project
performs an important civic service. A steel-plated vessel,
floating atop a vast outdoor skating rink, this is an icebreaker of
a design, a plan for crunching through rigid streetscapes and
frozen minds. And it is a test of the city's willingness to think
big.
</P>
<P>
   Will it get built? The question is a waste of energy. Like other
sideshows that have kept New York in denial about the mediocrity of
the buildings it puts up, the feasibility question distracts from
the challenge presented by the design. This is the top form
architecture comes in these days. Want some?
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Krens, the director of the Guggenheim Museum, said that
the institution is committed to building another museum in
Manhattan. The Fifth Avenue building is too small to display more
than a fraction of the museum's permanent collection, which also
includes examples of large-scale contemporary art. Krens envisions
an arrangement in which the Wright building would display work from
the late 19th century to 1945 while the downtown building would
present art from 1945 to the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``Project for a New Guggenheim Museum in New York City''
presents the record of a creative process leading to the birth of
an idea. If this one doesn't fly, we can count on Krens to have
others. In 1998 he set his eye on another waterfront site, on the
Hudson River. Local opposition helped deflate that dream and it
could shatter this one, too. Financial and government support are
also hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Lower Manhattan is well stocked with cherished landmarks like
the Brooklyn Bridge, the World Trade Center, the Woolworth
Building, Trinity Church and 70 Pine Street. But it has been some
time since the district's architecture has risen to their iconic
level. One of the charms of Gehry's design is that it would recast
mediocre towers in the supporting roles for which they are better
suited.
</P>
<P>
   If New York is a perpetual gift to the future, this design is
its bow: a flourish of titanium ribbons ( Gehry calls them
wrappers) curled around half a million square feet of gallery
space. The composition is roughly triangular, a pediment on square
columns. The triangle is anchored at the northern and southern
corners by two low-rise structures of boxy silhouette. The southern
structure houses a terminal for a ferry that would take visitors to
a sculpture garden on Governors Island. The northern structure
contains a 1,200-seat theater.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six galleries, ranging from 1,300 to 20,000 square feet,
would be housed on three levels within the cloudlike tangle of
ribbon and a 450-foot tower rising above it. The galleries would
serve various uses: in addition to the permanent collection and
temporary shows, they would present exhibitions for three
departments: education, architecture and design, and art and
technology. As at the Guggenheim in Bilbao, the previous
collaboration between Krens and Gehry, the museum's major space
would be an atrium bathed in natural light; 26,000 square feet of
gallery space would overlook the atrium's well. Escalators, forming
a dramatic diagonal at the base of the space, would move visitors
up from the open areas beneath the museum into the building's
heart.
</P>
<P>
   Six massive square columns, steel and concrete superpylons,
would hold the mass aloft. Gardens, bridges, a waterside promenade
and other public spaces would occupy petal-shaped platforms
extending into the river. The free-form rink, beneath the museum's
soaring underside, would be equipped with ``Knife Ship I,'' a
kinetic sculpture by Claes Oldenburg that was the focus of a
performance piece created by Gehry, Oldenburg and Coosje van
Bruggen for the 1985 Venice Biennale.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the models could give you whiplash. In New York
architects have spent the last two decades viewing the present
through a rearview mirror, as if the city came to a halt in the Art
Deco era.
</P>
<P>
   As with the Bilbao Guggenheim, Gehry shows that one of the
purest ways to honor context is to play against it. Many have seen
the Manhattan skyline as a geological formation of cliffs, peaks
and canyons. Gehry treats the site as a natural wonder, a spot
where mountains cascade into the sea. He has raised the horizon of
the water, in waves that lap against the base of the cliffs, and
pulled the sky down to the canyons, with changing light reflected
in the museum's wavy metal surface. Expanses of glass, articulated
with diagonal mullions, splash upward like jets of water formed by
a Manhattan-bound meteor's narrow miss.

 NEW YORK: narrow miss.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the tower, the vertical dimension of the skyline
reverberates into the foreground. The tower's leaning silhouette
and flaring top talk back to the World Trade Center's scaleless,
impersonal thrust. Some architects, who still regard the Trade
Center as an aesthetic abomination, have championed a revival of
building crowns, by which they mean paperweights blown up to
skyscraper scale. Here is another way to top a tower. Rip off roof.
Cut jaggedly above penthouse. Let curtain walls droop. Instead of
hiding structural spines behind marble and steel, as Mies van der
Rohe did with the Seagram Building, just let them hang out there in
the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Ordered complexity, not chaos, is the fundamental principle of
this work. We should be used to this by now. It has been 35 years
since Robert Venturi introduced the concepts of complexity and
contradiction as an alternative to the unified simplicity of the
International Style. Gehry's work, like Venturi's and Denise Scott
Brown's, aims for the maximum complexity that can be transmitted
through habitable space.
</P>
<P>
   The wrappers are the most eye-catching element of the Guggenheim
design, but it would be a mistake to think the project's importance
rests entirely on Gehry's ability to sculpture arresting shapes.
What matters here is the physiognomy of the shapes.
</P>
<P>
   Intersubjectivity _ the idea that multiple perspectives can
render a truth _ is the central concept governing this and other
projects that Gehry has designed for the last 25 years. It is also
the idea that many people find hardest to take. We still look to
architecture to embody some ideal of external authority: history,
science, nature and religion, to name a few. This Gehry declines to
provide. Though he makes fleeting formal allusions to other times,
other buildings, these images are mutable. They rise to the surface
and sink back. Tell me what you see and I will tell you _ with wild
inaccuracy, no doubt _ who you are.
</P>
<P>
   Scale and relationship to context are two of the Rorschach tests
this project must pass in the eye of the beholder. But the
Guggenheim faces even bigger obstacles. Some will object that the
design looks too much like Bilbao; New York, ever mindful of its
uniqueness, deserves better than a remake of something designed for
provincial Spain. Some will not want to invest hope in a project
that has yet to obtain the required permits and financial and
government support.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't worry too much about the design's uniqueness. To
philistines all modern glass towers are identical. When you've seen
one titanium wrapper, you've seen 'em all. A model of the Bilbao
museum, included in the exhibition, will enable viewers to compare
the designs. But carping about formal similarity may just be part
of the Nimby syndrome. Architecture is fine for Bilbao, but we
don't want it here.
</P>
<P>
   Since the demolition of Pennsylvania Station, the troops can be
counted on to protest tinkering with a lamppost. We've only begun
to awaken to the loss of heritage that occurs when a city is frozen
in time.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Delegates looked bleary-eyed after their predawn
wake-up calls, and a handful arrived several hours late. But the
member nations of the International Monetary Fund achieved a major
breakthrough Sunday: They met.
</P>
<P>
   That was perhaps the one definitive accomplishment the world
finance ministers could announce after a full day of meetings to
discuss global financial stability and to set the course for the
monetary fund. After globalization-wary protesters briefly shut
down world trade talks in Seattle last year and threatened to do
the same to finance ministers gathered in Washington Sunday, the
simple fact of the meeting was presented as a triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meeting went on as normal,'' announced Gordon Brown,
Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, the chairman of the fund's
steering committee. ``It started on time and it was completed in a
normal way.'' That included a relaxed lunch in the IMF's soaring
marble and glass atrium, where formally attired waiters served
jumbo shrimp and offered a selection of red and white wines.
</P>
<P>
   The shouts of protesters could not be heard inside the
earth-tone conference rooms of the fund's downtown Washington
headquarters. But participants said the varied complaints of the
fund's many critics in Congress, in academia and on the streets
resonated in many of the policy proposals discussed during the
sessions, including those for streamlined lending procedures and
expedited debt relief for poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   A carefully worded day-end communique gave credit to outside
critics for stoking a public debate about the future of the fund.
And many of the finance ministers stressed that they had heard the
protesters' messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is going through a period of profound change, and
that has made for debate here and some debate outside,'' said Paul
Martin, Canada's finance minister. ``Ultimately our aims are the
same,'' he said, adding that both parties want to figure out how
best to deal with poverty.
</P>
<P>
   There appeared to be modest progress on a range of issues
confronting the fund, some of which are high on the agenda of
outside critics. The finance ministers asked the fund's managers to
continue a review of their lending programs with an eye to
eliminating some. The fund was also told to review whether to use
variable pricing on some loan programs so as to discourage
repeated, long-term borrowing. Those proposals are favored by the
United States and some members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But some poor and middle-income countries expressed strong
reservations about proposals that would make it more difficult for
them to obtain loans or force them to pay the loans back faster.
Their opposition highlighted how difficult it is to institute
changes quickly at the fund, which consists of 182-member nations,
though its board is effectively controlled by the United States and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find some of these proposals unacceptable and have serious
concerns about them,'' said German Suarez, who chairs a coalition
of developing countries known as the Group of 24. He was referring
primarily to a proposal put forward by a congressional commission
that studied ways of changing the IMF and the World Bank, its
sister lending agency.
</P>
<P>
   The finance ministers' communique ruled out the possibility of
completely eliminating the fund's long-term lending programs and
expressed strong support for the fund's involvement in working to
reduce poverty. The congressional panel, known as the Meltzer
Commission, had urged that the fund cease both types of lending.
</P>
<P>
   On debt relief, finance ministers reiterated their longstanding
pledge to free the world's poorest countries, including many in
Africa, of their crushing foreign-debt burdens. One major problem
is that some legislatures around the world, most notably Congress,
so far have failed to allot all the necessary funds to allow the
fund and the World Bank to forgive past loans.
</P>
<P>
   Jubilee 2000, a religious coalition, has called for stepping up
the effort and for total forgiveness of debt owed by the world's 40
poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the discussions Sunday said the ministers also
considered proposals that would make it easier for the poorest
countries to qualify for debt relief and to put the plans into
effect faster once they do.
</P>
<P>
   Of 27 nations considered under a debt-relief program approved in
Cologne, Germany last summer, only four have begun a qualification
process and just one, Uganda, has actually had some debt forgiven.
Many others have faced difficulties proving to the fund and the
bank that they have the good governance and adequate programs in
place to meet the criteria for debt forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Most finance ministers, traveling in police-escorted bus
convoys, had little trouble winding their way through barricades to
the fund's headquarters. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, the
top-ranking American official at the meetings, was whisked by
limousine from his office a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   But the protests made life difficult for some officials. The
Japanese delegation, fearing a tardy arrival, left its quarters at
the Madison Hotel a few blocks from the IMF at 4:30 a.m., arriving
a short time later and waiting more than three hours for the start
of the formal proceedings, a Japanese official said.
</P>
<P>
   The French finance minister, Laurent Fabius, who had told IMF
and World Bank staff members that he wanted to conduct a dialogue
with demonstrators during his stay, got full exposure. Protesters
surrounded his limousine just before the 8 a.m. start of the
morning session, forcing him to turn back. Fabius then waited for
nearly six hours at a luxury hotel for bus transport through the
barricades, arriving only at the conclusion of lunch.

SPORTS COLUMN: VALENTINE REVISITING MISTAKES OF MARTIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The similarity is inescapable. Call them birds of a
feather or two of a kind, two peas in a pod, psychological twins.
Billy Martin was and Bobby Valentine is one of the most tactically
accomplished managers in baseball. Both, however, have had damaging
ways of undermining their talent. Martin did it and Valentine does
it with his mouth. For Martin, it was ingesting alcohol; for
Valentine, it is disgorging words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby's problem is he's a very good tactical manager,'' a
former teammate of the New York Mets' manager said Sunday, ``but
the other stuff overshadows that. He can't not do it. He's always
been like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine believes he is the smartest manager in the game.
Whether or not he is, he cannot allow his managerial moves to speak
for themselves. At seemingly every opportunity, he has to let
everyone know that he is the smartest manager in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   He also has to make sure at least some people _ usually selected
reporters covering the team he's managing _ know where he differs
with the front office. He has long done it. In case something goes
wrong, he wants those people to know where the blame lies,
certainly not with him.
</P>
<P>
   The manager's latest oral indiscretion came when he appeared
before a group of graduate students last Wednesday and apparently
expressed disagreement with some of the moves made last winter by
the Mets' general manager, Steve Phillips. Valentine's purported
comments wound up on the Internet and sent him another giant step
down the path that Martin often took with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine's comments also caught the attention of Yankee Manager
Joe Torre, who was dismissed earlier in his managerial career not
for a poor choice of words but for poor collections of players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see this whole Bobby Valentine thing,'' Torre said
Sunday before the Yankees beat Kansas City, 8-4, at Yankee Stadium.
``I've made remarks about my players at different places that I've
spoken. I've made fun of my players. But I've made fun of my
players to my players, nothing that they haven't heard from me
first-hand. But there's no question you have to be aware of what
you're saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre said he was reluctant to talk about anybody even if he was
having lunch or dinner with someone, ``much less speaking to a
group of people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't want someone to have anything,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   That would be good advice for Valentine, if he ever felt he
needed advice. People used to tell Billy Martin to reduce his
alcohol intake. Knowing his five-time manager wouldn't follow that
advice, George Steinbrenner, both a benefactor and a manipulator of
Martin, tried to get him to drink privately. That way, at least, he
could avoid the fights that too often erupted in bars that Billy
visited.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin didn't take his drinking private any more than
Valentine has kept his thoughts to himself. By now, the Mets
probably have enough of a case to send Valentine on his way, if
they wanted to take that step. They obviously don't, not yet
anyway. If they have as good a team as they think they have _ not
that the team's play has supported that view _ they wouldn't want
to make a change now and disrupt what they think they have. On the
other hand, Valentine is doing a good job of that by himself.
</P>
<P>
   He did a good job of it last September, too, doing a magazine
interview that appeared just as the Mets were scrambling to reach
the playoffs. That was the interview in which he said that he had
five losers in the clubhouse and that other managers feared
appearing on a panel with him because they would be exposed. He
didn't mean to chickenpox.
</P>
<P>
   Martin never felt the need to put down other managers; he harmed
only himself. Valentine is a double threat.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine hasn't denied making the comments that were attributed
to him from last Wednesday at the Wharton School of Business. He
could have denied them and let his word stand against any student
who would have said differently. But he apparently knew that his
show was videotaped, and if the tape were to surface, he could have
been shown to have been lying.
</P>
<P>
   It was lying that did Martin in the first time of the four times
Steinbrenner fired him. That occurred after Martin's fight with a
marshmallow salesman in a Minnesota hotel after the 1979 season. He
wasn't fired for fighting but for telling Steinbrenner the fight
never happened. The owner found out otherwise. The Mets, if they
had wanted, presumably could have located the smoking tape.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, Valentine would have been wiser to stage a
different act for his Wharton audience. Like his negative views
about the front office, this one would have been a repeat, but it
would have been visual, not oral. He could have done a mime act,
donning the fake mustache and glasses he used to reappear within
sight of a television camera after he had been ejected from a game
last season.

SPORTS COLUMN: JOHN MCMULLEN'S LAST TIME AROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ During a Devils game, John McMullen sits
in the back row of the owner's suite at midice. Quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not very vocal,'' he said, ``unless somebody stands up in
front of me; then I ask them to sit down.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the Devils' sale to YankeeNets for $175 million due to
be completed in July, this is the 81-year-old McMullen's last time
around in that owner's suite. He will be ensconced there only as
long as the Devils remain alive in these Stanley Cup playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a chance to win the cup again,'' he was saying
before Sunday night's game with the Florida Panthers. ``I think we
corrected the slump.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the slump. Two months ago the Devils were atop the Eastern
Conference standing in the National Hockey League, but they
finished the season in a 9-14-2 tailspin that dropped them into the
fourth-seeded spot in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   During that slump, while still in first place, the Devils
suddenly discharged Robbie Ftorek as coach and promoted Larry
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I concurred,'' McMullen said, alluding to Lou Lamoriello's
decision to change coaches. ``I felt Robbie was losing control of
the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamoriello, the Devils' president and general manager, also made
two significant trades that brought in the sharpshooter Alexander
Mogilny and defenseman Vladimir Malakhov.
</P>
<P>
   ``The slump probably cost us the first seed,'' McMullen said,
``but we've been the first seed and it didn't do us any good.''
</P>
<P>
   In each of the past two years, the top-seeded Devils were
embarrassed and eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by
their eighth-seeded opponent _ the Ottawa Senators two years ago,
the Pittsburgh Penguins last year. ``Last year was devastating,''
McMullen said.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter what the Devils do or don't do in these playoffs,
they are now considered one of the NHL's premier franchises. Over
the 18 seasons since McMullen purchased the Colorado Rockies and
transplanted that franchise in the Meadowlands, where the Empire
State Building can be seen even on a cloudy night, the Devils have
succeeded despite the Rangers' existence on the other side of the
Lincoln Tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rangers,'' McMullen said, ``are in the most dominant
position of any New York team from the standpoint of fan base and
adoration. I've had to live in their shadow all this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Not really. On the ice, if not on the books, the Devils have
towered over the Rangers in the standing in six of the last eight
seasons, while producing the same number of Stanley Cup
championships, one _ in 1995 for the Devils after the Rangers ended
their 54-year famine in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should've won it in 1994, too,'' McMullen said. ``If we had
won that seventh game in overtime with the Rangers in the
conference final, we would have won the cup that year.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Rangers, the Devils, dollar for dollar, have been one
of the NHL's most cost-efficient teams. With a $37.6 million
payroll, the Devils are a bargain, especially when compared with
the Rangers' wasteful $61.2 million payroll for a team that not
only didn't make the playoffs but also performed in the last few
weeks as if it didn't care if it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our legacy,'' McMullen said, ``is the proliferation of
junior hockey in New Jersey. I think more kids under 15 can name
more Devils players than they can any other professional team in
this area. Just look at all the Devils jerseys you see kids
wearing. That's why I never wanted a third jersey. I want those
kids to wear their older brother's Devils jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   But in July, the Devils' era under McMullen's ownership will be
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to sell the team; I was in a dead end,'' he said. ``You
have to have your own arena. I was willing to build one in Hoboken
just for the Devils, but the state wouldn't let me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christine Todd Whitman refused to grant McMullen the air
rights over the train shed there. Eventually, the Devils are
expected to join the Nets in YankeeNets' proposed arena in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about the Devils' future,'' McMullen said. ``The
YankeeNets is going to be a very businesslike deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the YankeeNets organization apparently wants to keep
Lamoriello in charge, his contract expires with the July sale. He
will be available to join the front office of other NHL teams,
possibly the Rangers. And with YankeeNets as the Devils' landlord,
George Steinbrenner will surely be involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can he not be?'' John McMullen said. ``George is George.''

FOR METS AND PIRATES, IT WAS A LONG AND UGLY AFTERNOON 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Rick Reed does not want to be a doomsayer, but he
does not see any way Bobby J. Jones can recover quickly from the
calf strain he suffered Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Jones faced only two Pirates in the Mets' 12-9 victory, hitting
the first batter _ almost certainly as retaliation for the Pirates'
hitting the Mets' leadoff man, Rickey Henderson _ and allowing a
single to the next. As he left the mound to back up third, he felt
the muscle pull, and when he stopped limping, he felt a burning
sensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to have to rest it, treat it and then start doing
exercises to strengthen the area again,'' said Reed, who missed
three weeks with a similar injury last year. ``Right now, he can't
walk on it, and it's going to be a while, I'm sure, before he can.
It's not fun. It's going to be a long, long process, I'm sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The team doctor will evaluate Jones on Monday. The trainer Fred
Hina said there was no chance that Jones, who left Three Rivers
Stadium on crutches, could make his scheduled start on Saturday.
Manager Bobby Valentine was considering several pitchers to replace
him, with Pat Mahomes a logical choice, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' injury was not the first ugly play in a game that third
baseman Robin Ventura compared to a boxing match. ``They're more
like rounds than they are innings _ whoever's the last man
standing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura had three hits, including a home run, and six runs
batted in. He raised his batting average 98 points in this series
by getting 7 hits in 15 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Leading off the game, Henderson was hit on the right thumb by a
95-mile-an-hour fastball from the Pirates' Kris Benson. He ran the
bases _ being thrown out advancing from second to third on a
grounder to shortstop _ but left the game with a bruise under his
fingernail. He said after the game that he expected to play on
Tuesday, when the Mets return home against Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   A three-run homer by Ventura gave Jones a 3-0 lead, but Jones
put himself in trouble by plunking the Pirates' leadoff man, Jason
Kendall, with an 0-2 pitch. Jones would not respond when asked if
he hit Kendall on purpose, but it seemed clear he was upholding an
unwritten code of conduct: if our leadoff man goes down, so will
yours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make of it what you want, I guess,'' Jones said. ``I think he
kind of threw his elbow in front of it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones hurt himself when Pat Meares singled Kendall to third, and
Kendall scored when Brian Giles doubled on the first pitch from the
reliever Mahomes. Mahomes, who earned the victory, said he did not
warm up properly and allowed six hits and four walks in four
innings. The Pirates scored four in the first, and a messy game had
begun.
</P>
<P>
   --Because of two-out errors, scoreless innings became three-run
innings for both the Mets (in the first) and the Pirates (in the
third).
</P>
<P>
   --It took the teams 1 hour 57 minutes to play four innings; they
played nine in the same time on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   --The first six pitchers in the game each allowed at least two
runs.
</P>
<P>
   --Mets infielders made three errors, two by third baseman
Ventura, who bobbled a grounder and threw one away, and one by
shortstop Rey Ordonez, who made a wild throw after ranging far to
his right to backhand a grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Both those players won Gold Gloves last season, when the Mets
had only one game in which their infielders made two errors. This
season, they have had two. Ordonez has four errors, as many as he
had last season, Ventura and first baseman Todd Zeile have three,
and Valentine acknowledged that the Mets have not found a rhythm
defensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we had the best infield,'' said second baseman
Edgardo Alfonzo, who has one error. ``I think we still have it.
Things aren't going well for us, but those are the best two guys on
the team, and that's going to happen. We're all human.''
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Derek Bell saved the Mets in the fourth inning
when he backpedaled, leaped and caught a fly ball by Aramis Ramirez
with a man on second to end the fourth. Bell played exceptionally
in the field and at the plate on this six-game trip, and he has 12
hits in 24 at-bats since correcting a flaw in his timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a matter of a little thing we found out I was
doing wrong,'' Bell said. ``I wouldn't call it a streak. I righted
my ship.'' &QL;

KENYANS SET TO TAKE LAURELS AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Is there a Heartbreak Hill in Nairobi? Maybe the
Hancock folks could ship the whole men's race over there and save
on the jet lag.
</P>
<P>
   What we have here is the Kenyan intramural championships,
masquerading as the Boston Athletic Association Marathon. Unless
they miss their wake-up calls this morning, either Joseph Chebet,
or Moses Tanui, or Ondoro Osoro, or one of their running mates will
win the laurel wreath for the 10th straight time. No country has
managed that since the United States between 1916-1925, when a
``foreigner'' meant someone from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, it'll be tougher than ever to crack the Kenyan
hegemony this time, since they're using the 104th running as their
selection race for Sydney. ``Every athlete is eyeing the
Olympics,'' said the 34-year-old Tanui, who'll be chasing his third
title in five years. ``So I think the race will be very
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The top two Kenyans here will earn tickets Down Under. History
and form say it'll be Tanui and the 29-year-old Chebet, the
defending champion. But half a dozen of their countrymen, who've
all done marathons in less than 2 minutes 9 seconds, also have a
shot _ the 32-year-old Osoro (who scratched with an injury last
year), 31-yearold John Kagwe (a two-time New York champion),
23-year-old Jackson Kabiga, 25-year-old Philip Tarus, 28-year-old
Julius Ruto, and 33-year-old Elijah Lagat.
</P>
<P>
   Most years, they would cover the hills and flats as a pack,
playing cat-and-mouse with rival soloists. Not this time. ``We
normally run as a team,'' said Tanui. ``That is the Kenyan way.
Then later, someone who is very strong will win. We will not run
that way this year.''
</P>
<P>
   That gives hope to the rest of the world _ except to the
Americans, whose top people are bypassing the race in favor of next
month's Olympic Trials in Pittsburgh. But top contenders, such as
Ecuador's Silvio Guerra (last year's runner-up), Ethiopia's
Gezahenge Abera, and South Africa's Abner Chipu (fourth last year)
and Makhosonke Fika, figure they may have a shot to slip through
while the Kenyans are jockeying with each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good because I have a bunch of Africans who will be
pushing the race, so I don't have to worry about that,'' said the
31-year-old Guerra, who led last year's race for six miles before
Chebet ran him down in Brookline. ``And they will have the pressure
to qualify for the Olympics. I have already qualified, so I don't
have the pressure to get on the team. I just can go for the win.''
</P>
<P>
   Guerra went for the win last year, breaking out of the pack
after 16 miles, and discovered the dubious pleasure of having the
Kenyans nipping at his heels through the Newton hills. ``That was
the race I took,'' he said. ``At some point, I thought I could win
the race. I didn't, but I was very happy with second place.''
</P>
<P>
   Chebet had come in second to Tanui by three seconds in 1998
after leading, and it haunted him. Last year, he broke through, and
returned home a minor god. ``I was very famous,'' Chebet said.
``When I got back to Kenya, everybody wanted to see me. It changed
my life drastically.''
</P>
<P>
   Five Kenyans have won the Hopkinton-to-Boston pilgrimage _
Ibrahim Hussein (three times), Cosmas Ndeti (three times), Tanui
(twice), Chebet, and Lameck Aguta. In 1996, the last Olympic year,
they swept the first five places and seven of the top eight.
</P>
<P>
   The last non-Kenyan to win was Italy's Gelindo Bordin a decade
ago. That's no coincidence. The Marathon may be Boston's heirloom,
but it's on permanent loan to Nairobi. ``It is our tradition, like
in world cross-country,'' said Tanui. ``When you win once, you want
to maintain the tradition.''

ENTREPRENEUR PUSHES PLAN TO FIX CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDWOOD CITY, Calif. _ In Timothy Draper's world, change occurs
at a breakneck pace. A billionaire venture capitalist, he finances
Internet start-ups that grow from business plan to public company
in mere months. He came up with the concept of ``viral marketing,''
instantaneously circulating advertisements by e-mail the world
over.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, the pace is known as Internet time. So it is
no surprise that Draper wants to transform overnight an institution
that has long been dragged down by myriad problems _ California's
school system.
</P>
<P>
   Draper has spent $2 million to try to get the United States'
most far-reaching school-voucher plan onto the November ballot.
Under it, parents would be eligible for $4,000 a year per child for
tuition at private schools, including parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education reform has to happen from the outside,'' said
Draper, 41. ``I have to be the one to make sure it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Draper's mantra has a familiar ring in Silicon Valley, where
free-market and libertarian strains and new-found wealth have
inspired a rush of interest in California's initiative process. But
as they would say here, Draper's politics are a few standard
deviations from the mean.
</P>
<P>
   He calls public education ``socialistic'' and advocates
free-market solutions at every turn, even advocating the
legalization of drugs. He said his plan would empower parents to
act as consumers shopping for the best education possible for their
children.
</P>
<P>
   The plan reflects his extreme strain of laissez-faire economics.
It calls for the use of existing educational money for the $4,000
vouchers. But according to the latest National Education
Association figures, California spent $5,627 per student in 1997-98
_ 40th in the nation and roughly $1,000 less than the national
average.
</P>
<P>
   Critics call the plan a drastic and simplistic solution to
difficult problems _ overcrowded and outmoded buildings, a lack of
qualified teachers, textbooks and equipment, and a growing number
of students for whom English is a second language.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dealing with very complex subjects and it runs the risk
of totally undermining school funding in California,'' said Bob
Cherry, associate executive director of the California Teachers
Association, a powerful organization with 300,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   The association will provide stiff opposition to Draper. In 1993
it spent $16 million to defeat a similar initiative that voters
rejected, 70 percent to 30 percent. This year it is gathering
signatures to put on the ballot a measure requiring the state to
spend at least as much per student as the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, it is an earlier voter initiative that is blamed
by many for creating the state's educational quandary. Proposition
13, passed in 1978, capped some property taxes, thus limiting a
major source of school financing.
</P>
<P>
   Draper's initiative does not even have the support of all
proponents of vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Moe, a professor of political science at Stanford
University, supports vouchers but said they should be narrower than
Draper's proposal. ``There is a reason why around the country,''
Moe said, ``the kinds of vouchers that are successful are targeted
at low-income children, and are limited programs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate at this time when a well-designed voucher
initiative could win,'' Moe added, ``he comes up with this, and he
does it on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Draper's campaign said they were still gathering
signatures on a petition to qualify for the November ballot though
few believe that they will qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Draper says his proposal would bring California spending up to
the national average per pupil.
</P>
<P>
   But the language of the proposition does not guarantee that.
Rather, it says it would ``permit'' the Legislature to amend the
law to raise spending, leading some political scientists to say the
measure implies that it will accomplish more than it can.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bait-and-switch,'' Cherry said. ``It's not about
raising it to the national average; it's about installing a voucher
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Draper says he has an interest as a ``frustrated parent'' of
four children in private schools and as a businessman who knows
that high-tech firms cannot find sufficiently educated engineers
and scientists.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He is not the first Silicon Valley entrepreneur to use the
initiative process to seek change.
</P>
<P>
   On the March ballot, California voters rejected propositions
drafted or sponsored in Silicon Valley that would have banned
corporate campaign contributions and allowed votes for ``none of
the above'' in federal and state elections. Officials of high-tech
companies also supported an unsuccessful measure that would have
lowered the vote to pass a school bond measure to a simple majority
from a two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign-finance reform measure was sponsored by Ron Unz, a
software millionaire, whose initiative against bilingual education
was approved in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Schnur, a Republican strategist in California and the former
Republican political director of TechNet, a bipartisan Silicon
Valley lobbying group, said the region's entrepreneurs do not have
the patience for the political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to subcommittee hearings gets boring really fast,'' he
said. ``They figure they can achieve the results through a ballot
measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Draper said he planned to create a broader political coalition
than the conservatives and religious groups that backed the 1993
proposition, though he has not disclosed any backers. He said he
was prepared to raise $40 million, an atypically high amount, but
would not say how much he was prepared to spend himself.
</P>
<P>
   Draper is less the political novice than other
referendum-backing valley residents. He has been a prominent
fund-raiser for George W. Bush's presidential campaign and has
hired as his spokesman Barry Hutchison, the former press secretary
for Newt Gingrich. Draper's father, William H. Draper III, ran for
Congress in 1969 and in 1981 was appointed chairman of the
Export-Import Bank by President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Draper spent a year on the state board of education,
where, he said, he learned that ``the system is failing the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Californians embrace such a far-reaching
initiative, colleagues of Draper say he will put enough money and
personal influence into the race to force people to think about it.
Draper said he hoped the result would be a legacy that promoted his
near-religious belief in the free market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will have lived a great life if I can be known for viral
marketing and school vouchers,'' he said.

COMPETITION HOT ON THE TRAIL OF ROBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Although the spotlight in the women's race of the
Boston Marathon has focused sharply on Fatuma Roba's bid to win an
unprecedented fourth consecutive title, her opponents are set to
try to nudge her off the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't win the Olympics and three Bostons without being a
class athlete,'' said the woman who is perhaps her No. 1 challenger
here, Elana Meyer. ``Hopefully, she can't do it for a fourth.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer, a 33-year-old South African who finished third here in
1994 and was runner-up in '95 and '97, has been the subject of much
speculation in the days leading up to the Marathon. After 15 years
with the same coach, Meyer _ the 1992 Olympic silver medalist at
10,000 meters and world-record holder at the half-marathon _
recently switched to a coach with more experience at 26.2 miles.
Longtime observers say she looks stronger than she has in the past,
perhaps better prepared for the rigors she will face in the hills
of Newton.
</P>
<P>
   If she didn't feel she could end up on the victor's platform
here, she wouldn't have come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elana looks great,'' said Joan Benoit Samuelson. ``She's been
the bridesmaid so many times. She keeps coming back because she
really wants this.''
</P>
<P>
   Also back is Catherine Ndereba of Kenya. In her debut at the
distance here last year, Ndereba stuck with Roba through 17 miles
before surviving to finish sixth, only to collapse of exhaustion
and dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to be challenged, and that's exactly what
happened,'' said Ndereba, 27. She rebounded to finish second last
fall in the New York City Marathon, and pronounced herself pleased
with her improvement. Virtually untouchable at shorter distances
(ranked the top road racer in the world the last two years by
Runner's World), Ndereba comes in with a half-marathon best of 1
hour 9 minutes 2 seconds, set this year, and should be a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Boston rookie Lornah Kiplagat could create a stir. Gearing up
for the race, the 25-year-old Kenyan ran an impressive 1:06:54
half-marathon, the fifth fastest in history, and her 2:25:30
personal best marathon trails only Roba and Meyer in this year's
field. Of the four marathons she has finished, she has won three
(Amsterdam in 1999, Los Angeles in 1997 and '98).
</P>
<P>
   Next on the depth chart with a 2:25:45 personal best is
21-year-old Sun Yingjie of China, vowing not to repeat her youthful
mistake of last year when she blasted out of the starting blocks so
fast that she led by almost a minute at 10 kilometers. She was
finally caught by Roba and Ndereba just after the halfway point,
which she passed on world-record pace, and dragged herself home in
11th place.
</P>
<P>
   Joining her is 22-year-old countrywoman and training partner Ai
Dongmei, who finished 19th here last year and hopes to qualify for
China's Olympic team, to which Sun already has been named.
</P>
<P>
   With little time to recover from late February's Olympic Trials,
there are no top Americans here, and last year's top American
finisher, Lynn Jennings of Newmarket, N.H., has opted to
concentrate on training for the 10,000 meters. The fastest US woman
in the field is Marcia Narloch of Tampa, whose best time is
2:37:11.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the competition, Roba, 26, remains the woman to
beat. ``She's got the momentum of victory, and you can't override
that,'' said Kathrine Switzer. Last month, she demolished the field
at the Kyoto City Half Marathon with a 1:10:16 victory, and appears
as fit as ever. She has no reason to fear either Boston's legendary
hills or her competition, having dispatched both with aplomb the
past three years. She'll have plenty of support on the course from
the 10,000 or so Ethiopians living in Massachusetts, many of whom
will exuberantly greet their heroine with flags and cheers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethiopians living in the Boston area are very much prepared
for her win,'' said Roba's translator, Telahn Gebrehiwot.
</P>
<P>
   She gives no indication they will be disappointed.

VARGAS DELIVERS WHAT OSCAR HASN'T
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Fernando Vargas isn't as marketable as Oscar De La
Hoya. His promoter, Gary Shaw, admits it. He said he and others
must continue to push his client into the public consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's time to put Vargas in De La Hoya's class as a
fighter.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Oxnard resident did what De La Hoya has never
been able to do: beat an elite opponent convincingly.
</P>
<P>
   His performance against Ike Quartey here left onlookers shaking
their heads.
</P>
<P>
   He took everything a strong, fit challenger had to offer and
then returned the favor two-fold. And the way he did it - so
methodically, so professionally, so thoroughly - makes it difficult
to believe he's only 22 and has had a mere 19 fights.
</P>
<P>
   One word to describe the effort: Wow! When's the last time we
used that exclamation after a De La Hoya fight?
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya deserves tremendous respect as a fighter. His
accomplishments are considerable. At the same time, he had great
difficulty in his three biggest tests - Pernell Whitaker, Quartey
and Felix Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   He was able to beat Whitaker and Quartey - but barely. The
Whitaker decision was widely disputed and utterly uninspired, while
he had to rally to outpoint Quartey in another controversial fight.
</P>
<P>
   And, against Trinidad, he blew a chance to make a significant
statement when he outboxed the Puerto Rican but lost a close
decision when he ran in the final rounds.
</P>
<P>
   After all three fights, we were left wanting more out of De La
Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Vargas' detractors will make predictable comments.
</P>
<P>
   They'll say that Quartey had fought only once in 2 years,
inactivity that had to have had some impact on him. (He hadn't
fought for 16 months when he faced De La Hoya.)
</P>
<P>
   They'll say Quartey was at a disadvantage because he was
fighting for the first time at 154 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   They'll say Vargas was unable to seriously hurt or knock down
Quartey, as De La Hoya was able to do.
</P>
<P>
   They'll say this performance doesn't entirely erase his disputed
victory over Ronald ``Winky'' Wright in his last fight, in which he
had to rally to beat the relatively unknown, but slick left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   And all such comments will have some validity.
</P>
<P>
   However, we saw what we saw Saturday and it made a powerful
impression.
</P>
<P>
   If the Quartey who fought Vargas was rusty, he certainly didn't
look it. He looked stronger at 154 than he had at 147, at least in
part because he said he had difficulty making the lighter weight in
his most recent bouts.
</P>
<P>
   His jab, his most noted weapon, was crisp and powerful while his
right caught Vargas' attention on many occasions.
</P>
<P>
   It seems so obvious that precious few junior middleweights
could've stood up to him.
</P>
<P>
   That Vargas was not only among those few but dominated Quartey -
which no one had done - is convincing evidence of where Vargas
stands: He's one of the best fighters in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has been able to beat him convincingly and I did it
after only 18 fights. That has to say something,'' Vargas said.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad talk: As much as we learned about Vargas on Saturday,
we'll know much more if he fights Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas is expected to take a relatively easy fight in July -
possibly against former contender Tony Ayala, who is recently out
of prison and resurrecting his career - and then could tangle with
Trinidad in September or October.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations started before the Quartey fight and continue,
although both promoters - Shaw and Don King - are optimistic that
terms will be reached.
</P>
<P>
   It might be the biggest-money matchup for both at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   They could make more fighting De La Hoya, but the welterweight
champion is as comfortable at 147 as Trinidad and Vargas are at
154. No one will be willing to budge, at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas-Trinidad might not be as interesting to the public as a
fight involving De La Hoya. However, fight fans drool over the
prospect of two immensely talented young boxers they know will
stand and fight one another.
</P>
<P>
   If Vargas wins? Any doubters who remain after the Quartey fight
would have to concede.
</P>
<P>
   Correction: The date on which Vargas' trial on assault charges
begins was incorrect in Sunday's editions. He'll be in Santa
Barbara Superior Court beginning Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas and four friends allegedly beat up a man in a home
outside Santa Barbara in August. He could face up to eight years in
prison, but one legal expert said he'd be very surprised if Vargas
spent more than a few months in jail if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas insists he did nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be fully exonerated. You'll see,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: Quartey, who had said before the fight that De
La Hoya is ``far better'' than Vargas, refused to respond when he
was asked to compare the two after the fight. ...
</P>
<P>
   Vargas threw 909 punches, or roughly 76 per round, according to
CompuBox statistics.
</P>
<P>
   That might not be an eye-opening number for a flyweight but is
unusual for a fighter as big as Vargas.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas worked with a personal fitness trainer, John Philbin, for
the first time in preparation for this fight. To say he's sold on
the concept is an understatement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's earned a ticket for life,'' Vargas said of Philbin.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas connected on 389 of his punches. Quartey was 272 of 645.
...
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Diaz, who put on a very impressive, machine-like
performance in his 11th-round knockout of tough Ivan Robinson on
Saturday's undercard, has won 23 consecutive fights and has emerged
as one of the most capable junior welterweights in the world.
</P>
<P>
   One observer compared the Coachella resident to a young Julio
Cesar Chavez because of the way he chopped down Robinson. ...
</P>
<P>
   Paul Vaden, who lost a decision to Shibata Flores, was coming
off a fight in November in which he delivered the blows that killed
Stephan Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Vaden, the former IBF champion, reportedly has had a very
difficult time coping with the tragedy and hinted after Saturday's
fight that he might retire.

YANKEES SWEEP THEIR THREE-GAME SERIES WITH THE ROYALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ These were your defending World Series champion
Yankees Sunday. The starting pitcher had not started a game in
almost four years. The starting catcher had not started behind the
plate in 10 months and had no hits this season. The starting left
fielder had managed a grand total of four hits. The first pitcher
out of the bullpen was making his second major league appearance.
Welcome to Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But all that these truncated descriptions of Jason Grimsley, Jim
Leyritz, Ricky Ledee and Darrell Einertson prove is that the
Yankees are very deep and that it is still very early in the
season. It seemed as if everyone except the bat boys contributed
something as the Yankees subdued the Royals, 8-4, to sweep their
three-game series and finish their first homestand at 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are deep enough to summon Grimsley from the bullpen
and have him pitch five sturdy innings. Deep enough to get a
tie-breaking home run from Leyritz after Jorge Posada was given
most of the day off. Deep enough to watch the blossoming Ledee
produce two hits and three runs batted in. Deep enough to have
Einertson secure three important outs on nine pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you just saw is what we are,'' Ledee said. ``We don't
rely on one or two guys. Everyone is prepared to play. Even guys
who aren't playing are up in the clubhouse swinging a bat. It's
teamwork. That's why we're so good.''
</P>
<P>
   With Andy Pettitte on the disabled list, the Yankees needed a
replacement starter Sunday. Rather than promote Jake Westbrook from
Class AAA Columbus, Torre started and ended his search for a
starter in the bullpen. Torre recalled how Grimsley pitched a
five-hit shutout against the Yankees as a member of the Angels on
May 28, 1996, hardly caring that Grimsley had not started since
July 25, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley sprinted out of the dugout to begin the game and
admitted that it felt bizarre to hear the national anthem while he
was on the mound because he is usually in the bullpen at the start.
Using his hard sinker and an improved curveball, Grimsley stifled
the Royals until Mike Sweeney's two-run homer in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   But that lead did not last long, only a half-inning, because
Royals starter Chad Durbin failed to handle a bad-hop grounder and
also made a throwing error to allow one run. Ledee sliced a double
off the warning track in left field to knock in two runs, clapping
his hands three times as he stood on second. Grimsley left with the
3-2 lead in the sixth and was obviously the right man for Sunday's
starting job and maybe for several other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything I could do, I'll do,'' said Grimsley, who worked from
the stretch position, as relievers usually do. ``If they want me to
sweep the floor, I'll do it if they let me wear this uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Einertson said that he would gleefully join Grimsley in lifting
a broom if he could remain in pinstripes. When Einertson was
summoned to replace Grimsley with one out and the potential tying
run on second, he did not know there was a runner on base until he
got to the mound. Einertson used mostly sinkers to retire three of
four batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to stay here as long as I can,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After Ledee's bloop double in the sixth made it 4-2, Jeff Nelson
destroyed Grimsley's chance for the victory when he allowed two
runs in the seventh. Nelson appeared to pick the snoozing Carlos
Beltran off first base for what would have been the third out and
would have maintained a 4-3 lead. But Beltran was called safe and
Sweeney followed with a run-scoring single. Nelson slammed the
rosin bag behind the mound, angry at the first-base umpire, Jim
Reynolds, and himself.
</P>
<P>
   That simply gave Leyritz a chance to play the hero, a role that
anyone who is nicknamed Elvis and King relishes. Leyritz said he
felt lost at the plate on Saturday and had been unsuccessful for
his first 11 at-bats. That changed when he drove Chris Fussell's
0-1 pitch over the fence in right-center field in the seventh,
giving the Yankees a 5-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody will pretty much do anything that's asked of them,''
Grimsley said. ``Nobody is set in their ways. There's not an ego to
say: `This is my job. This is all I do.' These guys want to win
and, three out of the last four years, you see the results.''

 &HT;    49ers' Hearst needs another operation
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Former Georgia running back Garrison Hearst of the San
Francisco 49ers has suffered another setback in his comeback from a
leg injury that forced him to miss last season.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst broke his left ankle on the first play from scrimmage in
an NFC playoff game against the Falcons in the Georgia Dome on Jan.
9, 1999. The Lincolnton native hasn't played since, and his
recovery has been slowed by circulatory problems in the leg.
</P>
<P>
   The poor blood flow has left the bones in Hearst's foot
susceptible to necrosis, a bone deterioration condition that
developed in Bo Jackson's hip after an injury and forced him to
retire from football.
</P>
<P>
   Niners officials said Hearst will undergo more surgery this
month, but said he still has a ``70 percent chance'' of returning
to the field sometime this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a rare injury,'' San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci
said. ``I don't think the NFL has had to deal with this sort of
thing before. (The doctors) feel this would help get him back on
the field sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   Team physician Michael Dillingham noticed problems in Hearst's
ankle after the running back underwent an MRI last week.
</P>
<P>
   (It) showed that the injury is healing slowly but the healing is
not complete,'' Dillingham said in a statement. ``We feel an
additional surgery is necessary to speed up the healing process to
give him a chance to play this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst, who ran for a team-record 1,570 yards in 1998, hasn't
yet run at full speed and won't participate in the team's mini-camp
at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers, who last year signed former Eagles starter Charlie
Garner to replace Hearst, drafted another running back Sunday. San
Francisco used a fifth-round pick on Texas-El Paso's Paul Smith,
who ranks fourth on the school's career list with 2,539 yards
rushing.
</P>
<P>
   MR. IRRELEVANT
</P>
<P>
   Michael Green, a safety from Northwestern State in Louisiana, is
this year's ``Mr. Irrelevant,'' the title affectionately given to
the last pick of the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Green was the 254th choice overall by the Chicago Bears, who
traded down with the Cleveland Browns for the second year in a row
to make the last pick. Chicago gave up the 209th and 225th choices,
getting the 223rd, 232nd and 254th picks from the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's nice,'' Green told the Associated Press. ``We play
golf, we go sailing, have a banquet in honor of me. I'll be treated
like a king.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, who runs the 40-yard dash in 4.46 seconds, had 99 tackles
last season, broke up 14 passes and had two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like this kid has as good as speed as (anybody),''
said Mark Hatley, Chicago's vice president of player personnel.
``He's a physical kid for 190 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Green thought he would be drafted higher, perhaps as early as
the fourth or fifth round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited,'' he said. ``I just wanted to see my name
called on TV. It was a lot of relief.''
</P>
<P>
   JUST FOR KICKS
</P>
<P>
   One day after spending their first-rounder on Florida State
kicker Sebastian Janikowski, the Raiders selected the first punter
of the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland took Texas A&AMP;M punter Shane Lechler, who set an NCAA
record with a 46.7-yard average in his career, in the fifth round,
142nd overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we needed to improve on,'' Raiders coach
John Gruden said of his team's kicking game.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders aren't the first team to spend relatively high picks
on kickers. In 1976, their first year in the NFL, the Seattle
Seahawks spent two third-round picks on kickers _ punter Rick
Engles and kicker Don Bitterlich.
</P>
<P>
   SHOPPING SPREE
</P>
<P>
   In their attempt to replace All-Pro receiver Keyshawn Johnson,
the New York Jets gambled on a pair of wideouts with troubled
pasts.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Jets traded Johnson to the Buccaneers for a pair
of first-round selections. New York became the first team in NFL
history to make four first-round picks, using them to take a
defensive end, outside linebacker, quarterback and tight end.
</P>
<P>
   In the third round, the Jets took Florida State receiver
Laveranues Coles. Coles was involved in a much-publicized
shoplifting incident with FSU star Peter Warrick. Coles was kicked
off the team by Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden, while Warrick was
suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Jets grabbed Southern Cal receiver Windrell Hayes in
the fifth round. Hayes, who spent time at San Jose State and San
Joaquin Delta College in California, played two seasons for the
Trojans. He was arrested in an illegal check-cashing scheme last
year.
</P>
<P>
   RATTAY ALSO WAITS
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech's Joe Hamilton wasn't the only high-profile passer
who had to wait a long time to get drafted this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Rattay, the record-setting quarterback from Louisiana Tech,
was the 212th pick, going to the 49ers in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough couple of days at times,'' Rattay said. ``I
thought I might have gone higher, but it was worth the wait. I'm
really happy to be going to the 49ers.''
</P>
<P>
   In three seasons at Louisiana Tech, Rattay finished No. 2 in
NCAA history in passing yards (12,746), total offense (12,645) and
touchdown passes (115).
</P>
<P>
   But scouts were concerned about his height (6 feet 1) and the
offense he operated in at Louisiana Tech, in which he played in
shotgun formation and never took a snap under center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard all that stuff,'' Rattay said. ``I'm not really
worried. I just plan to keep working hard and do whatever it
takes.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has some options if star quarterback Steve Young
decides to retire because of recurring concussions. In the third
round, the 49ers drafted Giovanni Carmazzi, the record-setting
quarterback from Division I-AA Hofstra. Carmazzi rushed for 1,044
yards and 32 touchdowns in his college career.

KATHRYN NIXON: MARATHONER WITH HER EYE ON THE BALL 
</HEADLINE>

   BOSTON _ Two athletes, husband and wife. He's wearing No. 7.
She's been issued No. 18155.
</P>
<P>
   She'll hop on a bus near Copley Square at dawn and ride out to
the starting line in Hopkinton. He'll drive to Fenway Park and
check the lineup card to see if he's batting second, playing right
field against the Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   Trot Nixon's game starts at 11 a.m. and should be over around 2
p.m. Kathryn Nixon's race starts at noon and she hopes to be
cutting through Kenmore Square around 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   He plays for the Red Sox. She's running for the Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute's Marathon Challenge. He works to fulfill the
hopes and dreams of Red Sox Nation. She runs for all who have
succumbed to cancer, thousands of survivors, and all who'll be
affected in the future. It is the noblest of causes.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for Trot to take a postgame shower and hustle to
Copley Square so he can be there when his wife crosses the finish
line of the 104th Boston Marathon. The Sox will be chartering to
Detroit at that hour, but Nixon has permission to take a commercial
flight Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn and Trot are North Carolinians who have been married for
three years. This is his second full season in the major leagues
and it didn't take his wife long to align herself with New
England's favorite charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to run a marathon,'' she said. ``I looked
it up on the Internet and found out that I could run for charity.
When I saw Dana-Faber, it was instant. I said to myself, `This is
what I've got to do.' I've lost so many family members and
relatives of friends to cancer. So this was perfect. I called and
got signed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 400 Dana-Farber Marathon Challenge runners will
raise more than $2 million for cancer research. In 10 years the
team has raised $8.1 million and Kathryn Nixon has already gathered
pledges of more than $22,000. Fifty of the Challenge participants
run in the name of patient partners. Kathryn will run in memory of
Belmont's Derek Setterlund, who died of a brain tumor before his
third birthday in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Setterlund, Derek's dad, said, ``We're very touched and very
proud that Kathryn has volunteered to run, not only for Derek, but
that she's considerate enough to raise money for Dana-Farber to
help other kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The Setterlunds met with Kathryn and Trot Sunday afternoon at
the Westin Hotel at a Marathon Challenge patient-partner meal.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn is excited and ready to go. She'll wear a Red Sox cap.
Under the cap she'll have her hair bunched in a wide ribbon
inscribed with the names of Derek and others she's honoring. The
names furnish more fuel and stamina than pasta and months of
training. Team Dana-Farber never quits.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn was a dancer and cheerleader at North Carolina State and
remembers losing her grandmother and cheerleading coach to cancer.
Former Wolfpack basketball coach Jim Valvano, who won the NCAA
tournament in 1983, also succumbed to the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited for her,'' said Trot. ``She's running for a
special cause. She's invested a great deal of time, putting in
long, hard hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Distance running has never been a strength for the aptly named
Trot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't train with her,'' he admitted. ``I go 1 1/2 miles and
it's like, `I'll see you on the flip side.' I like to drive. I'd
much rather drive the 26 miles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to say the training for running the Marathon is very
strenuous,'' said Kathryn. ``But I should have given Trot more
credit. He can run. He ran the bases pretty hard Friday night and I
thought, `Oh, my goodness. I guess he is a runner.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Trot's contributions go beyond moral support. When the Red Sox
flew a red-eye home after completing their West Coast trip in
Anaheim, Calif., the right fielder dragged himself out of bed to do
seven promotional radio interviews with the other athlete in the
family.
</P>
<P>
   Before moving to Boston, Kathryn was the one asking the
questions, working in production for ESPN and ESPN2. Auto racing
was her specialty, but she never worked on-air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not with this accent,'' she said, sounding like one of Andy
Taylor's girlfriends from Mayberry.
</P>
<P>
   Running with Challenge team members, Kathryn reached the peak of
her training with a 20-mile run. She tapered off this week, running
5 miles Monday, 6 Wednesday, and 3 Friday. She took the weekend off
and loaded up on carbs _ particularly pizza. She hopes to finish in
four hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've met so many wonderful people through this, I'm not even
nervous,'' she said. ``I'm so anxious for the race. I can't wait.
It's a race for life.''
</P>
<P>

Challenge can send a check _ payable to DMFC _ to the Dana-Farber

US OLYMPC TRIALS IN BOSTON? WHY NOT? SAYS D'ALESSANDRO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He was candid, frank, and irreverent as always, saying
he will be in Sydney for the second week of the Olympics. And, yes,
he has received invitations from the International Olympic
Committee to attend some of their events. Gala, as always.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been invited,'' David D'Alessandro, eyebrows raised, said
in mock astonishment. ``To the big ones, too.''
</P>
<P>
   And will he _ one of the most damning critics of rampant
corruption in the IOC _ attend?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably go,'' he replied. ``I mean . . . you know . . .
Rasputin was allowed to go to places, I'm sure.''
</P>
<P>
   And on the eve of the Boston Marathon, D'Alessandro was equally
as frank about US Track &AMP; Field's reluctance to use Boston as its
venue for the US Olympic Trials, even though Kenya, for one, will
use the race as its Olympic qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   USA Track &AMP; Field was formerly known as The Athletics Congress
(TAC).
</P>
<P>
   ``TAC is afraid,'' said D'Alessandro, president of John Hancock
Financial Services Inc., the Marathon sponsor that also puts out
about $2 million and 1,200 volunteers annually for the event.
``They can only make money by going to Pittsburgh (for the men's
qualifier) and South Carolina (women's).''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Marathon has never been used as the US Olympic
qualifier ``because they have this ridiculous rule that the course
is too hilly,'' said D'Alessandro. ``They have this rule about how
much grade you can have in the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my point is that if (the United States) is supposed to
post up its best three runners who can run against international
competition, then why do we insist on this incestuous race with
just Americans?''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the world's best marathoners are in Boston today, he
said. ``This is the only event in America where enough of the
international players come in in the time frame to qualify for the
Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   What better race to qualify for the Olympics than one of the
world's more competitive marathons, said D'Alessandro. Even more,
it would be an ideal measuring stick for Americans to use against
many of the competitors they will be facing in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a disservice to all those potential athletes who dream of
winning the Olympic Games.''
</P>
<P>
   The only sure thing about the US Olympic Trials ``is that an
American is going to win,'' he said. ``Since when do American
athletes run _ or compete _ out of safety? It's not the American
mentality and, supposedly, not our heritage. We're supposed to be
risk-takers and out front in everything we do.''
</P>
<P>
   The result? American marathoning continues in its sad state
because US runners are not tested against the world's best in their
trials. ``It's like Americans are racing in a bubble. It's like the
bubble boy in that movie. (The US Trials) are a controlled
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   According to D'Alessandro, Ireland's John Treacy said it best
``when he said, `You haven't run a marathon until you've run
against the best.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The ``old TAC crowd was much more interested in money than the
new TAC crowd, but money is still the driver,'' he said, noting
there are far too many people in TAC more interested in showcasing
Americans in US-only trials in dreadfully slow times than in
preparing them to do well in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Marathoning ``is one of the few sports I know of where American
athletes, from a competition standpoint, are so frightened. Even in
soccer, we've made a more valiant try. The fact that we're not good
at it makes us not want to compete against the others. Therefore,
every four years, we take America's premier race'' and don't use it
as the US trial. It's ludicrous, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, D'Alessandro pitched the idea of using Boston as the US
trials to US Track &AMP; Field and US Olympic Committee officials. He
said a marathon is not like the 100 meters, or 400 meters. ``You
can see where they could say in those events, `Line up the best
Americans and let them run against each other.' That concept
doesn't work in a marathon because it's not a 9.3-second race. It's
a long, strategic race over varying conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The result?
</P>
<P>
   ``They actually promised us the race verbally back in '88,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But with a catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted the Americans to run ahead of everybody else,''
D'Alessandro said. ``So I made one of my comments. I said, `If you
want the Americans to run ahead of the pack, we'll probably have to
start them at least 45 minutes ahead. Because the Italians, the
Kenyans, and the Japanese are going to run them over.' The BAA
(Boston Athletic Association) actually was considering it,
considering an 11 a.m. start for the Americans, even though they
didn't want it, either. The BAA was just trying to be flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   He again was brutally . . . ah, candid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `That reminds me of when you have a big dinner and you
have a kiddie table for the kids. You know you have those little
card tables. You're putting the Americans at one of those little
card tables.' Then I said that some of the (top international
runners) would still beat some of the Americans, even with their
one-hour headstart. I said, `You guys would love that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Not since Joan Benoit won the gold medal in the 1984 Olympics
has an American won a medal in marathoning. Frank Shorter was the
last US male to win a medal _ in 1976 in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond ``incestuous'' trials, D'Alessandro said US marathoning
has slumped for other reasons. There is no true feeder system in US
colleges for marathoners. ``Colleges get a cross-country kid and
what do they do right away? They put him on a track,'' he said,
pointing out there have to be more scholarships for marathoners.
</P>
<P>
   The more poorly US marathoners do in international competition,
the less interest there is among Americans, he said. The cycle has
to be broken by American improvement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when marathoning in this country . . .
actually was a much more consumer-popular sport,'' said
D'Alessandro. ``When Chicago was a bigger race, when New York
wasn't a fun race, when Los Angeles wasn't a Hollywood race. Now,
there is only one pure marathon left that attracts enough
world-class athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, John Hancock and D'Alessandro first became
involved with the Boston Marathon. ``If you had told me in 1988
that marathons would be less of a sport for American consumers, I
would have thought no,'' he said. ``But I think there has been a
dilution over the last 10 or 12 years where the bigger marathons
have . . . well, not collapsed . . . but have become fun races.''
</P>
<P>
   And is it getting old for D'Alessandro to help shepherd Boston
from Hopkinton to Copley Square?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't have the time anymore,'' he replied. ``But it's
actually what I prefer to do, since I spend much of my time on the
(John Hancock) business, of course. It's not so much getting old .
. . but I do think the Boston Marathon could use some freshness.
The freshness I'd like to see is the Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   No shortage of Americans in this year's race. But a very real
shortage of Americans doing well.

COMMENTARY: THE BLUE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Zaher ``Zack'' Zahrey was a police detective with a
spotless record when certain malevolent forces of the criminal
justice system in New York began to close in on him. It was a case
of a corrupt and treacherous system devouring one of its own.
Zahrey would spend several humiliating months in jail and his
career would be ruined before he was finally exonerated by a jury
that took only 10 minutes to reach a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The problems for Zahrey, an undercover narcotics detective,
began early in 1994 when a man named William Rivera was murdered in
a nightclub in Brooklyn. Zahrey and Rivera, a former auxiliary
police officer, had grown up in the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn
and had been friends.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera had been shot with a gun that belonged to an off-duty
police officer and the matter was being investigated by the Police
Department's Internal Affairs Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Zahrey told police officials that he had once been close friends
with Rivera and he was asked by Detective Sgt. Robert Boyce of
Internal Affairs to assist in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Zahrey agreed.
</P>
<P>
   It was apparently at that point that a web of incredible lies,
some of them encouraged by the police and other investigators,
began to be woven. Rumors circulated among police officers that
Zahrey had been involved in criminal activities with Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   This was around the time the Mollen Commission was issuing its
report about police corruption. The Internal Affairs Bureau seemed
anxious to come up with a case that would demonstrate its
willingness to go after corrupt cops.
</P>
<P>
   Conveniently, a former police informant was found to parrot the
rumors against Zahrey. The informant was a drunk who had once been
arrested when he showed up at a police officer's funeral with a
hand grenade. He was known to be unstable and utterly unreliable.
Nevertheless, Boyce used this man's nutty stories to launch an
official investigation of Zahrey.
</P>
<P>
   What came next was much worse. Rivera had, indeed, been a
criminal. But there was no evidence that Zahrey was involved in any
way. When investigators located a man who really had been linked to
Rivera's illicit activities _ a dangerous career criminal named
Sidney Quick _ they didn't try at all to nail him. They tried
desperately to get Quick to nail Zahrey.
</P>
<P>
   On March 16, 1995, with the investigation of Zahrey going
nowhere, Boyce and another detective visited Quick at Sing Sing
Prison. By then he was serving a sentence of six years to life as a
persistent, violent felony offender. He was ready to tell the
police whatever they wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   The cops said they were interested in an armored-car holdup and
the murder of a drug dealer nicknamed J.R.
</P>
<P>
   Zahrey's lawyer, Joel B. Rudin of Manhattan, noted in court
papers that the holdup occurred while Quick was in prison and that
Quick himself was a suspect in the murder.
</P>
<P>
   So here's what Boyce told Quick in a conversation tape-recorded
at Sing Sing: ``If you did something, fine, you did it. If someone
else pulled the trigger when you were there, we can get around it.
You understand what I'm saying?''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what else he said: ``If you give me Zack, I'll drive you
home.'' He said: ``If you tell me Zack was there when J.R. was
killed, he's (expletive) and, and you are looking at a very sweet
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``The deal is Zack. That's what your deal is. You
understand that?''
</P>
<P>
   Quick understood. He told the detectives that Zack most
certainly was involved in the holdup and the murder and some other
crimes as well. There was no other evidence, just the transparent
fantasies of Sidney Quick.
</P>
<P>
   Having encouraged them, the cops now embraced them. And so did
the Brooklyn DA's office, which did its best to keep the Sing Sing
tape hidden, and the office of the U.S. attorney for the Eastern
District, which eventually prosecuted Zahrey on corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   A jury saw through the madness and acquitted Zahrey in June
1997. But the Police Department has never given him back his badge
or his gun. And his only hope for some kind of justice rests with a
lawsuit against the system he once served well.

SPORTS COLUMN: REDSKINS AND BUCS TAKE FASTEST LANES ON DRAFT DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ That cigar. The one that was being puffed by Daniel
Snyder, the Washington Redskins' owner, throughout the weekend's
National Football League draft. Get used to seeing it. Get used to
seeing Snyder in a state of glee. Get used to seeing people pat him
on the back, as they did after Washington's outstanding draft.
</P>
<P>
   Get used to seeing the Redskins win a lot of games. Get it
through your head: right now they are the best team in football.
</P>
<P>
   That smile. Tampa Bay Coach Tony Dungy wears it well. It's a
confident smile. It's a comfortable smile. Like the Redskins, the
Buccaneers also had a great draft, just a different one. Imagine
this: A team owns no first-round selections and has one of the best
drafts of the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   How is that possible? It's done by trading away two first-round
selections, two unknowns, for Pro Bowl wide receiver Keyshawn
Johnson. In one swift move, the Buccaneers' offense went from the
Stone Age to the Industrial Age.
</P>
<P>
   This is the nature of the NFL draft. It can transform average
teams into good ones, and good teams into great teams. Suddenly,
the two best are Washington and Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Not St. Louis: the Rams will be so battered with every team
playing them as if it's the Super Bowl that they will be bound to
take a step back. Not Tennessee: the Titans were a freakish play
from losing in the first round last season. Not Indianapolis: the
Colts don't have a good enough defense just yet.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is the king of the league right now. The Buccaneers
are a close second. And both teams can thank their new status
because of this draft. How each went about using its picks to get
to this point is one of the better stories of these past few days.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins were involved in many trade discussions in recent
weeks for either the second or third pick or both. At one point,
according to Snyder, the team seriously considered trading for
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was close at one point,'' Snyder said, ``but it would have
taken a lot for us to give up one of our top two picks.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington briefly considered trading the third pick for Johnson
and two of the Jets' four first-round picks. The Jets thought that
was too high a price and then focused on trading Johnson to Tampa
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   So the Redskins stayed put, and in the end knew that was the
right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of teams that wanted to make trades with
us,'' Snyder said, ``but we thought, `How can we not sit still and
take these two great players?'''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the picks was a brilliant move _ and don't think it was
an obvious one. A number of teams would have made the trade with
the Jets and then missed out on two great players.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State linebacker LaVar Arrington is possibly the next
Lawrence Taylor. He is the kind of player who can almost
single-handedly turn the team's mediocre defense into a great one.
Arrington is so undaunted by the Taylor comparisons, he will be
wearing a No. 56 jersey, the same number Taylor wore with the
Giants. Alabama offensive left tackle Chris Samuels, the perfect
quarterback bodyguard, can anchor Washington's offensive line for
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The draft picks, combined with the off-season signings of
defensive end Bruce Smith, safety Mark Carrier, quarterback Jeff
George and running back Adrian Murrell, make Washington a Super
Bowl favorite. The team might further distance itself from others
after, as expected, it signs Deion Sanders and Jerry Rice when both
are likely cut by their teams after June 1. ``Sometimes the best
trades,'' Snyder said, ``are the ones you don't make.''
</P>
<P>
   Or do make.
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers, with the 13th and 27th picks, looked at the list
of college wide receivers and liked what they saw, but none could
compare to Johnson. Once they discovered the Jets were trying to
trade him, the Bucs moved quickly to see if they could afford a
contract that would eat a significant portion of their salary cap.
After determining they could, they decided to lay low until the
draft approached and then make the play for Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers got a proven talent whose big frame helps them
inside the 20-yard line, where they fared poorly last year. Johnson
will also keep teams from stacking the line of scrimmage with seven
men to slow Tampa Bay's running game.
</P>
<P>
   Riding its great defense last season, the Buccaneers were
already one play away from the Super Bowl; now, with Johnson, they
are remarkably better. Double-team Johnson, and Tampa Bay will hand
off the ball to Mike Alstott. Stack the line against Alstott, and
Johnson will do what he did with the Jets: pick a defense apart.
Two great teams, two great drafts, two different approaches. The
Redskins smartly kept their two picks and made two good selections.
The Buccaneers gave up their two picks but still had a successful
weekend because they get Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   So get ready for lots of cigars in the nation's capital and lots
of smiles in Tampa Bay. And for one of the teams _ probably the
Redskins _ Super Bowl rings.

SPORTS COLUMN: TRADITIONAL ORGAN MUSIC MAKING A COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE LAPOINTE   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Lou Lamoriello, that old boat rocker,
wants to change the system. A conservative on many hockey issues,
the president and general manager of the Devils is bucking a trend
by expanding the role of a real, live organ player for the Stanley
Cup playoffs in Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Lamoriello has not completely eliminated the noisy rock
recordings that have increasingly polluted the aural atmosphere
around the National Hockey League in the last decade. But he is
leading a counterrevolution against what he calls ``the loud and
aggressive music'' that blares mindlessly whenever a whistle stops
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's the traditionalist in me,'' Lamoriello said of the
organ music that was the primary sound of hockey rinks until the
1990s. ``It just brings a different type of environment.'' He said
the organ music during Game 1 against the Florida Panthers on
Thursday night ``brought the old goose bumps'' to his skin and
reminded him of how buildings used to sound. For now, Lamoriello
said, the Devils will blend recorded rock music with live organ
playing. A complete switch to the organ could come next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intention is to get the organ to take over,'' Lamoriello
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lamoriello said Devils fans reacted positively to the new sound,
sending their thanks through e-mail. The organist, Robert Shaheen,
said fans gave him the thumbs-up signal of approval and one man
told him he called the front office between periods to express his
gratitude for the organ music.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of the younger fans have never been exposed to it,''
Shaheen said Sunday before Game 2 of the Eastern Conference
quarterfinals against the Panthers. His keyboard produces the
traditional tones that he called church and movie theater as
opposed to the horn sounds and other synthetic effects used even
when live musicians perform.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen, who used to play for Islanders games at the Nassau
Coliseum, grew up listening to live organ music in the old Boston
Garden. ``I'm partial to live music,'' Shaheen said. ``I'm a member
of the musicians' union.'' Both Shaheen and Lamoriello used the
phrase ``old-time hockey'' to describe the mood evoked by the
music.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL is monitoring the switch in the Meadowlands as well as
the overall presentation of music and special effects at all rinks.
Frank Supovitz, the NHL's vice president of special events, said
the league does not order specific play lists of recorded music,
though many of the same, annoying songs are played in many cities.
Somehow Queen's ``We Will Rock You'' always seems to be heard,
sometimes even when the home team is down by three goals in the
final minute of play.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the only inappropriate selection. At a Ranger game at
Madison Square Garden, while a player lay writhing on the ice with
a broken leg, the speakers blared ``My Sharona,'' an upbeat song
from the late 1970s. Supovitz, who concerns himself with all
aspects of the NHL experience in the arenas, acknowledged that
overused recordings can have the wrong effect, such as when there
are three face-offs in quick succession and the music blares. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be jarring,'' Supovitz said. ``People know they are
being manipulated, and they don't react to that. You have to pick
the right piece of music for the right moment.'' He said the intent
of using recorded rock songs is to attract ``the young, male
demographic.'' But when they play it, it often makes it impossible
for young men or old women or children or anybody else to talk to
the person sitting next to them.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the league is listening to direct feedback. In the April
issue of Talk magazine, a story about Ted Leonsis told how the new
owner of the Washington Capitals chatted during an intermission
with fans who ``urge the boss to lower the earsplitting volume of
the PA system.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen, so far, plays longer songs before the game and during
intermissions. His repertory includes ``Hello, Dolly,'' ``Isn't She
Lovely?'' and ``Got To Get You Into My Life.'' He also played
``Hungry Heart,'' explaining that playing Bruce Springsteen in New
Jersey is as important as playing Billy Joel on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   When whistles stop play for face-offs, Shaheen stays
traditional, playing various rhythms that lead to shouts of
``Charge!'' or ``Let's go, Devils!'' Some teams play these tunes on
tapes. ``The canned stuff will run short or too long and has to be
stopped in a place that is not appropriate,'' Shaheen said.
</P>
<P>
   By listening and interacting with the fans, he said he can
respond immediately to their mood ``if they feel like a certain
cheer or they are riding the opposing goalie in a certain key.'' In
Game 1, Shaheen said, the fans rode a Panthers player ``by singing
in C-sharp.'' It is important, he added, to stay in good taste and
not lead profane taunts. ``Always try to stay appropriate,''
Shaheen said. ``You don't want to overstep. These things are common
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine: Common sense in hockey-rink music. What a concept. &QL;

MILLER HAS SMALL FEET AND SOME BIG DREAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALNUT, Calif. _ Inger Miller jogged down the track at UCLA the
other day when her coach, John Smith, began teasing her about her
tiny feet. Earlier, he had pulled one of her shoes out of his
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got those tiny feet on today?'' Smith called out. ``I
can't see them from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoe size, of course, has nothing to do with speed. Miller won
the 1999 world championship at 200 meters in 21.77 seconds, the
fastest time of the year, and finished second to Marion Jones in
the 100 in 10.79 seconds, her best time. She enters this season as
the biggest impediment to Jones' attempt to win five gold medals at
the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The whirlwind of publicity surrounding Jones is fine with
Miller, even beneficial, allowing her to train in relative
anonymity, without the same pressure, expectation or burdensome
news media attention. In September, it is possible that Miller will
match or exceed Jones' gold medal total in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the pressure is on her,'' the 27-year-old Miller said.
``There is no pressure on me. No one cares if Inger Miller wins or
loses. The only thing they care about is whether Marion wins. My
job is to show that it is not a one-woman show. That's a lot easier
than trying to show that it is a woman show.''
</P>
<P>
   A crack in Jones' sprint dominance appeared at the 1999 world
championships in Seville, Spain. Jones withdrew from the 200 during
the semifinals with back spasms, and Miller won the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``People question whether Marion would have won if she had
run,'' Miller said. ``In my mind, no.''
</P>
<P>
   Already Miller is in the Olympic record books as part of the
only father-daughter combination to win medals in track and field.
Her father, Lennox Miller, won a silver medal for Jamaica in the
100 at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics and a bronze medal at the 1972
Munich Olympics. Inger Miller won a gold medal for the United
States in the 4x100-meter relay at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and
finished fourth in the 200. Her godfather, Don Quarrie, won the 200
meters for Jamaica at the 1976 Montreal Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still resentment from Jamaicans in general that she
didn't compete for Jamaica, but considering everything, she is well
received,'' said Lennox Miller, a dentist who, like his daughter,
attended the University of Southern California. He was a relay
partner of O.J. Simpson on a team that set the world record for the
440-yard relay.
</P>
<P>
   Inger Miller's running career became serious when her mother had
a chance encounter in a grocery store with the coach of John Muir
High in Pasadena, Calif., a scholastic power in track and field.
But her college career was interrupted by a broken navicular bone
in her foot in 1994, and just before the Olympic trials for Atlanta
in 1996, she flipped a sport utility vehicle on a California
freeway in a scary accident. She recovered to make the team and won
a gold medal in the relay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the culmination of a lot of things we had dreamed of,''
Lennox Miller said. ``Finally, she had reaped the benefits in
athletics. We thought she had the ability, but she never realized
those performances we thought she should have been achieving.''
</P>
<P>
   Lennox Miller coached his daughter until 1998, during lunch
breaks from his dental practice in Pasadena, but the arrangement
was not satisfactory to the career either of the father or
daughter. Last season, she switched amicably to Smith's group,
Handling Speed Intelligently, known by its initials as HSI, which
includes the world's fastest man, Maurice Greene, and Ato Boldon, a
bronze medalist at 100 and 200 meters at the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being around us, you can't help but be confident,'' Boldon
said. ``And you can't get away with a bad practice in this group.
Someone will let you know.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Lennox Miller said, his daughter was mainly
interested in sprinting because of her speed and the social aspect
of track and field. ``You're tremendously talented; you've got to
work harder,'' he would exhort her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now she's at the point where she doesn't need that pep talk
anymore,'' Lennox Miller said. ``It's in her.''
</P>
<P>
   Training with HSI has focused and calmed Miller _ ``She's hyper;
a lack of energy is not her problem,'' Smith said _ and has allowed
her to attain her best times in the 100 and 200. Winning the world
championship at 200 meters has also given his daughter the
assurance that she can compete at the elite level, Lennox Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   For motivation she has to look no farther down the track than
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marion has done a wonderful job,'' Smith said. ``You have to
acknowledge it. But you do have the right to dismantle her.'' &QL;

JUSTICE SHEPRO, CONNOISSEUR OF OLD CLOCKS, DEAD AT 74 
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Justice W. Shepro, a lawyer and businessman who used his real
estate fortune to transform himself into one of the nation's
leading collectors of antique clocks, died in an automobile
accident near Chicago on March 30. He was 74 and lived in Roscoe,
Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Shepro's odyssey in time began in 1971, when he asked a
decorator if a 19th-century grandfather clock would complement the
decor of his law office in suburban Chicago, where he then lived
and worked. The answer was yes, and he was off and running.
</P>
<P>
   He became owner of one of the world's largest and most carefully
selected collections of antique clocks, some dating from the 15th
century. Claire Vincent, associate curator of European sculpture
and decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
characterized his French clocks, ranging from the late 16th century
to the early 19th, as among the best in the world.
</P>
<P>
   William J.H. Andrewes, formerly curator of historical scientific
instruments at Harvard University, said, ``He was a true
connoisseur, enjoying every piece for its technical merit, its
aesthetic quality or its historical significance.''
</P>
<P>
   In Shepro's later years, his son Richard said, he consciously
changed from a flamboyant personality with two Rolls-Royces into a
serious scholar of clocks and time-keeping. When he was 70, he
began to teach himself French so he could converse with experts
about the particulars of old French clocks, as well as read entries
in the copy of Diderot's Encyclopedia that he kept in one of his
clock rooms.
</P>
<P>
   He was president of the American section of the Antiquarian
Horological Society for almost a decade. In 1977, he became only
the second American admitted into the Worshipful Co. of
Clockmakers, a London guild that has its roots in a royal charter
granted by King Charles I in 1631.
</P>
<P>
   Shepro roamed the world's museums, quietly accepting numerous
opportunities to view collections not on display to the general
public. He wrote articles and notes about clocks in catalogs at
galleries and auctions. For a major clock sale by Sotheby's in
December, he wrote, ``There are no other objects from the past that
combine such history, science, technology, design and intrinsic
beauty! For what more could a collector ask?''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Warren Shepro was born on March 25, 1926, in Fort
Pierce, Fla., where his father, a lawyer, was trying,
unsuccessfully as it turned out, to cash in on the Florida land
boom of the 20s. His mother, also a lawyer, liked to say he was
named for Chief Justice Earl Warren. When it was pointed out that
Warren was not named to the court until a quarter century after her
son's birth, she answered, ``We thought he was doing good work even
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepro grew up in Chicago's western suburbs, where his father
practiced law and owned a company that made screws and bolts. He
graduated from Northwestern University and its law school.
</P>
<P>
   His career choice was almost a foregone conclusion. ``I don't
know that I had much choice with a name like Justice,'' he said. He
joined the law firm of his father, who promptly resigned the day
his son passed the bar exam, in order to devote himself to screws
and bolts and his other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In the same manner as his father, Shepro invested in clients'
businesses. He ended up owning two travel agencies and making a
number of lucrative real estate investments.
</P>
<P>
   His first marriage, to Inez McKillip, ended in divorce in 1971.
They had two sons, Richard, who lives in Chicago, and Kenneth, of
Wayne, Ill. Six grandchildren also survive him.
</P>
<P>
   Shepro and his second wife, Teresa, a specialist in fabrics from
countries as far-flung as Peru and Indonesia, were married in 1988.
They moved from their Chicago apartment to Roscoe about five years
ago, in part because the Time Museum, a bountiful collection of
clocks and watches, was then in nearby Rockford.
</P>
<P>
   That museum has since been disbanded by its owners, and much of
its collection is scheduled to go to a new National Time Museum, to
be opened this year in Chicago. Shepro was chairman of the
international council of advisers to the new museum.
</P>
<P>
   Shepro's move to Roscoe was part of a new life. Two Ford
Explorers replaced the Rolls-Royces. They were chosen because they
were a perfect size to haul a grandfather clock.
</P>
<P>
   He continued to practice the sort of workaday law he loved. He
did a real estate closing for his son Richard and Richard's wife,
Lindsay, the day before he died.
</P>
<P>
   Shepro was a man in love with keeping time. He had his house
designed to show off his clock collection, but would never say how
many clocks he owned. In recent years, the number shrank as he
increasingly traded multiple clocks for a single one on which his
heart was set, Richard Shepro said.
</P>
<P>
   His sons remember well the day in 1977 when he gave each a
digital watch. ``This is the end of fine watchmaking,'' he said
ominously.
</P>
<P>
   His own everyday wristwatch reset itself by radio signals from
the atomic clock in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Shepro could tell you off the top of his head what time it was
in China. He owned a 17th century Italian monastic night clock; a
1738 Parisian clock identical to one owned by Queen Elizabeth, and
a French grandfather clock made in 1672. Patricia Atwood, who was
director of the Time Museum in Rockford and vice president of the
horological society, remembered being with him in a dark, dusty
attic of the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia. They were
shown a fabulous clock, one made by Louis XVI's clockmaker as a
present for Marie Antoinette.
</P>
<P>
   Shepro had one just like it at home, but did not want to upstage
his hosts as they discussed the clock's uniqueness. He said nothing
and winked at Atwood.

 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thousands of protesters looking to shut down
meetings of world financial leaders swarmed through the streets of
the capital Sunday, clashing briefly with police who moved firmly
to quash any unrest.
</P>
<P>
   The finance ministers and other delegates from around the world
were loaded onto buses early Sunday morning and escorted by police
so that their meetings could take place as scheduled. Sunday
evening, they tacitly acknowledged the shouting on the streets by
conceding in a communique issued by the International Monetary Fund
that their role had become a matter ``of growing public debate.''
</P>
<P>
   They acknowledged a widespread fear that ``the benefits of the
world economy'' are ``not reaching everyone, especially in the
developing countries.'' But they offered no new prescriptions,
other than some reforms of the IMF's internal operations that are
already under way.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Saturday, when police arrested some 600 people, on Sunday
they arrested fewer than 20, but responded forcefully to any
challenges, wielding clubs and pepper spray against protesters who
defied them. Several were injured.
</P>
<P>
   All weekend long, the police acted sternly and preemptively,
shutting down the protest headquarters early Saturday morning,
arresting as many as 600 marchers by that evening, and shunting
hordes of protesters around Sunday. The combination allowed police
here mostly to avoid the kind of widespread chaos that disrupted
world trade meetings in Seattle last year, a feat the protesters
said they hoped to repeat.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,500 or so police from city and federal agencies, many in
full riot gear, completely sealed off an area for many blocks
around the buildings housing the World Bank and the IMF, standing
shoulder-to-shoulder behind fencelike metal barricades.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the barricades, demonstrators roamed the
streets almost at will, hoisting giant puppets and signs _ a pig
labled IMF with the world in its mouth like an apple, red hands
that said ``spank the bank'' _ and accusing the financial
institutions of burdening poor Third World countries with crushing
debts, impoverishing peasants, destroying rain forests, and
supporting sweatshops and other policies that, as one sign put it,
``saps the poor to fatten the rich.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the day, the protests were peaceful, if vociferous.
Perhaps 10,000 gathered on the grassy Ellipse near the White House
for a legal rally calling for changes in the world financial
systems.
</P>
<P>
   But there were at least two short, sharp clashes between police
and demonstrators, where the police used pepper spray and what
appeared to be a form of anti-riot gas or smoke grenades and
charged into protesters, beating them with long sticks. And there
were other moments of tension.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Anthony Williams said Sunday evening that the police
``have got this under control as much as you can.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is like steering a raft down a raging river,'' he said.
``You can control it, but then the unexpected can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the police had acted Sunday with appropriate force when
challenged, and that the mass arrests of peaceful protesters
Saturday night were justified as a matter of prudence. And he urged
the city's workforce to ``stay out of downtown if at all possible''
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a serious situation,'' he said. ``It is simmering down,
but again, people have been on the street for a long time, so
nerves are frazzled. There is a sense of anxiety and
anticipation.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite failing to achieve their avowed goal of blocking the
finance ministers from attending the meeting, by late afternoon
many of the protesters were jubilant at the attention drawn to
their sometimes diffuse cause, which drew many of the same groups
that descended on Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having a victory party in the street,'' said Patrick
Rensborough, one of the spokesmen for the Mobilization for Global
Justice, the umbrella organization coordinating the protest
</P>
<P>
   ``We're celebrating that this movement has come about,'' he went
on, standing at the edge of the rally in the Ellipse that went for
most of the afternoon. ``A few days ago most Americans didn't know
the first thing about the World Bank or the IMF. These institutions
can't survive public scrutiny. This is the first step toward
shutting them down.''
</P>
<P>
   While the marchers paraded below with their signs bearing
slogans like ``Defund the Fund,'' the leaders of the IMF were
upstairs arguing over different issues _ including who should get a
bigger voice in running the institution.
</P>
<P>
   Japan staged a minor rebellion aimed at winning a larger voice
for itself and other Asian nations in the fund's operations. Tokyo
had put up a candidate to run the IMF earlier this year, although
by tradition the managing director has always been a European. (An
American has always run the World Bank.) Though the effort did not
get very far Sunday, the world's second-largest economy was clearly
laying down a marker that it no longer planned to acquiese to the
old order. ``There's a sense that this has always been a white
man's club,'' one senior Japanese official said recently, ``and
that needs some rethinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several leaders of smaller nations said during the
meeting that they were alarmed by reform proposals _ including
those developed by a congressional commission _ that would limit
the size and duration of the fund's loans during economic crises.
They fear it would reduce the funds made available to them.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast with the message being delivered by demonstrators
outside could not have been sharper. While developing nations fear
that the IMF money could dry up, many of those on the street were
arguing that those same funds hurt the poor because they often come
with so many strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   The communique issued at the end of the meeting bore no
surprises. But it clearly anticipated the din outside. It
acknowledged that the growing debate over the future of the fund
and the World Bank ``reflects a concern that the benefits the world
economy is deriving from freer trade and more integrated and deeper
international capital markets are not reaching everyone.''

   But in the end, it prescribed the kind of changes the fund says
it is already pursuing: more disclosure about the financial state
of member countries, more involvement of the private sector in
international bailouts, a crackdown on the kind of misreporting of
financial data that took the IMF by surprise in its dealings with
Russia.

traditional poverty-fighter _ and how much to the fund, which
manages international financial crises.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the sun came up, clumps of 20 or 30 demonstrators
were moving through the streets toward assembly points at Farragut
Park and Washington Circle. By seven o'clock they had blocked all
of the intersections around the police perimeter, erecting
barricades near the George Washington University campus made with
tipped-over garbage dumpsters, old furniture and about a dozen bags
of mulch intended for the university's gardens, which they used
like sandbags.
</P>
<P>
   But the police were up even earlier.
</P>
<P>
   They began picking up the finance ministers and other delegates
at the Watergate, the Four Seasons and other luxury hotels as early
as 5 a.m., loading them into buses and vans and shuttling them in
caravans escorted by police motorcycles and cars, lights flashing
and sirens wailing, on circuitous routes that eventually took them
through the sealed-off stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue past the
White House and two blocks farther to the IMF meeting.
</P>
<P>
   With the meeting safely under way, the police tactics for most
of the day consisted mainly of maintaining their perimeter.
Saturday, they had moved aggressively, shutting down the
protester's headquarters, declaring that it was a ``fire hazard,''
and arresting some 600 people after they had boxed them in on the
street.
</P>
<P>
   Taking their cue from the Seattle protests, the police were far
better prepared this time. They have been training for weeks, have
bought $1 million worth of new equipment, including shin guards,
chest protectors and big gauntlets, and expect a $1.6 million
overtime bill.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators, including several hundred self-styled
anarchists called the ``Black block,'' dressed solidly in black
down to their combat boots, most with sweatshirt hoods and bandana
masks obscuring their faces, marched and wandered throughout the
largely deserted downtown.
</P>
<P>
   At the midpoint of a sunny afternoon, protesters from the
Ellipse rally merged with a crowd coming from the George Washington
campus into a huge parade through Foggy Bottom and back to the
Ellipse, chanting, ``This is what democracy looks like.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was overwhelmingly young; many of its elements were
organized on college campuses. And there were a few graying
veterans of 1960s demonstrations, including the comedian Dick
Gregory and Tom Hayden, one of the organizers of the 1968
Democratic convention protests and now a California state senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inspiring,'' said Dan Swanson, 47, who marched with
Students for a Democratic Society in his youth. ``They're much more
disciplined and aware than we were at that age.''

DEMONSTRATORS CLOG CAPITAL'S STREETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thousands of chanting activists, some wearing
combat boots and gas masks in preparation for violent clashes with
police, mobbed the streets of the nation's capital and tried to
disrupt meetings of world finance leaders Sunday, the first such
demonstration since the riotous protests against the World Trade
Organization in Seattle last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Police fired tear gas at one point, and an isolated group of
self-described ``anarchists'' repeatedly tried to break through
police barriers, smashing security car windows and splashing
emergency vehicles with red paint. But the feared repeat of Seattle
did not occur, and at times the event took on a carnival
atmosphere, as an estimated 10,000 marchers shouted and danced
their way through otherwise deserted downtown streets.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the finance officials were successfully whisked into
the World Bank and International Monetary Fund for a day of
meetings. From there they could see the giant banners on display
outside, among them ``Make Love, Not Debt,'' ``Shut Down
Capitalism!'' and ``Economic Justice Now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the protesters perhaps have some points,'' said Mario
Vicens, the treasury secretary for Argentina, who was attending a
meeting at the IMF. ``But this is not the way to change things.''
</P>
<P>
   As in Seattle, the demonstrators came bearing a wide range of
complaints, from the impact of globalization on the environment to
the domination of a ``prison-industrial complex'' to human rights
abuses in East Timor. But they were unified against a single enemy:
the financial institutions of the developed world, whom they accuse
of creating economic policies that concentrate power and money
among a wealthy few.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to speak for those who can't speak,'' said Deepinder
Mayell, 20, a sophomore political science major from Boston
College. The problem, he said, is the increasing ``top-to-bottom''
structure of world economics, in which the poor in struggling
countries suffer for the benefit of everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are starting to realize the whole idea of economic
liberalization is the liberalization of exploitation of the poor,''
agreed Thomas Redman, a protester from California. ``Hopefully
people will get out and vote now.''
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested only about 20 people Sunday _ a mere shadow of
the 600 protesters detained on Saturday for parading without a
permit. Throughout the day, authorities kept a 50-block area of
downtown blocked off from protesters, but confronted the roaming
masses of activists only when they tried to break within the
security zone.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few violent outbursts. Several hours after police
successfully escorted the finance officials into their meetings _ a
mission accomplished, in some cases, in the predawn hours _ a group
of the ``anarchists'' tried to lunge through a police barricade not
far from the White House. The police responded with tear gas and
pepper spray, riding their motorcycles into the group until the
crowd dispersed. Many demonstrators were also beaten with clubs,
witnesses said, even as they shouted: ``Peaceful protest!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of tear gas is something we don't resort to unless we
absolutely have to,'' Washington Police Chief Charles Ramsey said
later at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   At around noon, another group dressed in black clothing and
combat boots tried to storm a line of police several blocks from
the IMF, chanting, ``Whose streets? Our streets!'' But because the
protesters were not threatening either the World Bank or the IMF
buildings, the police decided to simply drive away. Several
demonstrators then overturned Dumpsters, and one youth smashed the
rear window of a George Washington University police car.
</P>
<P>
   In general, however, the protests were overwhelmingly peaceful.
Thousands of people converged on a park near the White House known
as the Ellipse to attend the ``legal demonstration,'' an event
involving planned speeches. Elsewhere, the streets resembled a
college campus quad, or even the colorful Washington Square Park in
New York, more than the site of an angry political protest.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 1,000 students from Massachusetts _ and more than 300
from the Boston area _ made the pilgrimage to Washington, joining
thousands of young activists from across the country who converged
on the nation's capital at the end of last week.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Nugent, 20, a junior at the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst, was among them. He said he was motivated by ``human
suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we're trying to alleviate here,'' Nugent said, as
a group of protesters chanted nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Nugent admitted he had made the trip _ along with 500 students
from the five-college consortium of schools in Western
Massachusetts _ in part because of what he saw happen in Seattle.
Before that, he said, he ``didn't really know what it was all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Alex Cheney, 20, a sophomore from Boston College
who knew all about last year's WTO protests: He witnessed them,
having traveled to Seattle as part of a sociology project on global
justice. Sunday, Cheney said the police in Washington appeared far
better prepared _ and restrained _ than the Seattle police.
``They've stayed out of it for the most part,'' Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's almost a festival atmosphere,'' said Mayell, his
friend.
</P>
<P>
   There were sideshows everywhere. In a park across the street
from the World Bank, three women wearing shiny red formal gowns did
an interpretive performance of ``The Communist Manifesto.'' A block
away, a group of about a dozen protesters performed t'ai chi on a
lawn. One man played the clarinet on the sidewalk on 21st Street.
Several protesters carried giant puppets representing the heads of
the WTO, the IMF, and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In an angrier display, one demonstrator vandalized a bust of
George Washington at the entrance to George Washington University,
scribbling the word ``racist.'' Demonstrators hung a sign across
the entrance to a Chinese restaurant that read: ``World Bank + IMF
(EQ) Starving people.''
</P>
<P>
   There was even a protest for Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Burkhart, 40, of Arlington, Va., wore a sign that read:
``USA. Stop the Delay. Send Elian home now.'' Burkhart, who is
deaf, then wrote on a piece of paper that the greed of global
capitalists and the Miami relatives of the 6-year-old Cuban boy
were intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote: ``I am here to protest the IMF, Elian and the WTO.''

   (NYT13) WASHINGTON -- April 16, 2000 -- TRADE-VOICES -- Mike
Saltz, 22, a student at the University of Oregon in Eugene, sitting
on a park bench Sunday in the middle of downtown Washington.
Saturday, however, was a totally different experience for Saltz,
who was swept up in a mass arrest of roughly 600 people near the
IMF and World Bank headquarters. While simply trying to find some
friends at a rally, Saltz says he was corralled, arrested, cuffed
wrist to ankle and charged with parading without a permit, an
infraction legally less serious than a misdemeanor. ``I was really
shocked,'' he says. ``When it comes to disagreeing with the
dominant view, your rights are really out the window. They can do
whatever they want, they're the police.'' (Stephen Crowley/The New
York Times)

Graham Clark, left, as Mime and Stig Andersen, a Danish tenor, as
Siegfried at the Metropolitan Opera, part of Wagner's four-part
``Ring'' cycle. The opera has nearly four hours of music, and
Siegfried, the toughest dramatic tenor role in the entire
repertory, sings during most of it. He must portray an impulsive
and brawny youth. Yet it takes most tenors years to develop the
vocal heft and stamina to handle the music. (Sara Krulwich/The New

Glenn Carter has the title role in ``Jesus Christ Superstar,'' the
Andrew Lloyd Webber musical at the Ford Center for the Performing
Arts. ``Jesus Christ Superstar,'' which began as a concept record
album in 1970 before its varied reincarnations on stage and film,
has never been easy to translate into visual terms. Staged by the
Australian director Gale Edwards, the play follows a fairly
straightforward approach, clearly aimed at young audiences and
awash in emblems of youth-courting topicality. (Sara Krulwich/The

Sander M. Levin is a liberal Democrat from the Detroit suburbs who
proudly owns a 94 percent career voting record with organized
labor. Levin hardly fits the classic free-trade profile. Yet, the
68-year-old legislator is fine-tuning a plan that could give
wavering House Democrats the political cover they want to vote yes
on a the biggest trade deal of the decade, an accord with China.
``I'm an activist internationalist who's worked on both sides,
expanded trade and expanded issues of trade,'' says Levin. (Susana

But early sessions got under way as delegates were spirited to work
under extreme security. An estimated 2,000 police officers from
Washington and elsewhere are reported to have been mobilized for
the demonstrations, which are expected to continue on Monday when
World Bank policymakers are due to meet. (Susana Raab/The New York

Thousands of activists, from anarchists to environmental radicals,
have flocked to Washington vowing to shut down the meetings of IMF
policymakers and the World Bank. Protestors accuse the institutions
of impoverishing developing countries by imposing programs which
benefit multinational companies. Many of the demonstrators, with
tear gas masks in hand, were ready to take on local police, but
failed to stop the IMF policy meeting which went ahead as planned,
Sunday. (Paul Hosefros/The New York Times)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT4) WASHINGTON -- April 16, 2000 -- TRADE-PROTEST-1 --
Recalling an earlier era, protesters threw flowers at policeman
gathered to contain crowds on the streets of Washington during a
protest attended by hundreds against the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund meeting, Sunday. As crowds swelled,
police fired tear gas and clubbed and kicked demonstrators
attempting to disrupt the meeting, witnesses said. Protestors

shui is all about energy, and a Web site is pure energy,'' says

policymakers and the World Bank. Protestors accuse the institutions
of impoverishing developing countries by imposing programs which
benefit multinational companies. Many of the demonstrators, with
tear gas masks in hand, were ready to take on local police, but
failed to stop the IMF policy meeting which went ahead as planned,
Sunday. (Paul Hosefros/The New York Times)

Recalling an earlier era, protesters threw flowers at policeman
gathered to contain crowds on the streets of Washington during a
protest attended by hundreds against the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund meeting, Sunday. As crowds swelled,
police fired tear gas and clubbed and kicked demonstrators
attempting to disrupt the meeting, witnesses said. Protestors

imposing programs which benefit multinational companies. (Susana

EDWARD GOREY, ARTIST OF THE MACABRE, DIES AT 75 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: A short version of this obituary moved late Saturday
night.)  
 By MEL GUSSOW   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward Gorey, the artist and author who was a grand master of
the comic macabre and delighted generations of readers with his
spidery drawings and stories of hapless children, swooning maidens,
throbblefooted specters, threatening topiary and weird, mysterious
events on eerie Victorian landscapes, died on Saturday at Cape Cod
Hospital in Hyannis, Mass. He was 75 and lived in Yarmouth Port,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   He had suffered a heart attack on Wednesday, said Elizabeth
Morton, a cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Edmund Wilson, the first of many critics to extol Gorey's work,
described his world as ``poisonous and poetic.'' It was that and
much more: witty, woeful, devious and delirious to the point of
obsession. He was one of the most aptly named figures in American
art and literature. In creating a large body of small work, he made
an indelible imprint on noir fiction and on the psyche of his
admirers.
</P>
<P>
   Gorey, who wrote more than 100 books and illustrated more than
60 by other authors (from Edward Lear to Samuel Beckett), also had
a career in the theater _ with revues based on his stories _ and as
a scenic designer. ``Dracula,'' in the Gorey version, was a
Broadway hit in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   In person Gorey was as instantly identifiable as his work.
Toweringly tall, he had a white beard and frothy hair, an earring
in each lobe and rings on most of his fingers. When he lived in New
York, he often wore a raccoon coat, although later in life he
became sheepish about wearing fur.
</P>
<P>
   He looked foreboding, like a buccaneer between piracies or a
figure out of one of his books, and his self-portrait lurks on the
fringe of many of his stories. But in contrast to the work, the man
was genial and gentle, and sometimes childish in his language,
peppering his conversation with words like ``jeepers'' and
``zingy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this false idea that he was a brooding, melancholic
man,'' said Andreas Brown, a friend of Gorey and the owner of the
Gotham Book Mart in New York. ``He was not a recluse. He was jovial
and effervescent, and he loved to laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   The books could be bizarre in the extreme. His alphabet books
chronicle the mishaps of unfortunates deceived by fate. ``The
Gashlycrumb Tinies'' begins with ``A is for Amy who fell down the
stairs'' (a ghostly child plummeting headlong to her doom) and ends
with ``Z is for Zillah who drank too much gin.'' The stories of
peril are frightful, but with a strong sense of mockery.
</P>
<P>
   Though sometimes mistakenly categorized as an author of
children's books, Gorey appealed to all ages, at least to everyone
with a taste for the fanciful. Only a few of his books, including
``The Wuggly Ump'' and ``The Bug Book,'' were intended specifically
for young readers.
</P>
<P>
   In both his art and his writing Gorey was inimitable. Developing
crosshatched line-drawing into an art form, he used pen and ink to
create a world of barren moors, abandoned railway stations and
storm-struck formal gardens. A stroller in one of those gardens
could suddenly be brained by a piece of falling masonry, as in the
Gorey animated film that for years has acted as a prelude to the
``Mystery'' series on public television.
</P>
<P>
   In Goreyland the moon is a skull, and no sun shines. A tiny
green face peers through the curtained window of a black motor car.
Frightful beasts are perched on a crag, and upstairs in the listing
attic. Death is by drowning, dismemberment or being dropped by the
Devil into a flaming pit. The Beastly Baby is a bulbous blob
carried away by an eagle and exploding in midair.
</P>
<P>
   Gorey could be sportive as well as horrific, as in ``The Broken
Spoke,'' which, in his words, ``combines, with breathtaking
cleverness, two objects of consuming interest: postcards and
bicycles.'' Although sometimes confused with the cartoonist Charles
Addams, with whom he shared an interest in the ghoulish, Gorey
generally told cautionary tales that offered moral instruction
along with tearful laughter.
</P>
<P>
   As an artist he was close to Daumier and, with his aura of
surrealism, to Magritte, as in ``The Betrayed Confidence,'' a
series of pernicious postcards, closing with wordless pictures: a
dangling rope, an empty frying pan, an unmarked grave.
</P>
<P>
   As an author he bore the mark of S.J. Perelman, inventing an
atlas that found room for place names like Nether Postlude,
Backwater Hall in Mortshire (between West Elbow and Penetralia) and
the Cycle Cemetery near Dingy Cruet, Blots. He also played word
games with his name, anagrammatizing it in infinite ways, as Edward
Gorey became Ogdred Weary, Dogear Wryde and D. Awdrey-Gore.
</P>
<P>
   A passionate lover of the ballet, Gorey for years
ritualistically attended all performances of dances by George
Balanchine at the New York City Ballet. Often he dreamed up stories
about ballets and operas and occasionally designed sets, costumes
and drop curtains.
</P>
<P>
   For many years he lived in a cluttered apartment in New York,
and at the end of the ballet season he would leave for his home on
Cape Cod. After Balanchine's death in 1983, stripped of his primary
cultural outlet, Gorey began thinking seriously about leaving New
York permanently.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 he moved to Cape Cod, first to Barnstable, and then to
Yarmouth Port, eventually living alone in a 200-year-old house that
may or may not have been haunted.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 he mentioned to a visitor the strange disappearance of
all the finials from his lamps, along with his collection of tiny
teddy bears. The house was in disarray, with esoteric objects (a
toilet with a tabletop) and with no sign of Gorey's work. There
was, however, a definitive Gorey touch: poison ivy crept inside
through cracks in the wall.
</P>
<P>
   A speed reader of writers from Agatha Christie to Jane Austen,
he packed his home with books, many of them Victorian, and tempered
his scholarliness with subcultural pursuits, watching soap operas
and checking out horror movies from nearby video stores.
</P>
<P>
   A covey of cats shared his life and, in Gorey fashion, had free
run of the furniture. The number was usually five or six. If a
stray showed up at his door, he would immediately welcome it in.
(After his death a friend moved into the house to take care of the
cats.) Gorey remembered the time that the cats were on a couch and
suddenly ``everyone turned,'' eyes opening wide, as if someone, or
something, unseen had entered the room.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Gorey-like figure in his stories seemed icily
removed, the real Gorey was a friendly neighbor on Cape Cod,
holding court daily at Jack's Outback, a cafeteria-style coffee
shop. He would take his personal mug from a rack reserved for
regulars and join in the local gossip. He was close to his cousins,
some of whom lived nearby, but there are no immediate survivors.

 UNDATED: immediate survivors.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1994 he was told he had prostate cancer and diabetes, and he
met his illnesses with his customary cheerful demeanor. ``Why
haven't I burst into total screaming hysterics?'' he asked, and
added, ``I'm not entirely enamored of the idea of living forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward St. John Gorey, known to his friends as Ted, was born in
Chicago on Feb. 25, 1925, the son of a Hearst journalist. ``I like
to think of myself as a pale, pathetic, solitary child,'' he said.
``But it was not true.'' He taught himself to read at 3{, and by 5,
he had read ``Dracula'' and ``Alice in Wonderland,'' two books that
were to have a profound effect on his life.
</P>
<P>
   The protagonists, one evil incarnate (but he can't help it), the
other all innocence and curiosity (she gets what she deserves),
were to haunt his dreams and dominate his art. By 8, he had
graduated to reading Victor Hugo. He taught himself to draw and
subsequently took courses at the Art Institute of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Drafted into the Army at 18, he sat out the Second World War as
a company clerk and in 1946 entered Harvard, where he majored in
French literature and roomed with the poet Frank O'Hara. He and
O'Hara joined the Poets Theater in Cambridge, Gorey as a designer,
director and playwright.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation he remained in Boston, illustrating book
jackets. Then he went to New York and worked in the art department
at Doubleday, staying late in the office to create his own books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't envision a career in anything,'' he said, unless,
perhaps, it was running a bookstore. Unable to find a publisher, he
invented his own imprint, Fantod Press, and sold his books directly
to stores. His first book, ``The Unstrung Harp,'' was published in
1953.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Doubtful Guest'' (1958) quickly became a Gorey classic. In
it a strange, hook-nosed creature, wearing a long scarf and tennis
shoes, shows up uninvited at a dreary mansion and soon becomes a
permanent member of the family, peering up flues in the fireplace,
tearing up books and sleepwalking through the house. And after 17
years he showed ``no intention of going away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The West Wing'' (1963) is one of Gorey's wordless masterworks.
It is the house that is the central character, with its dark
passageways, doors leading to other doors, a carpet that looks like
a turbulent sea and shadows floating in space.
</P>
<P>
   A turning point in Gorey's career was his meeting with Andreas
Brown. When Brown bought the Gotham Book Mart, it became the
central clearing house for Gorey, presenting exhibitions of his
work in the store's gallery and eventually turning him into an
international celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   The Gotham sold great quantities of his books and also
collectibles: greeting cards, T-shirts (one reads, ``So many books,
so little time''), calendars and stuffed toys. With the publication
of his first anthology, ``Amphigorey'' (in 1972), followed by two
sequels, his audience widened.
</P>
<P>
   Gorey worked slowly and precisely, and because of his amiability
often overcommitted himself to projects. Suddenly he would be
struck with an idea, and that would draw him to his studio. In
Yarmouth Port he worked in a cubicle about the size of a Gorey
book. Pinned above his drawing table were postcards of paintings by
Goya and Matisse (his favorite artist) and of an Indian sculpture
of a tiger devouring a missionary.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was inspired by ``practically anything visual or
verbal'' and always tried to keep himself open to new experiences
and new images. When he saw the French silent movie ``L'Enfant de
Paris,'' he was so excited that he began making notes in the dark,
and then went home and wrote ``The Hapless Child.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Willowdale Handcar'' and other cliffhangers derive from
movies by D.W. Griffith. The moors murder case in England led to
``The Loathsome Couple.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``The Raging Tide: or, The Black Doll's Imbroglio,'' he drew
an impish inkblot named Figbash (inspired by Max Ernst), and then
years later produced a Figbash alphabet book. In his books, he
acted as his own scenic and costume designer and typographer. He
believed in hand lettering, even drawing the Library of Congress
number in his books.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``Dracula,'' Gorey's work has been the subject of
many theatrical revues, including ``Gorey Stories,'' ``Amphigorey''
and ``Tinned Lettuce.'' In recent years a series of revues were
done on Cape Cod for limited audiences, with the author supervising
as director.
</P>
<P>
   One friend regularly supplied him with dreams. Gorey always
insisted that he never used his own, which were ``grandiose
architectural dreams'' and occasionally horror movies. Late in life
he was troubled by insomnia, awake in the dark of night thinking
Gorey thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he published a new Christmas story, ``The Headless
Bust,'' subtitled ``A Melancholy Meditation on the False
Millennium.'' In a variation on a previous book, ``The Haunted
Tea-Cosy,'' Edmund Gravel (the Recluse of Lower Spigot) and the
Bahumbug (a pear-shaped insect with six limbs) embarked on a
disaster-prone journey through the village of Godly Wot. After
phantasmal adventures, the author concludes:
</P>
<P>
   ``They saw it was about to come:
</P>
<P>
   The end of the millennium,
</P>
<P>
   So find themselves perforce to be
</P>
<P>
   Into another century.''
</P>
<P>
   Once when he was asked why he wrote so much about murder and
other forms of violence, Gorey answered: ``Well, I don't know. I
guess I'm interested in real life.''

   TECHNOLOGY STOCK SELL-OFF CAUSES A WAVE OF ANXIETY
</P>
<P>
   The steep drop last week in the price of technology stocks,
punctuating a three-week slide, seems to mark a turning point in
perceptions. Unless the technology shares rebound quickly, the
Internet industry will no longer be seen as a sure thing for
investors and entrepreneurs hoping to cash in quickly.
</P>
<P>
   A few bad days are one thing, but with the shares of many
leading technology companies down by 40 percent or 50 percent in
less than a month, the sell-off is causing anxiety across the New
Economy.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA ECONOMY SURGED IN QUARTER

which sells luxury homes, concluding that the site was not aligned

misplaced ``help'' and ``dream'' buttons. Barbara Corcoran, whose

   CANADA PRESS BARON ASSAILS BISHOP
</P>
<P>
   Conrad Black, the Canadian press baron, attacked the local
bishop in Calgary, Alberta, early this month, writing in The
Calgary Herald that the bishop was a Leninist-style ``useful
idiot,'' among other things. Calgary's Christian leaders condemned
the statement.

   PARENTS DISPUTE A DAUGHTER'S TALE
</P>
<P>
   The article ``Party's Over'' in the April issue of Allure is
full of family intrigue, sex and alcohol abuse. In the article,
Taylor Stein _ blond habitue of the New York party circuit, speaks
at length about how the childhood neglect she suffered contributed
to her alcoholism. But there is one question of ethics raised by
the article: The magazine never checked out Stein's stories with
her parents, and in fact points out that it obtained the interview
on the condition that it would not do so. Her parents now say the
tale is a fabrication.

   TECHNOLOGY HURDLES FOR ONLINE MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   The record companies BMG and Sony Music Entertainment recently
announced long-awaited plans to sell their music online through
digital downloads. But the fine print suggests that mainstream
Internet users are not going to buy their music digitally any time
soon. Despite the promise of digital downloads for the masses, the
technical challenges could continue to confine the audience mainly
to college students.

   NEW APPROACH TO `AFFINITY PORTALS'
</P>
<P>
   A fresh spin is emerging on ``affinity portals'' _ gateways
aimed at every slice of the Internet population. Rather than spend
millions persuading group members to come to a portal designed for
them, companies are working with associations that already cater to
such groups to build portals for their members.

POLICE, PROTESTERS BOTH MAKE THEIR POINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With gas masks on their faces and nightsticks in
hand, riot police Sunday peered across a steel barricade near the
White House at a surging wave of protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Police Chief Charles Ramsey, who had vowed that the
demonstrators ``aren't burning our city like they burned Seattle,''
edged closer as the crowd advanced across the remnants of broken
bottles that officers had dodged earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the protesters wore bandanas over their faces. They had
etched their lawyers' phone numbers on their arms. And some had
spoken of anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   But as Ramsey prepared to issue a command, the demonstrators
stopped short, inches from the police line and several blocks from
the targets of the crowd's wrath: world financial leaders who were
at the headquarters of the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   No mayhem. No mass arrests. No black mark on the nation's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what democracy looks like!'' the demonstrators
chanted, as Ramsey issued the ``all clear.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the ominous buildup, the first major demonstration
against the World Bank and IMF since a disastrous riot last year in
Seattle began with only isolated and relatively minor violence.
Police clubbed several protesters, squirted pepper spray in the
eyes of several others, and unleashed tear gas to quell another
skirmish.
</P>
<P>
   But in a city where generations of Americans have aired their
grievances, day one of the two-day ``Mobilization for Global
Justice'' may be remembered as a footnote in the annals of social
protest, a pale successor to the tear-gas clouded antiwar rallies
of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, organizers failed to shut down or substantially
disrupt the meeting of world economic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this march on Washington had the flavor of a new
revolution for a new century. Steelworkers stood shoulder to
shoulder with socialists. Environmental activists shared the
streets with protesters seeking freedom for a convicted police
killer. A banner promoting the Progressive Librarians Guild
fluttered near a placard that said, ``Poodles Before Profits.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial leaders of the richest nations have become symbols
of all that the demonstrators detest, from Third World poverty to
the shrinking polar cap. And the number of grievances was nearly as
vast as the size of the crowd, about 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the convergence of a lot of groups that finally have
found they have more in common than what was dividing them,'' said
Will Miller, a philosophy professor at the University of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, hoisting a ``Green Mountain Veterans for Peace'' sign
across from the White House, arrived in Washington with two
busloads of Vermonters. A longtime social activist, he said he was
heartened by what he considered the most exuberant protest movement
since ``the disinvestment struggle in the mid-1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was that graying veterans of the 1960s counterculture
clasped hands with teenage vegans. There were antiviolence
activists and avowed agitators. Some flashed peace signs at riot
police as others set upon unoccupied police cruisers, smashing
windows, flattening tires, and spray-painting the vehicles with an
``A'' for ``anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   They converged from across the country for a burst of street
theater, played out amid the scream of sirens and the whir of a
hovering police helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the hurly-burly, the peaceful took solace in their
solidarity despite their failure to ruin the economic summit. ``The
fact that so many people came out makes it less disappointing,''
said Karen Benson of Andover, N.H., a student at Gordon College in
Wenham, Mass. ``We've come a long way in educating people about
what's wrong so something can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that there were so many issues to cover: the Navy
bombing range in Puerto Rico, the Singrauli power plant in India,
human rights abuses in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Cameroon, among other
consequences of ``neocolonialism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making a big statement,'' said Rebecca Riofrio, a union
organizer from Hartford. ``But speaking with one voice is the best
way to challenge institutions that are working to make sure things
don't change.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, the message was simple. As the economic ministers
dined on shrimp and chicken entrees amid extraordinary security,
protesters who were cordoned off blocks away hoisted signs that
said, ``Eating is political.''

GORDON TAKES DIEHARD 500 TO END LOSING STREAK 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE NOBLES   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLADEGA, Ala. _ Seconds after he crossed the finish line as
the winner of the DieHard 500 Sunday, Jeff Gordon began yelling and
screaming and waving his arms, a sustained outpouring of emotion
that once was reserved for clinching his three Nascar Winston Cup
Series titles.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a different time for Gordon, and Sunday's victory
spelled relief with a capital R. It also helped silence many of
Gordon's budding critics. He came into Sunday's race without a
victory in his last 13 races, conspicuous futility for a driver who
had won 40 races from 1996 through 1999. It was his 50th victory
over all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it hasn't been forever, but it has been a while and
we've had to listen to a lot of things,'' Gordon said after taking
the lead with five laps to go and holding on to edge Mike Skinner
by less than a fifth of a second _ about two car lengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criticisms take a toll on you eventually,'' Gordon added.
``When you get knocked down a notch, it's tough. I think this
showed what we're made of when we're down.''
</P>
<P>
   What made this victory even sweeter for the 28-year-old Gordon
is that he won after starting from the 36th position, a Talladega
record. He broke the mark for the worst starting position for a
winner, held by Dale Earnhardt Sr., who won from the 27th spot in
last year's Winston 500.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon learned during the race that the middle lane in the
sometimes three-wide racing gave his car more kick. He first
surfaced among the top 10 racers by Lap 40. After being shuffled
back for most of the next 40 laps, he re-emerged for good among the
contenders by Lap 90.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were in the middle lane, you could go to the front,''
he said. ``If you weren't, you'd go to the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon took the lead for the first time on the 103rd lap and led
another 23 laps of the 188-lap race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think coming from 36th that we could do what we did
today,'' he said. ``I was just in shock that I got the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   The shock had worn off by the time he reached victory lane,
$159,755 richer.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, the ninth different winner through nine races this
season, moved from 12th to seventh in the Winston Cup standing.
Mark Martin, who finished sixth despite leading 99 laps, took the
overall point lead from Bobby Labonte, who was part of a 16-car
pileup and finished 21st.
</P>
<P>
   No leaders were involved in the wreck, which came on Lap 137
heading into the track's 2.66-mile trioval. The rookie Scott Pruett
caused it after he suddenly dropped low on the track. There was one
problem with that move: Michael Waltrip occupied that spot. The
affected cars quickly began ricocheting off one another, with smoke
creating a haze over the crunching sounds of high-powered
machinery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was minding my own business _ they just ran into me,'' said
Waltrip, who planned to run Monday in the Boston Marathon as a
diversion from ``this craziness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was real proud of this group of drivers to that point,''
Waltrip said. ``But just one mistake and you get a wreck like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Musgrave, one of four drivers treated and released from the
infield medical center, said he thought he had dodged the mess
until he was hit from behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``From there we were just a Ping-Pong ball,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other drivers treated were Tony Stewart, Steve Park and Dick
Trickle. ``I never liked restrictor-plate racing,'' Stewart said,
referring to the devices used to reduce speeds. ``It's not real
racing to me. Eventually, this was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 16 of the 43 cars completed all 188 laps.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett, the defending Winston Cup champion, persevered,
though the race turned sour for him on the 120th lap. Running
second, Jarrett ran out of gas before he could reach pit road. He
compounded that by getting flagged for speeding as he left pit
road, drawing a penalty that left him 33rd when he rejoined the
field. He finished 17th.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt flirted with his third straight Talladega victory
before finishing a close third, helping Chevrolet gain the top four
places. It was the sixth top-10 performance this season for
Earnhardt, who will be 49 later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt had faltered for several years after a 1996 wreck
here, the most severe of his career. His car was bumped into a
wall, flipped and slid down the track on its side as two other cars
buffeted him around. He fractured his sternum and collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been eating his Wheaties or something,'' Rusty Wallace
said Sunday. ``I don't think he ever thought he'd be this strong.
It's pretty inspiring.'' &QL;

MUGABE GIVES BLESSING TO VETERANS' FARM TAKEOVERS  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ One day after a white farmer and two opposition
leaders were killed in separate acts of political violence,
Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe defied rising domestic and
international pressure to restore the rule of law in his country
and called on supporters yesterday to continue invading white-owned
commercial farms.
</P>
<P>
   Returning from a week in Cuba, Mugabe reversed a call by his
deputy for an end to the farm attacks carried out by veterans of
Zimbabwe's liberation war and others loyal to the president. The
invasions twice have been ruled illegal by the country's High Court
since they started two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there is an expectation that I will say to the war
veterans, `Get off the land.' I will not say or do that,'' Mugabe
said, blaming white farmers and opposition supporters for the
country's turmoil. ``To my supporters, I say retaliate. Hit back,
but don't kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe has slid into a state of near-anarchy as Mugabe
struggles to fend off a rapidly growing opposition movement that
poses the first real threat to his rule in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago the Movement for Democratic Change, or MDC, which
has its roots in the labor sector, rallied workers to reject a new
constitution proposed by Mugabe and his ruling Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic Front. A nationwide survey conducted by
Gallup last February found that 68 percent of rural and urban
adults had ``not much, very little, or no confidence'' in Mugabe,
giving movement leaders confidence that they can win at least 65
percent of the seats in upcoming parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   Rattled by the defeat of his draft constitution, Mugabe resorted
to the emotional issue of land to shore up his support, inciting
war veterans, a tiny but influential constituency, to invade
white-owned farms. The veterans fought against colonial Rhodesia to
recover land, the most fertile of which lies predominantly in white
hands, but remain landless 20 years after independence.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's supporters have invaded more than 900 farms since late
February. The police, widely seen as progovernment, have done
little to intervene or comply with the High Court's orders to
remove the squatters. Although the attacks were hostile, damage was
restricted mostly to property until late last week, when political
violence escalated sharply.
</P>
<P>
   The first farmer to be killed, David Stevens, was hauled off his
land Saturday by about 40 government supporters and taken to a
police station in the town of Morowe, northeast of the capital,
Harare. Five fellow farmers followed Stevens to the station, where
they were handcuffed and handed back over to the angry mob.
</P>
<P>
   The surviving white men said they were beaten repeatedly with
metal pipes. Stevens, reported to be an MDC activist, and a friend,
John Osbourne, were then taken to the headquarters of the war
veterans association, where they were beaten again. The two men
were moved a third time, to a location outside town, where Stevens,
a father of four, was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Lying in a hospital bed Sunday, Osbourne told reporters that
``they took David around the back'' of a building, ``they beat him
up very badly and then they shot him'' with a shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not about land,'' Osbourne said. ``It was about
politics. None of those vets was interested in land. The major
pummeling we got was trying to get us to say we're all MDC.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on Saturday, two movement officials were burned to death
when their car was hit with a Molotov cocktail, according to
opposition spokesmen. That attack follows an ambush late last week
that remains somewhat murky.
</P>
<P>
   According to Job Sikhala, the movement's head of security and
intelligence, three buses carrying opposition leaders and
supporters from a rally was attacked last Tuesday near Mt. Darwin,
a town nearly two hours from Harare. Sikhala, who received injuries
in the attacks, said five people were killed, 66 were injured, and
33 more went missing. Zimbabwean defense forces broke up the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   The chief police inspector in Bindura, where many of the victims
were taken to a hospital, denied that anyone was killed.
</P>
<P>
   There are growing indicators that Mugabe is becoming
increasingly isolated at home. Last week the military chiefs said
publicly that Zimbabwe's armed forces, long a formidable ally of
Mugabe, would be loyal to whoever won the parliamentary elections,
which must be held before Aug. 11, according to constitutional
rules. Last week, the High Court rejected the government's
assertions that it could not stop the farm invasions, and ordered
police to evict the squatters.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the court's ruling last Thursday, Vice President
Joseph Msika, acting on Mugabe's behalf, called for an end to the
campaign against the farmers. Government sources said Msika had
consulted with Mugabe prior to issuing his statement, and that
three top ministers held meetings throughout the weekend to
persuade the veterans to comply with the court order. Reversing
those efforts Sunday, Mugabe increased his government's
antagonistic stance. ``We have warned the white farmers not to be
provocative, not to take up arms, not to resist,'' he said. ``If
they do not they will suffer the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in India on Sunday, British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said Mugabe was overseeing ``the destruction of his own
country.'' Mugabe accuses Britain, Zimbabwe's colonial power, of
blocking land reform, even though London has donated roughly $70
million for farm transfers.

EDITORIAL: THE REBEL FLAG IN SOUTH CAROLINA 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, April 17:
</P>
<P>
   When South Carolinians brag about their state, they typically
talk about the beautiful beaches and the bustling industrial
corridor between Spartanburg and Greenville. But the attempt to
portray the Palmetto State as a good place to vacation and do
business has been tarnished for years by the Legislature's refusal
to remove the Confederate flag from the Statehouse dome.
</P>
<P>
   The flag continues to fly despite condemnation by the state's
major business leaders and an economic boycott that has prompted
sports figures and entertainers to decline appearances in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for keeping the flag have tried to portray it as an
important historical symbol of Southern pride. But in recent
decades the Confederate battle flag has been used primarily as a
symbol of resistance to civil rights and full equality for black
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The flag's defenders seemed to relent last week, when the state
Senate advanced a plan that would remove this emblem from the
Capitol's dome and place it near a Confederate memorial in front of
the building. Unable to block the measure, black senators agreed to
the plan, saying it was the best they could hope for.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate compromise has generated protest from black
lawmakers in the state's House of Representatives, who rightly
point out that every black person who does business in the
Statehouse would be required to walk directly by this emblem of
segregation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the NAACP's South Carolina branch has unanimously
rejected the deal. The group's national president, Kweisi Mfume,
issued a blistering statement, saying the deal ``added insult to
injury'' and threatening to expand an economic boycott that is
clearly hurting the state.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, a flag that symbolizes racism and segregation has
no place at all on state property, much less at the Statehouse
door. If those who govern South Carolina fail to grasp this, the
state will continue to suffer in the court of public opinion.

EDITORIAL: BUSH'S NEW LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, April 17:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Gov. George W. Bush was a battered victor in the
presidential race, seemingly beholden to right-wing leaders who had
rescued his candidacy. Vice President Al Gore appeared set to
dominate the issues with proposals on health, children, schools and
the environment. But lately Bush has shifted tactics _ releasing a
barrage of domestic proposals, appearing at urban schools and
meeting with gay Republicans. He seems eager to retrieve the
``compassionate conservative'' label and flesh it out. The
governor's proposals have good features and flaws. They are also
costly and somewhat undercut by his Texas record. But they bring a
welcome new phase to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   After clinching the GOP nomination, Bush has proposed an
increase in education spending, a tax credit to help families buy
health insurance, a proposal to clean up toxic ``brown fields'' and
other measures. His military and domestic spending proposals would
add $86 billion to the budget over five years. But it is fair to
ask how the governor would pay for everything while saving Social
Security and Medicare, retiring the debt and cutting taxes. Indeed,
both Gore and Bush may have to be more careful about using up
surpluses that could shrink because of declines in the stock market
or a possible economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore has begun to point out, it is also worth examining what
Bush tried to accomplish in Texas to determine if he has been as
good as his word. On education, the governor's record is rated as
solid by many independent analysts. He has increased school
spending and tried to enforce standards. A profile of Bush by
Nicholas Lemann in The New Yorker said the governor's childhood
resentment of being stigmatized as a low achiever has led him to
reach out to minorities and others left behind by a failed school
system.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush record on health and the environment is something else,
however. As Adam Clymer reported in The New York Times last week,
Bush appears not to have even tried to expand health coverage, even
though he had the money to do it. The Gore campaign has also begun
charging that the reason Texas has one of the poorest environmental
records in the nation is that the governor's campaigns, along with
those of others in the Texas political establishment, have been
bankrolled by the state's worst polluters. Bush may have a tougher
time defending himself in these areas.
</P>
<P>
   The healthy aspect of these proposals is that the public will be
able to weigh the exchanges on the merits. It is good that Bush,
while embracing the mistaken idea of vouchers for schools, has at
least recognized _ as no recent GOP presidential candidate has _
that there is also a role for increased federal involvement and
expenditures in education. A debate about market-oriented versus
government-oriented health care plans is also welcome. Bush's push
toward moderation may well invite charges of hypocrisy by Gore, who
has had a long record on the environment, health care and
education. The vice president can also make the claim that he knows
how to do these things and still produce fiscally sound budgets.
But such exchanges are what campaigns are for.

DOROTHY HART, 94, WHO COMPILED FAMOUS BROTHER-IN-LAW'S LYRICS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dorothy Hart, the editor of two highly praised books of song
lyrics by her brother-in-law, Lorenz Hart, of Rodgers and Hart
fame, died April 11 at a hospital in Ontario, Calif. She was 94 and
lived in Rancho Mirage, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Hart was the widow of Lorenz Hart's brother, Theodore, a
comedian. She and Robert Kimball edited ``The Complete Lyrics of
Lorenz Hart'' (Knopf, 1986), containing some 670 of the songs
Lorenz Hart wrote before his death in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   The book was lauded by the cabaret singer Bobby Short in The New
York Times Book Review. He said Hart ``took on the herculean task
of compiling Larry Hart's historic works a decade ago'' for her
other book, ``Thou Swell, Thou Witty,'' which Short said was ``an
admirable effort on its own, but, as it turns out, it was merely
the tip of the iceberg.''
</P>
<P>
   Short wrote that Hart and Kimball, an expert on the musical
theater, ``left no stone unturned in their search for every lyric
ascribed to Hart,'' and ``what has been achieved here is something
monumental.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart edited ``Thou Swell, Thou Witty'' (Da Capo, 1976) and wrote
a memoir included in the book. One critic said that work was
``indispensable for anyone interested in Hart, which is to say
anyone interested in Broadway musical comedy, and Hart's words are
honest, unpretentious and affecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son, also named Lorenz, said ``Thou Swell, Thou Witty'' had
played a critical role in the growth of the popularity of Rodgers
and Hart songs that he said had taken place since then. The
best-known Rodgers and Hart songs include ``The Lady Is a Tramp,''
``Manhattan'' and ``Blue Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart, the former Dorothy Lubow, was born in Brooklyn. She left
school at 16 and became a dancer. Then she spent years as a writer
and columnist for show-business fan magazines. She married her
husband in 1938. He died in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her son, of Arlington, Va., she is survived by a
granddaughter.

 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
TALLADEGA, Ala. _ Sunday was a day of vindication for Jeff Gordon,
who proved he can win with the new version of the Rainbow Warriors.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gordon had equaled his longest losing streak at 13 races, but he
made it back to Victory Lane in the No. 24 Dupont Chevrolet by
outdriving the competition in the final laps and winning the
DieHard 500 at the Talladega Superspeedway.
</P>
<P>
   The three-time Winston Cup champion became a record ninth winner
in nine races this year, taking the lead for good with five laps to
go when he passed Mark Martin coming out of turn 4.
</P>
<P>
   More than 180,000 spectators were on their feet as Gordon
managed to hold off a pack of cars behind him in the final laps to
earn his first victory since October of last season at Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pretty emotional for me,'' Gordon said of his 50th
career win. ``It hasn't been forever, but it has been awhile. We've
had to listen to a lot of criticism, and it takes a toll on you. I
think this shows what we're made of.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon held off Mike Skinner, who finished .189 seconds back in
second. Dale Earnhardt, trying to win his third consecutive race at
Talladega, was third by edging Kenny Irwin at the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   But this was a day when Gordon silenced the critics who wondered
if the Wonder Boy could win without former crew chief and mentor
Ray Evernham.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon also lost five members of the pit crew who switched to
Dale Jarrett's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were down, but I never lost faith in this team,'' Gordon
said. ``Nobody pointed fingers or got mad. We brought in some new
guys, and I'm so proud of them. They have been able to overcome a
lot of stuff and keep their heads up to do what we had to do to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   It also was a special day for Robbie Loomis, who left Petty
Enterprises to become Gordon's crew chief this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the best night's sleep I've had in a long time,''
Loomis said. ``I said from the beginning I didn't expect to fill
Ray's shoes, but there has been a lot of pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Loomis made the right adjustments on a day when the cars in the
draft were running about 190 mph _ 10 mph slower than last year at
Talladega _ because of NASCAR-mandated smaller air holes in the
carburetor restrictor plates.
</P>
<P>
   But it made for exciting racing within a bunched field, with 27
lead changes among 10 drivers. It also enabled cars in the back to
work their way to the front.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon started 36th, the lowest starting spot for any winner in
the 31-year history of Talladega racing.
</P>
<P>
   With 20 laps to go in the 188-lap event, 20 cars still were in
the lead pack. At least eight cars still had a chance to win when
Gordon went to the front for the final time.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was running third when second-place Jeremy Mayfield
bumped leader Martin and went outside on the backstretch. That gave
Gordon a chance to push forward while Martin had to contend with
Jarrett, who was in front of Martin, trying to stay on the lead
lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked to get the lead,'' Gordon said. ``Martin had
Jarrett in front of him, and I think that hurt him. I was able to
take advantage of it. I had some momentum and made the pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily, Skinner went with me to push me ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who led 98 laps, finished sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 12 car (Mayfield) was real anxious and made a move too
soon,'' Martin said. ``That's what cost us.''
</P>
<P>
   After Gordon took the lead, Skinner stayed right on his bumper
the last five laps, but he couldn't get around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff has a lot of experience in situations like that,''
Skinner said. ``I wasn't going to wreck him to win the race. I
didn't want to win my first race by spinning out a guy who raced me
clean all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny Irwin tried to push me to the front, but it just didn't
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt was running fourth and went outside in turn 3 to try
to catch the leaders, but it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw Dale get a run on Kenny, I pulled in front of Dale
and was going to make him wreck me to pass me,'' said Skinner,
Earnhardt's teammate. ``But I got to the finish line before he got
to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor to finish ahead of him because he's the best in
the draft I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, who has won a record nine times at Talladega, wasn't
pleased with the new restrictor-plate rules for the 2.66 mile
tri-oval.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place has gone from speedway racing to short-track
racing,'' Earnhardt said. ``It's getting worse and worse. The more
we slow the horsepower down, the more we get bunched up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was bumping like it was Martinsville. I almost got
turned around two or three times. It was a rock-em, sock-em day.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who won $159,755, managed to survive the bumper-banging
and take the checkered flag. Gordon, 28, usually hears a lot of
boos when he wins, but the Talladega fans cheered the man they used
to love to hate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really surprised me,'' Gordon said. ``I always understood
why there were times when they pulled against us, because nobody
likes someone who wins too much. It's normal to pull for the
underdog, and that's what we were this time.''

EDITORIAL: A JUDICIAL REBUKE FOR NEW YORK CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, April 17:
</P>
<P>
   A state judge last week issued a sharp rebuke to the way the
Giuliani administration has awarded private contracts to operate
the city's welfare-to-work program. State Supreme Court Justice
William Davis concluded that the administration's granting of two
contracts worth $104 million to Maximus, a job placement company,
was corrupted by favoritism and other improprieties.
</P>
<P>
   Since February City Comptroller Alan Hevesi has been battling
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani over the truncated, biased process by which
the administration awarded some $470 million of contracts to
private firms hired to place welfare recipients in private-sector
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Hevesi charged that the city failed to meet legal requirements
in the contracting process by negotiating the contracts instead of
putting them out for competitive bidding. He refused to give final
approval to 17 contracts. But an odd provision in the City Charter
allows the mayor to override the comptroller's judgment and require
approval of contracts despite charges of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Hevesi eventually approved 15 of the contracts under protest,
but he refused to sign off on two contracts with Maximus, the
largest winner.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani sued Hevesi to force him to register those two
contracts, arguing that the comptroller had no power to refuse the
mayor's direction. Davis refused to order Hevesi to approve the
Maximus contracts on the grounds that ``to do so would place a
judicial imprimatur on a process that has been corrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   The justice agreed with Hevesi that there was no rationale for
using a less competitive process than normal in awarding the
contracts. He found that there had been extensive meetings between
city officials and Maximus executives prior to the formal
contracting process that gave the company an unfair advantage.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that Maximus had misled city administrators about
the role that Richard Schwartz, a former senior adviser to the
mayor on welfare policy, played in its contract proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is appealing the decision. And for some
related policy and research contracts, the city is said to be
seeking an alternative financing plan that would not require
Hevesi's approval. Maximus has announced that it will suspend its
operations in the city for now.
</P>
<P>
   Further litigation against the comptroller will not help the
city put into place an effective welfare-to-work program. Instead
of fighting in court, Giuliani should restart the competitive
bidding process, making sure that it is not tainted by favoritism.

EDITORIAL: IMPENDING FAMINE IN ETHIOPIA  
 &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, April 17:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The images from the Horn of Africa are sadly familiar _ the
hollow eyes of emaciated mothers, the stick-like limbs and
distended bellies of dying children cradled in their arms. Fifteen
years after a million of its people perished in a devastating
famine, the specter of famine looms again in Ethiopia. A repeat of
that disaster need not happen if the world reinforces a relief
effort that could save hundreds of thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has warned that as many as 16 million people
in 10 countries across East Africa are threatened by renewed
famine. Half of them are in Ethiopia, primarily in the Ogaden
region bordering Somalia, where three years of drought has parched
the land and dried up wells. Casualties thus far are relatively
limited, but in some towns children are dying at a rate of a dozen
a day. During the last famine, the dictatorship of Mengistu Haile
Mariam prevented the distribution of food to areas that supported
rebel armies. The current government, led by Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi, has been more cooperative with international relief
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has promised to send 432,000 tons of food to
Ethiopia. The European Union has pledged to send more than 400,000
tons. But the U.N. estimates that it may need twice that much to
avert widespread famine by the end of June. It takes two to three
months for food to reach the stricken areas. So the time for urgent
action is now.
</P>
<P>
   Though the famine has been caused by drought, it is compounded
by Ethiopia's calamitous border war with Eritrea. The war is far
from the famine areas, but it has sapped the economies of both
these impoverished countries. Prime Minister Meles and the Eritrean
leader, Issaias Afwerki, have agreed to participate in talks this
month in Algiers, backed by Washington and the Organization of
African Unity. They owe it to their long-suffering countrymen to
negotiate in good faith and refrain from further military action.
In so doing they could help save thousands of lives.

USC PUTS BEST FOOT FORWARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC's kicking woes this spring could lead to a big
summer surprise, as Trojans coach Paul Hackett said this weekend he
is considering letting punter Mike MacGillivray take a shot at
winning the place-kicking job.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's definitely a possibility,'' Hackett said. ``He's
game-tested and it's something he could do. I think a guy who is a
veteran guy might be able to do it. It's hard to do but not
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett is mulling the switch because neither David Bell nor
David Newbury distinguished themselves in spring practice. They
made 1 of 6 field goals in light scrimmaging Saturday, and were 1
for 5 in last week's scrimmage at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This spring practice was about these two guys having a chance
to show what they could do, and it was very dismal,'' Hackett said.
``We're going to continue to use those two guys but also have to
bring someone else into the pool.''
</P>
<P>
   MacGillivray has yearned to kick since he came to USC, and made
a 54-yard field goal at Loyola High.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did both at Loyola and it was no problem,'' MacGillivray
said. ``If the coaches approach me, I'll work hard. I've worked on
it before. When I first came here, I didn't know what I was going
to be doing so I prepared for both.''
</P>
<P>
   Depth chart adjustments: As USC closed spring practice, some
positions cleared up, while others remain open.
</P>
<P>
   At tailback, Hackett said junior Malaefou MacKenzie took a
slight lead but he and sophomore Sultan McCullough will split time.
Another spot that will platoon players is defensive end, where
senior Sultan Abdul-Malik took the lead over junior Lonnie Ford.
</P>
<P>
   One position that firmed up is strongside linebacker, where
junior Kori Dickerson beat out freshman Chris Prosser and junior
John Cousins.
</P>
<P>
   At strong safety, sophomore Troy Polamalu appears to have beaten
out senior Ife Ohalete, but Ohalete will probably start at free
safety. At fullback, junior Charlie Landrigan held off a strong
challenge from sophomore Chad Pierson, though both will play.
</P>
<P>
   And at right tackle, freshman Jacob Rogers has won the job at
least until true freshman Joe McGuire arrives in August.
</P>
<P>
   Three drafted: USC wide receiver Windrell Hayes was selected by
the New York Jets in the fifth round, tailback Chad Morton was
chosen by the New Orleans Saints in the fifth round, and strong
safety David Gibson went to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the sixth
round Sunday in the NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting a little worried,'' Gibson said. ``It was a
little later than I had hoped, but I'll take it. I like the coaches
and (former USC cornerback) Brian Kelly is there, and it's a lot
better to go where you know someone. I can make my car payments
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those attending Gibson's draft-day party was Mater Dei
quarterback Matt Leinart, who was offered a scholarship by the
Trojans last month.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Cornerback Antuan Simmons, who missed spring
practice after undergoing back surgery in November, is expected to
be 100 percent by Aug. 1. Outside linebacker Markus Steele, held
out of contact drills after undergoing shoulder surgery, has begun
upper body weightlifting and expects to be cleared for full contact
by Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll know how I feel the first day of training camp,'' Steele
said. ``I'll try to hit somebody. I can't wait to hit somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Training camp: The Trojans begin practicing at UC Irvine on Aug.
6, and will spend nearly three weeks there before heading for the
Meadowlands to play Penn State in the Kickoff Classic on Aug. 27.

GIANTS GO LONG SHOT IN THE THIRD ROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: The following story, previously eliminated from NYT News
Service budget, is now restored)  By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ For all but one pick during the
weekend's National Football League draft, the Giants made choices
that were reasoned, rational and, perhaps most surprising of all,
predictable.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants took a Heisman Trophy winner, the first in franchise
history; a linebacker from Penn State; a tackle from Alabama and a
cornerback from Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the third-round selection, the choice that
fits the mix like a canary yellow Nehru jacket in a closet full of
blue and gray suits.
</P>
<P>
   He was Ron Dixon, a wide receiver from tiny Lambuth University,
a former women's college in west Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon is a speedy, slender, long-legged receiver and
kick-returner whom the Giants consider a discovery and most would
label a colossal long shot. Dixon played one year at Lambuth, which
belongs to the National Association for Intercollegiate Athletics,
a class of football comparable to Division III in the National
Collegiate Athletic Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' 2000 draft may ultimately be remembered for Ron
Dayne, the first-round pick who could bring an end to the tumult
that has enveloped the team's running back position since Rodney
Hampton retired. But it was Dixon who brought the spice and
intrigue to the Giants' draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's inexperienced, but he's an electrifying player and you
just have to take some risks in this business,'' Giants General
Manager Ernie Accorsi said of Dixon, who scored 22 touchdowns in 11
games last season for Lambuth.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1-inch, 183-pound Dixon, the last pure speed receiver
the Giants had listed on their draft board, also caught 89 passes,
averaged 19.5 yards a catch and returned three kicks for
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to get speed from this draft,'' Accorsi said. ``Other
people probably had Dixon targeted at a later round, but we wanted
him, so we took him.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Giants chose Dixon late Saturday night as the 73rd pick
over all, they insisted he was not a secret in the NFL. And Sunday,
in a conference call with reporters, Dixon said several teams had
contacted him, including the Jets, who recently flew him to New
York for a physical.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon, 24, acknowledged that he was surprised when he heard his
name called in the third round because he had been told he might be
taken in a later round. But Dixon was convinced he deserved to be
taken in the second or third round.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was at Florida or someplace, I would have been a
first-round or second-round pick,'' Dixon said. ``The only reason I
was at Lambuth was because of the bad judgment calls I made in my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon was ruled academically ineligible at various stages after
graduating from a Florida high school. He attended three community
colleges _ Lake Sumpter and Tallahassee in Florida and Itawamba in
Mississippi _ as well as Western Georgia, an NCAA Division II
school. He also agreed to attend Central Florida, but substandard
test scores kept him from keeping that commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't grown up yet,'' Dixon said of those years. ``I wasn't
into my books when I should have been.''
</P>
<P>
   With one year of football eligibility left, Dixon earned enough
credits to enroll at Lambuth. He was referred there by an
acquaintance of Lambuth's head coach, Vic Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to assess the level of competition he faced at Lambuth,
Dixon answered, ``It was NAIA level, and I was above that _ put it
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Today the Giants provided reporters with a videotape of one of
Dixon's games, which showed him catching several passes and
returning a kickoff for a touchdown virtually untouched. Dixon
displayed a high-stepping running style and an ability to catch the
football.
</P>
<P>
   As an aside, it was easy to notice that the rows of bleachers
next to the field were almost empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologize to Giants fans because I'm sure they were looking
for a big-ticket guy,'' Dixon said. ``But give me a little time and
I'll show them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon's presence muddles the future for Brian Alford, the
receiver the Giants selected for his speed in the third round two
years ago. And it is worth questioning how Dixon is going to make
an impact when Alford played four years of Big Ten football at
Purdue and has not been able to get on the field in two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But Accorsi said the Giants needed more than one quick receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rams have about eight of them,'' he said of the Super Bowl
champions. ``Everyone is going to multiple-wide-receiver sets
now.''
</P>
<P>
   In Rounds 4 through 7 Sunday, the Giants followed a routine
course, taking two linebackers, a cornerback and a defensive end.
Brandon Short, the fourth-round pick from Penn State, may have the
best chance to make an immediate contribution. He is projected as a
strongside linebacker because of his quickness.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth-round pick was Ralph Brown, a four-year starter at
cornerback for Nebraska. He will challenge Dave Thomas, a recently
signed veteran free agent, for the nickel cornerback spot. The
club's sixth-round selection, Dhani Jones, a Michigan linebacker,
figures to play mostly on special teams. Jeremiah Parker, the
defensive end from California taken in the seventh round, provides
depth where the Giants need it.
</P>

TROUBLED PASTS OF DRAFT PICKS DO NOT WORRY THE JETS 
</HEADLINE>

Service budget, is now restored)  By JUDY BATTISTA

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Jets, despite addressing some needs with their
many picks in the National Football League draft, did not make
anyone forget the departed receiver Keyshawn Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But they may end up reminding a lot of people why the NFL has a
character issue.
</P>
<P>
   In the year in which the NFL stressed wariness of players with
off-the-field troubles _ its extensive predraft background checks
showed one in five of the 323 draft-eligible players had something
that raised eyebrows among the league's security personnel _ the
Jets took three players with known records.
</P>
<P>
   None of those players _ defensive end Shaun Ellis, and receivers
Laveranues Coles and Windrell Hayes _ have anything in their pasts
that compares to Rae Carruth or Ray Lewis, both of whom are facing
murder charges. But the Jets, needing a successful draft to quash
some of the dissonance over the Johnson trade, chose to walk a
tightrope with their future, hoping that these players have
abandoned their troubled ways before they enter the
pressure-filled, temptation-laden and highly scrutinized world of a
professional athlete in New York. This is a bit of a departure for
the Jets, who in the past have shied away from drafting players
with troubled backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Al Groh insisted he was not concerned that there could be
problems with these picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had a very active program for three years in security
checks before the draft and while the players are here,'' Groh
said. ``We did our research. If we saw that as a potential problem,
we wouldn't have done it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' draft, while tinged with risk, did fill some gaping
hopes on the field. They got two desperately needed pass-rushers in
Ellis and linebacker John Abraham, both of whom are expected to
contribute immediately. They picked up tight end Anthony Becht,
another glaring need, and got the bonus of nabbing, they hope,
their franchise quarterback of the future in Chad Pennington.
</P>
<P>
   In the later rounds, they picked up receivers who will get a
shot to fill the slot left by Johnson, but the trade of the
second-round pick to San Francisco precluded the Jets from getting
a higher-rated receiver. Did they make up for the loss of Johnson?
No.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to get a wide receiver with four first-round picks
was confounding, and as a result the Jets figure to run the ball
more than in recent years. Did they make the best of a bad
situation? Once the chance to trade up for a receiver was lost,
they used the picks they got for Johnson, Nos. 13 and 27, to get
two players who will challenge for starting jobs right away and
they shored up the pass rush.
</P>
<P>
   But they also gave themselves the potential for future
headaches. Ellis pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge
last July after being charged with felony assault for striking a
woman in the head with a drinking glass. He did community service
and paid the woman's medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   Coles was thrown off the team at Florida State after pleading
guilty in October to a misdemeanor petty theft charge in relation
to the same scam at a Tallahassee, Fla., department store in which
Peter Warrick was involved. Coles was already on school probation
for a variety of academic and legal troubles, including a battery
incident in 1998 involving his stepmother. According to a story in
ESPN magazine, Coles ``mushed'' the face of his father's ex-wife
against a car window, he said, after the woman took a swing at
Coles' mother.
</P>
<P>
   Coles would not discuss that incident after he was drafted
Saturday, although Groh implied that the extenuating circumstances
involved made him confident the incident would not be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Laveranues understands that this is his last
opportunity to use his football talents to create a far better life
for himself than he otherwise would have,'' Groh said. ``Sometimes
if you have no strikes left, you protect the plate a little bit
better than if you still had all three of them to take a swing
at.''
</P>
<P>
   Coles said he had learned something from the department-store
scam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opens your eyes,'' he said. ``It lets you know people are
watching you and people are out to get you and people want to pull
you down. I don't think I'm down to my last strike. I'm just
thankful that they gave me the opportunity. Usually when a guy gets
dismissed, he's not allowed back in football anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes faced three felony counts in 1998: suspicion of writing
bad checks for merchandise, conspiracy and burglary. Hayes said he
met the people he got in trouble with during 1997, when he sat out
as a transfer student before joining the Southern California
football team. He pleaded guilty to misdemeanor fraudulent check
cashing and received three years of probation, which he is still
serving. He was ordered to pay $8,500 in restitution. Hayes said he
was asked by nearly every team at the combine about his record. But
the Jets, he said, did not ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got caught up hanging out with the wrong type of people,''
Hayes said. ``I got involved in writing checks to get some clothes,
in insufficient funds. It was a little scam an acquaintance of mine
had started up and it sounded good at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, I got caught early, so I didn't get in too much
trouble. To this day, I can't describe what made me go along with
it. I've never done anything close to that before.''  &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Delegates looked bleary-eyed after their predawn
wake-up calls, and a handful arrived several hours late. But the
member nations of the International Monetary Fund achieved a major
breakthrough Sunday: They met.
</P>
<P>
   That was perhaps the one definitive accomplishment the world
finance ministers could announce after a full day of meetings to
discuss global financial stability and to set the course for the
monetary fund. After globalization-wary protesters briefly shut
down world trade talks in Seattle last year and threatened to do
the same to finance ministers gathered in Washington Sunday, the
simple fact of the meeting was presented as a triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meeting went on as normal,'' announced Gordon Brown,
Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, the chairman of the fund's
steering committee. ``It started on time and it was completed in a
normal way.'' That included a relaxed lunch in the IMF's soaring
marble and glass atrium, where formally attired waiters served
jumbo shrimp and offered a selection of red and white wines.
</P>
<P>
   The shouts of protesters could not be heard inside the
earth-tone conference rooms of the fund's downtown Washington
headquarters. But participants said the varied complaints of the
fund's many critics in Congress, in academia and on the streets
resonated in many of the policy proposals discussed during the
sessions, including those for streamlined lending procedures and
expedited debt relief for poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   A carefully worded day-end communique gave credit to outside
critics for stoking a public debate about the future of the fund.
And many of the finance ministers stressed that they had heard the
protesters' messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is going through a period of profound change, and
that has made for debate here and some debate outside,'' said Paul
Martin, Canada's finance minister. ``Ultimately our aims are the
same,'' he said, adding that both parties want to figure out how
best to deal with poverty.
</P>
<P>
   There appeared to be modest progress on a range of issues
confronting the fund, some of which are high on the agenda of
outside critics. The finance ministers asked the fund's managers to
continue a review of their lending programs with an eye to
eliminating some. The fund was also told to review whether to use
variable pricing on some loan programs so as to discourage
repeated, long-term borrowing. Those proposals are favored by the
United States and some members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But some poor and middle-income countries expressed strong
reservations about proposals that would make it more difficult for
them to obtain loans or force them to pay the loans back faster.
Their opposition highlighted how difficult it is to institute
changes quickly at the fund, which consists of 182-member nations,
though its board is effectively controlled by the United States and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find some of these proposals unacceptable and have serious
concerns about them,'' said German Suarez, who chairs a coalition
of developing countries known as the Group of 24. He was referring
primarily to a proposal put forward by a congressional commission
that studied ways of changing the IMF and the World Bank, its
sister lending agency.
</P>
<P>
   The finance ministers' communique ruled out the possibility of
completely eliminating the fund's long-term lending programs and
expressed strong support for the fund's involvement in working to
reduce poverty. The congressional panel, known as the Meltzer
Commission, had urged that the fund cease both types of lending.
</P>
<P>
   On debt relief, finance ministers reiterated their longstanding
pledge to free the world's poorest countries, including many in
Africa, of their crushing foreign-debt burdens. One major problem
is that some legislatures around the world, most notably Congress,
so far have failed to allot all the necessary funds to allow the
fund and the World Bank to forgive past loans.
</P>
<P>
   Jubilee 2000, a religious coalition, has called for stepping up
the effort and for total forgiveness of debt owed by the world's 40
poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the discussions Sunday said the ministers also
considered proposals that would make it easier for the poorest
countries to qualify for debt relief and to put the plans into
effect faster once they do.
</P>
<P>
   Of 27 nations considered under a debt-relief program approved in
Cologne, Germany last summer, only five have begun a qualification
process and just one, Uganda, has actually had some debt forgiven.
Many others have faced difficulties proving to the fund and the
bank that they have the good governance and adequate programs in
place to meet the criteria for debt forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Most finance ministers, traveling in police-escorted bus
convoys, had little trouble winding their way through barricades to
the fund's headquarters. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, the
top-ranking American official at the meetings, was whisked by
limousine from his office a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   But the protests made life difficult for some officials. The
Japanese delegation, fearing a tardy arrival, left its quarters at
the Madison Hotel a few blocks from the IMF at 4:30 a.m., arriving
a short time later and waiting more than three hours for the start
of the formal proceedings, a Japanese official said.
</P>
<P>
   The French finance minister, Laurent Fabius, who had told IMF
and World Bank staff members that he wanted to conduct a dialogue
with demonstrators during his stay, got full exposure. Protesters
surrounded his limousine just before the 8 a.m. start of the
morning session, forcing him to turn back. Fabius then waited for
nearly six hours at a luxury hotel for bus transport through the
barricades, arriving only at the conclusion of lunch.

CABBIES EYE STREETS WARILY ON TENSE NIGHT SHIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUAN FORERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's Sunday morning, just after 2 _ a scant 24 hours
after Jean Scutt, the new driver at Commodore Car Service, was shot
dead _ and Brandi Turner is frazzled because Car 72's driver is
squeezing the radio transmitter as he barrels across Brooklyn in
his Lincoln Town Car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy-two, seventy-two,'' Turner says, raising her voice as
she speaks into the worn Motorola microphone in Commodore's grubby
dispatcher booth, in a small, drab storefront with overhanging
wires and dusty counters in East Flatbush. ``Why you squeezing your
mike and not shouting back at the base?''
</P>
<P>
   Turner, who was on duty the morning before, when Scutt was
killed with a gunshot to the neck in Flatbush, knows all too well
that holding down the button on a mike, which lights up the driver
ID box in her booth, is a distress signal that can mean a driver
has a gun to his head.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Car 72's driver is inadvertently squeezing the
mike, an honest mistake for any driver. But with the death of Scutt
fresh on Turner's mind, the oversight prompts a gentle scolding
from an edgy dispatcher. ``It's not right to play games,'' Turner
tells him. ``It's not right to play wolf.''
</P>
<P>
   At Commodore one day after violence struck close to home, no one
_ not Turner, the other dispatchers, the 20 drivers on duty early
Sunday or management _ could be too careful through Saturday's
overnight tour, the busiest night of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said she had turned away 30 callers who had asked for
rides between midnight and 3 a.m., most of them people who had
failed to give an exact address for their pickup or destination.
About 10 drivers did not show up to work. Those who did frequently
ignored people who tried to wave them down or phoned for service
from dark, desolate streets in the heart of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're scared, afraid,'' said Gasner Racine, owner of
Commodore. ``Some of them chose to take the day, to stay home. They
feel very bad about what happened. The ones that worked, they're
more careful. They keep talking to each other, telling each other
to be careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, livery drivers and dispatchers at Commodore know
danger is ever present for people who make their living ferrying
strangers to wherever they wish to go in the middle of the night.
Many have been robbed in the past, they said. Most knew that before
Scutt's death, six livery drivers in the city had lost their lives
this year, a pace expected to easily surpass the total of 11
drivers killed in all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're easy targets, and people know we're out there,'' said
Shelby Oliver, the Commodore manager and a driver who was robbed at
gunpoint about two weeks ago. ``Everyone needs cab drivers, and
you're always picking up someone, and so you're always carrying
money. You understand it. If you're working a full shift, they
figure that in the wee hours of the morning, you have a nice amount
of change.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Commodore's drivers and dispatchers said Sunday that
Scutt's death had shaken them to the core. Never before had someone
from Commodore been killed. That he was new to the company _ on the
job just two days _ and thus a stranger to the other workers,
seemed to make no difference to drivers who consider their network
akin to a brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Scutt, a Haitian immigrant like many Commodore drivers and a
father of three, was shot dead shortly after a young man walked
into the car service about 2 a.m. Saturday and told Turner he
needed a ride. About 20 minutes later, Scutt's car crashed against
the wrought-iron fence outside a candy store, his body slumped
inside.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Scared or not, Commodore's drivers still gravitated throughout
Saturday night to their base. The drivers, who in a good week can
make $700, said they have families to support. So they worked,
driving their Lincolns and Fords on a rainy night across all
corners of Brooklyn and beyond, from the gritty streets of East New
York to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't do the job, someone else has to do it,'' said
Charles Cyprien, 45, a driver for 10 years. ``So it's like you do
it. It's like soldiers going to war: You've got to go. To make a
living, you have to drive.''
</P>
<P>
   So Commodore was a blur of activity on the Saturday overnight.
</P>
<P>
   This was no more apparent than in the dispatcher's booth, a
6-by-6-foot space where dispatchers sit before a pink Formica
counter; a sign taped to the wall warns them not to stay on the
phone more than three minutes. Nimbly juggling as many as 10 lines
at once, the dispatchers quickly logged the addresses where callers
needed to be picked up and then put out the information to drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-five, ninety-five, Dean Street and Stone,'' said Melody
Taylor, a dispatcher with a Jamaican lilt, trying to reach Car 95
and direct the driver to a fare. Meanwhile, Fajr Smith, who favors
gold necklaces and rings and was outfitted from head to toe in
fatigues, fielded a call from someone on Seaview Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Under this system, drivers respond to calls for service put out
by dispatchers _ if they wish. But with calls for service coming in
at a furious pace and the number of drivers down for the night, the
dispatchers had to tell dozens of people to call back. Other calls
never went out to the drivers; there was something about the pickup
location, something about a caller's voice that alerted skittish
dispatchers.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers, meanwhile, said they were especially wary. Over the
weekend, that meant being mindful of a prospective passenger's
appearance or the location where a pickup or a drop-off was to take
place. Most of the drivers said they avoided picking up people
trying to wave them down, a common but dangerous practice in
certain neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that guy outside, the young guy, the way he's dressed,
the baggy clothes and stuff,'' Wilner Charlemagne, 45, a driver for
25 years, said as he looked out to a group of young men milling on
the corner outside Commodore's office. ``He flags me down, I don't
pick him up. I go to the next one.''
</P>
<P>
   The drivers were also especially conscious of young men who
walked into the base, requesting a ride in person, as Scutt's
killer apparently did.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some walk-ins were eagerly welcomed, like Trevlyn
Atkinson, a nurse leaving a church function in an elegant black
dress late Saturday night and requesting a ride to her home in
Borough Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think she would do me harm; I can trust her,'' Norman
Stoll, 32, a Commodore driver, said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Stoll, a driver for eight years with Commodore, said he had
never been robbed, an accomplishment he attributes to street smarts
and caution. Stoll, an immigrant from Guyana, said he had never
given much thought to the dangers inherent in his job, until his
co-worker was shot dead. That has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, I don't think I'm going to pick up no guys in
the night after a certain time, even though I have the partition,''
he said, as his 1991 Ford sliced across the wet pavement. I have a
lot of fear in me right now. This guy lost his life.''

MIAMI POLITICIANS TESTED BY ELIAN GONZALEZ CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to give job title of Marvin Dunn and elaborate on his quote.
Changes Anglo to non-Hispanic white. Rewrites last two grafs.)  
(See also CUBAN-BOY-SUPPORTERS, CUBAN-BOY-HAVANA) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ What excites Miami's Cuban-Americans about the Elian
Gonzalez case is that it is the best opportunity since the failed
Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 to humiliate Fidel Castro. But
domestic conflicts are stirring this pot, too, and threatening
Miami and its two top politicians with their own Bay of Pigs.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Penelas, 38, a Democrat, was elected mayor of Miami-Dade
County four years ago with the huge support of normally
Republican-voting Cuban-Americans, as well as the support of many
blacks and non-Hispanic whites. Once perceived as a future governor
or senator, Penelas faces a re-election race in the fall against a
Republican Cuban-American, Miguel Diaz de la Portilla, a county
commissioner who is more conservative than Penelas.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Carollo, 45, a Republican, was elected mayor of the city
of Miami three years ago. In a city where Cuban-Americans make up
the majority of the vote, he survived an attempt by his own city
commission to oust him in a special election last year that the
courts overruled. Accused of taking his Cuban-American support for
granted, Carollo faces a challenge next year from a former mayor,
Xavier Suarez, also a Cuban-American.
</P>
<P>
   In the local political arena, said professor Kenneth W. Goodman,
director of the ethics program at the University of Miami, ``Fidel
Castro is not even an issue.'' Alberto Duran, a board member of the
Cuban Committee for Democracy, which favors the boy's return to his
father, said, ``This is a political struggle, a show of political
muscle more than a stance against Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to prove they can keep this child here,'' Duran
said. ``Penelas is in a very tough political race, so he's taking
extreme stands to get the Cuban-American vote, and Carollo is going
to have a tough race in November next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The turning point in both mayors' participation in the dispute
came late last month when Penelas, with Carollo beside him at the
microphones on the steps of the federal courthouse here, lashed out
at federal law and its enforcers.
</P>
<P>
   Penelas, until that moment a man known as a consensus-building
moderate, declared that he would not let the Miami police help
federal agents move Elian from his temporary home and would blame
President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno for any ensuing
violence and civil disorder. He and Carollo, who is better known as
a firebrand, have since promised to maintain order. But they will
not let their police join federal marshals in moving Elian from his
great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez's white stucco house in Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the mayors have alienated all other ethnic groups,
sullied their images as emerging leaders of their national
political parties, and diminished the stature of their city. At
moments in the Elian saga, analysts say, the mayors have let
emotions trump federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they both have at stake,'' said Dario Marino, a pollster
and associate professor of political science at Florida
International University here, ``is the good name of Miami and the
ability to attract business. No one in the business elite wants
civil disobedience.'' But as passions over Elian have begun to boil
over, Marino said, ``their first priority is not to alienate their
Cuban-American base. If they alienate their Cuban base, they're
both gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Gladwin, director of the Institute for Public Opinion
Research at FIU, said: ``The first level of political impact, until
it's resolved and people start reflecting on it, is this huge
polarization. People are going to remember.'' Because of the
mayors' ``pandering to popular sentiment,'' said Mayor Neisen O.
Kasdin of Miami Beach, just across Biscayne Bay, ``Miami has taken
it on the chin. It's not going to stop Miami's emergence as the
capital of the Americas. But this is a setback for two or three
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The two mayors have impeccable Cuban and American political
credentials. Penelas' father, a labor organizer in Cuba, was in a
Castro prison facing a death sentence when he escaped with his
family to Florida, where Alex was born. Joseph Carollo came at the
age of 5 or 6.
</P>
<P>
   They soaked up American culture, got educations and entered
careers in politics. Penelas was elected to the Hialeah city
council at 25. Carollo, briefly a Democrat and a police officer,
was elected a Miami city commissioner at 24. Both dress in the
crisp suits and tightly knotted ties of members of the board of a
chamber of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the Elian case, following Elian's rescue at sea in
November when he and his mother, who drowned, were fleeing Cuba,
the mayors stood on the fringe of the custody debate while their
Cuban-American constituents weighed the issues.
</P>
<P>
   As views coalesced to the point where many now support Lazaro
Gonzalez's defiance of a federal order to release Elian to his
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who awaits him in Bethesda, Md., the
mayors have declined to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll this month that stunned analysts here, The Miami
Herald found an acutely polarized city, with 85 percent of
Miami-Dade County's Cuban-Americans supporting efforts to keep
Elian in the United States and 92 percent of African-Americans and
72 percent of non-Hispanic whites supporting his return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   With a Cuban majority in the city and a plurality in the county,
said Lisandro Perez, director of the Cuban Research Institute at
Florida International University, ``Carollo and Penelas want to
make sure they're in the front of this movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The 4,000 or 5,000 people who demonstrate in front of Lazaro
Gonzalez's home may represent only a small fraction of the county's
743,000 Cuban-Americans, Perez said, but when things get emotional,
Carollo and Penelas are going to have to take up the banner or get
trampled. ``The fact that this is foreign policy is academic,''
Perez said. ``They're doing what their constituency wants them to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   In responding to the passions of a single constituency, the
mayors have alienated blacks and non-Hispanic whites. Marvin Dunn,
a black who is the chairman of the psychology department at FIU and
the author of a book about the black experience in Miami in the
20th century, said the Miami Herald poll showing that 92 percent of
blacks want Elian repatriated was stunning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see far too many fathers abandoning their children,'' Dunn
said. ``When we see a dad stand up for his son, that's
impressive.'' That such views are ignored, he said, ``is for me,
for a lot of African-Americans, reprehensible. We feel we are a
less important part of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   That may not hurt Carollo because of the city's Cuban-American
majority. ``But Penelas has more of a problem,'' Dunn said. James
W. Corey, a political scientist at the University of Miami and a
veteran of the Bay of Pigs, said, ``I would say strategically, he's
put himself in a precarious position.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban-Americans, said Susan MacManus, a professor of
political science at the University of South Florida in Tampa,
``forced him to go so far over to the right that it makes it
difficult for him to win.'' The only winners, she said, are the
aging leaders of the Cuban exile community, who had been losing
influence. The Elian affair, she said, ``has galvanized them and
emboldened them.''

AGAINST ALL ODDS, A COMPLICATED CASINO PROPOSAL ADVANCES 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTICELLO, N.Y. _ Robert A. Berman stalked across the cavernous
grandstand at Monticello Raceway on a recent afternoon just as the
trotters breezed across the finish line to the desultory cheers of
two dozen bettors and a couple of children scattered among the box
seats.
</P>
<P>
   He winced when the tote board showed that a mere $6,223 had been
bet on the race, including the off-track action. It had hardly been
worth the effort.
</P>
<P>
   With the scruffy racetrack, and the empty parking lot, it was
hard to picture the tens of thousands of vacationers who once
flocked here from borscht belt hotels. But it is here that Berman
wants to build a $500 million casino for the St. Regis Mohawk
tribe, a project that he says will bring prosperity back to the
Catskills and a windfall to him and his partners.
</P>
<P>
   And on April 7, after six years of public hearings,
environmental reviews, negotiations and nearly $30 million, he
finally won the federal Interior Department's approval for his plan
to donate 30 acres to the Mohawks for the casino. He and his
partners would build and operate it under a management contract
with the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing here,'' said Berman, who grew up here and
heads an investment group that owns the track. ``This area has been
devastated. The casino would create thousands of good-paying jobs.
It'll drive demand for hotels and the people who work there will
spend money in the community.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with the victory in Washington _ one that many thought
would never happen _ Berman still feels embattled.
</P>
<P>
   The casino venture still needs the approval of Gov. George E.
Pataki, whose longstanding support for the project is now open to
question, and possibly the State Legislature. Although Berman's
partners include top Republican campaign contributors with close
ties to the state's top economic development official, Charles A.
Gargano, the battle in Albany will be joined by a combative group
of gambling opponents, Atlantic City casino interests, unions and
real estate developers.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the intrigue, casino proponents and tribal officials
say that a new force has sought to curry favor with the Mohawk
tribe in an effort to gain control of the casino, or kill it:
Arthur Goldberg, president of Park Place Entertainment, the largest
gambling operator in the country, and his adviser, Alfonse M.
D'Amato, the former senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The casino could revive an historic area,'' Berman said. ``We
hope the governor will judge this project on the merits and ignore
all the political noise in the background.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman's friends and critics in Sullivan County described him as
a ``wheeler dealer'' who was always trying to get some project
going in the county, even after business took him to New York and
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always very enterprising,'' said Ira Jay Cohen, the
Sullivan County attorney. ``Very inventive. I wasn't surprised
years later when he surfaced as the head of this casino venture. He
was always willing to take a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of local contractor, Berman, 40, was 19 when he opened
the Bananas nightclub in nearby Woodridge at one of the county's
many shuttered hotels. In 1981 and 1982, he ran Music Mountain, a
successful concert series that included the Allman Brothers Band
and the Grateful Dead at Avon Lodge, a former hotel owned by his
girlfriend's family.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, he and four partners revived a twice-failed ski resort
in Sullivan County called Davos. The county's resort industry had
foundered badly in the competition with Atlantic City and
relatively inexpensive air fares to Europe. But there was a boomlet
in second-home construction. Berman's group expanded the ski trails
and built a clubhouse, a lodge and hundreds of condominiums, town
houses and single-family homes.
</P>
<P>
   The recession in the early 1990s, however, brought construction
to a halt, and the project's lender pushed Davos into bankruptcy
court, leaving some residents and local contractors angry with
Berman over unfulfilled promises. Berman eventually wrested back
control of the property.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the 1990s, Berman was involved with Watermark
Investments, a holding company based in Manhattan that invested in
real estate projects, an Internet lottery and hotel renovations. He
said he stepped down from those ventures last month to concentrate
on the casino.
</P>
<P>
   The origins of that project date back to 1994, when the State
Legislature had once again did not approve casino gambling in New
York. Berman told Cliff Ehrlich, whose family had owned the Pines
hotel and was an advocate of gambling as a way to revive the
county's beleaguered economy, that he had a way to get around the
state's prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   Berman, who had worked with the Coeur d'Alene tribe in Idaho on
an Internet lottery venture, said that a seldom-used provision of
federal law allowed for the creation of a casino on land donated in
trust for a tribe. The trust would establish a tax-free sovereign
Indian territory outside tribal lands expressly for a casino.
</P>
<P>
   Berman and Ehrlich bought the failing racetrack in Monticello
and approached the Oneidas, one of only two tribes in New York that
had a gambling contract with the state and the wherewithal to both
finance and operate a casino. When a deal with the Oneidas fell
apart in 1995, Berman and Ehrlich struck an alliance with the St.
Regis Mohawks, whose reservation is on the Canadian border, 350
miles north of Monticello. But the Mohawks could not finance or
operate the casino.
</P>
<P>
   For financial support, Berman enlisted an old friend, Joseph
Bernstein, a developer based in New York City who had gained
notoriety in the 1980s when he secretly bought skyscrapers in
Manhattan on behalf of President Ferdinand Marcos of the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Berman also picked up another partner, Alpha Hospitality, a
gambling company that already had a deal with the Mohawks to run an
off-reservation casino. Alpha was run by Stanley S. Tollman, a New
York businessman who owned a number of hotels. Its directors and
major stockholders included Gargano, who was appointed chairman of
the Empire State Development Corp. in 1995. Gargano's connections
to Alpha, whose casino project was being reviewed by the state, set
off a storm of protest in the Legislature. He ultimately resigned
from Alpha and sold his stock, although he and Tollman remain good
friends.
</P>
<P>
   `` Gargano divested his holdings many years ago so there
wouldn't be any reason to question anything,'' said Thomas Aro,
executive vice president of Alpha. ``But you don't resign your
friendships.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman added: ``Nobody is doing anybody any favors on this
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Tollman may have other problems that could reflect poorly on
Alpha and the contract with the Mohawks. The United States attorney
in Manhattan is investigating his Tollman-Hundley Hotels company,
which bought the Days Inn chain in 1989 in a highly leveraged $765
million deal. Less than two years later, Days Inn filed for
bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors recently obtained indictments of a former company
executive, Howard Zukerman, on charges of tax evasion. In a
declaration filed in that case, an assistant U.S. attorney, Stanley
J. Okula Jr., stated that he was investigating Tollman's friend and
former partner, Monty Drew Hundley, and three other unnamed
executives at Tollman-Hundley in connection with ``a massive scheme
to defraud certain financial institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley was a founder of both the hotel company and Alpha.
Tollman did not return numerous telephone calls requesting comment
and Larry Horn, a lawyer for Hundley, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing to do with Alpha,'' Aro said. ``I have no
knowledge of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the group drew up plans for the casino over the
last five years and met with county legislators and federal
regulators. Berman promised to expand the track when the casino was
built. The two-story gambling and entertainment complex, which
would include 200 gambling tables, a 12,000-square-foot poker room,
a bingo room and 3,000 video lottery terminals, is expected to
attract 9 million visitors a year and generate 5,300 people. In a
series of negotiations, the tribe has agreed to give the county $5
million a year and to provide the state with up to 25 percent of
the gross revenues from electronic gambling machines.
</P>
<P>
   After 30 years of talk about gambling in the Catskills, few
people thought the Monticello casino would ever materialize. But
last year, David Flaum and Louis R. Cappelli, developers who are
also heavy Republican campaign contributors, began buying property
for resorts the likes of which had not been seen in Sullivan
County. Gambling foes and Atlantic City casino owners like Donald
J. Trump opposed the project in advertisements attacking Pataki as
a pro-gambling politician.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has long said that Indian casinos could be an economic
boon in traditional resort areas like the Catskills and western New
York. He has also maintained that he has the power to approve
Indian casino proposals. But last month, he filed a bill that would
require the State Legislature to approve Indian gambling
operations, a proposal that casino advocates believe would mean
almost certain doom. Since then, the Pataki administration has
refused to say whether the bill covers the Mohawks, a tribe that
already has a gambling compact with the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the last best hope for the area,'' said United States
Senator Charles E. Schumer, who had lobbied the federal government
on behalf of the casino.
</P>
<P>
   A top state official said in a recent interview that the
Monticello casino would be reviewed in the context of the state's
overall relations with the tribe. In a meeting last Thursday, state
officials made a settlement offer concerning the Mohawks' land
claims. The offer got a favorable reception, according to one
person who was briefed on the talks.
</P>
<P>
   That gave casino proponents hope. But they must still get their
management contract with the Mohawks approved by the National
Indian Gaming Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent break with the Atlantic City casino owners,
Goldberg of Park Place Entertainment has been negotiating for six
months to take over management of the Mohawks' small, money-losing
casino in Hogansburg, N.Y., according to tribal officials, the
current casino operator and others. And last week, he made
overtures to Alpha concerning the proposed Monticello casino.
</P>
<P>
   It is this kind of maneuvering that gives Berman headaches. He
fears that Park Place does not truly want a casino in Monticello
that could take business away from Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe for a minute that they want a casino in
Monticello,'' he said. ``They've got too big a stake in Atlantic
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing rests on Pataki's shoulders,'' Berman added. ``He
has the power with a stroke of the pen to say yes to thousands of
jobs and millions of dollars in revenue that now flows out of the
state.''

   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   As an improvisational violinist, I have noticed that gigs really
pick up at this time of year, and that spring seems to bring the
quirkiest jobs. A unique one was a call from a forlorn fellow who
had been rejected by his true love. He rented the Central Park boat
house _ not yet open for the season _ and hired a famous chef and a
jazz violinist, namely me. When the girlfriend arrived, she found a
romantic setting that even a heart of steel wouldn't have been able
to resist.
</P>
<P>
   But my story really isn't about that couple. As I stood on the
dock playing standards like ``Lover Man'' and ``You'd Be So Nice to
Come Home To,'' my violin wove a spell that no one could have
predicted. All the ducks in the pond gradually migrated to the dock
and formed a semicircle around me. The highlight came when my time
was up and I started packing up the fiddle. Until you've been
surrounded by a dozen mallards quacking gleefully as they gaze at
you, you haven't known the heights of artistic fulfillment.

forth. ``E-mail,'' said one. ``Beeper,'' said the second.

next to the man. ``He's right, it was a bee-oo-tiful movie,'' I

PINTO WINS LONDON MARATHON AND KHANNOUCHI IS THIRD 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEAL ALLEN   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Lontonio Pinto of Portugal won the London marathon
Sunday in 2 hours 6 minutes 36 seconds, defeating Khalid
Khannouchi, the world record-holder, who finished third.
</P>
<P>
   Pinto, who finished in the first three in this race six times,
earned $180,000 for the victory, which was the fifth-fastest
marathon in history. Morocco's Abdel Cader El Mouaziz, last year's
London champion, finished second in 2:07:33.
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi, who set the world record with a 2:05:42 in October
in Chicago, finished third in 2:08.36.
</P>
<P>
   A Moroccan who lives in Ossining, N.Y., Khannouchi is trying to
gain citizenship in order to compete for the United States in the
Olympic Games in September. His wife, Sandra, said Sunday that his
lawyers believe he will obtain his citizenship on May 3 after
fingerprint procedures and a test on his knowledge of American
history. Khannouchi complained that the London air was too cold for
him Sunday, though the temperature was 51 degrees after an hour and
a half of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending upon how soon Khalid recovers from this race, he
will either aim to compete in the American Olympic trials for the
marathon in Pittsburgh on May7 or the 10,000 meters trial for the
Sydney Olympics on July 14 in Sacramento,'' said Sandra Khannouchi,
who is also his manager and coach. ``I reckon we'll know which
within the next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinto, 34, who won the London Marathon in 1992 and 1997, and was
runner-up last year, took control of the race with a 25th-mile
split time of 4 minutes 32 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Pinto's time was the fastest ever by a European, surpassing the
2:07:12 by his compatriot Carlos Lopes back in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Tegla Loroupe of Kenya, the women's marathon world record-holder
(2:20:43), finished 13 seconds ahead of Romania's Lidia Simon in
2:24:33 to win the women's race, which was the Olympic trial for
the Kenyan women.

STEVENS' GOAL GIVES DEVILS A 2-0 PLAYOFF LEAD ON PANTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The big, lively crowd cheered Scott
Niedermayer when he first took the ice Sunday night in Continental
Arena and they cheered the Devils defenseman the first few times he
touched the puck. They cheered later in the first period when he
nearly scored on a rebound and they cheered again when he bumped
Peter Worrell, the big Panther with whom Niedermayer has a history.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest cheer came early in the second period, when the
Devils were two men short and Niedermayer was on the
penalty-killing team. Rushing down ice with John Madden on a
two-on-one rush, Niedermayer pounced upon the loose puck after
Madden's shot was stopped by goalie Mike Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting the rebound with a backhanded motion, Niedermayer
pushed the puck over the goal line to tie the score at 1-1. The
Devils went on to a 2-1 victory when Scott Stevens scored his
second goal of the playoffs 3:42 into the third period. That gave
the Devils a 2-0 lead in the four-of-seven-game series with Games 3
and 4 in Sunrise, Fla., on Tuesday and Thursday nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just jumped and basically rushed down as hard as I could,''
Niedermayer said, describing the goal, during a television
interview at the second intermission. He seemed to hit the puck in
the air, as it bounced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just swung at it,'' Niedermayer said. Describing his first
few shifts, Niedermayer said: ``I didn't have the confidence'' to
pass accurately. After a while, he said, it felt like he had not
missed a game.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a dramatic return for Niedermayer, who had missed the
previous 10 games for using his stick to hit Worrell on his
helmeted head during a March 19 game on the same playing surface.
Niedermayer was allowed to practice with the Devils during his
suspension, but it is difficult for a player in these conditions to
maintain the necessary sharpness.
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer's evening had many interesting moments. In the first
period, when the Devils were on a power play, Niedermayer lost his
grip on his stick. Noticing this was his brother, Rob Niedermayer,
a forward for the Panthers. In a subtle move, Rob Niedermayer used
his own stick to push away the stick of his brother. Perhaps it is
a trick they used on each other on the neighborhood rink in
Edmonton, Alberta, where they grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the second period, when Florida's Mike Sillinger
appeared to have a step on Niedermayer during a rush down ice,
Niedermayer caught up to him with a smooth skating stride and poked
the puck away before the Panther forward could shoot.
</P>
<P>
   When the Devils prepared for this game and Niedermayer's return,
Coach Larry Robinson was asked whether he thought Niedermayer might
be too ``hyped up.'' Robinson smiled at the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he's too hyped up,'' Robinson said. ``In all the years
I've known Scotty Niedermayer, I don't think I've ever seen him too
hyped up. If anything, it's the other way, not hyped up enough.
He's a pretty laid-back individual - very intelligent,
philosophical about what he does. Being too intense, I don't think
he'll have a problem with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Inefficiency on the power play reached a rather high level for
the Devils, who failed with the man advantage five times in the
first two periods. They were presented with a grand opportunity for
a four-minute manpower advantage just 84 seconds into the gane,
when Rob Niedermayer of the Panthers was assessed a double minor
for high-sticking Bobby Holik.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils took four shots with the manpower advantage, but none
of high quality. They had a good chance on their third manpower
advantage, when Scott Niedermayer's backhander was thwarted by
Vernon. But the Devils proved more productive playing short not
just one but two men.
</P>
<P>
   A penalty against Ken Daneyko for high sticking at the end of
the first session left the Devils two men short for 78 seconds at
the start of the second period. But the Devils managed to score 56
seconds into the period to tie the score. Florida had taken the
lead in the opening period on Sillinger's goal.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Niedermayer scored the tying goal on a rebound after a
shot by John Madden during a two-on-one break. Niedermayer jumped
into the play the moment Madden gained possession on the left and
beat the sprawled Vernon to celebrate his return after his
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Sillinger's goal came with 5:15 left in the first period, and it
was primarily the work of Pavel Bure that created it. Getting the
puck behind the line on the right, Bure went to the net with
authority and Sillinger capitalized on the rebound in a crowd in
front of Martin Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   There were few chances for either team to take the lead going
into the third period _ two attempts by Bure that Brodeur turned
aside with seven minutes left, and a shot off the crossbar by the
Devils' in the waning seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils were pleasantly surprised this morning when Daneyko
and Jason Arnott reported for the morning skate in much better
health than a day earlier. Daneyko did not work Saturday, and
Arnott skated only slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Daneyko's strained abdominal muscle felt much better and he kept
intact his streak of playing in every playoff game in Devils
history. Daneyko, who will celebrate his 36th birthday on Monday,
played in his 110th playoff game and showed no ill effects of the
injury he sustained on Thursday in the first period of the opening
game of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott's sprained right wrist, which forced him to miss the
third period of the opening game victory, played in his usual spot,
centering for Patrik Elias on the left and Petr Sykora on the
right.

INJURED ANDERSON TAKES RARE DAY OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Anaheim Angels' Garret Anderson missed his first
game of the season Sunday, sitting out with a tender left ankle.
Anderson rolled the ankle over when batting in the first inning
Saturday but played the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like (Anderson playing in) center field would be a
stretch today,'' manager Mike Scioscia said. ``DH was a possibility
because he's swinging the bat well, but he can't plant and turn the
way he wants to. You don't want to mess up a guy's swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, the former Kennedy High of Granada Hills star, has
played in at least 150 games in each of the past four seasons,
including a career-high 157 games last year. Anderson prides
himself on playing every day, but Scioscia says everybody needs a
day off now and then.
</P>
<P>
   ``This schedule is the most demanding in professional sports, I
don't care what position you're playing,'' he said. ``You talk
about keeping the lineup together 150-some games, but 162 is not
realistic. There are going to be days a guy needs a day off, and
today was one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Centered: Darin Erstad played center in Anderson's place, and
made a spectacular diving catch in left-center field of a ball hit
by Chicago's Paul Konerko leading off the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just ran as hard as I can, and if I get to it, I get to
it,'' Erstad said. ``I'm going after it hard, and whatever happens,
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't find a better catch in left-center field anywhere,''
Scioscia said. ``That was some play.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia said there will be no center-field controversy.
Anderson has the job, and Erstad will get an occasional start in
center when Anderson needs a day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garret's our center fielder,'' he said. ``He's comfortable in
center and he's done an outstanding job. We think it gives us a
solid outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``G.A. throws a little better and is more accurate. Erstad
charges the ball hard and gets rid of it quickly. There are pros
and cons, but in our estimation, Garret's a better fit.''
</P>
<P>
   In the field: With Erstad moving from left to center, Edgard
Clemente got his first start in left field Sunday, having started
two previous games as the DH. He got his first hit as an Angel on
Sunday with an infield single in the fourth inning, and got his
first RBI with a groundout in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Positive step: Pitcher Tim Belcher's rehab start at Single-A
Lake Elsinore went well Saturday night. Belcher, recovering from
offseason elbow surgery, pitched three hitless innings, striking
out four while making 30 pitches.

ANGELS' SCHOENEWEIS BEATS WHITE SOX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO -- Scott Schoeneweis isn't exactly a household name. In
fact, most people can't even pronounce his name.
</P>
<P>
   But the pitcher is making observers take notice, his performance
Sunday in the Anaheim Angels' 3-1 victory over the Chicago White
Sox the latest to turn heads. Schoeneweis limited the majors'
top-hitting team to three hits in eight innings to earn the win and
improve to 3-0. He lowered his ERA to 2.35, best among the club's
starters.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's outing before 10,929 at Comiskey Park followed the
left- hander's three-hit shutout of the Toronto Blue Jays. And it
followed Kent Bottenfield's performance (7 innings, 0 runs, 5 hits)
one day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job Bottenfield and Schoeneweis did the last two (days)
against a team not only the hottest in baseball, but a talented
offensive group, is a great sign,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia
said. ``That order is power- packed from the right side. What Scott
did today was a tremendous job of pitching. He used all his pitches
and moved the ball around.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Schoeneweis allowed a run Sunday, he said he felt
better than when he threw the shutout last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``My arm was a little tired coming out of spring training,'' he
said. ``Also, I'm learning. Every time out I learn something new
about how my stuff works, how to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The only run he allowed came on Ray Durham's two-out, RBI double
in the third inning. After that, no White Sox baserunner got as far
as third base and only one reached second. Schoeneweis is gaining
confidence with each outing but is focusing on keeping a level
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really trying to keep everything in perspective, go start
to start,'' he said. ``In between starts, keep an even keel. The
more I'm out there, the more confidence I have, but after I talk to
you guys, it's over. I'm looking toward my next start against
Tampa.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels offense supported Schoeneweis with 13 hits but scored
only three runs. Scott Spiezio had an RBI double in the fourth off
former UCLA and Crescenta Valley High star Jim Parque (1-1), then
scored later in the inning on a sacrifice fly by Bengie Molina for
a 2-0 lead. After the White Sox cut the lead to 2-1, the Angels
scored in the sixth when Troy Glaus doubled, went to third on a
single by Spiezio and scored on Edgard Clemente's groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Percival pitched a 1-2-3 ninth for his fourth save.
</P>
<P>
   Spiezio and Darin Erstad each had three hits, but Erstad's
biggest play of the day might have been his diving catch of a liner
to the left-center-field gap hit by Paul Konerko leading off the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great player,'' Schoeneweis said of Erstad. ``That just
pumps you up, pumps up the whole team. He does it all. He's the
hardest-nosed player I've ever been around.''
</P>
<P>
   As a whole, the Angels are pumped up about their start, thanks
to their starting pitching, which is 7-3 with a 3.01 ERA in 12
games. Expectations for the starters were low going into spring
training, but Scioscia and others promised it would be better than
advertised.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a matter of `I told you so,''' Scioscia said. ``It's
a matter of a group of pitchers stepping up and living up to our
expectations. Throw Kent Bottenfield into the mix and you have a
solid rotation. We're pleased with where our pitching has been,
needless to say. But we're also just scratching the surface when
you talk about contending for a championship. We're not at all
where we need to get to. We have to keep grinding it out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to know we can win tight ballgames,'' first baseman
Mo Vaughn said. ``The offense will click. Right now we're doing it
with good defense and pitching. What we need until guys start
swinging the bat is to win these types of ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn credits Scioscia for the team's play and positive
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard people say, `You've got a good mix, a great
chemistry.' It's a different feel,'' Vaughn said. ``That guy right
there (Scioscia) doesn't mess around. It's nice when you have that
type of feel in the dugout. I've never seen a guy never miss a
thing. He sees everything. ... Everyone wants to do well for
ourselves, but you also want to do well for him.''

ABRAM CHAYES, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR   AND JFK ADVISER, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MAC DANIEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Abram J. Chayes, an original member of President John
F. Kennedy's ``best and the brightest'' who had a profound
influence on US foreign policy and international law, died Sunday
at Brigham and Women's Hospital. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Chayes enjoyed an extraordinary career in both law and
politics, most of which was spent at Harvard Law School, where he
had served as one of the school's most distinguished and respected
experts in international law since 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret H. Marshall, chief justice of the Massachusetts Supreme
Judicial Court and a student of Mr. Chayes's in 1975, described him
Sunday as a ``brilliant, challenging, beloved professor'' who
``brought his own experience and great learning into the
classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Chayes was born on the North Side of Chicago on July 18,
1922, to Edward and Kitty Chayes. After graduating from Senn High
School, Mr. Chayes followed his lifelong passion for law and
politics into, as a profiler once wrote, an ``admirable humdrum of
grand slams.''
</P>
<P>
   He received a bachelor's degree, magna cum laude and Phi Beta
Kappa, from Harvard in 1943. He served in Army field artillery
units in France, the Netherlands, Germany, and Japan from 1943 to
1946 and was discharged with the rank of captain.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Chayes married Antonio (Toni) Handler on Christmas Eve 1947,
when he returned to Cambridge, and graduated magna cum laude from
Harvard Law School in 1949. He served as president of the Law
Review and was at the top of his class.
</P>
<P>
   His first job out of school was serving as legal adviser to
Connecticut Governor Chester Bowles from 1949 to 1951. After
Bowles's unsuccessful bid for reelection, Mr. Chayes went to
Washington, D.C., where he served as associate general counsel of
President Truman's Materials Policy Commission, clerked for Supreme
Court Justice Felix Frankfurter. He then went to work for the law
firm of Covington &AMP; Burling.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Chayes returned to Cambridge in 1955 to join the Law School
faculty. ``Since then,'' he wrote in the 25th anniversary report of
Harvard's Class of 1943, ``with a single if lengthy break,
Cambridge has been my home.''
</P>
<P>
   That break came when, after working for Kennedy's unsuccessful
vice presidential bid in 1956, Mr. Chayes was among the first wave
of departures from Cambridge to Washington after Kennedy won the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   From 1961 to 1964, he served as chief legal adviser in the
Department of State. His duties included advising about the
blockade during the Cuban missile crisis, about which Mr. Chayes
wrote ``The Cuban Missile Crisis, International Crisis and the Role
of Law,'' published in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was, especially in retrospect, an extraordinarily
exhilarating time to be in Washington,'' Mr. Chayes wrote. ``Much
was possible and almost everything seemed fun. Whether this is
truth or incurable utopianism, I'll leave to others.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, he went to the law firm of Ginsburg &AMP; Feldman in
Washington, before coming back to the law school in 1965, where he
remained. In 1976, he became the Felix Frankfurter Professor of
Law, and in 1993, he added emeritus to that title.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Chayes went on to serve as chairman of George McGovern's
foreign policy panel, where he spoke out against President Richard
Nixon's incursions into Vietnam and Cambodia. Mr. Chayes also
served as foreign policy and defense task force adviser during
Jimmy Carter's presidential campaign in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Mr. Chayes followed his wife to Washington after Carter
appointed her the first female assistant secretary to the US Air
Force.
</P>
<P>
   One of the highlights of his legal career occurred in the 1980s
when Mr. Chayes represented Nicaragua in that country's World Court
case against the United States, attacking the Reagan
administration's policy of support for the contras and the attempt
to overthrow the Sandinista government. Reagan administration
officials walked out of the trial over a technical glitch and never
returned, giving Mr. Chayes and the case an empty victory.
</P>
<P>
   Anne-Marie Slaughter, director of the Graduate School of
International and Legal Studies at Harvard Law School, assisted Mr.
Chayes during the Nicaragua trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believed with passion that the US had to adhere to the
rules of international law,'' Slaughter said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Mr. Chayes was the recipient of the Harvard Law
School Association Award, the school's most prestigious honor. He
also recently joined joined the Boston office of the international
law firm of McDermott, Will &AMP; Emery.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he leaves four daughters, Eve and
Abigail of Los Angeles, Sarah of Paris, and Angelica of Canaan,
N.Y.; a son, Lincoln of Los Angeles; and a sister, Judith
Chayes-Neiman of Baltimore.

STOCKS CONTINUE SHARP SELL-OFF IN WORLD MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
   By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ Friday's rout on Wall Street reverberated across
Asia on Monday, with so-called old economy stocks sliding together
with technology-related issues as investors worried about the
potential fallout of declining stocks on the U.S. economy and its
demand for Asian exports.
</P>
<P>
   In early trading, stocks in South Korea fell 9 percent, Japan's
benchmark Nikkei index dropped more than 8 percent and the Hang
Seng index in Hong Kong slumped nearly 8 percent. Analysts were
predicting more of the same when markets opened in Hong Kong and
elsewhere overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more than we anticipated,'' said Joe Lee, an analyst
at Daiwa Securities in Seoul, South Korea. ``It's not just the tech
stocks. Everything is falling right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The reverberations across the Pacific came despite efforts by
financial officials to calm investors, who were responding to a
9.67 percent drop in the Nasdaq composite index on Friday, which
capped the worst week in its history. Australia's All Ordinaries
index dropped by more than 5 percent even after Prime Minister John
Howard went on the radio to remind shareholders of the strength of
Australia's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Officials attending the meeting of the seven major industrial
nations in Washington issued a statement on Saturday saying the
global economic outlook was continuing to brighten. And Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan predicted that Wall Street's
declines would not spread to Japan's stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts shared Miyazawa's optimism that stronger economic
fundamentals and a smaller number of Internet stocks would help
reduce the effect in Tokyo and that markets would recover ground
during the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magnitude of the sell-off won't be anywhere near where it
is in the U.S.,'' said Kathy Matsui, a strategist at Goldman, Sachs
in Tokyo. Japan is far behind the United States in terms of
adopting information technology, she said, giving its technology
companies much more room still to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some analysts said a shift away from high-technology
investments was likely to rekindle interest in emerging markets
like Indonesia, Thialand and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Despite positive economic growth forecasts, a dearth of
Internet-related stocks in those markets has left them far behind
those in North Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Currency markets echoed such optimism as Asian currencies
rallied against the dollar in spite of the tailspin on stock
markets. On Monday morning, the dollar fell to 104.66 yen from its
settlement price in New York on Friday of 105.09 yen.
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts said their concern was that so much wealth
had evaporated with last week's declines _ more than $2 trillion _
that it could touch off waves of selling in Asia's smaller markets,
with the potential for even more drastic price declines. Any such
landslide in prices was likely to test government commitments to
free-market dynamics and resist the temptation to intervene to
protect asset values.
</P>
<P>
   Rising stock prices over the last year made it easier for Asia's
heavily indebted companies to service their loans and, in the
process, reduced the pressure on governments to reform their
banking sectors. A sharp decline in stock prices, analysts said,
was likely to refocus attention on the need for such restructuring
for Asia's long-term economic health.

CORZINE'S PLANS ARE GREAT SOCIETY-LIKE IN NEW JERSEY CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Jon S. Corzine may be running only for the
Senate, but his proposals sound as sweeping as any president's
since Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society.
</P>
<P>
   He envisions a national health care system, with insurance for
everyone. A national program of long-term care for the aged and
infirm. And enough new federal education spending to cover college
tuition for every high school graduate with a B average or better,
and preschool for every toddler.
</P>
<P>
   Even a cursory look at this breathtakingly expansive platform
raises some obvious questions: How much would it cost? Where will
the money come from? And are New Jersey voters, historically
moderate, ready for a candidate who seems so much like a throwback
to the 1960s?
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., says he
is running ``because it's time to get bold things done.'' In an era
when fiscal conservatism is almost synonymous with patriotism, he
has outlined programs that could cost hundreds of billions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   He has said much less about how he would pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   His candidacy rests on two propositions: that a society awash in
prosperity, its confidence in government buoyed by rising
surpluses, should be ready to spend liberally to solve its most
vexing social problems; and that the ideal guardian of the nation's
purse strings is someone like him _ a Wall Street-hardened
financier.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after President Clinton, a Democrat, said that ``the
era of big government is over,'' Corzine is perhaps the only
prominent Democrat in America arguing forcefully for a reversal of
the last two decades' steady shift in power from the federal
government to the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a generation of Democrats that is understandably
afraid to get out on any tree limb at all,'' said Susan Estrich,
who managed Michael S. Dukakis' 1988 presidential campaign and now
is advising Corzine. ``He isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's stands on social issues, meanwhile, make his fiscal
plans seem middle of the road. He supports allowing gays to marry
legally and to serve openly in the military. He favors greater
curbs on firearms than even the advocacy group Handgun Control. He
opposes the death penalty and any restrictions on abortion rights,
even for late-term procedures. And he supports affirmative action,
including set-asides for minority contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, his opponent in the Democratic primary, former
Gov. Jim Florio, is dying to meet Corzine head-on in a debate.
``The people of this state do not want extremes,'' Florio said.
``They do not want someone who's going to go out there promising
them the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   But Corzine, 53, insists that more voters will be attracted by
his authenticity than repelled by his positions. ``Why should
someone run for political office if they're only going to shape
their views to poll-driven responses?'' he said in one of two
recent interviews. ``I actually think that's why people are
frustrated with politics in America. They know politicians tell
them what they want to hear to get elected. I have to have a
purpose in this exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's purpose in running for Senate begins with the
so-called social safety net. He endorses President Clinton's plan
to allow investment of up to 15 percent of the Social Security
trust fund in the stock market instead of only in safer, but
possibly less lucrative, government securities. He supports setting
aside $680 billion from future federal surpluses to cover rising
Medicare costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take on getting these safety-net programs properly
structured in a businesslike fashion,'' he said. ``These things are
vital. And if we don't pay attention to the details of how they are
organized, our society's going to suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   It is on health care, however, that Corzine has focused the most
attention in his speeches and television commercials. Unlike Vice
President Al Gore, who wants to extend health care to the uninsured
in increments, he speaks of ``universal health care coverage'' for
all 44 million uninsured Americans as something that can and should
be done immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hillary Rodham Clinton's ill-fated 1993 national health
care plan, Corzine's proposal relies on employer mandates. All
companies would be required to offer insurance to their workers,
who would have to bear some of the cost themselves through
premiums. Smaller businesses would join regional insurance pools to
negotiate for discounts. The federal government would reimburse
businesses with fewer than 200 workers for the costs through
subsidies under a sliding scale.
</P>
<P>
   But while Corzine continues to speak in universal terms, he
leaves himself room to retreat to a half-measure. Pressed for weeks
to detail his approach and its costs, he released late on Friday a
one-page financial summary of two options. It stated that he
favored making health insurance a matter of individual choice, and
projected that half of America's uninsured would choose to remain
uninsured, limiting the government's costs to $21 billion. To cover
everyone, it said, would cost the government $42 billion and
employers $36 billion more than they already spend.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said that more than half the uninsured might well choose
to enroll up front, ``depending on how aggressively the system
markets itself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it is affordable,'' he added, ``people will more
willingly volunteer to take up the opportunity. We could ultimately
move to some kind of requirement, but I don't think we should move
there on the first step.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Corzine's heart clearly is in truly universal health
coverage. At a recent forum before nurses and other health care
professionals, he was asked if he supported a single-payer system.
He carefully avoided answering (though he later told a reporter
that he opposed it). ``Running around as a newcomer to politics and
talking about what is generally labeled socialized medicine would
probably be the kiss of death,'' he told the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said he was proudest of his proposals for long-term
care, an issue that has few champions in the national debate.
``This is something that when I get there, I will be an advocate
for the next 10 years, till we get something done,'' he said. ``I
think I can make a deal out of this, because I think it's something
our society needs.''
</P>
<P>
   He supports Clinton's latest proposal for a $3,000 tax credit
for patients or their caregivers, though he says it should be
refundable and still dismisses it in the next breath as too little.
``It's nuts,'' he said. ``That's one month of assisted living.''
</P>
<P>
   As a more meaningful step, Corzine says he admires programs
begun by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in New York,
Connecticut, California and other states that were intended to
entice people to buy their own long-term care insurance. Those
pilot programs, which under existing federal law cannot be expanded
to other states, assure participants that they will not need to
exhaust all their assets before qualifying for Medicaid in old age.
</P>
<P>
   But reviews have been mixed. ``Policy analysts like it a lot,
but people don't like these policies,'' said Joshua M. Wiener, an
expert on long-term care at the Urban Institute in Washington.
``Insurance agents don't like to sell them, either. It's opposite
the way they normally sell. They usually say, `Buy this product and
you'll never go on that horrible Medicaid.' Now, they're saying,
`Buy this and, should you use up your benefits, we'll get you on
Medicaid faster.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Corzine said he believed that a national long-term
care system should be folded into Medicare or a Social
Security-like program. Wiener said that this could cost $70 billion
or more.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said the tab should be much less, because individuals
and employers would both contribute, but he could not elaborate.
``I'm very admitting that it's the formative stage, but I think
we've got to encourage our society,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he deliberately set his sights higher than his
expectations but that he was not unrealistic. But his grand plans,
outlined on his Web site at www.votecorzine.org, do come at a
price.
</P>
<P>
   In education, for example, Corzine said he would raise spending
by $30 billion to cover initiatives for preschool and kindergarten
through the 12th grade. Beyond that, he wants to copy a scholarship
program in Georgia, which pays for two years of tuition at a state
college for any student who maintains an average of B or better. If
students qualify for a national scholarship program at the same
rate they do in Georgia, the cost could reach $16 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine also favors a fully refundable college tuition tax
credit for low-income families. That would cost more than $9
billion after three years, according to the Progressive Policy
Institute in Washington. All told, his education programs alone
could add $55 billion to the nation's annual budget, roughly five
times what Gore has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Florio, the combative former governor, says Corzine's proposals
are irresponsible or naive. ``At the very beginning, when he was
out there, I chastised him gently, saying, `You've got to be
specific,''' Florio said of his opponent. ``Then he came forward
with this set of specifics that are unaccounted for in terms of the
costs, and that's the opposite extreme. It's irresponsible to say,
`I'm for everyone having a good life, elect me.' Or on the other
side, `I'm for everybody having 17 Cadillacs in their driveway,'
without saying how they're going to pay for them.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Corzine's Web site does omit any bottom-line dollar
figures, Corzine asserted that his proposals could all be paid for
with the $750 billion in non-Social Security surpluses projected by
the federal government over the next 10 years. Where necessary, he
said, senators could always cut pork-barrel spending. And in an
economic downturn, he would favor deficit spending, he said.

 POWER MAC BESTS THE GIGAHERTZ PCs  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ During the past 18 months, while top PC
processor speeds have jumped from 450 megahertz to a gigahertz, the
PowerPC chip used in Apple Macintoshes has climbed only from 400 to
500 megahertz.
</P>
<P>
   But the PowerPC has always been able to get more work done in
each clock cycle than Intel and Advanced Micro Devices processors.
</P>
<P>
   That's all the more true with the latest PowerPC, the G4,
especially with programs updated to take advantage of its key
innovation, a ``vector-processing unit'' Apple calls the Velocity
Engine.
</P>
<P>
   Still, running at half the clock speed of the competition is a
significant handicap, and as I tested the performance of the new
gigahertz PCs, I wasn't at all certain Apple's machines could keep
up. So I set out to find out.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, none of the major benchmarks of real-world
performance runs on both platforms, so I turned to Adobe Photoshop
5.5, a program available in virtually identical versions for Mac
and Windows. It's not only a widely used application, but also a
pretty good indicator of overall processor performance.
</P>
<P>
   Using the same test file _ a 50-megabyte scanned image of
Yosemite _ and an Adobe plug-in that tells Photoshop how to take
advantage of the PowerPC G4's Velocity Engine, I clocked a series
of seven processor-intensive operations _ the same ones I had
earlier run on the PCs _ on a 450-megahertz Power Mac G4. (Apple
announced a 500-megahertz version of the same machine in February,
but I didn't have access to one of those.)
</P>
<P>
   When I first ran the tests on the Power Mac, it ``only'' had the
128 megabytes of memory that comes standard with this model. In
this configuration, it handily outperformed one of the gigahertz
PCs, a Hewlett-Packard 1G with Intel Pentium III and 128 megabytes
of RAM. The Mac beat the Pavilion on six of the seven tests; its
total time for the whole sequence was 118 seconds, nearly a third
faster than the 185 seconds the Pavilion required.
</P>
<P>
   But the other gigahertz PC, Polywell Systems' Poly 800K7-1000
with an Athlon processor from Advanced Micro Devices, had done even
better, finishing the sequence in just 82 seconds. The Poly,
however, had a big advantage: 256 megabytes of memory. To level the
playing field, I swiped a 128-megabyte memory module from the
Gateway Select 1000, which was already idle because its screen had
gone blank. I restarted the Mac, adjusted Photoshop's memory
settings to use the additional RAM and tried the tests again.
</P>
<P>
   This time, there was no ambiguity: the 450-megahertz Power Mac
blew both gigahertz PCs out of the water, completing the
seven-operation sequence in just 55 seconds. Whereas the
Athlon-based Poly had scored about a third better than the Mac when
the former had twice the memory, the Mac cut its time in half and
finished a third ahead once the two systems were configured
equally.
</P>
<P>
   Applications differ, of course, and no doubt there are
legitimate comparisons where the PCs would come out ahead. But in
spite of Adobe's roots on the Mac, it can hardly be accused of
optimizing its products only for Apple hardware _ at times in the
past Photoshop has run better on the PC.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Mac partisans have no reason to panic about the
PowerPC's current clock-speed shortfall, and graphics professionals
who rely on Apple have no reason, at least in terms of performance,
to doubt their choice of platforms: The Mac's resounding victory in
this particular test is strong evidence that the PowerPC remains
more than competitive with the best Intel and AMD can produce.

REVIEW: DO YOU NEED FASTEST CHIP? 
</HEADLINE>
   By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ What difference does a gigahertz make?
</P>
<P>
   Over the past couple of weeks, I've had a chance to find out for
myself. I've been testing three new PCs with processors that run at
gigahertz speeds _ 1,000 megahertz, or 1 billion clock cycles per
second. (By way of context, a gigahertz is 200 times the speed of
the original 1981 IBM PC, and twice the speed of the fastest PC
chip available just 14 months ago.)
</P>
<P>
   One of these machines, the Pavilion 1G from Hewlett-Packard, has
Intel's gigahertz Pentium III; the other two, the Poly 800K7-1000
from Polywell Computers Inc. of South San Francisco, and the
Gateway Select 1000 Deluxe from Gateway, have the gigahertz version
of Advanced Micro Devices' Athlon chip.
</P>
<P>
   As an unabashed speed freak from way back _ when it comes to
computers, that is _ I got a kick out of breaking the gigahertz
barrier, but the thrill was mostly intellectual; I can't honestly
claim the actual experience knocked my socks off.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you put two comparably configured PCs on my desk,
one with a gigahertz chip and the other with a processor running
at, say, 500 or 600 megahertz, I'm not even sure I could tell which
is which, at least with the applications I use most of the time _
e-mail, Web browsing, word processing, modest databases and
spreadsheets. Even if your software repertoire is more diverse than
mine _ maybe you dabble in digital photography, or your kids are
into MP3 music _ my guess is that you'd have to look hard to notice
the difference.
</P>
<P>
   The plain truth is that for the majority of PC users, both at
home and at work, processor speed has ceased to be a major issue.
Nowadays, the most important bottleneck for most of us (not
counting our own typing and thinking speeds) is our Internet
connection; secondarily, many users suffer poor performance simply
because their systems have insufficient RAM or second-rate hard
drives.
</P>
<P>
   That was already the case a year ago, when mainstream systems
ran at 300 to 500 megahertz; it's all the more true now that those
speeds have doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Not for everyone, though. Significant numbers of PC users _
scientists and engineers, professional programmers, graphic
artists, video editors and others _ are still held back by the
limits of their PCs' processors. If you're in one of those
categories, more megahertz still translate directly into time saved
_ not just seconds, but minutes, maybe even hours over the course
of a workweek. And for hard-core gamers a faster processor, paired
with a state-of-the-art 3-D card, means richer, more lifelike
graphics.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of us, there's still real value in high-end PCs
like those I tested, but it has less to do with their souped-up
CPUs than with the other components PC-makers typically pack into
their top-of-the-line models: mountains of memory, ultrafast hard
drives with acres of storage space, the latest in graphics
technology and assorted other goodies. But if you shop carefully,
you can get all this good stuff without paying the huge premiums
the latest chips command. Some specifics about what does and
doesn't change with a gigahertz PC:
</P>
<P>
   -- Booting up still takes forever _ between a minute and a
minute and a half for each of these machines.
</P>
<P>
   -- Gigahertz PCs are no more stable and reliable than their
predecessors. Application crashes may be less frequent _ I didn't
run into any _ because these systems have lots of memory, but
Windows froze up several times as I was shutting down.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the Gateway machine went south halfway through my testing
_ it seemed to boot up normally, but the screen went blank shortly
after the Windows 98 splash screen went by. Same thing happened
when I tried to boot in Windows' ``safe mode,'' and even removing
and reinstalling the video card didn't help. After futzing with the
system for more than an hour, I gave up _ a PC with a blank screen
isn't much use no matter how fast its processor. Adding hardware is
as much an adventure as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, given that most machines like these will probably end
up connected either to a local-area network or to a high-speed
cable or DSL hookup, only the HP Pavilion comes with an Ethernet
card as standard equipment. Adding a Kingston network card to the
Gateway was no problem. But I went through hell trying to add the
same card to the Polywell box.
</P>
<P>
   In short, even at a gigahertz, Windows plug-and-play continues
to deserve its ``plug-and-pray'' nickname.
</P>
<P>
   -- Your Internet connection doesn't get any faster. A
high-powered processor, together with an ultrafast video card (all
three of these machines came with today's hottest graphics chip,
the Nvidia GeForce 256, and 32 megabytes of video RAM), does speed
up the rendering of complex Web pages. But the fundamental
constraint on surfing speed is still bandwidth _ the speed of your
connection to the Internet _ and the processor doesn't change that.
</P>
<P>
   If you already have a reasonably up-to-date PC _ one with a
processor running at, say, 300 megahertz or more _ and you're
looking for a way to make the Web faster, you're better off
investing in a cable or DSL connection than spending your money on
a faster CPU.
</P>
<P>
   -- You can't get very far ahead of the obsolescence curve. Even
though they're on the bleeding edge of technology today, these
chips will be passe in a few months. This summer, AMD is expected
to ship a whole new version of the Athlon, code-named Thunderbird
and reportedly to be branded the Athlon Ultra. It will probably run
at appreciably higher speeds, and, even more important, it will
have extra performance-enhancing memory (the ``Level 2 cache'')
built right on the chip, as is already the case with Intel's
processors. The current Athlon, like older Intel versions, relies
on separate chips for its Level 2 cache, which limits the
effectiveness of this important technique.
</P>
<P>
   Intel plans to add a new generation, code-named Willamette, to
its Pentium line this fall. The new chips are likely to run at
significantly higher clock speeds (Intel has already demonstrated,
albeit briefly, a 1.5-gigahertz version) and incorporate other
performance improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'm waiting for Willamette before I get a new PC.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the ledger, today's gigahertz chips are
really and truly a lot faster than any PC processor produced more
than a few months ago. I ran a battery of benchmark tests on the
three gigahertz models and on my regular home PC, a 21-month-old,
400-megahertz Pentium II machine.
</P>
<P>
   The results were pretty dramatic. On Ziff-Davis' WinStone tests,
which attempt to measure overall performance in top-selling
real-life applications, the new machines scored about 75 percent
above my old clunker. On ZD's WinBench CPUmark 99, which focuses
specifically on processing speed, I got a score of 31.4 on my old
machine, just shy of 80 on the two gigahertz Athlon models and 85.7
on the Intel-based HP Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Whether changes even of this magnitude make any real difference
for most users in most applications is debatable. I certainly
didn't produce this article any faster because I wrote most of it
on the HP Pavilion. In demanding applications and games, however,
the speedup is quite noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   In id Software's Quake II, for instance, using id's OpenGL
display driver, I got 60 frames per second (fps) on my old PC; on
the gigahertz machines that figure jumped to about 125 fps, which
translates into noticeably smoother, more realistic graphics.
</P>
<P>
   I also ran a series of tests with Adobe Photoshop _ not just
because it's a critical application for most graphics
professionals, but also because it's a pretty good indicator of
performance in other programs that push PCs to their limits.
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, the benefits of the fast processors were clear cut,
at least on many operations. Applying a Gaussian blur filter to my
50-megabyte test image, for example, took 51.5 seconds on my
400-megahertz PC, but only 17.5 seconds on the HP Pavilion and a
mere 4.1 seconds on the Polywell system. A sequence of seven
processor-intensive operations took 323 seconds on my old PC, 185
on the Pavilion and just 82 on the Poly. (I wasn't able to run
these tests on the Gateway because of the blank-screen problem
noted earlier.)
</P>
<P>
   These Photoshop results seem to suggest that the Athlon is
significantly faster than the Pentium III at the same clock speed.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be fooled, though: Photoshop always runs faster when it
has more memory, and I'm certain the reason it worked so much
better on the Polywell is that that machine came with 256 megabytes
of memory, while the Intel-based Pavilion, like my old PC, had a
mere 128 megabytes of RAM.
</P>
<P>
   Moral of that story: Whatever processor you use, make sure your
system is optimally configured for the work you do. If not, much of
the horsepower you, or your boss, has invested in could be going to
waste.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I wasn't able to test the machines with
comparable configurations _ I didn't have extra memory to add to
the Pavilion, and I'd already returned the Polywell by the time the
HP system arrived.
</P>
<P>
   If I had been able to do such tests, I suspect, judging by the
results of my other benchmarks, that the scores would have been
close. Each company points to various technical advantages in its
chip, and overall Intels might have a slight edge in performance,
but for most purposes the two seem to perform about equally well in
equivalent systems.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one powerful argument in favor of the Athlon: You
can actually order one today and get it within a week or two. Intel
seems to have announced its gigahertz entry mainly in an effort to
steal AMD's thunder, and PCs incorporating the chip are all but
impossible to buy, as best I can determine.
</P>
<P>
   One final word of advice: If you intend to buy a gigahertz PC,
consider ordering some earplugs or headphones along with the new
system. The new machines are not only the fastest PCs I've ever
used, but also among the noisiest.

E-ZPASS SYSTEM: EASY FOR SOME STATES, DIFFICULT FOR NEW JERSEY 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's supposed to work like this: You get into your car in Boston
with an electronic toll tag affixed to the windshield like your own
personal herald. And you end up as far away as Philadelphia without
ever having to wait in a line or fumble with a single quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, something very big is standing in the way of this
seamless regional transportation vision. It is called New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   After years of delays in installing the E-ZPass toll collection
system on the Garden State Parkway, the New Jersey Turnpike and the
Atlantic City Expressway, state officials announced earlier this
month that the system would not be completed at all parkway toll
plazas by June, as promised, and that the job would probably drag
on into the fall.
</P>
<P>
   This came three weeks after officials had already pushed back
the deadline for the turnpike, the most difficult part of the
project, from May 22 to August or even September. In both cases,
officials did not announce exact new completion dates, and their
critics say the reason is that they were still wincing from the
last time they set dates only to miss them.
</P>
<P>
   For a state that almost voted its governor out of office three
years ago because of high auto insurance rates, a state whose
car-centered identity is rivaled perhaps only by California's, the
delays have become a running joke, one that people laugh at to keep
from cursing.
</P>
<P>
   And the problems have only added to the auto-related woes of
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, whose administration's efforts to
install a tougher statewide emissions testing system have also been
plagued by delays and breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey has more cars per square mile than any other state.
It has the nation's second-highest toll revenues, after New York.
And it was testing the concept of electronic toll collection before
any other state, dreaming of the day when a human toll collector,
who can process 250 cars an hour, would be replaced by a chunk of
electronics that can handle as many as 1,100 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   But most of New Jersey's drivers can still only look enviously
north, where New York finished installing E-ZPass on the Gov.
Thomas E. Dewey Thruway three years ago, and northeast, where the
Massachusetts Turnpike has Fast Lane, a system compatible with
E-ZPass. (Delaware also has E-ZPass, and the system has been
proposed in Pennsylvania and Maryland.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a real black eye for the state,'' said
Assemblyman John S. Wisniewski, a Democratic member of the New
Jersey Assembly's transportation committee. Wisniewski has long
criticized the selection of Adesta Transportation, a subsidiary of
a troubled Georgia company, Able Telcom, as the contractor to
perform the $500 million installation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once problems surfaced,'' Wisniewski said, ``we had denial
after denial. We had an administration that refused to believe
there were problems when they were told.''
</P>
<P>
   But state officials overseeing the project contend that most of
the delays came even before a contractor was selected, and that
those delays were largely beyond anyone's control. The state's
contract with Adesta, for example, was held up for a year after a
rival bidder filed an unsuccessful lawsuit maintaining that the
selection process had been tainted.
</P>
<P>
   The State Legislature also had to pass a law allowing cameras at
toll plazas, so that the cars of drivers who failed to pay the
tolls could be identified.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the project's contract was not signed until 1998,
the same year the Whitman administration had said that the system
was supposed to be completely up and running.
</P>
<P>
   The delays since then, the officials say, have not been
unreasonable, considering that the job is perhaps the largest
electronic toll collection project in the world, predicted to
process a billion electronic tolls a year and eventually involve
more than 750 toll lanes, more than in any other state.
</P>
<P>
   An additional complication is the fact that because the New
Jersey Turnpike is what is known as a closed-ticket system, with
tolls that vary according to where drivers get on and off, it must
activate E-ZPass at all toll plazas at once, like a string of
lights.
</P>
<P>
   The Garden State Parkway and the Atlantic City Expressway charge
a flat fee, so workers are able to activate the system one plaza at
a time. On the parkway, work crews have been steadily marching
south, and E-ZPass is operating as far down as the Raritan toll
plaza in Middlesex County, the busiest on the highway. E-ZPass has
been working on the 44-mile Atlantic City Expressway since the fall
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing that could happen,'' said James Weinstein, the
state transportation commissioner, referring to the turnpike, ``is
to open it up and then have to shut it down. So we're being
especially cautious and diligent.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   All these explanations mean little to drivers, and not just to
New Jerseyans, but also those for whom the turnpike is a major
commercial link. Don Spaulding, a truck driver based in Maine,
hauling a load of apples from Cape May to Massachusetts, waited 25
minutes to pay his toll on a recent Friday at the northernmost toll
plaza, near Ridgefield.
</P>
<P>
   Spaulding, 56, makes at least two trips a week through New
Jersey and said he did not want to think about the hours that have
evaporated over the years in the slow march toward turnpike toll
plazas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the worst,'' he said at the Vince Lombardi service area.
``We were jammed in there like sardines today. It's never this bad
in other states.''
</P>
<P>
   The very congestion that the system is meant to alleviate is one
of the biggest obstacles to installing it on time, engineers say.
The turnpike is one of the busiest highways in the world, with an
estimated 560,000 vehicles a day.
</P>
<P>
   By 5 a.m., the lanes had to be cleared and ready for traffic
again.
</P>
<P>
   But the problems with the company and the contract have long
been much more than logistical.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the contract was awarded, Adesta, then known as
MFS Network Technologies, was sold to a Georgia holding company
called Able Telcom, which soon began to struggle with its finances.
By this February, the company's debts were so high that it was
having difficulty getting loans and issued a warning that there was
``substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a
going concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, it managed to receive financing commitments from
private investors worth $90 million that it said would keep it
afloat. But the New Jersey contract was not helping matters: Able
Telcom said in a filing last week that the E-ZPass project was
responsible for $8.2 million of the $10.7 million in losses the
company reported for the three months ending on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Adesta, its subsidiary, had handled several big electronic toll
collection projects in Virginia, Colorado and elsewhere around the
country. But less than a year into its contract for New Jersey's
highways, Adesta almost lost the job when it was unable to make a
major component of the toll system _ the part that processes
violations _ work properly.
</P>
<P>
   The Regional Consortium, the group of five New Jersey area
transportation agencies that control the contract, began to fine
the company $25,000 a day _ $4.9 million in all _ for the delays.
And in April 1999, the company had to bring in a competitor to help
it finish the job.
</P>
<P>
   But problems persisted even after the violations center opened:
pictures of license plates taken by video cameras at the toll
plazas turned out too dark for officials to read; in the first four
months of operation, only 13 percent of toll violators were issued
tickets. (E-ZPass users prepay a selected amount; the system
automatically deducts the toll through a small toll tag when the
car passes through the toll lane.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the company was also missing deadlines for finishing
the highways. In 1998, the company promised to finish every lane on
all three highways by early 2000. When the company failed to meet
that deadline, officials agreed to let it install the system in
fewer than half the lanes to begin with, and then finish the rest
after the system was running. But even that scaled-back plan has
not worked.
</P>
<P>
   Philip A. Kernan Jr., the president and chief executive of
Adesta Transportation, said the biggest problem was simply that New
Jersey officials, after getting such a late start beginning the
project, wanted it done faster than was realistic. And the company
agreed to the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was mutual delusion on that,'' said Kernan, who
took over as president two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The delays have grown so troubling to politicians in both
parties that the state Senate president, Donald T. DiFrancesco, a
Republican, recently formed a task force to investigate how Adesta
won the contract.
</P>
<P>
   The group will also look into the $488 million contract awarded
for an auto emissions testing system that has been plagued by
computer breakdowns and equipment failures, creating long lines of
angry drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator DiFrancesco's questions are no different than what any
normal person who is reading the papers, anybody riding on the
highways, is asking,'' said Rae Hutton, a spokeswoman for the
senator. ``You have to put yourself in the position of the average
motorist in New Jersey.''

 WEB SITE HELPS ASPIRING ARTISTS FIND THEIR MUSICAL MUSE  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When she was just 5 years old, Alysha Antonino
knew she wanted to become a singer like her idol, Celine Dion.
</P>
<P>
   Alysha even made up her mind that just like Dion, she would one
day work with famed record producer-songwriter David Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 12-year-old Scotts Valley, Calif., girl is seeing her
dreams come true, thanks to a new Web startup called Tonos.com,
which has the backing of Foster and other top recording industry
heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
   Alysha won a singing contest sponsored by the Web site, which
flew her to Hollywood for a recording session with Foster. During
the session, Foster phoned Dion and let her listen to Alysha sing.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said something like, `You've got a beautiful voice and
you're working with the best,''' Alysha said, still giddy about the
encounter weeks later. ``I was in shock. I didn't know what to say.
I think I almost passed out. It was so cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster, a 10-time Grammy award winner, is a co-founder of
Tonos.com, a Culver City, Calif., site that bills itself as a
``music insider's network,'' where aspiring artists and music fans
can seek the advice of top stars like songwriter-singer-producer
Kenneth ``Babyface'' Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   Budding musicians can also receive online piano and guitar
lessons, collaborate via the Internet on new songs and, eventually,
watch live Web casts of recording sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first Internet site where music industry hopefuls,
professionals and fans can meet and work together,'' said Carole
Bayer Sager, the Grammy-award winning singer-songwriter who hatched
the idea for Tonos.com one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sager is best known for co-writing enduring pop tunes like
``That's What Friends Are For,'' ``Groovy Kind of Love'' and
``Don't Cry Out Loud.'' Now she hopes to compose another career as
an Internet entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has opened new avenues for unknown artists and
undiscovered garage bands to gain exposure by making their songs
available in formats like MP3.
</P>
<P>
   Although the music industry frets over how to contain music
piracy on the Web, major players like Sony and BMG are speeding up
the tempo on plans to use the Internet to increase sales.
</P>
<P>
   And numerous Web sites have formed to try to help new artists or
groups get exposure. One company, idealive Inc. of San Francisco,
recently launched a Web site designed to match musicians, painters,
filmmakers and other artists with investors.
</P>
<P>
   But Sager said she wanted her Web site to fill musicians' need
for professional mentoring and career advice.
</P>
<P>
   Sager, inspired by the consumer-oriented Motley Fool stock
investing site, said the site could ``demystify'' an industry
structured around knowing the right contacts to get through the
right doors.
</P>
<P>
   Tonos.com, named for the Greek word describing how musical notes
come together on a scale, seems to have a lot of the right people
behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Sager, along with Foster and Edmonds, formed the company in
September 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they loved about it was the mentoring aspect, the idea
that we could give back,'' Sager said.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tonos' board is Sager's husband, Bob Daly, CEO of the
Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team and former chairman and co-chief
executive officer of Warner Bros. and Warner Music Group.
</P>
<P>
   Tonos has assembled a roster of mentors and talent scouts that
includes hot R&AMP;B producer-songwriter Rodney Jerkins, who has
produced hits for the likes of Whitney Houston, Jennifer Lopez and
Matt Serletic, who produced Carlos Santana's Grammy-award winning
``Smooth.''
</P>
<P>
   And Tonos garnered about $7 million in investments from venture
capital firm Sequoia Capital and Shockwave.com Inc., the online
entertainment spin-off of San Francisco's Macromedia Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring musicians and hobbyists can chat via the Internet with
professionals to learn about the inside of the business, like
contracts, royalties and percentages.
</P>
<P>
   Sager said she hopes to help others avoid the mistake she made
earlier in her career when she needlessly signed away large
percentages of royalties to songs like ``Nobody Does It Better.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the more subtle lessons about the music business,
Tonos offers more basic instructions. Tonos bought Net startup
NetMusic School, which offers interactive guitar and piano lessons
online.
</P>
<P>
   Tonos also uses a program called the Tonoscorder, developed by
well-known audio company Emagic of Germany, which allows singers,
musicians and songwriters to collaborate on songs via the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Tonos CEO Matt Farber said that as the site becomes more
popular, he plans to generate money through ads, sponsorships and
by selling products and services.
</P>
<P>
   To promote the site, Tonos has launched continuing ``You Sing
the Hit'' or ``You Write the Hit'' contests using the Tonoscorder.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Antonino, Alysha's mother, stumbled upon the Tonos
demo site in February and realized her daughter had the chance to
meet her idol Foster if she entered a singing contest.
</P>
<P>
   Alysha is no stranger to the stage. She has been working the
state fair circuit for a couple of years, has done a few weddings
and has performed the national anthem before big crowds at Oakland
A's, San Francisco Giants and San Francisco 49ers games.
</P>
<P>
   In a friend's trailer home in Soquel (Santa Cruz County), Alysha
recorded Celine Dion's ``Love Is on the Way'' and sent the tape to
Tonos.
</P>
<P>
   Sager said she was blown away when she heard the tape and called
the Antonino home on March 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the phone rang, it was Carole (Bayer Sager), and I was in
shock when she told me I won,'' Alysha said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Damian Fontana, a 34-year-old bread distributor from
Brick, N.J., submitted lyrics to an original song he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   On March 12, both Alysha and Fontana found themselves in
Foster's home studio in Malibu. Surrounded by a wall full of gold
and platinum records, Alysha spent six hours recording a
professional demo of Fontana's song with the coaching and producing
of Foster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love working in a studio and I love performing live,''
Alysha said.
</P>
<P>
   Tonos officials say country star Tim McGraw is considering
recording Fontana's song, and Edmonds has offered to sing backup
vocals for the track.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Alysha is getting more time in the spotlight. Foster
invited Alysha back to perform with him at a benefit concert two
weeks ago at the ritzy Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   What lies in the future for Alysha and Fontana, of course, is
still in the stars. The same can be said for Tonos, even for all
its star power, said analyst Mark Mooradian of Jupiter
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a difficult time to build a consumer destination site
from scratch,'' Mooradian said. ``In terms of business models,
they're casting a wide net right now.
</P>
<P>
   The site might have trouble building a lucrative business model
from a limited audience of music insiders and music aspirants, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the site could succeed in drawing revenues from
business-to-business services for other music industry companies or
by finding other revenue sources from companies wanting to sell to
the niche music audience drawn by the NetMusic School or
Tonoscorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm looking forward to seeing from them is a great deal
of partnerships,'' Mooradian said.
</P>
<P>
   Sager and Alysha hope they both have seen the start of something
big.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has always been my dream, since I was 5 or 6, I always
wanted to be a singer,'' said Alysha. ``Even at 2, I was always
singing Disney stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Now's she's almost rubbing elbows with stars like Celine Dion.
``She's like my idol,'' Alysha said. ``I didn't know I was ever
going to get to talk to her. I can't wait to meet her someday.''

 TECH21: FUEL CELLS COULD BE NEW WAY TO POWER GADGETS  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &LR; Editor's note: Tech21 is a new column that will appear in &LR; 
 &LR; this space on Mondays. Written by Chronicle staff writer and &LR; 
 &LR; technology buff Henry Norr, it will focus on developments in &LR; 
 &LR; computing and communications that will shape our lives in the &LR; 
 &LR; 21st century: gadgets and gizmos, tips and tricks, fundamental &LR; 
 &LR; innovations and important issues. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sometimes I wonder how long it will be before
we've covered the planet pole-to-pole with plastic water bottles
and used-up batteries. With recycling lagging and Miller putting
its beers in plastic, the outlook isn't good on the bottle front.
</P>
<P>
   But a solution may be in sight for the battery problem: Replace
them with ``fuel cells,'' devices that produce energy by putting
hydrocarbons such as methanol and ethanol through a catalytic
process, producing only heat, carbon dioxide, and water vapor as
byproducts.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the buzz about fuel cells involves the automobile,
because Detroit, with help from Washington, is spending billions to
see whether the devices will someday provide an alternative to the
internal-combustion engine.
</P>
<P>
   To Robert Hockaday, that's starting from the wrong end of the
stick. It'll be years, most experts agree, before fuel-cell
technology is up to the huge challenge of powering cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Hockaday, a former Los Alamos National Laboratory scientist who
says he has been fascinated by fuel cells since childhood, thinks
it makes more sense to start small _ with ``micro-fuel cells'' just
big enough to charge cell phones, digital cameras, pocket
organizers and other miniature devices.
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade ago, Hockaday formed a company, Energy
Related Devices, to pursue that idea as well as solar-energy
research, and in 1995 he left Los Alamos to devote himself full
time to his startup. Two years ago, he won funding from Manhattan
Scientifics, a New York technology incubator.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Manhattan Scientifics announced that Hockaday's
group had reached an important milestone: a micro-fuel cell that
puts out three times as much energy as conventional cell-phone
batteries. The long-term target, according to Hockaday, is 10-times
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   A complete engineering prototype of a product based on the
technology, aimed at the hot cell-phone market, will be ready in
the fall, he says. Assuming Manhattan succeeds in finding a
manufacturing and marketing partner for the technology, it should
reach the market sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   In its initial incarnation the device will supplement rather
than replace conventional batteries _ it won't deliver enough power
to run a phone by itself, but it will provide a steady trickle
charge to keep the regular batteries (any kind but NiCad) from
running down. It'll weigh only a couple of ounces, according to
Hockaday, and users will be able to attach it directly to the
phone, like the secondary batteries some phonemakers already offer,
or keep it in a ``power holster'' in a purse or clipped to a belt.
</P>
<P>
   All users will have to do is replace a tiny cylinder containing
methanol and water every three weeks or so. In return, they can
expect at least three times as much talk time and standby time as
current batteries deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Is Hockaday just another dreamer with a tiny startup and a
cockamamy scheme that'll never make it to market? Could be, but
after spending an hour or two on the phone with him, I don't think
so. Industry Week magazine last year named his micro-fuel cells
``Technology of the Year.'' And industry giants such as Motorola
and Samsung are reportedly working hard on similar projects, though
Hockaday says he's pretty sure he's still in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   The big question is not whether Hockaday is on to some important
technology, but whether he and his associates will be able to line
up the resources needed to commercialize it before competitors
catch up. I'm rooting for him.
</P>
<P>
   You can find out more about Hockaday and his fuel cells at his
Web site ( &LR; www.energyrelatedevices.com &LR; ) and Manhattan Scientifics'
site ( &LR; www.mhtx.com). &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Locking down the PC
</P>
<P>
   I have DSL at home, the kind of ``always-on'' connection that
theoretically makes my computers (I have lots of them) a potential
target for hackers. But because I usually turn my systems off when
I'm not using them, and I don't have any deep, dark secrets on them
anyway, I never worried much about security.
</P>
<P>
   Then, one night in February, I accidentally left a PC on
overnight. The next morning I found a bizarre dialogue box on its
screen: ``Fetch callback failed,'' it said. The only button was
labeled ``Ouch.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Yahoo, then a list of other high-profile Web
sites, began falling victim to a wave of denial-of-service attacks.
Experts said the floods of data that shut them down came from
computers where hackers had, without their owners' knowledge,
planted malicious applications.
</P>
<P>
   I decided it was time to get serious about security, or at least
about assessing the magnitude of the threat.
</P>
<P>
   My first move was to do some online research on ``personal
firewall'' software, programs that monitor network traffic and
attempt to block unauthorized intrusions. Symantec's entry in that
category, called Norton Internet Security 2000, got good reviews,
but most of the sources I checked said BlackICE, a $39.95 program
from a San Mateo company called Network ICE, was considerably
simpler and at least as effective.
</P>
<P>
   So I got an evaluation copy of the program, loaded it up, and
left my PC on for a month to see what would happen. BlackICE, which
runs constantly in the background, logs everything it considers an
intrusion, recording the IP address the suspect data packets came
from and what the program thinks they were up to.
</P>
<P>
   I was astonished at the results. In just a month, BlackICE
recorded 23 intrusions from sites all over the world, the first
from a domain called  &LR; celery.mit.edu &LR; , but most from abroad _
Taiwan, Japan, Germany, Israel, Brazil and a lot of other addresses
I didn't recognize.
</P>
<P>
   One nice feature of BlackICE is its ``AdvICE'' button: You can
click it after selecting an entry in the program's log, and it
opens your browser to a page on the publisher's Web site with
details about the kind of attack in question.
</P>
<P>
   None of those it recorded on my machine were actually
destructive; they were all just ``probes'' attempting to elicit
responses that would indicate a security hole the hacker could come
back to exploit in the future. In most cases, according to the
explanations BlackICE provided, the probes were looking for known
vulnerabilities in Solaris, Linux or other forms of Unix, not for
Windows problems.
</P>
<P>
   I can't be sure that the packets BlackICE considered suspect
really were ill-intentioned, nor that the addresses it recorded
were those the probes really came from. And as best I can tell,
none of the intrusions would have actually produced a harmful
result even if I hadn't had BlackICE to protect me.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of PCs and Macs with always-on cable and DSL
connections is exploding, and it seems it's only a matter of time
before hackers start finding ways to penetrate such machines and
hijack them for nefarious purposes. Under the circumstances,
running a firewall program seems only prudent. Personally, I've
gone back to shutting down my PCs when I'm not using them, but I'm
keeping BlackICE installed just in case.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to learn more about PC security, one excellent
resource is the ShieldsUp Web site ( &LR; grc.com/x/ne.dll?bh0bkyd2 &LR; ),
where Steve Gibson, a well-known PC programming wiz, offers lots of
useful and clearly presented information, as well as free software
that quickly tests your PC for security vulnerabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson also provides detailed assessments of a number of
software firewalls ( &LR; grc.com/su-firewalls.htm &LR; ). Although he used
to be partial to BlackICE, I should note that he's found some flaws
in it; his current favorite is ZoneAlarm 2.1 from Zone Labs of San
Francisco ( &LR; www.zonelabs.com &LR; ). It's free for personal and
nonprofit use and just $19.95 for business use.
</P>
<P>
   None of these programs runs on the Mac, but I know of two others
that do: OpenDoor Networks' DoorStop ( &LR; www2.opendoor.com/ &LR; 
 &LR; doorstop/ &LR; ) and Intego's NetBarrier. DoorStop is available in
several versions, but the ``Personal Edition'' is $59; NetBarrier
is $74.95. OpenDoor, which is headed by a former Apple networking
guru, also provides a useful white paper about Mac OS Internet
security issues at  &LR; www2.opendoor.com/doorstop/macOSsecurity.html.
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Memo to Judge Jackson
</P>
<P>
   Breaking Microsoft or imposing restrictions on its business
practices might be effective ways to prevent Gates &AMP; Co. from
expanding their monopoly into new areas, but they won't do anything
to reduce Windows' overwhelming dominance in PC operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Even splitting the company into multiple ``Baby Bills,'' each
with the right to market all of the current company's products,
won't do that. Competition of that sort might result in lower
prices, but it wouldn't create any new alternatives to Windows or
bolster the chances of existing alternatives such as Linux or BeOS.
On the contrary, lower prices for Windows would actually make it
all the more difficult for challengers to gain any ground.
</P>
<P>
   Some would argue that this is a lost cause _ that Windows is by
now so firmly established as the OS standard that nothing the judge
could do would really reopen the desktop market.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but I think it's worth a try. And it seems to me that
one relatively simple step would go a long way in this direction:
Make Microsoft publish, or at least license on reasonable terms,
the Windows application programming interfaces (APIs), together
with all the supporting code libraries that are needed to make
Windows applications run, to current or future developers of
alternative OSes.
</P>
<P>
   After all, as the good judge argued so convincingly in his
``findings of fact'' last fall, the key to Microsoft's power is
``the applications barrier to entry.'' Few users choose Windows
because it manages hardware so efficiently, and even fewer, I'm
sure, because it's so stable and reliable. People need it because
it's required for most of the applications they want to run.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of IBM's OS/2. Technically, it was far
superior to the Windows versions, but it couldn't run Windows 95
applications, and that killed it.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, most people don't pick Windows at all _ they get it
simply because it's what comes with a PC. But any PC-maker
contemplating switching to an alternative would have to face the
fact that such a move would instantly cost it most of its
customers, because its machines would no longer run the programs
they want and need.
</P>
<P>
   Now suppose Microsoft had to disclose the code and technical
information Windows applications require, and keep doing so as it
developed new versions. Linux distributors, Be and anyone else who
wanted to play _ maybe even IBM again _ could incorporate that code
into their systems, making it possible for customers to run
off-the-shelf (and off-the-Web) Windows applications in these
alternative environments, without rebooting, adding emulation
software or any other special burdens.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this wouldn't trigger any large-scale abandonment of
Windows; if nothing else, inertia would prevent that. But other OS
developers would at least have a chance to demonstrate the merits
of their products without asking customers to give up all the
applications they depend on.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, that might lead to some real competition to Windows _
and isn't that what the case was supposed to be about in the first
place?
</P>
<P>
   Let's hear from you
</P>
<P>
   Make this new column an interactive experience _ pass on your
reactions to what I write, or your own insights about the
technology scene and your tips about cool new products and
services. I can't provide individual tech support or buying advice
_ I don't get paid to do that _ and though I'll respond, either
directly or in print, to as much of your mail as I can, odds are I
won't have time to reply to everyone. But I'll read everything you
send, and I'll take it seriously.

 STILL TIME LEFT TO FILE TAX FORMS  &HT;     By CAROL EMERT 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's April 17, and still you haven't turned in
your tax forms. In fact, you haven't finished them. Perhaps _ sigh
_ you haven't even started them.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly a healthy dose of self-flagellation is in order. But
what then?
</P>
<P>
   First of all, take heart. You may be a procrastinator, but
you're in good company: 25 to 30 percent of Americans turn in their
tax forms on the last possible day. That's not expected to change
this year, even though filers have a two-day reprieve, since April
15, the usual day for filing taxes, fell on a weekend.
</P>
<P>
   If it is impossible to finish your paperwork on time, you need
to get an extension using IRS Form 4868. Like other tax forms, it
must be postmarked or sent electronically by midnight tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Along with hundreds of other IRS forms, 4868 can be printed out
from the agency's home page at &LR;  www.irs.gov &LR; . Click on the Forms &AMP;
Pubs button at the bottom of the page.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, the IRS has an automatic fax number for the 150
most common forms and for answers to frequently asked questions.
You must use a telephone attached to a fax machine; follow the
recorded instrucTions to have documents faxed to you. The number,
(703) 368-9694, is not toll-free.
</P>
<P>
   Many last-minute filers owe the IRS money, since people
expecting refunds tend to file earlier in the year. If you owe,
don't forget to include a check with your extension form.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, you can pay via MasterCard, American Express or
Discover for a fee by calling (888) 272-9829, a commercial service.
Visa does not participate in the program, which charges a small fee
based on how much your tax bill is.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Many libraries, post offices, community centers, copy shops
and IRS branch offices carry paper tax forms, although supplies may
be running low by today. People without Internet access can log on
at the library and print out forms from the IRS site.
</P>
<P>
   IRS staff will be handing out forms at San Francisco's
Montgomery Street BART and Muni station today from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m.
and from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. The IRS branch at 55 Market St. in San
Jose will be handing out forms curbside from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Once your forms are ready to go, you still have to get them
postmarked by midnight. Otherwise, you'll be assessed a monthly
penalty of 0.5 percent of your total tax bill until you pay up,
even if you're requesting an extension.
</P>
<P>
   Several area post offices will be open late this evening.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; As you do your tax return, try to get the math right: If you
send a payment that is at least 10 percent less than the amount
owed, you may be penalized.
</P>
<P>
   People who have Internet access (and even some who don't) have
the option of filing their tax forms electronically. The IRS site
includes a list of commercial software providers, which typically
offer interactive instructions along with electronic forms. Click
Electronic Services at the bottom of the home page, and then click
Online Software Filing Companies for a list of links.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS urges taxpayers to ``e-file'' to cut down on paperwork,
lost documents and other problems. The main advantage to filers is
that refunds typically take three weeks, compared with 10 weeks for
paper filers.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of individual federal tax forms are expected to
be e-filed this year, up from a quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   H&AMP;R Block, Jackson Hewitt and Intuit are the most popular
software services. Most charge a fee of at least $10. Your
neighborhood accountant may also agree to key in the data from your
paper tax form and file it for you electronically, but expect a
charge of up to $60.
</P>
<P>
   Low-income individuals can ask their local IRS office to file
for them electronically if their forms are less than 12 pages long,
said Larry Wright, a spokesman for the IRS in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   If you are e-filing from home, don't wait until 11:58 p.m. to
try to send your documents. E-filings must be routed through a
third-party ``electronic return originator,'' since the IRS is not
set up to receive individual files. Send your e-filing as early as
possible to avoid electronic logjams, Wright advised.
</P>
<P>
   If you are e-filing for the first time, you will need to send a
copy of Form 8453 via snail mail to the IRS; this is your official
ignature, which the IRS keeps on file. In the following years, you
can simply include a personal identification number that the IRS
will assign you in lieu of a hard-copy signature.
</P>
<P>
   And what about your employer's W-2 or other official forms you
typically send in the mail with your tax filing? You don't need to
send them when you file electronically, but you do need to keep
them in case you are audited.
</P>
<P>
   If you have questions about filling out your forms, several
resources are available today.
</P>
<P>
   Answers to the most common questions _ such as the address you
should send your tax forms to _ can be found at  &LR; www.irs.gov &LR;  or
via fax at (703) 368-9694. Recorded answers to more than 140
questions can be found at (800) 829-4477. You'll need a touch-tone
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Live assistance is available via the IRS' toll-free information
line, (800) 829-1040. However, it will be extremely difficult to
get a live agent today on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   IRS agents and volunteer accountants will be staffing local
branch offices today from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. You can't make an
appointment in advance, though, so if you want help, expect to wait
for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Area IRS offices are at 450 Golden Gate in San Francisco,
1301 Clay St. in Oakland, 185 Lennon St. in Walnut Creek, 55 S.
Market St. in San Jose, 777 Sonoma Ave. in Santa Rosa and 1761
Broadway in Vallejo.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to submitting federal tax returns, many Californians
will file their state returns today. It's not necessary to file an
extension request if you can't file today. The state grants an
automatic extension until October 16. However, if you owe money,
your payment is due today, along with form FTB 3519.
</P>
<P>
   The Franchise Tax Board Web site provides downloadable forms and
information about e-filing and other topics at  &LR; www.ftb.ca.gov &LR; .
Refunds will be mailed to e-filers in seven to 10 working days.

ONLINE INVESTING _ WEB PROVIDES ABUNDANCE OF INFO FOR
BIOTECH  INVESTORS 
 &HT;     BY HARRY DOMASH
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Biotech stocks caught fire earlier this year.
The American Stock Exchange Biotech Index more than doubled during
January and February before losing steam in March and plunging in
April.
</P>
<P>
   Like Internet and other tech stocks, biotech stocks have
enamored investors because of the potential rewards from choosing a
company with a product that makes it big.
</P>
<P>
   The biotech label usually applies to firms that use genetic
engineering to manufacture drugs or other products. Most biotech
drugs are developed by small companies hoping to come up with a
blockbuster product such as a cure for cancer or AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech investing is difficult for most investors, because few
of us understand the issues involved in assessing the potential
worth of a biotech product.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there is a remarkable amount of information on the
Internet to help investors. A good place to begin is the Drug and
Biotech Investor, a weekly newsletter published by the Bull Market
Report, a newsletter focusing on technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The report requires a subscription. You can get the newsletter
free by e-mail, or you can access it on the Web at
 &LR; www.bull-market.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Start by clicking on the Drug and Biotech Investor on Bull
Market Report's home page. The newsletter started publishing on
Aug. 31, 1999, and the current, as well as all past, issues are
available from the Drug and Biotech Investor page.
</P>
<P>
   Click the Drug and Biotech Portfolio to review the portfolio.
When I checked last week, the portfolio contained 19 companies
divided into three sections: large-cap pharmaceuticals, plus
mid-and small-cap biotech companies. The large-cap section includes
large biotech firms such as Amgen and Genentech, along with large
drug companies such as Pfizer and Merck.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the portfolio lists the date and price when
each stock was added to the portfolio, a 12-month target price, and
the percent return of each stock as of the end of the previous
month.
</P>
<P>
   The results were good, most stocks were up, with many showing
triple digit returns. On the downside, most stocks were added to
the portfolio last fall, and are now close to their 12-month target
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The newsletter was originally written by Dr. Eddy Arnold,
professor of chemistry at Rutgers University in New Jersey.
However, it's important to note that Arnold left the newsletter in
late January and no changes have been made to the portfolio since
then.
</P>
<P>
   If you scroll past the portfolio listings, you will see a single
paragraph description and analysis of each company. The paragraph
details the products under development, along with an opinion of
future prospects. An additional paragraph includes excerpts from
the management discussion in the company's latest quarterly or
annual report.
</P>
<P>
   Each weekly edition of the newsletter typically includes an
overview of current market conditions, and a description of a
company not included in the current portfolio. These discussions
often read like recommendations, but none of the recently featured
stocks has been added to the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, most issues of the newsletter provide good ideas
for further research.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some ideas for analyzing biotech companies.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCT PIPELINE: All new drugs must go through a lengthy
testing and approval process supervised by the Food and Drug
Administration. Each drug must complete three sets of clinical
trials called Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III, typically running
18 months, two years, and three to four years, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Products successfully completing the clinical trials are
submitted to the FDA for marketing approval, a process usually
taking one or two years to complete.
</P>
<P>
   Given these time frames, it is best to focus on companies with
at least two products in Phase III trails or awaiting final FDA
approval. More is better, and you want companies with a steady
stream of products in all testing stages.
</P>
<P>
   The place to find information on clinical trials is Recap
( &LR; www.recap.com &LR; ), the site of Recombinant Capital, a San Francisco
consulting firm specializing in biotech financing issues.
</P>
<P>
   Click on Clinicals to display Recap's clinical trials database
search tool. It is impressive. You can look up all the trials for a
specific company, search for companies with products in trials for
specific diseases such as diabetes, arthritis, cancer, etc., or
companies with products in a specific development phase, such as in
Phase III trials, waiting for FDA approval, etc.
</P>
<P>
   BURNING CASH: Most biotech firms have few, if any, products
already on the market generating income. Companies without income
to cover expenses are said to be ``burning cash.'' Analysts often
compare a company's assets to its ``burn rate'' to determine how
long the company can survive before running out of cash. They say
it's better to stick with companies with a least a two-year supply
of cash on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Recombinant Capital's Signals magazine ( &LR; www.signalsmag.com &LR; )
lists a ``survival index'' for 250 biotech companies. The survival
index measures how long, in years, a company can last on its
existing cash.
</P>
<P>
   You can see the survival index by selecting Contents and then
Financial Snapshot in the Signals vs. Noise section to display a
summary of financial factors for various company categories.
</P>
<P>
   Click on any category to see the figures for individual
companies. You may want to get a cup of coffee at this point
because the download takes some time. Once downloaded, you can
scroll through the list to locate a specific company.
</P>
<P>
   PARTNERS: Most biotech products sound promising. However, it is
difficult to know if there are better competing products in the
pipeline, and the size of the potential market even if the product
is successful.
</P>
<P>
   Small biotech companies usually form partnerships with large
pharmaceutical firms to market their products. The existence of
these partnerships means these in-the-know companies think highly
enough of the product's prospects to take on the marketing.
</P>
<P>
   You can find a list of marketing and research partnerships on
the Recap site by selecting Alliances, and then typing the company
name into the Database Quick Search entry box.
</P>
<P>
   A good place to keep up with biotech news, especially the status
of clinical trials, is BioSpace.com ( &LR; www.biospace.com &LR; ).

BIOSCOPE: FRIDAY'S DEBACLE MAY HAVE CREATED VALUES IN
BIOTECH  STOCKS 
 &HT;     BY TOM ABATE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The market free fall finally pulled biotech
stocks into negative territory last week and now the question is
when and where they'll hit bottom.
</P>
<P>
   All year, biotech issues had outperformed tech stocks, but
Friday's selling frenzy proved too strong to resist.
</P>
<P>
   The largest biotech stock index, which covers 203 companies,
sank 13 percent Friday. That plunge wiped out the last of the gains
chalked up since January and put the index down nearly 3 percent
for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biotech is certainly not divorced from the overall market
mentality,'' said Tom Dietz, senior managing partner of Pacific
Growth Equities, a biotech specialty bank in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Friday's debacle, jitters in the broader market had
closed the window on initial public offerings in biotech. Although
Exelixis Inc. of South San Francisco snuck in just before it shut
last week, neighboring Rigel Pharmaceuticals wasn't so lucky. It
postponed its IPO indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a gross abandonment of biotech,'' Dietz said.
``But even the guys who play long term are letting the market hit
bottom before they start buying.''
</P>
<P>
   Where biotech bottoms obviously depends on the overall market
psychology. But Bob Adler, president of AMG Services, which tracks
mutual fund money flows, offered one ray of hope: Money flowed into
biotech mutual funds last week after four straight weeks of
outflows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only $130 million, the smallest inflow of the year, but
it was positive nevertheless,'' Adler said.
</P>
<P>
   That suggests that investors are sitting on the sidelines
waiting to buy, he said. Of course, his figures came before
Friday's bloodbath. If spooked investors withdraw money from
biotech funds, it could deepen and prolong the slide in share
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Jim McCamant, editor of the Medical Technology Stock Letter in
Berkeley, said he'll be buying next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friday's plunge was so big it created values,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCamant thinks biotech stocks will get a lift from news on the
horizon. Cancer researchers will gather in New Orleans next month
for the American Society for Clinical Oncology, the most
prestigious scientific gathering in the field. Cancer is enormously
important to biotech firms. Roughly half of the 369 biotech
medicines now undergoing human trials are cancer related, according
to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of companies release their best clinical trial results
at this meeting,'' said McCamant. Such news often gives companies a
lift.
</P>
<P>
   Another blast of positive news will come sometime in the next
two months, when public and private scientists complete a
preliminary map of the human genome. Excitement over genomics
sparked the earlier biotech rally and McCamant thinks it could help
biotech recover.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, perhaps, the market should eventually realize
that biotech firms are better bets than the Internet stocks whose
weakness sparked the sell-off, said Steve Burrill, who runs his own
biotech investment bank in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have real companies with real products, not like the
Internet companies that are still dreaming of becoming
businesses,'' Burrill said.
</P>
<P>
   But since it might take a couple of weeks for the broader market
to stabilize, biotech is probably in for continued uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see big moves like this, the market bounces around so
much that I wouldn't expect to see a bottom until the end of
April,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So if you're interested in biotech, do what the pros are doing.
Wait, watch and focus on the two P's: profits and products.
</P>
<P>
   Profitable biotech firms like Amgen, Biogen, Immunex and
Genentech have all been clobbered, somewhat indiscriminately. When
the rebound comes, they'll lead the bounce back.
</P>
<P>
   Don't ignore the vast majority of biotech firms that are still
losing money. But check out the product pipeline charts on their
Web sites before you start bottom fishing. Firms with several
products in Phase II or, even better, Phase III trials are your
best bets. There are no guarantees, but the later in the testing
process you buy into a company, the less the risk.
</P>
<P>
   And don't worry about getting in too late. Dave Flores,
publisher of the BioCentury newsletter in San Carlos, Calif., likes
to say that the stock chart of a biotech firm with a newly approved
drug looks like a hockey stick.
</P>
<P>
   There's a little rise as the company nears the end of the
testing process. But the real gains come after the drug gets past
the FDA and delivers revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, don't worry that biotech is facing some huge
reckoning like the dot-catastrophe stocks. When biotech was
overvalued earlier in the year, I warned the bubble couldn't last.
</P>
<P>
   Now I can't predict where the sector will bottom, but I can tell
you this: Biotech has real products. It will come back.
</P>
<P>
   CAPITOL CONNECTION: Some 40 members of the House of
Representatives have reactivated a biotech caucus, led by Rep. Tom
Ewing, R-Ill., and Rep. Cal Dooley, D-Hanford (Kings County).
</P>
<P>
   The caucus first formed in the early '90s, during the last big
bout of public and Wall Street fascination with biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   But as public interest in the sector waned, the caucus fell
idle. In recent months, however, issues like genetically engineered
food labeling, concerns over gene patents and the privacy issues
surrounding the release of genetic information have all heightened
congressional interest. It hasn't hurt that biomedical research and
drug development are seen as high-paying industries akin to
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech industry representatives are delighted. ``Any time you
can get 40 members in a room at one time to explain your issues,
that's great,'' said Nancy Myers, a lobbyist for the Biotechnology
Industry Organization.
</P>
<P>
   INCIVILITY: Last week, I moderated a debate over the risks and
benefits of genetically modified foods. As strong as emotions run
over the issue, it was a polite affair until the end, when someone
came up and assaulted one speaker with a pie.
</P>
<P>
   No charges were pressed. It was not that big a deal. But it
seemed so foolish and counterproductive that I wonder why it
happened at all.
</P>
<P>
   Understand the setting. A hundred or so people in a room. Two
speakers on stage for an hourlong discussion. I can imagine no
better example of free speech.

   Most of what passes for free speech isn't really free. It's
filtered through the media, through people like me who have
shortcomings and biases. So why penalize someone who is willing to
stand up in an open forum? Why inhibit the freest form of free
speech we have available?
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase Othello, he who steals my purse steals trash. But
he who filches another's free speech robs that which enriches him
not, but makes us all the poorer.

THIS KIND OF SEASONAL HUMOR CAN BE TAXING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, MO. _ You're nursing a migraine, snapping pencils
and up to your elbows in 1099-Bs. How funny is that?
</P>
<P>
   It's tax time and, once again, America insists on opening its
tattered bag of tax jokes. As today's filing deadline nears, it may
seem that everyone but you is laughing it up, even when the jokes
stink.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one from Tom Antion &AMP; Associates, sales consultants:
</P>
<P>
   ``A tax return is like a girdle. If you put the wrong figure in
it, you're likely to get pinched.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Wide Web's got a million of them.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City-based Hallmark Cards has joined the party, allowing
Internet users to send free electronic messages sure to tickle the
ribs of that special tax preparer. The e-cards say, ``Happy Tax
Day,'' and Hallmark expects to move at least a quarter-million. One
card features the ``The Adventures of IRS Man,'' who holds a
taxpayer upside down to shake out his change.
</P>
<P>
   You never knew that tax time was such a hoot.
</P>
<P>
   OK. We all know it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe it's not terribly tough to find something humorous
about W-2s in a world where even presidential adultery can put
late-night audiences in stitches for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call tax day a celebration,'' said Hallmark.com
spokeswoman Kathi Mishek. ``But there's nothing wrong with taking
your medicine with a spoonful of sugar.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why those kooky accountants at CPAdvantage.com came up
with a list of accounting jokes. More than 100 in all, they range
from pickup lines, such as ``Nice assets,'' to jokes only
number-crunchers would love, such as ``You might be a CPA if ... at
the movie `Indecent Proposal' you did an NPV calculation.''
</P>
<P>
   NPV calculation. Get it?
</P>
<P>
   Try this, then: What's the difference between the short form and
the long form?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you use the short form, the government gets your money. If
you use the long form, the CPA gets your money.''
</P>
<P>
   Stop, you're killing us.
</P>
<P>
   If any kind of humor is hit or miss, it's tax-time humor. A
mouse click to www.4comedy.com proves it.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site features ``Spotlight: Taxing Humor.'' It mixes the
rather clever _ ``A harp is a piano after taxes'' _ with a clunky
rim shot _ ``Americans are now in a daze of intaxication.'' Half
the lines are bitter: ``If our president wants to abolish poverty,
he can do it by abolishing the IRS.''
</P>
<P>
   Far funnier, accountants will tell you, are the true stories
about tax preparation. A favorite at H&AMP;R Block Inc. involves a
California client who donated his deceased wife's body to science
and wished to write it off as a charitable contribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``True story,'' company spokesman Todd Ransom said. ``The
preparer had to come up with a fair-market value on the cadaver.''
</P>
<P>
   So the tax preparer calls up some medical colleges and
hospitals. ``The strangest part of it,'' Ransom said, ``is, yes, he
could take a deduction. The IRS accepted it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that's funny. But is this?:
</P>
<P>
   ``When there is an income tax, the just man will pay more and
the unjust less on the same amount of income.''
</P>
<P>
   The Greek philosopher Plato said it 24 centuries ago, and even
now it's too true to be funny.
</P>
<P>
   In cyberspace, where everyone's a comedian, Web masters have
been taxing their noggins to one-up Ben Franklin's classic line,
``Nothing is certain but death and taxes.'' So at
www.taxspecialists.com, they came up with ``Death: to stop paying
taxes suddenly.''
</P>
<P>
   Another site that bills itself as Ammo for Freedom Fighters
offers a quote from Will Rogers. ``The difference between death and
taxes,'' Rogers said, ``is death doesn't get worse every time
Congress meets.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, talk show host David Letterman weighed in with
his ``Top 10 Dumb Accountant Tax Tips'':
</P>
<P>
   10. Don't file a W-2 form unless your name begins with ``W.''
</P>
<P>
   9. Answer every question ``Wouldn't you like to know?''
</P>
<P>
   8. Hide all money in mattress and on return write, ``No money
hidden in mattress.''
</P>
<P>
   7. If you've just eaten, don't do taxes for at least half an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   6. Hire yourself as an employee, fire yourself, sue yourself for
discrimination, deduct court costs.
</P>
<P>
   5. Report $1 billion in income so IRS will think you're some
sort of big shot.
</P>
<P>
   It's downhill from there.
</P>
<P>
   Enough with the tax jokes?
</P>
<P>
   Please, said Laura R. Ingraham, assistant professor of
accounting at North Carolina State University. She, after all,
knows the meaning of NPV calculation. It stands for net present
value, and refers to the time value of a dollar. No, she said, that
joke isn't very funny.
</P>
<P>
   Ingraham used to give her students copies of a letter supposedly
written to the Internal Revenue Service by a woman whose children
were denied as deductible dependents. The woman wrote in jest, ``I
have questioned whether these are my children for years. They are
evil and expensive. ... This year they are yours!''
</P>
<P>
   Said Ingraham: ``Besides that letter, I haven't come up with
anything that made me laugh at taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to an intriguing question making the rounds: How
do you make an IRS auditor laugh on a Monday?
</P>
<P>
   Tell the auditor a joke on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rollie Woods, an IRS spokesman in St. Louis, didn't even giggle
at that last week. ``You work for the IRS, you best develop a thick
hide,'' he said. ``By and large, we're willing to go along with a
joke.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not easy, Woods said, when the jabs gets vicious.
``I've seen editorial cartoons with scenes of IRS employees being
maimed, shot at ... and that's when it gets personal.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate irony is that IRS workers _ the butt of so much bad
humor _ are forbidden from using their computers to pass along
their own jokes. And take it from Woods: What they know about tax
cheats is hilarious.

PENTAGON URGES DELAY IN ARMS SALES TO TAIWAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon has recommended deferring for at least
a year a decision on Taiwan's request to purchase four
sophisticated American destroyers, as well as diesel submarines and
surveillance aircraft, a senior defense official said on Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Clinton administration officials are expected to discuss
on Monday Taiwan's request for advanced arms, which officials in
Taipei say are needed to defend against what they perceive to be a
growing threat from China, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   No final decision has been made on the request, but the
Pentagon's recommendation is expected to prevail since defense
officials had argued more strenuously than other parts of the
administration for doing more to help Taiwan's military.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's recommendation, first reported in The Washington
Post, would postpone for at least a year consideration of a request
by Taiwan that had caused serious diplomatic strains between the
United States and China, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, China has strongly warned against the
sale of advanced weapons to Taiwan. At the same time, Taiwanese
military officials have made it clear that they consider the
weapons essential to the island's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of granting Taiwan's request to purchase four destroyers
equipped with the Navy's advanced Aegis radar systems, the Pentagon
has recommended a study of the island's maritime defenses, which
have grown increasingly weak. The Pentagon is already examining
Taiwan's air defenses and its anti-submarine warfare strategies.
</P>
<P>
   While the Pentagon called for deferring a decision on the most
advanced weapons, it has recommended going ahead with sales of a
number of other weapon systems, including air-to-air missiles and
ground-based radar, the official said. Details of those sales must
still be worked out, the official said, so there is not yet a cost
figure attached to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a robust package that will meet Taiwan's defense needs,''
the official said, ``but there are other things that need to be
studied further.''
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's request for the advanced weapons, particularly the four
Arleigh Burke cruisers with their sophisticated Aegis air defense
radars, have put the administration in a tough spot politically.
China, which considers Taiwan a renegade province, has signaled
that it would consider such a sale a violation of its sovereignty.
But Taiwan has considerable support in Congress, where the island's
strongest supporters seek a weapons sale as a price for one of
Clinton's other goals, improved trade ties with China.
