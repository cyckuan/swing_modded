<HEADLINE> White House Allocates 900 Million Dollars for Homeless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Those grants will fund proven, successful programs that help
homeless families, veterans and children and people looking for
work," President Clinton said Saturday in his weekly radio
address.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the grants will go to more than 350 states and
communities, and more than 1,000 non-profit groups.
</P>
<P>
About 750 million dollars will be spent on long-term programs
designed to keep homeless people off the streets by providing drug
treatment, job training and other social services.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 150 million dollars will go to provide shelter
and food on a short-term basis to the needy.
</P>
<P>
New York City is to receive about 60.5 million dollars,
according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. But
New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the move was politically
motivated and designed to help first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
who is competing the New York senate seat with him.

<HEADLINE> Conditions Favorable for Solving Sudan Issue: Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The present conditions in Sudan
are more favorable than any time before for seeking a comprehensive
political solution to conflicts in the country, an opposition
leader said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sadek el-Mahdi, leader of Sudan's Ummah Party, made the remark
after a meeting here with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
El-Mahdi did not elaborate, but he was apparently referring to
the steps taken recently by Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-
Bashir.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir declared a three-month state of emergency and
dissolved the National Assembly (Parliament) on December 12, as a
result of his power struggle with parliament Speaker Hassan al
Turabi.
</P>
<P>
The ouster of Turabi, who reportedly put hurdles to the
reconciliation and peace process, was said to have paved the way
for the process.
</P>
<P>
El-Mahdi said he discussed with Moussa steps that should be
taken for convening a peace conference to include all parties
related to the Sudanese issue to seek a solution to the country's
problems.
</P>
<P>
No date has been set yet, he said, but the time is now ripe to
act under an Egyptian-Libyan proposal that all parties appoint
representatives to a committee that will convene a national
reconciliation conference.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he stressed the necessity and importance to
coordinate between the Egyptian-Libyan initiative and another one
put forward by the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, or
IGAD, grouping Eastern African countries.
</P>
<P>
The IGAD regional initiative has involved direct negotiations
between the government and the Sudan People's Liberation Army, the
main guerilla force headed by John Garang.
</P>
<P>
The east African proposal only provides for a dialog between
Khartoum and SPLA, whereas the Arab plan includes all opposition
groups, represented by the umbrella opposition National Democratic
Alliance (NDA).
</P>
<P>
El-Mahdi said the IGAD countries must play a role in mediating a
political solution to the Sudanese problem. The 16-year-old civil
war in Africa's biggest country has claimed nearly 2 million lives.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government and the Muslim opposition parties, which
want to share power, have accepted the Egyptian-Libyan plan, but
the southern rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army, which has been
fighting for greater autonomy for the south, favored the U.S.-
backed IGAD proposal.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Fighter Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's leading anti-Israeli
military group Hezbollah Saturday announced that one of its
fighters was killed in south Lebanon during clashes with Israeli
troops.
</P>
<P>
The group's statement said Bilal Bazal, 26, was killed Saturday
when he and his colleagues attacked an outpost of the pro-Israeli
South Lebanon Army (SLA) at Kfar Houneh in the eastern sector of
the Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
A militiaman was also slightly wounded during the fire exchange,
Lebanese security sources said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas also
launched operations against SLA's Rihane outpost in the same area.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israeli warplanes blasted several suspected
Hezbollah targets in south Lebanon, firing at least four missiles.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 15-kilometer-deep buffer zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the declared aim of shielding its north from Lebanese
guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's resistance movement has since been fighting to oust
the Israelis and the SLA militiamen.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Public Sector Said Secured Against Y2K Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 25 (Xinhua) -- All computer systems of Egypt's
government agencies and the public sector have been secured against
the millennium problem, also known as Y2k bug, through successful
tests, an official said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ahab Elwi, chief of Egypt's Central Agency for Public
Mobilization and Statistics, told a press conference that
alternative expediency plans have also been tested in preparation
for any eventuality that might arise after clocks bid 1999
farewell.
</P>
<P>
Elwi singled out the sectors of oil, electricity, health,
banking, communications, sanitary drainage, Suez Canal and Cairo
International Airport flights control as the most vital sectors
with direct bearing on daily life.
</P>
<P>
These sectors are now Y2K compliant, the official added.
</P>
<P>
Elwi said the main emergency operations room at his agency, with
access to similar rooms in ministries and government institutions,
will start work on Thursday, December 30.
</P>
<P>
Most older computers, computerized equipment and software
programs were programmed to recognize only the last two digits of a
year. These computers may misread the year 2000 as 1900, causing
technical malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
The millennium problem might affect the computer systems for
electricity, water, payrolls, elevators and gas pumps.
</P>
<P>
Egypt set up a specific committee in early 1998 and has taken
steps ever since to secure the public sector against the Y2K bug.

<P>
ABU DHABI, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Passengers released from
a hijacked Indian Airlines plane are now on their way back to India
after receiving medical treatments in Dubai, the United Arab
Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
They were escorted by Indian Civil Aviation Minister Sharad
Yadav, who arrived in the UAE on a special plane Saturday morning
to tackle the case.
</P>
<P>
The heavily-armed hijackers released 25 Indian passengers,
including 14 women, 10 children and one injured man early Saturday
morning when the Airbus-300 stayed at the Al Minhad Airbase near
Dubai city. The body of a man who was stabbed to death by the
hijackers was also offloaded from the plane.
</P>
<P>
The Indian minister earlier held talks with Chairman of the
Dubai Civil Aviation Department Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al Maktoum.
He expressed his country's gratitude to the UAE authorities for
their effort to help save the 25 hostages, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The hijacked plane stayed on the ground at the UAE airbase for
nearly five hours, during which it took on food, water for the
hostages and fuel for the plane. It took off again at about 5:10
local time (01:10 GMT) and was now in the Southern Afghanistan city
of Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
The plane, originally with 189 people including 11 crew members
on board, was taken over when it was on a routine flight from Nepal
to India. It had landed in India and Pakistan before touching down
in the UAE.
</P>
<P>
The five heavily-armed hijackers, whose status not known, had
reportedly demanded political asylum in Afghanistan, but was
rejected. They are now demanding the Indian government to release a
Pakistani religious leader and some Kashmir militants now held in
Indian jails, reports said.
</P>

No one knows how long they will stay in Afghanistan and what
their next demands will be.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Envisages 21st Century's Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel said on Saturday that Turkey's major goal in the new
millennium is to be one of the 10 major developed countries in the
world.
</P>
<P>
"Following in the footsteps of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the
founder of our republic, we shall continue with our ceaseless
efforts to equal, if not surpass, the levels of achievement in the
most advanced countries of the world," said Demirel in a blueprint
report for Turkey in the 21st century, entitled "Turkey Toward
2000", at an annual New Year press conference at his presidency.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said that Turkey will strive to become a full member of
the European Union (EU) at the shortest possible time in the new
century.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey's membership will be a concrete contribution to the
pluralist structure of European integration," he added.
</P>
<P>
Once accepted as an EU member, Demirel predicted, "Turkey will
continue to play a leading role in ensuring prosperity, stability,
and peace in the Black Sea, Caspian, and Mediterranean basins, and
will contribute to the establishment of closer ties between Asia
and Europe."
</P>
<P>
Demirel pledged that Turkey will meet EU membership criteria in
various areas of socio-economic development, and will create the
conditions necessary for Turkish citizens to compete with their
counterparts on a global scale.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on specific development programs, he said that Turkey
is expected to become one of the leading energy consumers in the
world and a center for energy distribution thanks to the
construction of natural gas and petroleum pipelines which will link
energy-producing areas in the Caspian and Central Asian countries
to world markets.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country's ambitious Southeast Anatolia Project,
the largest agro-economic project in Turkey's history, will bear
fruits, thus contributing to the world food security by increasing
agricultural productivity.
</P>
<P>
In the 47-page report, Demirel also evaluated Turkey's
achievements and difficulties in the past year.
</P>
<P>
He listed the approval by EU at its Helsinki summit of Turkey's
candidacy status for full membership of the 15-member European club
as the most remarkable success and earthquakes which hit Turkey in
August and November as the hardest blow to the country's
development.

<HEADLINE> Russia Starts Operation to Storm Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal forces launched
a key stage of an operation to storm Grozny, capital of the
breakaway republic of Chechnya, Friday midnight and an operation
to clear Grozny of militants began Saturday night, Russia's media
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The goal of this stage is to take full control of Grozny and to
clear the city of rebels, Itar-Tass quoted credible sources at the
staff of the federal army grouping as saying.
</P>
<P>
A 500-member force of Chechen volunteers headed by Grozny's
former mayor Beslan Gantamirov, is fighting a way into central
Grozny from three directions, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Russian Air Force Commander Anatoly Kornukov told journalists
in Moscow Saturday that the Chechen militia led by Gantamirov will
solve the main tasks of forcing militants out of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
"The brunt of the task in Grozny is borne by the militia, and
they are trained to implement it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The commander said that federal units have blocked the exits
from Grozny and isolated the battle zone to prevent rebels from
breaking through to Grozny from the southern mountain areas.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest Interfax report, the Russia's combined
army command in the North Caucasus has reported that now
Gantamirov's Chechen militia units are carrying out a mop-up
operation in Grozny, backed by special rapid reaction and elite
OMON police and interior troops entering the city from all sides
with gun support from units positioned on the city perimeter.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, another Interfax report citing Chechen sources said
that intensive fighting has been underway in Grozny since Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Federal soldiers of the Western and Eastern groups are
advancing from the city outskirts and tightening their
encirclement of the Chechen rebels with heavy artillery pounding
the city throughout the night and morning, said the report.
</P>
<P>
While explosions are heard "almost every minute" and large-
caliber weapons are firing from all directions, the Russian troops
are using smoke as a screen to keep the rebels from being able to
fire accurately at their armored vehicles, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Grozny has been mapped into 15 sectors in which the federal
airpower and army reconnaissance had scouted rebel positions.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that it could take the federal units a few
days to fly the Russian flag on the Chechen President Aslan
Maskhadov's residence on the Street Revolyutsiy in downtown Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Russia began its military offensive against the Chechen
separatists in late September after Chechen rebels' armed
incursions into neighboring federal republic of Daghestan and a
spate of apartment building blasts that claimed over 300 people in
Moscow and two other Russian cities. Russian authorities blamed
Chechen extremists for planning and carrying out the terrorist
acts.
</P>
<P>
Over the past weeks, Russian groupings successively freed the
second biggest Chechen city of Gudermes and other key towns of
Argun, Urus-Martan and Shali, closed the surrounding of Grozny. By
now, Russian units have reportedly controlled all flatland
Chechnya, or over two thirds of the republic's territory, where 90
percent of Chechen population live.

Airbus-300 aircraft was hijacked Friday on its flight from
Kathmandu, Nepal, to New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Previously the hijackers kept forcing the pilot to talk with
the authorities of the four airports the plane had landed on its
terrifying journey in South Asia and to the Middle East during the
past 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Akhtar Mansoor, a civil official of the militia, talked with
the hijackers, who asked the Taliban to convey their message to
the Indian government, according to Mutawakil.
</P>
<P>
One of the hijackers named Ibrahim also demanded the release of
his brother Masood Azhar, who was a journalist.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia have proposed the United Nations to send a
delegation to talk with the hijackers so that the militia should
not be blamed, said Mutawakil.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban representative in the United Nations has raised the
proposal to the international organization, he added.
</P>
<P>
"No one should blame the Taliban for that event," he said,
adding that they are doing whatever they can to secure the safety
of the some 160 people on board.
</P>
<P>
He said New Delhi has been in contact with the Taliban and
asked the latter to take care of the passengers.
</P>
<P>
India Friday suspected the hijacking has some connection with
the alleged terrorist Osama bin Laden, who is now living in
Taliban-controlled part of Afghanistan. However, the Taliban have
rejected these allegations.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers also reiterated that they will not leave
Afghanistan and threatened that they will destroy the plane if
anybody attempts to approach it.
</P>
<P>
The hijacked plane, with 185 people on board at the take-off,
grounded in the Kandahar airport early Saturday after its landings
in India's Amritsar, Pakistan's Lahore and the United Arab
Emirates' Dubai.
</P>
<P>
At the Dubai airbase, 25 women and children were released and a
dead body was sent out of the aircraft.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Buy More Natural Gas from Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish government has
decided to raise its import of natural gas from Russia to meet the
demand of the ever-increasing consumption at home.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said Saturday that by the beginning of 2001,
Turkey will receive some 3.9 billion cubic meters of extra natural
gas annually from Russia. Currently, Turkey purchases 9 billion
cubic meters of natural gas from Russia.
</P>
<P>
The natural gas pipeline, which starts from Russia, passes
through Ukraine and Bulgaria before it reaches Turkey. The General
Director of the Turkish Natural Gas company, Gokhan Yardim, said
that the country had obtained a 78 million U.S. dollar credit from
the European Investment Bank and Black Sea Bank for the purchase of
the extra natural gas and an agreement to the effect had been
signed.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been pressed hard for more supply of natural gas.
Much of the country's power supply in urban areas come from a new
generation of combined-cycle, gas-fired power stations. The natural
gas, a clean energy, is also badly in need for home heating.
</P>
<P>
Drawing a lesson from a recent interruption of natural gas
supply from Russia, the natural gas company concluded an agreement
with the Turkish Oil Corporation to store natural gas in the
Marmara Region.
</P>
<P>
Another storage project is under way by the Salt Lake in the
interior of Turkey. The Turkish Government has also sent experts to
Bulgaria, Romania and Russia to study their natural gas storage
facilities.

<HEADLINE> Four Key Falun Gong Cult Members Sentenced in Beijing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Four key members of the banned
Falun Gong cult were sentenced today to prison terms ranging from
7-18 years by the Beijing No.1 Intermediate People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Li Chang, Wang Zhiwen, Ji Liewu and Yao Jie were sentenced to
18, 16,12 and seven years respectively in today's first instance
of trial. The men were charged with organizing and using the cult
to obstruct justice, causing human deaths by organizing and using
the cult, and illegally obtaining state secrets.
</P>
<P>
On December 15, the No.1 branch of the Beijing People's
Procuratorate initiated its public prosecution of the four at the
Beijing No.1 Intermediate People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Today the court held a closed session of the trial specifically
dealing with the charge of stealing state secrets, which was
followed by an open session for the remaining counts.
</P>
<P>
Court investigations show that the accused had colluded with
Falun Gong leader Li Hongzhi in setting up the organization, in
formulating the charter of Falun Gong and related cult rules, and
in the establishment of 39 Falun Gong subheadquarters, 1,900
teaching posts and over 28,000 practicing posts across the country.
</P>
<P>
The court found that Li Hongzhi and the four accused had
organized illegal public demonstrations at government organs and
institutions in Beijing, Tianjin and other parts of the country,
which seriously disrupted public order. Of the demonstrations, 78
had participation of 300 people or more.

<HEADLINE> Four Key Falun Gong Cult Members Sentenced in Beijing (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On April 25 this year, Li Chang and others organized over 10,
000 Falun Gong practitioners from Beijing and elsewhere in the
country to stage an illegal sit-in demonstration at the Chinese
central leadership compound Zhongnanhai, seriously disrupting the
work of government organs, public order and the stability of the
Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Later, Li and others, following orders of Li Hongzhi, plotted
to gather the practitioners in Beijing, provinces of Jilin and
Sichuan and other places in an attempt to oppose the government
for a long period of time.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi and the accused also illegally published Falun Gong
promotional materials, raking in a total of 45.13 million yuan ( 5.
4 million U.S. dollars) in illegal profit.
</P>
<P>
The accused and others manipulated the members of the Falun
Gong cult to spread heresy -- actions which ultimately led to the
deaths of many people. By the end of August this year, over 1,400
Falun Gong practitioners had died as a result of refusing to take
medicine because the Falun Gong Cult doesn't believe in medicine
and of self-inflicted injuries, or by committing suicide.
</P>
<P>
To thwart the government's investigation and ban of the cult,
the accused and others attempted through various means to
illegally acquire state secrets.
</P>
<P>
Materials containing a total of 37 separate items of secret
state information were later retrieved from their residences, the
court found.
</P>
<P>
Li Chang and others also leaked the top-secret information in
Falun Gong articles and open letters to the government, causing
serious consequences.

<P>
The court held that the accused had willingly acted in
accordance with Li Hongzhi in disregarding laws, and committed a
host of serious crimes, including organizing and employing cults,
obstructing justice, causing human deaths, and illegally obtaining
state secrets.
</P>
<P>
Li Chang, Wang Zhiwen and Ji Liewu were the principal culprits
in the crimes and Yao Jie was an accessory, and each should be
punished accordingly, the court said.
</P>
<P>
However, in view of the fact that Li Chang and Yao Jie
confessed to their participation in the planning and organizing of
the illegal public demonstrations at government organs and media
institutions, and showed some repentance by acknowledging the true
nature of the Falun Gong cult, the court showed leniency in their
sentences.
</P>
<P>
The court, in line with the Criminal Law and the explanations
of the Supreme People's Court and Supreme People's Procuratorate
on criminal activities of cults, sentenced Li Chang to 18 years in
prison on the three charges and stripped him of his political
rights for five years.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhiwen, Ji Liewu and Yao Jie were sentenced to 16 years,
12 years and seven years respectively and deprived of their
political rights for four years, two years and one year.
</P>
<P>
The four accused and their lawyers challenged the accusations
in court today.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the trial were individuals from all walks of
life, journalists and relatives of the four accused.

<HEADLINE> Unity of Sudan, Egypt Helps Arab Nation: Sudanese Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Culture and Information
Minister Ghazi Salah el-Din underlined on Sunday that the unity of
Sudan and Egypt forms a strength for overcoming differences and
closing ranks of the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with the Cairo-based Voice of the Arab
radio from Khartoum, Salah el-Din noted that Sudanese President
Omar Hassan al-Bashir's recent visit to Egypt afforded an
opportunity for the two countries to discuss issues concerning the
Arab world and the region.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between al-Bashir and his Egyptian counterpart Hosni
Mubarak gave an impetus to the bilateral ties and served as a
turning point in the ties as the leaders seek ways to overcome the
problems between the two sides, said Salah el-Din, also spokesman
of the Sudanese government.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents agreed to settle all pending issues, mainly
the border dispute over the Halayeb area, through dialog, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Sudanese relations soured after Cairo accused
Khartoum of supporting Islamic militants who attempted to topple
the secular Egyptian government in early 1990s. The two neighbors
went into brief armed clashes over Halayeb and Egypt later recalled
its ambassador. The ties have been much improved in recent two
years because of joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir ended a two-day visit to Egypt on Thursday, during
which the two countries agreed to normalize relations and set up a
joint ministerial committee to follow up steps in this regard.
Egypt also decided to send its ambassador back to Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the domestic situation in Sudan, Salah el-Din
reiterated Khartoum's readiness to hold a peace conference grouping
all parties related to the Sudanese issue under an Egyptian-Libyan
initiative.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government and the opposition parties are in
agreement that a democratic regime is needed in the country, based
on the principle of equal rights for all political forces, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Libya proposed earlier this year a five-point peace
plan, which calls for an end to Sudan's 16-year-old civil war
between the government and the southern rebel Sudanese People's
Liberation Army and for a peace conference aimed at seeking
national reconciliation in the largest country of Africa.

attorneys for the accused presented evidence at court today.
</P>
<P>
"It was fully demonstrated that the evidence of their crimes
was clear, solid and sufficient," he said.
</P>
<P>
China's Criminal Law stipulates that anyone who organizes a

<HEADLINE> Publisher Charged with Murder Conspiracy in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The publisher of a leading
Israeli newspaper was charged Sunday with conspiracy to murder and
interfering with police investigation in a case implicating some
senior officials.
</P>
<P>
Ofer Nimrodi, the publisher of the Hebrew-language daily
Ma'ariv, was charged by prosecutors at a Tel Aviv district court
with plotting to murder Ya'acov Tsur, a key witness against him in
a wiretapping case in mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
Nimrodi spent five months in jail earlier this year after being
convicted of illegally tapping the phones of his rival publishers.
</P>
<P>
He was also accused of bribing and blackmailing in an attempt to
block investigation into the case of the attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors said he "did everything in his power to suborn
witnesses, interfere with legal procedures in everything connecting
with the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
Conviction on the two charges carries a maximum 35-year prison
term.
</P>
<P>
Tzur, a private detective, turned to state witness against
Nimrodi after being investigated for carrying out the wiretapping.
</P>
<P>
Another detective, Rafi Pridan, who also carried out the
wiretapping for Nimrodi, told police several months ago that
Nimrodi had solicited his assistance in an attempted murder of Tzur
in 1996 to block the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Pridan, who was sentenced four years in imprisonment three
months ago for his role in the wiretapping case, also charged that
Nimrodi had attempted to murder the publishers of two other major
newspapers, the Haaretz and Yedioth Ahronot dailies.
</P>
<P>
But the prosecutors did not include these accusations in the
charge sheet.
</P>
<P>
In the last two months since Nimrodi was remanded in the case of
attempted murder, Israelis have been shocked by reports that some
senior officials have been involved in his efforts to block the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Nimrodi used his influence "on senior levels of
the police" to discover information from the investigation. Several
policemen were questioned over allegations that they took bribes
and leaked information to Nimrodi.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported Sunday that former public minister Avigdor
Kahalani would also be questioned by police on reports that he
prompted a police officer on behest of Nimrodi in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted sources close to Kahalani, who is currently
abroad, as saying that Kahalani had denied the allegations.

<HEADLINE> Dismissed Sudanese Parliament Speaker not to Live in Qatar: Source </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 26 (Xinhua) -- A Qatari official source
said Sunday that his country did not intend to invite Sudan's
dismissed Parliament Speaker Hassan al-Turabi to live in Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Qatar will host al-Turabi who will arrive in Doha Monday at the
invitation of the Future Foreseeing Studies Center to give
religious speeches, as the case of every year in Muslims' holy
month of Ramadan, the unnamed source was quoted by Kuwait News
Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
News reports in London said on Sunday that Qatar welcomed al-
Turabi after he was sure of his loss against Sudan's President Omar
al-Bashir.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir dissolved the Sudanese parliament headed by al-Turabi
and declared a state of emergency on December 12 to "preserve
national unity against the external and internal perils."
</P>
<P>
The move was taken a few hours before a planned parliament vote
on a al-Turabi-proposed constitutional amendment that is to cut al-
Bashir's power
</P>
<P>
The Qatari source expected al-Turabi to meet with Qatar's Emir
sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa al-Thani to discuss the latest
developments in Sudan and did not rule out any Qatari efforts to
help calm down the situation there.
</P>
<P>
Hamad has recently called al-Bashir twice for talks on the
developments in Sudan and bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Al-Turabi has also asserted in an interview with the Qatar-based
TV channel Jazeera that he did not wish to leave Sudan to live in a
foreign country as al-Bashir's opponent.

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong Members' Sentences Appropriate: Expert (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The sentences handed down to
four key members of the banned Falun Gong cult were appropriate
and in keeping with China's push to rule the country according to
law, a noted legal expert said here today.
</P>
<P>
Li Chang, Wang Zhiwen, Ji Liewu and Yao Jie were sentenced
today to prison terms ranging from 7-18 years by the Beijing No.1
Intermediate People's Court. The three men and one woman were
charged with organizing and using the cult to obstruct justice,
causing deaths as a result of cult activities, and illegally
obtaining state secrets.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zuofu, professor of the Institute of Jurisprudence of
People's University of China, told Xinhua he believes that the
judges concerned were prudent in their handing of the case and
sentencing.
</P>
<P>
Today's sentences were based on fact and relevant law, and had
sufficient legal backing, the professor said.
</P>
<P>
China's Criminal Law stipulates that anyone who organizes cult
activities which result in human deaths should be punished
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
The claim by some of the defendants that they were in no way
responsible for the deaths of more than 1,400 people across the
country is flimsy, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang explained that these deaths were the result of cult
activities which the four defendants helped to organize. "The
cause and effect relationship is very clear," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Quite a number of people died or inflicted self-injury for no
other reason than that they were manipulated by the Falun Gong
organization, Wang said.

<P>
During the trial, some of the defendants argued that they had
no idea of which laws they had broken.
</P>
<P>
In response to this, Wang said that Article 1 of the 300th Item
of the Criminal Law deals with the organizing and employing of
cults to obstruct justice, and that in their explanations, the
Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate also
list behaviors that constitute obstructing justice.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations outside newspaper offices, television
stations and the Chinese government compound Zhongnanhai which
were organized by the defendants resulted in the disruption of
social order and public security.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the existing Chinese law does not allow
demonstrations or sit-ins without the prior permission of public
security departments, the professor noted.
</P>
<P>
It is stipulated that organizing and employing cults to
obstruct justice and cult activities which result in human deaths
carry prison sentences of no less than three years and no more
than 15 years. The charge of illegally obtaining state secrets
carries a sentence of no less than seven years.
</P>
<P>
Today's varying sentences indicated that the court took into
consideration the shows of repentance from the defendants.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that the court handled the case strictly in line
with the law," Wang noted.

TEHRAN, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian armed forces killed two

arrested another on Saturday night in the southwestern province of
Khuzestan, a military officer said on Sunday.
</P>

and personal equipment were sized from the MKO members.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Accuses Donors of Interference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister of Bangladesh
Sheikh Hasina Wajed Sunday denounced a section of donor envoys
for their recent comments about the country's internal affairs,
saying "this is an interference."
</P>
<P>
"They have no right to make such comments," the prime minister
told a press briefing arranged by Overseas Correspondents
Association Bangladesh at a local hotel.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was giving her opinion in reply to a
question on U.S. Ambassador's recent request to President Justice
Shahabuddin Ahmed to take initiative to resolve the present
political crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hasina said that the donors should not have commented so
negatively about the state of affairs.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister at the same time stated that it was
the opposition who instigated them to do so.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Bangladesh John C Holzman Tuesday called on
President Shahabuddin Ahmed here and expressed his concern at the"
confrontational politics" between the government and the
opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sunday reminded the
members of the diplomatic community to avoid statement and
activities which amount to interference in the internal affairs of
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
British High Commissioner to Bangladesh David Walker Thursday
said that diplomats, particularly from the donor countries and
development partners, have legitimate interest in the political
situation in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
When attention of the ministry was drawn to his statement, a
spokesman said that "we find it rather difficult to believe that a
diplomat would make a claim that by dint of being a donor country
or its envoy has the right to interfere in the internal affairs of
another country."

<HEADLINE> Sino-Israeli Symposium on Agriculture in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- A two-day Sino-Israeli
symposium on agricultural cooperation opened here today, with
participants from the two countries set to discuss technology used
in irrigation, and aquatic and flower production.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of Sino-Israeli diplomatic relations in
1992, agricultural cooperation between the two countries has had
positive results.
</P>
<P>
China and Israel established the Chinese-Israeli International
Center for Training in Agriculture (CIICTA) in the China
Agricultural University in 1993. In addition, they also set up a
demonstration farm on the outskirts of Beijing. These two programs
have helped China introduce advanced agriculture technology from
Israel and also promoted exchanges between agro-scientists of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
CIICTA has thus far organized 34 programs for training more
than 1,000 Chinese agro technicians throughout the country. The
programs relate to fruit and vegetable processing, water-
conservation irrigation, greenhouse projects, anti-water pollution
and flower growing.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from China's Ministry of Agriculture and Israel
's Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed satisfaction with the
outcome of CIICTA over the past six years, and signed a memo on
the second phase of cooperation programs for the next six years.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the two sides will further promote
agricultural cooperation through training, joint scientific and
technological development and academic exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Ambassador to China Ora Namir said at the occasion that
Israel is eager to share its agricultural technology and
experience with China, as a means of developing China's
agriculture sector.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Sunday reminded rebel groups to maintain the spirit of
peace by observing the on-going ceasefire with the government.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, Estrada said that his
administration will continue to vigorously pursue peace efforts
with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) through formal
negotiations and the National Democratic Front (NDF) through
direct talks at the local level.
</P>
<P>

Filipinos in our country," he said.

<P>
Earlier this month, the government declared a suspension of
offensive military operations with the National Democratic Front.
</P>

The ceasefire took effect on December 10 and will last until
January 9, 2000. But the NDF declared its own ceasefire from
December 30 to January 2, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The government has an existing ceasefire with the MILF as a
confidence-building measure to boost the peace process in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Estrada called on the Islamic community in
Mindanao to make sure the ceasefire between the government and the
MILF proves fruitful for the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the needs to ensure peace and order in the south to
fulfill his campaign promise to develop Mindanao as the country's
next food basket and regional economic hub.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the ceasefire will do much good this Christmas. Let
us hope our Muslim brothers comply with the ceasefire," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the president also made it clear that the government
is mandated to uphold the law and ensure public safety, and it
would not tolerate any violation of the ceasefire by the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Russia Launches Military Satellite From Baikonur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia launched a Cosmos
military satellite with a Cyclone-2 carrier-rocket from the
Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The rocket blasted off at 11 a.m. Moscow time (0800 GMT) and
the satellite was put into orbit to supplement the orbital group
of the Russian Defense Ministry, and now it is monitored
effectively, the Interfax quoted the Russian Defense Ministry's
Main Center for Testing and Controlling Space Vehicles as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Cyclone-2 carrier-rocket is based on the R-36 ballistic
missile, which was re-built into a carrier-booster by the
Ukrainian design bureau Yuzhnoye. Cyclone carrier-rockets are
manufactured by the Yuzhny Machine-Building Enterprise (Yuzhmash).
The blast-off of the rocket was immediately registered by radars
of the Russian Space Missile Defense (RKO), said the press service
of the Russian Strategic Missile Troops (RVSN), cited by the Itar-
Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
RKO troops are used to detect launchings of Russian and
foreign ballistic missiles, to determine the start of an enemy
missile attack and to flash out information about it to the
supreme bodies of state and military leadership of the country.
</P>
<P>
These troops conduct reconnaissance and control of near-earth
space, notify flights of foreign spy and other space systems.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the launch was set for Thursday, but was
subsequently put off until Friday because of bad weather. However,
the launch did not take place Friday due to a malfunction on one
of the on-board systems at the final stage of preparations.

development, which are aimed at reducing the rate of unemployment
and poverty and boosting human and natural resources, Ghazali was
quoted as saying by the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The conference called for alleviating African foreign debts
which are viewed as one of the main obstacles to the economic
development of the continent, providing more jobs and intensifying
social services for women, and expanding the reach of international
efforts to abolish child labor, he added.

ADDIS ABABA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian agriculturists
have grown 19 new high-yield lowland species of crops for edible
oil and cotton, the Ethiopian Herald newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Based on its studies on sesame, the Melka Werer Agricultural

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Vaccinate Children to Prevent Polio Outbreak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian Health Ministry
will vaccinate some 700,000 children under the age of five to
prevent a possible outbreak of polio in the country, officials said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The vaccination campaign, expected to be carried out in four
months, will also cover children who had been vaccinated against
the disease under a routine program launched annually by the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
The new vaccination is aimed at protecting Jordanian children
from the importation of polio from neighboring countries,
particularly from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva-based World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed 16
cases of the crippling disease between May and October this year in
Iraq, which is under nine-year-old sanctions by the United Nations
following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is now home to some 120,000 Iraqis who fled their
sanctions-hit homeland. Jordan is the only land exit for Iraq due
to no-fly zones imposed in Iraqi skies by the United States and
Britain following the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Jordan reported no cases of polio in the past four years due to
successive vaccination campaigns by the health ministry in
collaboration with the WHO as part of its campaigns to eradicate
the disease worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Polio, the shorthand for poliomyelitis, is an infectious viral
disease that can cause muscular paralysis in the muscle systems of
human beings. The disease is highly preventable.
</P>
<P>
Initial symptoms of the disease include headache, fever, nausea,
sore throat, vomiting, diarrhea, restless or drowsiness.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Court Begins Trial of Alleged Brotherhood Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 26 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian military court
Saturday begun the trial of 20 alleged members of the outlawed
Muslim Brotherhood, and decided to continue the trial on January
12, the Al-Ahram daily reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a court at Heikstep military base, 20 kilometers east of
Cairo, prosecutors accused the defendants on Saturday of belonging
to an outlawed group that aimed to disturb law and order and to
control activities of various syndicates, the Arabic-language
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The defendants, who were arrested on October 16, are leading
members of syndicates and professional unions which became a
stronghold of the Muslim Brotherhood influence in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
State security prosecutors had accused them of planning to
infiltrate the syndicates, an apparent reference to the
fundamentalist group's plans to run in any future syndicate
elections.
</P>
<P>
The court adjourned the case until January 12, the pro-
government newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The defense lawyers, including some of Egypt's top attorneys,
called for the defendants' temporary release during the current
Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan, the paper quoted court
officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The defense argued that this is "a case of ideology and not
terrorism," and that Egypt's criminal law does not outlaw the
freedom of ideology and meetings and preparations for various
syndicate elections.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts have said the trial was a warning to Muslim
Brotherhood to keep out of future syndicate elections. The
government has prevented elections in the engineers' and lawyers'
syndicates since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's biggest fundamentalist group
established in 1928, advocates turning Egypt into a strict Muslim
state by political means, setting itself apart from militant groups
that took up arms in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's secular government has accused the group of being a
front for militant groups whose violence abated in the past two
years after a tough government crackdown.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Iraqi Charges Over Kuwaiti POWs </HEADLINE>

<P>
TEHRAN, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi on Saturday evening rejected claims of
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad Said al-Sahaf that a number of
Kuwaiti prisoners of war (POWs) are in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister's remarks, that were made in an interview
with the Egyptian weekly Al-Ahram Al-Arabi printed on Saturday,
were "sheer lies," the Islamic Republic News Agency on Sunday
quoted Asefi as saying.
</P>
<P>
Asefi expressed regret that the Iraqi official made such remarks
instead of responding to the requests of families of the Kuwaiti
POWs inquiring about the fate of their relatives.
</P>
<P>
The attempt of the Iraqi foreign minister to undermine relations
between Iran and Kuwait, two neighboring and friendly countries,
will bear no fruit, he said, urging Baghdad to respond to the
international and human requests regarding the fate of Iranian and
Kuwaiti POWs.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq have swapped most of their POWs left over from the
1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, but both sides still claim the presence of
their POWs in the other side.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Industrial Output Leaps Up in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's industrial
production leaped up by 18.2 percent year-on-year in November with
robust growth in both electronics and chemicals clusters, bringing
to 14.4 percent the tally for the first 11 months of this year,
the country's Economic Development Board said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
November's rise covered the electronics, chemical and
engineering clusters with growth in every category except in
segments of petroleum, process engineering and transport
engineering, the board said in its monthly bulletin.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the electronics cluster, which hit 25.5 percent in
November over a year ago and 23.2 percent for the first 11 months
of 1999 over the same period of 1998, was largely fuelled by
continued strong global demand for semiconductors and computer
peripherals and more exports of mobile phones to the Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
The chemical cluster saw a robust growth of 21.0 percent in
November and an cumulative increase of 20.5 percent for the first
11 months of this year.
</P>
<P>
In November, the output of pharmaceuticals jumped up 63.1
percent and that of the industrial/specialty chemicals surged up
by 61.3 percent and that of petrochemicals increased by 4 percent.
However, the petroleum segment contracted by 14.5 percent,
resulting from lower margins of refining activity.
</P>
<P>
Output of the engineering cluster increased by 6.8 percent in
November with cumulative output registering a marginal growth of 0.
3 percent in the first 11 months of this year.
</P>
<P>
While the output of the precision engineering segment surged by
23.9 percent in November with electronics-related industries in
the lead, the outputs of process engineering segment and the
transport engineering segment declined by 14.5 and 6.7 percent
respectively in the month over a year earlier.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- China's border trade with
Vietnam has made a new breakthrough and building contracts are in
great demand in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The border city of Fangcheng Port in south China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region has become a major beneficiary of the
booming trade, with contracts worth 18.66 million U.S. dollars
signed with Vietnam in the first 11 months this year.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has witnessed an infrastructure spree in sectors
including hotel upholstering, road construction, port warehouse
building, and appliance assembly.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, rich agricultural and cultural resources in
Guangxi such as tea, aquatic products, pottery and other
handicrafts, have also found good markets in the neighboring
country.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the foreign trade department in the city of
Fangcheng Port attribute the trade surplus to China's preferential
policies on promoting border trade issued early this year. They
also foresee more trade with high-tech content next year.
</P>
<P>
Trade between China and Vietnam is mutually beneficial, and
popular Vietnam products such as processed cassava slices,
coconuts, and rubber are also selling well in China.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Punish Those Responsible for Sea Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
Sunday assured families of the victims in the sinking of the MV
Asia South Korea that it will punish those who are responsible for
the sea tragedy, during which at least 27 people were dead.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada is monitoring the progress of search
and rescue operations, which started soon after the Cebu-bound
ferry sank Thursday, and will not allow any whitewash of an on-
going investigation of the tragedy, Press Secretary Rodolfo Reyes
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The president is on top of the situation. There will be no
finger pointing. He wants the responsible parties identified and
punished," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he also said that the president stressed the need to
improve the country's shipping industry, particularly by having
its players use new and better vessels instead of second-hand
ships.
</P>
<P>
"This incident points to the need for investments for improving
the shipping industry," he quoted the president as saying.
</P>
<P>
The MV Asia South Korea sank off Cebu, the Central Philippines,
early Thursday after leaving Cebu late Wednesday for Iloilo City.
</P>
<P>
The National Disaster Coordinating Council said that at least
27 people were confirmed dead, while 711 survivors were rescued as
of Saturday afternoon. But dozens of people are still missing and
overloading has been blamed for the sea tragedy.

<HEADLINE> Hotel Fire Kills 20 in Northeast China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, December 26 (Xinhua) -- A big fire that occurred at
around 4 a.m. Sunday in a hotel bath center in Changchun, capital
of northeast China's Jilin Province, took a heavy toll of 20 lives,
according to firemen and hospital sources.
</P>
<P>
 Half of those victims in the fire are men, and the others are
women, and they were among the 51 bath-takers in bathrooms in the
basement of the Hawaii Grand Hotel in the city's downtown area.
</P>
<P>
 The exceptionally big fire has been extinguished completely
by the press time.
</P>
<P>
 The victims in the fire are believed to be suffocated by
heavy smoke, which engulfed the entire building. Thirty-one other
bath-takers were rescued and sent to nearby hospitals by firemen.
</P>
<P>
 The firemen, divided into five groups, rushed to the hotel in
a matter of five minutes. They then encountered great difficulties
during their rescue operation since electric power was cut off.
</P>
<P>
 During a one-hour rescue operation, they ran from floor to
floor and sorted out and saved all other 150 guests in 87 hotel
rooms who were stranded amid flames and smoke, including seven
Japanese customers.
</P>
<P>
 Local government leaders showed great concern about the
tragedy. At nine o'clock in the morning, Jilin Provincial Governor
Hong Hu, Deputy Governor Wei Minxue, and Changchun mayor Li Shu,
rushed to the hotel, which remained in a good shape except a 100-
sq-m area in the basement.
</P>
<P>
 The officials promptly ordered security departments to find
the cause of the fire and bring those held responsible to justice.
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, they urged those leading officials in various
departments to thoroughly check their fire control facilities and
to prevent the occurrence of any possible fire accidents.
</P>
<P>
 The boss of the bathrooms was said to have Christmas party
with his workers, and firemen did not leave the hotel until 1:30 a.
m. after they claimed to have finished their security checks,
police sources said.
</P>
<P>
 The incident is still under investigation.

<HEADLINE> GCC Countries to Hike Tobacco Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) states are likely to gradually increase customs duty on
cigarette and other tobacco products to 200 percent by 2001, the
local Gulf News daily reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The six states, namely Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates
(UAE), Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain, are now targeting to
achieve 100 percent customs duty on tobacco by next July, in line
with an agreement inked in 1983 to curb high cigarette consumption
levels in the region.
</P>
<P>
The tobacco tax was hiked from 50 percent to 70 percent in April
last year and was further increased to 90 percent in July this
year.
</P>
<P>
The hike in customs duty on tobacco to 200 percent was
recommended recently by a high-level GCC anti-smoking committee
which met on request of the ministers of health in the states, Gulf
News said.
</P>
<P>
A proposal to allocate 5 percent of the customs duty levied on
tobacco products for anti-smoking programs is also under
consideration, the paper quoted concerned officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The UAE is expected to net 272 million dirhams (about 74.3
million U.S. dollars) this year in customs duty on tobacco. The
figure is forecast to increase to 303 million dirhams (82.8 million
dollars) next year.
</P>
<P>
The GCC states are among countries with highest cigarette
consumption levels. They import nearly 30 billion cigarettes a
year, worth over 800 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
By next year, the six countries' total revenues from duty on
tobacco is likely to exceed 1 billion dollars compared with less
than 100 million dollars in mid-1980s.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, December 26 (Xinhua) -- China announced on Sunday that
the renovation of a 396-kilometer-long railway section has been
completed.
</P>
<P>
 The Ministry of Railways decided to widen the rail route
between Baoji city in the northwest Shaanxi Province and the
capital of Chengdu in southwest Sichuan Province so as to turn it
into one with multiple tracks.
</P>
<P>
 According to sources from a press conference held in the city
of Guangyuan today, the renovation of the rail line, a major state
rail project, is aimed at easing traffic and creating conditions
for paving a continental route that connects Russia, China,
Myanmar and Viet Nam.
</P>
<P>
 The upgrading of the line is an extraordinary feat as it
spans rigid, steep mountains, deep valleys and turbulent rivers
with swift rapids in western China.
</P>
<P>
 The project is expected to increase the annual rail cargo
transportation capacity from 11.58 million tons in the past to
some 50 million tons a year.

<HEADLINE> Injured S.Lankan President Makes Remarkable Recovery: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga, who sustained facial injuries in a suicidal bomb
attack last week, has made a remarkable recovery, said a medical
report reaching here Sunday from London.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga is receiving medical treatment in London for the
injuries she sustained in the bomb attack by a suspected Tamil
rebel at her last election rally in central Colombo on December 18.
</P>
<P>
"After all available extensive investigations, it was decided
that no surgical intervention was required," said the report,
issued from the Sri Lanka High Commission in London.
</P>
<P>
"The injury to the right eye is receiving further attention and
will be under constant review," it said, adding that all other
injuries are resolving themselves satisfactorily.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted medical experts from Sri Lanka and London as
saying that the president could resume normal duties forthwith.
</P>
<P>
But it did not say when the president can fly back to Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga flew to London hours after she was sworn in as Sri
Lanka's fifth president on Wednesday, the same day when the
election result was announced.
</P>
<P>
The government has blamed the separatist Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) for the suicidal bombing which left 24 people
dead and 84 others injured.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting for an independent homeland
in the north and east of the country since 1983. So far, more than
55,000 people have been killed in the civil war.

<HEADLINE> China Resolved to Protect Taiwan Investors: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- A foreign trade official said
the newly-issued Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Law
for Protecting the Investment of Taiwan Compatriots has shown the
central government's resolve to protect the interests of
businessmen from Taiwan island.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yuqing, director-general of Laws and Treaties Department
of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (MOFTEC)
, said the rules cover a wide range of issues, from the education
of Taiwan investors' children to border entry requirements.
</P>
<P>
The official, who has taken charge of drafting the rules,
refuted criticisms from some Taiwan authorities that the
principles allegedly did not included detailed regulations for
protecting Taiwan investors' safety on the mainland, China Daily
Business Weekly said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The newly-adopted rules are expected to strongly boost
Taiwanese businessmen's investment in the mainland area.
</P>
<P>
Because of the Taiwan authorities' restrictions on Taiwan
businesses' capital flow to mainland, some firms from the island
have invested on the mainland via a circuitous route, such as by
first getting registered in a third country or region, to
circumvent the Taiwan authority's control.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said, "Taiwan compatriots' safety is of course secured
on the mainland. The Criminal Law and regulations regarding public
security strongly guarantee their security."
</P>
<P>
After the detailed rules promulgated, MOFTEC Minister Shi
Guangsheng said that the central government is committed to
protecting all legitimate rights of Taiwan investors whatever the
circumstances are.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Taiwan authorities to stop politicizing trade and
investment issues and to cancel its unreasonable restrictions on
economic exchanges across the straits as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC statistics revealed that by the end of October, there
were 43,408 Taiwan invested projects involving a total of 43.59
billion U.S. dollars in pledged capital and 23.45 billion U.S.
dollars in actual input.

<HEADLINE> Textiles to be Beneficiary of WTO Accession: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, December 26 (Xinhua)-- China's textile industry will
apparently be the beneficiary of the country's entry into the
World Trade Organization (WTO), according to a government official
reported by today's China Daily Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
Yang Donghui, secretary-general of the China National
Federation of Textile Industries said that China's textile
industry will benefit from the WTO membership, especially in the
long-run, because the country will then be able to enjoy stable
multilateral preferential trade policies in a rules-based market.
</P>
<P>
Better access to the global market, which will surely come with
the WTO membership, may help the industry upgrade its technology,
management and trade system, he said. "but it presents the sector
with more challenges than opportunities in the short term."
</P>
<P>
He warned companies of being too optimistic about China's
textile exports prospects, saying that it will not make a rapid
increase during the next few years, not even after quota
limitations are lifted in 2005.
</P>
<P>
China's textile exports have been declining over the past few
years. "It would be a big feat if we could maintain last year's
export level, not to mention that it would be a large increase in
the short run," he added.
</P>
<P>
Non-tariff trade barriers other than quota limitations will
continue to hamper China's textile export progress even after
China's entry into the WTO, and regionalization will also work
against the interests of China's textile products, said Yang.

URUMQI, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region is expected to invest 10 billion yuan (1.2

<HEADLINE> Service Industry: New Favored Area of Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, December 26 (Xinhua)-- Tertiary industry is becoming a
new favored area for both public and private investment though
China is still in the primary stage of industrialization.
</P>
<P>
"The service industry is drawing government investment because
of the large number of employment opportunities that comes with it
and the high technological content in some productive areas,"
China Daily Business Weekly reported today,
</P>
<P>
The tertiary industry has been a main stimulator of internal
demand, said Xu Jiangping, a director with the State Development
Planning Commission (SDPC), given the fact that more than 95
percent of the products on the market have larger supplies than
demands. He gave the figure based on an annual survey conducted by
the SDPC and the National Bureau of Statistics involving more than
600 products.
</P>
<P>
Having offered quick returns with relatively small investment
and little technology, the tertiary industry is also attracting
more and more private investment, he added.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that China's tertiary industry is involved in
the primary stage and often provides low-quality services at high
prices. This kind of backward management is conditioned by China's
present low level of urbanization.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the tertiary industry is also expected to spur the
economic development in western China since eastern China's
industrialization and rapid economic growth have paved the way for
the west to develop its tertiary industry, Xu Jiangping said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Announces Traffic Restriction to Reduce Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 26 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian special committee
monitoring air pollution on Sunday announced urgent traffic
restriction to reduce critical air pollution in the capital city of
Tehran, Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The Supervisory and Coordinating Committee for Emergent Air
Pollution in Tehran ordered that private cars with even number
plates are allowed to travel in the city on Sunday and those with
odd number plates on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The committee called on traffic police to seriously deal with
any private cars violating the traffic restriction. However, the
report did not mention how long the restriction will last.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the committee also announced the closure of primary
and high schools in the city.
</P>
<P>
Air pollution in Tehran reached a "danger" level in recent days
and a "critical" level on Saturday morning due to stagnant air, the
committee said.
</P>
<P>
During the past weeks, different authorities urged residents in
Tehran not to travel in the city in their personal cars and advised
them to take public transportation instead.
</P>
<P>
Over two million old vehicles which consume fuel more than the
standard are the main cause of about 80 percent of air pollution in
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Mayor Morteza Alviri announced on Tuesday that the city
will launch a 15-year project to combat the serious air pollution
next year.
</P>

He said that since 1993, Iran has received three plans by the
World Bank, Japanese experts and Iranian environmentalists and that
the anti-pollution project is a combination of the three plans.
</P>
<P>
He said that about 1.5 million tons of pollutants are being
produced in the Iranian capital city annually, which will be
controlled in the first year of the implementation of the said
project.
</P>
<P>
Alviri said that 72 percent of the pollution is caused by
traffic which can be reduced by the traffic organization through
practicing mechanisms such as preventing travel of vehicles
producing exhaust fumes, banning traffic within certain zones, and
carrying out compulsory technical check up for the cars.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 26 (Xinhua) -- India's inflation rate
vaulted by 0.40 percentage points to 2.84 percent for the week
that ended on December 1, following its continued decline during
the past three weeks, according to the Reserve Bank of India.
</P>
<P>
The annual inflation rate rose to 2.84 percent from 2.44
percent a week earlier despite a marginal fall of 0.1 percent in
the overall price index for the same week.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate was higher at 6.53 percent during the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The lower rate of inflation during the most part of this year
is mainly on account of a comparison with a higher base last year
when overall prices were up following abnormal increases in
vegetable prices.

<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, December 26 (Xinhua)-- Foreign trade in Guangdong
Province, south China, is will possibly register a high rise in
December, today's China Daily Business Weekly reported.
</P>
<P>
Given a total imports and exports value of some 126 billion U.
S. dollars during January-November, an increase of 8.1 percent
from a year ago, statistics from Guangdong Customs Administration
(GDCA) indicated.
</P>
<P>
The province's foreign trade is expected to reach a new height
this month, said Liu Xiao and Tan Yanhua from the GDCA, noting
that the foreign trade usually booms during last month of a year.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong's exports during the 11 months were valued at 69.71
million U.S. dollars, a rise of 2.4 percent, whereas exports via
the processing trade were valued at 54.34 billion U.S. dollars, up
4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned enterprises, foreign-funded enterprises and
collectively-run businesses in the province all maintained steady
growth, and the private-run undertakings made more headway in
their exports during the period, according to sources from the
GDCA.
</P>
<P>
Exports to the United States and European Union grew while
exports to Hong Kong, the province's most important trading
partner, and Japan fell.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said high value added and high-tech products dominated
January to November exports and that exports of garments and
related items such as shoes, which are among Guangdong's most
important export commodities, dropped during the period.
</P>
<P>
Imports climbed 16.2 percent to 56.26 billion U.S. dollars
during the time, customs statistics said.

<HEADLINE> S.Lanka May Go for Early Parliamentary Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is likely to go for
parliamentary elections during the first half of next year,
several months ahead of the scheduled August, political sources
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, there are different predictions as to in which month
the elections are to be held.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times here quoted the ruling People's Alliance
general secretary, D.M. Jayaratne, as saying that the
parliamentary elections would be held before April following the
victory at Tuesday's presidential polls.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga won the reelection
in the fourth presidential election on Tuesday with a simple
majority of 51.12 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
Jayaratne said the mood among government leaders and within the
alliance after the election was one of utmost confidence and thus
it was likely that a general election would be called within three
months.
</P>
<P>
But some political sources predicted that President Kumaratunga
would dissolve the present Parliament by mid-February to call
elections for April or May.
</P>
<P>
During her campaign rally in late October, Kumaratunga said she
was planning a snap parliamentary election soon after the
presidential poll.
</P>
<P>
The sitting parliament can continue till August 16 next year
when it would stand automatically dissolved. But the president can
dissolve parliament earlier if she deems fit.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga left here Wednesday hours after she was sworn in as
Sri Lanka's fifth president for London to treat her right eye
which was damaged at an assassination attempt on her at the final
election rally in central Colombo last week.
</P>
<P>
On her return from abroad, Kumaratunga is due to meet the top
leaders of the ruling coalition to discuss plans regarding the
next general election, the political sources said.

<HEADLINE> On-line Shopping to Flourish in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- As more consumers in China
began to surf on the Internet, on-line shopping is expected to
flourish, with several computer companies already reporting
growing profits.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chengguo, an economist with the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences, predicted that an increasing number of Chinese
customers will go on-line during this holiday season, although
electronic-commerce is not fully developed in the country.
</P>
<P>
An e-commerce operator, 8848.net, which opened an on-line
supermarket in May this year, has scored surprising sales growth,
according to a report by China Daily Business Weekly today.
</P>
<P>
The company's revenues grew from the first month's 500,000
yuan (about 60,200 U.S.dollars) to 3.8 million yuan in September
said.
</P>
<P>
However, China's on-line shopping is still hindered by several
factors. Internet applications, to most Chinese surfers, are still
limited to news and E-mail.
</P>
<P>
The e-commerce market is still immature because the country
lacks a complete credit system and effective express network.
</P>
<P>
Justin Tang, chairman of eLong.com Corp., said that his
company has sponsored a national campaign to teach website skills
and arouse people's awareness of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
The number of Internet users is growing rapidly in China, from
four million in the first half of this year to an estimated 10
million by year's end.

ZHENGZHOU, December 26 (Xinhua) -- A growing number of students
who received their education overseas have returned to central
China's Henan Province since the provincial government began
providing them with favorable policies.
</P>
<P>
 Since 1992, Henan has offered financial assistance amounting
to 8.1 million yuan (980,000 U.S. dollars) to overseas-returned
students to help them start research projects.

<P>
 The provincial government has passed regulations giving these
students better housing conditions, higher salaries, and
professional titles.
</P>
<P>
So far, approximately 2,000 out of the 5,000 people who went
abroad to study have returned to work, including 200 with doctoral
degrees. Their research topics are mainly in the fields of
chemistry, agriculture, medicine, physics and computer science,
all urgently needed by the national economy, according to sources
with local departments of education.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province set up an economic development zone in
the provincial capital of Zhengzhou at which overseas-returned
students are able to start new projects.
</P>

In one instance, Dr. Wang Fuming designed a world-class road
analysis system, and has bought a tract of land in the zone to
expand the provincial road inspection center. More people are
following Wang's example and launching their career in Henan.

according to the United Nations, affects 80 percent of the 11.2
million people of the Central American country.
</P>

Portillo and Berger will vie for the second round because they
obtained the highest number of votes in the November 7 elections,

<P>
Portillo obtained 47.72 percent of the votes in the first round,

</P>
<P>
Outside Europe, Japan will be the country of reference for
Spain December 31, since the change of date will arrive first to
