<HEADLINE> Iraq Calls for Ending Turkish Military Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today called on Turkish forces
to immediately and unconditionally withdraw from Iraqi lands, a
day after Turkey announced that its operation was coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq should stop exploiting the fragile situation in this part
of our country to satisfy their regional ambitions," said Nabil
Nejm, Iraq's permanent representative to the Cairo-based Arab
League.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with the League's Secretary General Esmat Abdel
Meguid here today, Nejm said that Turkish military operations in
northern Iraq had not ceased.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to an announcement by Turkish Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan Sunday that the Turkish army's 25-day-old
operation in northern Iraq had come to an end.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Turkish troops, backed by air power, poured into
northern Iraq on May 14 in a cross-border operation against
Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) bases used for raids into southeast
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The operation has attracted condemnation from the Arab League
secretariat and a demand that Turkish forces withdraw
immediately.
</P>
<P>
Nejm lauded the "positive and responsible stance" the Arab
League adopted toward the "Turkish invasion into Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish incursion into Iraq is not the first and the Arab
nation refuses the Turkish justifications for it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs demand the immediate and unconditional withdrawal and
the maintaining of Turkish-Arab relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military said they had killed 2,252 guerrillas in
the operation for the loss of 95 of their own troops. But the
rebels put losses by the army and its Iraqi Kurd alllies at almost
800 men.

<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation, Wu Yi, meeting today with Shinji
Sato, the Japanese Minister of International Trade and Industry,
said that China wants to work with Japan to increase the trade
volume to 100 billion US dollars by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
She said that the two sides should treasure their hard-won
accomplishments in bilateral trade and economic cooperation in 25
years since their relations were normalized.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade between China and Japan was worth more than 60
billion US dollars in 1996. Wu said she hopes the two countries
will strengthen exchanges between their governments and their
people.
</P>
<P>
Sato said that further promotion of bilateral trade and
economic cooperation will help promote prosperity and development
in both countries.

TOKYO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Japan and Russia agreed today to
increase economic cooperation to promote Russia's economic reform
with Japan's investment and technical assistance, the Japanese
Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The accord was reached by Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko
Ikeda and Russia's first Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov when
they met for the second session of a bilateral governmental
committee on trade and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
During the session, they signed a 15-point memorandum calling
for mutual cooperation to speed up development of natural

Russia into the international economic mechanism including the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Japan has decided to provide about 100 million dollars of new
loans to Russia through the Export-Import Bank of Japan to finance
three projects in the Russian Far East.
</P>
<P>
The pact covering the loans, which will be part of the bank's
500 million dollar package pledged earlier, was signed today at
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume between Japan and Russia stood at about 5 billion
dollars in 1996.

<HEADLINE> France Asks EU to Put off Budget Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- France has requested on Monday a
"period of reflection" before the European Union countries adopt
budgetary rules in preparation for economic and monetary
union(EMU).
</P>
<P>
This request came at a meeting of EU finance ministers who held
talks in Luxembourg to discuss measures to ensure the stability of
the single currency euro, due to be introduced on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Within moments of the news, financial markets reportedly
reacted sharply with the French stock market and the franc falling
against the German mark.
</P>
<P>
New French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn told his
counterparts at the meeting that Paris wanted time to consider the
"stability pact", agreed in Dublin in December, but not yet
ratified.
</P>
<P>
Paris would need at least a week, he said, adding that that
meant he did not believe it could be done by the EU's summit on
June 16-17 in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
Strauss-Kahn said he did not want to renegotiate the pact.
Other EU ministers and officials were quick to say that the pact
could not be reopened.
</P>
<P>
"What has been agreed upon and discussed for two years can no
longer be put up for negotiation," German Finance Minister Theo
Waigal told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"No renegotiation of the stability pact is being demanded," he
said, but added that France wanted additional elements on
employment policy to be included in the so-called Maastricht II
treaty to be agreed at Amsterdam summit.
</P>
<P>
European Commission President Jacques Santer said he still
hoped for a deal by Amsterdam but that the new French government's
desire to discuss the issue was "understandable".
</P>
<P>
Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm, whose country currently
holds the EU rotating presidency, said he also hoped for a deal by
Amsterdam but acknowledged it could take time to integrate
France's demand for a greater coordination of economic policies.
</P>
<P>
The pact would place heavy fines on states within EU currency
union who ran excessive spending deficits after the euro is
introduced.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday night, the EU ministers approved in principle various
designs and technical specifications for euro coins.

<HEADLINE> BIS to 'Intensify' Relations with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BASLE, SWITZERLAND, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bank for
Internationaln Settlements (BIS) is determined to further
intensify its relations with its new shareholder, the People's
Bank of China (PBC), BIS General Manager Andrew Crockett said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions at a press conference held at the BIS
headquarters, Crockett said that the PBC had actively participated
in many activities of the BIS committees and sub-committees at
different levels since PBC formally became a BIS member last
November. He appreciated the contributions which the PBC had made
to the BIS.
</P>
<P>
Crockett recalled his visit to Beijing a couple of weeks ago,
during which he "held consultations with senior Chinese officials
about further intensifications of relations" between the two banks.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned, in particular, PBC's participation in the
preparation of 21 core principles released by a BIS committee a
few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The principles are now under consultation, hopefully to be
finalized at a BIS meeting scheduled in Hong Kong this September.
</P>
<P>
At the same press conference, the BIS Economic Adviser and Head
of the Monetary and Economic Department, William White, said that
sustainable development around the world, not just in China,
demands in the first instance a framework of macro-economic
stability, which means price stability and financial stability.
</P>
<P>
When asked how China would have sustainable development, White
said: "The biggest problem that China faces on the financial side
of the development is the restructuring of the state-owned
enterprises and government agencies, and state-owned banks that
lend money to them.
</P>
<P>
"This is a joint problem of the enterprises and the banks. I
have every confidence that the Chinese authorities are addressing
these challenging tasks in an appropriate way. I think they
recognize this is an important task at this juncture," White
said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Libya Pledge to Promote Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Libya today
signed in Pretoria an agreement to strenghten bilateral economic
and political cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Our relations (with South Africa) on the politcial side have
been almost perfect. We hope to start seriously backing this up
with economic relations," Libyan Foreign Minister Omar Mustafa
Muntasser told reporters at the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
South Africa needs Libya's petroleum products, while Libya
hopes to learn South African technological expertise in refining
petroleum, Muntasser said.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minsiter Alfred Nzo said the latest
signed agreement demonstrated the determination of South Africa
and Libya to strengthen their all-round links.
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony, Muntasser reiterated Libyan leader
Muammar el-Gaddafy's intention of visiting South Africa. He said
the timing of such a trip would depend on when international
sanctions against Libya were lifted.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed sanctions against Libya in 1992
because of its insistence on a neutral venue for the trial of two
Libyan citizens suspected to have been involved in the 1988
Lockerbie air disaster.
</P>
<P>
More than 250 people died when a Pan American aircraft
exploded over the town of Lockerbie in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Britain, France and the United States have been demanding the
extradition of the suspects to Scotland to stand trial. The three
western states have rejected Libya's offer to deliver the two men
to the Hague International Court to be tried by Scottish judges
under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
Munstasser reiterated his country's stance on the matter,
saying the two suspects were willing to subject themselves to a
trial in a neutral country.
</P>
<P>
Reaffirming South Africa's support for Libya's approach, Nzo
said, "Whenever this question arises...we suggest this should be
the way out for a solution of the problem."

<HEADLINE> Universal Principles Urged at CITES Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Decisions on the conservation of
wildlife resources should be based on universal principles, a
high-ranking official of the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species (CITES) Nobutoshi Akao said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Our decisions on these important issues must not be based on
emotion, but on credible scientific findings on the respect for
culture and traditions, and on the recognition of the different
values guiding the world," Akao told the opening session of the
parties to the conference.
</P>
<P>
"We must avoid double standards in our approach. It has become
all the more important for us to address challenges confronting
us in a new, innovative and creative way," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many proposals were made during the conference for new
listings, uplisting and downlisting of various species which
include the elephant, crocodile and white rhino.
</P>
<P>
He said the need for sustainable use of natural resources
advocated by the CITES was not a single-minded pursuit of one
specific philosophical approach to conservation, but should be
based on scientific data.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, Akao said, governments should be given full
responsibility to manage and protect their species.
</P>
<P>
"So long as this principle is maintained, there will be no
loss for anyone involved," he said, adding that it is extremely
important for the international community to changes the
traditional ways of addressing the issues.
</P>
<P>
About 1,300 delegates from around the world are attending the
ongoing conference convened to discuss the protection of
endangered species, while promoting other conservation
mechanisms.

<HEADLINE> Cook Rules out Early EMU Entry for Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
has virtually ruled out the possibility of Britain joining the
European Monetary Union (EMU) in 1999 because the prospect of EMU
going ahead was increasingly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
Cook was quoted by press reports as saying on Sunday that the
recent events in Germany and France have made it less likely that
the single European currency would be implemented on January 1
1999.
</P>
<P>
He warned against easing any of the economic criteria for
joining the EMU and noted that the recent dispute between
Bundesbank and the German government on revaluing the country's
gold reserves have raised "significant questions" as to whether
the 1999 timetable could be reached.
</P>
<P>
On Britain's single currency membership, Cook said that it was
unlikely that Britain would want to join in the first wave and he
now considered it less than 50-50 that EMU would start before the
end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Secretary made it clear that Britain would carry
out a hard-headed assessment towards the end of this year as to
whether joining the single currency would be in the country's
economic interests.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment we think it's unlikely that that assessment
would point to us joining," he said, adding "If it proceeded on
time and it then proved a success, then in the long run Britain
could not stay outside."
</P>
<P>
He also signaled that Britain was closer to reaching an
agreement with its European Union partners over border controls by
saying "I am quite confident we are going to come away with a good
deal for Britain."

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Considers UN-Demanded Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz stressed here today that the 1.7-million-dollar
compensation which a U.N. committee asks Israel to pay for its
shelling of a U.N. base last year "is less than what Lebanon has
demanded."
</P>
<P>
In a press conference held in his office this afternoon, the
foreign minister noted that Lebanon is sticking to its demands.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the U.N. administrative and budgetary committee
adopted a resolution requiring Israel to pay more than 1.7
million U.S. dollars for damage resulting from its shelling of a
U.N. peacekeeping force camp at the south Lebanese town of Qana
on April 18, 1996.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 civilians taking refuge in the camp as well as
several Fijian soldiers of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon
(UNIFIL) were killed in the bombardment, making the day the
bloodiest of Israel's half-month-long "Grape of Wrath" operation
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. resolution is less than what Lebanon has demanded,
including clear (U.N.) condemnation, sanctions and compensations
of billions of dollars for the losses Israel caused for
Lebanon," the Lebanese foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We are sticking to the Lebanese complaints," Boueiz said,
adding that his government is waiting for a clarification from
Washington on a reported pressure U.S. officials exerted in order
to abort the bill.
</P>
<P>
Beirut media said this morning that the United States has
pressured Lebanon's U.N. delegation to "freeze" the resolution,
but the delegation has received instruction from its government
to press ahead with the bill to the finish.
</P>
<P>
The influential An-Nahar daily reported that U.S. officials
told the Lebanese side that if Lebanon did not freeze the draft
resolution, the U.S. team to the U.N. would block the automatic
renewal of the mandate of UNIFIL when it next comes up for
review at the U.N. Security Council in July.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz pointed out any pressure on Lebanon to force it to
withdraw the resolution "is at first a sabotage for the U.N.'s
role."
</P>
<P>
"We have to inquire what's the use of the U.N.'s existence if
it is not allowed to discuss and to hold a necessary session on
the most important massacre taking place since the end of the
Second World War," the Lebanese official underlined.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the U.S. pressure has caused an anger of
the Beirut media, and prompted the leftist daily As-Safir to say
that "the Americans do not tolerate any opposition to their
foreign policies especially when the Jewish State's welfare is
at stake."
</P>
<P>
Ash-Sharq daily said that "the Americans showed blind bias
when they threatened to sabotage Lebanon's bid to renew the
mandate of the UNIFIL forces in south Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
It said that this bias "goes against all international laws
and human rights." It accused the Americans of "covering up for
the slaughters which have been perpetrated by Israel over the
years, especially the Qana massacre."
</P>
<P>
The Christian-owned Nida-Al-Watan said that the U.S. was
"never a real Middle East peace broker and Lebanon never
expected the Americans to reward it for anything."
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Defense Minister Mohsen Dalloul accused the U.S. of
being consistently biased in favor of Israel while other Arab
countries are punished on the pretext of failing to carry out
U.N. resolutions."
</P>
<P>
In a dialogue with local resident in the Shiite-populated
Beqaa Valley in eastern Lebanon at the weekend, Dalloul further
said that by describing the resistance movement against the
Israeli forces in south Lebanon as "terrorism", the U.S was
"provoking and challenging Arab feelings."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Meets German Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, reiterated today that China will never seek
hegemonism. He called the "China threat" totally groundless.
</P>
<P>
The "China threat" is a pretext fabricated by a handful persons to
contain China, said Li while meeting with German Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel at the State Guesthouse here.
</P>
<P>
Those people disliked seeing a China on the road chosen by
itself, a rapidly developing China, for fear of a powerful China
to hinder their hegemonist practice, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1840, China had suffered a lot from foreign imperialist
aggression and humiliation and had paid a heavy cost in blood in
resistance to such aggression and humiliation, the Chinese leader
said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Chinese people hated and opposed hegemonism, and
China would never harm other nations by practicing hegemonism.
</P>
<P>
China will concentrate on developing its economy and improving
the living standards of its people because it remains a developing
country with a backward economy and culture, and needs to struggle
50 to 100 years to reach the level of moderately developed
countries, said Li.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader pointed out that even if China becomes
prosperous and strong in the future, it will not bully and
threaten others.
</P>
<P>
Late Chinese leaders, Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, told the
Chinese people that China would never practice hegemonism, and
pose as a world leader, Li said.
</P>
<P>
History has demonstrated that all those who practice
hegemonism, whether globally or regionally, come to an sticky end,
Li said, citing Adolf Hitler and Tojo Hideki as examples.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-German relations, Li said there exist no problems left
over from history between the two countries and they share
extensive common interests.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries should all the more treasure the
current situation of bilateral relations established after many
twists and turns.
</P>
<P>
Li repeated China's appreciation for Germany's wise decision
not to participate in the anti-China motion at this year's session
of the United Nations Human Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
China has always considered and handled issues on its ties with
Germany from a strategic point of view. It is willing to establish
with Germany a long-term, stable, comprehensively cooperative ties
which are oriented to the 21st century, the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
In response, Kinkel said as a major world power, a permanent
member of the UN security council, and the largest burgeoning
market in the world, China is playing an important role in
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that maintaining good German-China relations is in
the fundamental interests of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel also said that it is very wise for China, the most
populous country in the world, to give top priority to economic
development and to work hard for the basic needs of its people.
</P>
<P>
Both the German and Chinese economies have their own strong
points and are highly complementary, he said.
</P>
<P>
Germany hopes economic and trade cooperation between the two
countries will be further grow, he said.
</P>
<P>
The German foreign minister repeated that Germany would stick
to its position that Taiwan and Tibet were inalienable parts of
China.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived here today from Berlin to continue his seven-day
goodwill visit. He is scheduled to meet German President Roman
Herzog, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the president of the Bundestag,
the lower house of the German parliament, Rita Suessmuth.

<HEADLINE> 13 Beaches in Cyprus Awarded Blue Flags </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen Cypriot beaches were
awarded the Blue Flag this year by the Foundation for
Environmental Education in Europe (FEE), a Cypriot environmental
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Michael Ierides, President of Cyprus Marine Environmental
Protection Association (CYMEPA), told reporters that another five
beaches in Cyprus have been awarded pilot flags, not because
they are lacking in cleanliness or facilities, but because not
enough chemical analyses of the water were carried out
throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first year Cyprus has been granted full Blue
Flags, as last year we only had 11 pilot flags," Ierides said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this year 23 applications had been submitted to
CYMEPA, the national operator for the Blue Flags, but three were
rejected by the eight-member National Jury, made up of
representatives of the Health Ministry, Environment Department,
the Cyprus Tourism Organization, the Local Authorities and the
Consumers' Association.
</P>
<P>
He explained that these three beaches were not given the Blue
flag because their facilities were not yet completed.
</P>
<P>
According to Ierides, a total of 1,809 beaches in Europe were
awarded the Blue Flags by the FEE, which is a non-governmental
organization consisting of 18 European countries.
</P>
<P>
The FEE has 26 criteria that have to be met to award a beach
with the Blue Flag. They divide into three categories, namely the
quality of the water and the beach, its management, security and
environmental education.
</P>
<P>
This eastern Mediterranean island launched a "Clean-up Cyprus"
campaign this month, which is aimed at making the island a more
competitive tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
More than 2 million foreign tourists visit the island every
year, earning the country about 1.6 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Ministers of Balkan Countries Meeting in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A two-day conference of foreign
ministers from southeast Europe today opened in Thessaloniki,
northern Greece.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in his opening speech, Greek Foreign Minister
Theodoros Pangalos urged his Balkan counterparts to work toward
the establishment of broad cooperation aimed at consolidating
political stability and economic development in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that the progress achieved since a similar meeting in
Sofia last year was significant but "below our true capabilities."
</P>
<P>
Noting that the countries represented by ministers at the
conference shared the same ideals on which the European Union (EU)
was founded, he intimated that they should work toward the
construction of a similar union of their own.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need for strengthening economic ties
between the countries of the region at a bilateral, multilateral
and regional level, as well as the implementation of specific
programs for the development of the region's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos recalled the proposal put forward by Greece in
February calling for the long-term solution of problems arising
from countries in the region in the present phase of their
transition to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis today hailed the
conference as "a decisive step" towards further progress in
cooperation between the countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
He said in a message to the conference that following the
changes which have taken place in the region, countries in the
region must seek new challenges and take advantage of new
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
He added that the successful outcome of the conference will be
"a milestone" in the development of the conference for stability,
security and cooperation in southeast Europe.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, the participants will examine issues
concerning broader political cooperation in fields such as the
protection of the environment, the promotion of humanitarian,
social and cultural cooperation and common action to fight
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
They will also discuss the development of economic cooperation
between the Balkan countries and initiatives aimed at regional
cooperation in southeast Europe.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Insurance Firms Rush to Southeast Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korean insurance firms are
rushing to take a piece of vast insurance markets in Southeast
Asia, China and other countries in Asia, the country's insurance
industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, Thailand and China are targeted as the biggest
potential market for South Korean insurance firms which already
maintain offices in these countries.
</P>
<P>
Latest government statistics showed, South Korean insurers are
operating more than 70 overseas branches and offices, compared to
41 foreign insurers in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Samsung Life Insurance Co. has agreed to set up a joint venture
insurance firm in Thailand in partnership with three Thai
companies. With 25 percent of the total holdings for each
company, the signing took place several days ago in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Samsung Life Co. also plans to upgrade its branch in Singapore
to a local incorporated company so as to make it engage in
insurance business there.
</P>
<P>
Another firm, Daehan Life Co., is trying to open branch offices
in Hong Kong and Malaysia to secure a foothold for its business in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
In addition, non-life insurance firms, plan to make inroads
into Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia, with a plan
targeting many South Koreans working there as potential buyers.
</P>
<P>
Samsung Fire Co. has entered into an agreement last February to
set up a joint venture non-life insurance company with an
Indonesian insurance company at a total investment of 7 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
LG Fire Co. will set up a local subsidiary in August in
Indonesia, along with Hyundai Marine Insurance Co., Dongbu Fire
Co. and Tongyang Fire Co..
</P>
<P>
Aware of the enormous growth potential of China's insurance
market, South Korean insurance firms, including Samsung Fire
Insurance Co., LG Insurance Co. and Hyundai Marine, are now
vigorously pushing to secure footholds in China.

<HEADLINE> Ireland's Ahern Says Minority Government Will Last </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Ireland's Fianna Fail party leader
Bertie Ahern, set to become the country's new Prime Minister after
winning a narrow election victory, said in Dublin today that his
minority government will last.
</P>
<P>
Ahern, whose opposition alliance won 81 of the 166 parliament
seats, dismissed press speculation of holding early elections,
saying that he was determined his minority government would last
its five-year term, press reports from Dublin said.
</P>
<P>
"The aim will be to have a four or five year government,"
Ahern said, adding he hoped independent parties, on whose support
he will have to court in a bid to achieve a parliament majority,
would be mindful of the need for political stability.
</P>
<P>
"I would hope most of them would be concerned about how long
the new parliament can last. We have to get an arrangement that
will last in the longer term," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the new government's views on the single European currency,
outgoing Irish Finance Minister Ruair Quinn, attending an European
Union Finance Ministers meeting in Luxembourg, said today he was
confident the new government would give the same backing to
European economic and monetary union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
"I hope that they will maintain the progress we have put in
place and I would be reasonably confident that by and large they
will," he said. "The commitment of the Irish government to the
single currency project -- the incoming government -- will be the
same as the outgoing government."

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Acts to Improve Economic Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar government
planned to enhance the country's economic infrastructure by
mobilizing investors under the proposed build-cooperate-transfer
(BOT) strategy.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Ahmed Abdulrahman, principal secretary
in the president's office who was opening a three-day workshop on
infrastructure development through BOT in the town of Zanzibar
today.
</P>
<P>
He said the system would provide a lasting solution to the
setting up of a sound infrastructural base for the Isles.
</P>
<P>
Under the BOT system, investors would be allowed to open
projects and operate them for a certain period before handing
over to the government.
</P>
<P>
Abdulrahman told the participants, most of them directors and
managers of companies, that due to limited resources, the
government was unable to provide necessary economic
infrastructure and would therefore welcome better economic
strategies to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would continue to put emphasis on
intrastructure facilities because that was one of the factors
that would attract investments.
</P>
<P>
The principal secretary said the BOT concept has been adopted
with great success by a number of developing countries such as
India, Pakistan, Turkey, Malaysia and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
He noted that bridges, highways, power plants, port and
airport facilities have been established and the number of
investors increased by adopting the BOT strategy.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the BOT concept is one of the tools that would
help Zanzibar to improve its infrastructure facilities," He said.
</P>
<P>
Abdulrahman said the introduction of BOT concept was part of
the government's commitment to create a favorable and predictable
investment atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was co-sponsored by the United Nations
Development Program and the United Nations Industrial Development
Organization in collaboration with the Zanzibar government.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Rules out Early Resumption of Diplomatic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz ruled out here today an early resumption of diplomatic ties
with Iraq, saying economic and political relations are different.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on a resumption of relations with Iraq at
a news conference in his office, the foreign minister said that
"it is still too early to talk about the diplomatic relations
despite that economic contacts between the private sectors of the
two countries have begun."
</P>
<P>
Underlining a separation between the economic and political
links, the foreign minister pointed out that the private sector
in Lebanon "is free and independent and it has the right to
cooperate with Iraq according to their direct and common
interests and we are not against the cooperation on this level."
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that the Iraqis have repeatedly expressed a
desire for a resumption of relations with Lebanon since the Iraqi
embassy in Beirut was closed some three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Sarraf, chairman of the Lebanese Industrialists
Association, expected at the weekend that Lebanon will "soon"
resume diplomatic ties with Iraq to make convenient the export of
Lebanese goods to that country.
</P>
<P>
Sarraf, who visited Baghdad in March heading a powerful
delegation of Lebanese businessmen, said that the Lebanese
government "will coordinate Damascus on this issue."
</P>
<P>
Lebanon broke off diplomatic ties with Iraq in April 1994,
over the killing of an Iraqi opposition leader, Talib Suheli
Al-Tamimi in Beirut in which the Lebanese government accused
Iraqi diplomats of being involved.
</P>
<P>
Even before that, the relations between the two countries had
become tense when Iraq backed Lebanese former army general Michel
Aoun in his failed war against Syrian forces in Lebanon in 1989.
</P>
<P>
In a move interpreted as a sign to show intentions to improve
the relations, the Lebanese authorities released three Iraqis in
January, who were considered the perpetrators of Al-Tamimi's
murder.

<HEADLINE> APEC Environment Ministerial Meeting Opens in Toronto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TORONTO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Environment Ministerial Meeting
of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) opened here today in
another bid to develop practical solutions to the region's
environmental challenges.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal at this meeting is to find better ways of putting the
principle of sustainable development into practice," said Sergio
Marchi, chair of the meeting and environment minister of Canada.
</P>
<P>
The three-day ministerial meeting will have two tasks, Marchi
said at today's opening plenary.
</P>
<P>
"The first is to develop an Action Plan that contains practical
solutions to help create more sustainable urban areas, more
sustainable marine environments and cleaner production methods in
each of our economies," he said.
</P>
<P>
The second is "to send a clear 'sustainable development'
message" to APEC Economic Leaders when they meet in Vancouver in
November.
</P>
<P>
"The message is that all our economies must redouble their
efforts to make sustainable development the overarching objective
by integrating our economic, development, social and trade
agendas," he noted.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, APEC ministers will also have a chance to
hear the views and recommendations of the Business Leaders and
Local Authorities Forum, as well as the Environmental Youth
Caucus.
</P>
<P>
A final joint statement on sustainable development strategies
and actions will be developed by the APEC ministers to take
forward to the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ministers and their representatives from all 18 APEC economies
are participating in the ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
The 18 APEC economies are Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada,
Chile, the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, Indonesia,
Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Republic of the Philippines, Singapore, Chinese
Taipei, Thailand and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Thirtieth Anniversary of 1967 Arab-Israeli War Observed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A special meeting of the
Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the
Palestinian People was convened here today to observe the
thirtieth anniversary of the Arab-Israeli War of June 1967.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
that the United Nations had always played a central role in
assisting the parties in their efforts to reach a negotiated
settlement.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the Declaration of the Principles on Interim
Self-Government arrangements by Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organization on September 1993 was a major breakthrough
in those efforts, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the beginning of the Oslo peace process also opened
major new opportunities for supportive action by the United
Nations. Those included the creation of a special mechanism to
coordinate international assistance and the appointment of a
United Nations Special Coordinator in the Occupied Territories to
serve as a focal point for all United Nations agencies and
programs operating on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The General-Secretary said that he had been encouraged by the
agreement on Hebron and it was an important achievement that
should pave the way for further progress towards full
implementation of the process envisaged at Oslo.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed deep concern that despite the appeals from
the international society, the government of Israel decided to
proceed with the construction at Jabal Abu/Har Homa and called on
the parties to do their utmost to find mutually acceptable
solution, and proceed with the peace process.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Workers Continue Strike Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Government employees in Freetown,
capital of Sierra Leone, continued to stay away from jobs today
despite coup leaders' threat to sack them.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here said government employees, company
clerks and factory workers stood outside their working places on
the pavement, refusing to go back to work on the grounds of
non-payment and continuous looting by the coup soldiers.
</P>
<P>
"Last night the army looted the few remaining electric fans,"
said a clerk at the Freetown Magistrates' Court.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of shoppers descended on three groceries in downtown
areas to stock up on rice, sugar and flour while heavily armed
soldiers guarded the shops to prevent breakout of quarrels and
fights.
</P>
<P>
While stocks of shops were running out, there was no immediate
prospect of restocking. A senior harbor official said several
boats carrying rice and other foodstuffs had been diverted to
neighboring Guinea despite their scheduled arrival at Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The silent strike has been maintained for consecutive two
weeks since the widely condemned May 25 coup overthrew the
civilian government led by President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
A statement of the military junta, repeatedly broadcasted on
the state radio since Saturday, warned that anyone absent from
work without a valid reason would be sacked.
</P>
<P>
The coup leaders have sent a delegation to other west African
countries to explain reasons for the coup which triggered off a
military action by the sub-regiona's peacekeeping force, led by
Nigeria, to restore power of the ousted President Kabbah.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Gap Unbridged Between Palestinians, Israelis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Despite the Palestinian-Israeli
expert meeting on Sunday, the gap separating the two sides remains
in place, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said here today.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that the Cairo meeting designed to pave
way for renewing the full-scale Palestinian-Israeli talks has
failed to clear major obstacles but he stopped short of specifying
the details.
</P>
<P>
"The situation requires further efforts in the coming days,"
he said, adding that another expert meeting in Israel on Thursday
between the two sides is part of those efforts.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met here on Sunday night
for the first time in nearly three months since the peace talks
were paralyzed when Israel began construction on a new Jewish
settlement in the disputed Arab East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian top diplomat waved off the statement of European
Mideast envoy Miguel Moratinos about giving Egyptian efforts a
deadline for moving forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt rejects any dictation to it. There are no such a thing
as definitive deadlines for any topic, but rather a reasonable
time framework for any political action undertaken by any party,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the European role in the Middle East is important
and Europe can engage in cooperation (with other parties in the
peace process) on an equal basis "without piling pressure."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials have confirmed that the fate of the
housing project was discussed in the Sunday talks.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat voiced
his sorrow today that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
has not issued instructions for halting settlement construction in
Har Homa in East Jerusalem and other areas.
</P>
<P>
Israel has reportedly hatched a face-saving compromise under
which it will slow down the Har Homa construction to a near halt
to allow the resumption of talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu today denied the existence of such a plan and
said the construction will continue.

ANKARA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A group of 50 Turkish officers and
soldiers today flew to the United States to participate in a
multinational military exercises from June 11 to July 4.
</P>
<P>
The Cooperative Nugget maneuvers will be held in Fort Polk
Joint Military Training Center in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that Turkey sends its land forces to
overseas military exercises.
</P>
<P>
The joint maneuvers is reportedly aimed at strengthening
military coordination among the participant countries for
regional stability in the Balkans and neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
Besides Turkey, the United States, Canada, Belgium and other
Partnership for Peace countries will also take part in the
military exercises.
</P>
<P>
Greece, a traditional rival country with Turkey, made a
U-turn last week to withdraw from the joint maneuvers, saying
that it would not participate in the drills with a Turkish
military unit.
</P>
<P>
Athens usually does not participate in any NATO military
exercises organized in or by Turkey, although both of them are
NATO member countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece have long been at odds due to differences
over a number of sensitive issues, including the Agean Sea
sovereignty, mineral rights as well as the Cyprus problem.

<P>
LONDON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
said today that Britain was likely to secure a good deal at the
European Union (EU) summit to be held in Amsterdam next week.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at parliament this afternoon, Cook said that the new
Labor government, which won a landslide victory on a May 1
election, was poised to get positive results from the EU summit
because of its constructive stance taken on European policy.
</P>
<P>
Cook explained that the Labor government had already
re-established Britain as a leading player in Europe because it
had given up the previous Conservative government's
confrontational strategy on Europe.
</P>
<P>
"Precisely because this government is not shouting `No' to
everything out of prejudice, we are listened to with respect when
we do say `No' to issues that threaten Britain's national
interests," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
On the EU summit, Cook said he was confident of reaching
agreement with Britain's EU partners on border controls, fighting
against fraud in EU member states, reform of the Council of
Ministers and the common foreign and security policy.
</P>
<P>
"We can return from Amsterdam not just having done a good deal
for Britain but having obtained a better deal for Britain that the
previous government could have hoped to achieve," Cook said.

<P>
PARIS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- President Jacques Chirac today
obtained from President Pascal Lissouba of the Congo Republic and
former President Denis Sassou N'Guesso an "agreement of principle"
on a cease-fire in the capital Brazzaville, the French
presidential office announced this evening.
</P>
<P>
Chirac talked on telephone today with Lissouba, Sassou N'Guesso
and Gabonese President Omar Bongo about the crisis in the Congo
Republic, and he used the "same language" to urge the conflicting
sides of Congo to implement a cease-fire, said presidential
spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
</P>
<P>
"There is no military solution to a political problem. One
cannot but condemn the actual behaviors. It is unacceptable to
talk about war," said Chirac in his telephone conversation with
Lissouba and Sassou N'Guesso.
</P>
<P>
Chirac asked both men to arrange a cease-fire as quickly as
possible and to accept the mediation by Bongo to find a peaceful
solution to the conflict in the Congo Republic.
</P>
<P>
Both Lissouba and Sassou N'Guesso agreed in principle to the
request of Chirac, said Colonna.
</P>
<P>
France today sent a reinforcement of 800 soldiers to the Congo
Republic to protect the French nationals there, after one French
soldier was killed Saturday night when trying to help foreigners
evacuate from a hotel in Brazzaville.
</P>
<P>
This added the number of French troops deployed in the Congo
Republic to 1,250.
</P>
<P>
Some French nationals who have fled Congo said that anti-French
feeling was on the rise in Congo.
</P>
<P>
Government troops and the militiamen supporting N'Guesso fought
for a fifth consecutive day today in Brazzaville, as both sides
held the other side responsible for the violence, in which
hundreds of civilians were reportedly killed.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) today announced the investment of 46.7 million
U.S. dollars equivalent in Suzhou Huasu Plastic Co., Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The new company, located in the Liujia Port Economic
Development Zone in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, will operate a plant
capable of producing 100,000 tons of polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
resin per year and a 24,000 ton per year film calendering
facility.
</P>
<P>
PVC is a major commodity plastic used in industrial and
consumer products such as pipes, fittings, wire cables and
bottles. The calendering process converts PVC compounds into PVC
film and sheets.
</P>
<P>
The new company will be the first petrochemicals joint venture
project with U.S. and Norway companies in Suzhou providing a
vehicle for the transfer of modern technology and know-how. The 90
million dollar plant is scheduled to be completed in early 1999.
It will import vinyl chloride monomer, which is the main raw
material for PVC, but its products will be sold in the domestic
and overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
IFC's financing package includes a 22 million dollar loan for
its own account, a 2.5 million dollar equity investment and a 22.2
million dollar loan for the account of participating banks. The
Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation is co-financing the
project with a 3.8 million dollar equivalent loan.
</P>
<P>
IFC is a member of the World Bank Group and also the largest
multilateral source of equity and loan financing for private
sector projects in developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Kissinger: Revoking MFN Risks Confrontation With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger has said that revoking the Most Favored Nation (MFN)
trade status for China was not in the U.S. national interest as it
would lead to a political confrontation with China.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CBS's "One on One" program last Friday,
released today, Kissinger said the MFN status was in fact the
normal trade treatment as "there are only six nations in the whole
world that don't have MFN status."
</P>
<P>
"So if it is rejected, it would mean that the most populous
nation in the world is put into separate status. And it's
equivalent to a political confrontation with China," said the
former secretary of state, who was instrumental in thawing ice
between the United States and China in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Revoking the MFN for China was not "in the national interest
because the relations with China are essential or important for
stability in Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger rebuked someone's preach of "China threat," saying it
was "running a huge risk of talking ourselves into a demonology of
China as a madly aggressive country."
</P>
<P>
"China is growing at the rate of 10 percent a year. That sounds
formidable, and it is. But we have to remember that 10 percent of
China's growth is less than 1 percent of ours. So actually the gap
is increasing in our favor," he said.
</P>
<P>
As regards the future of Hong Kong after its returning to China
on July 1, Kissinger believed that the Chinese would keep the "one
country, two systems" principle going "because it is essential for
them as a bridge to Taiwan, to show that you can have one country,
two systems, and because it is essential also for the economy of
Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
"They will not want to have that economy disintegrate just
after it returns to China," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger predicted that Hong Kong would have a smooth
transition, and "nothing will happen in the first week" after the
transfer of power.
</P>
<P>
"Unless it is provoked by the presence of so much attention and
6,000 newsmen wanting to generate stories," he added.

<P>
NEW YORK, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street pushed
further into record highes today, briefly boosting the Dow Jones
industrial average above 7,500 for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The Dow rose by 42.72 points to 7,478.50, its second straight
record close. The blue-chip barometer bobbed above 7,500 several
times during the session before retreating during the last hour.
The Dow -- up about 1,000 points, or 16 percent, for the year --
first broke above 6,000 in October and 7,000 in February
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a nearly 4-to-3
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 465.57
million shares as against 488.40 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Broader indicators also set new highs.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 4.92 to 862.93, and
the NYSE's composite index rose 2.04 to 450.17, with both measures
adding to Friday's record highs.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 7.33 to 1,412.17, its first new
high in eight sessions. The American Stock Exchange composite
index rose 4.92 to 619.57, setting its first new high in more than
a year.
</P>
<P>
The market was not affected by a weak bond session in which
long-term interest rates rose. Some major corporate deals also
added to investor enthusiasm, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
Those deals included an agreement by Microsoft to invest 1
billion U.S. dollars in Comcast, the nation's fourth-largest cable
company. BankAmerica, meanwhile, agreed to buy the investment firm
Robertson Stephens for up to 540 million U.S. dollars; and Safeco,

<TEXT>
<P>
Rome, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Alberto Tomba and four associates
are facing a probe by Italian tax authorities into advertising
and sponsorship contracts involving the national ski hero.
</P>
<P>
According to a report availble here, Tomba is likely to be
questioned by tax inspectors.
</P>
<P>
As well as Tomba, the authorities are investigating his father
Franco, who is the sole director of New Events, Paolo Comellini,
Tomba's former business manager, and Luciano Bindini, who owns an
advertising agency linked to Comellini.
</P>
<P>
A tax official, Giuseppe Moscuzza, is meanwhile under
investigation for an alleged breach of confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
Tomba will only be questioned once the authorities have sifted
through documents, computers and floppy disks found at New Events
offices.
</P>
<P>
State prosecutor Enrico Cieri is investigating whether any of
Tomba's publicity contracts with sponsors were settled by
payments to foreign bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
Investigators have also sought advice from the Italian Ski
Federation over the nature of athletes' sponsorship contracts.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua On Patriotism (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- China's Xinhua News Agency, in an
article entitled "Cultivating Patriotic Feelings and Encouraging
Dedication to the Motherland", says that with Hong Kong's return
to the motherland on July 1 growing near, the hearts of all
Chinese people are full of patriotic feelings.
</P>
<P>
It reports that a major project to educate people in patriotism
and to promote reforms, opening up and socialist development on
the eve of Hong Kong's return is the 100 Patriotic Education Bases
designated by the Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
"Providing an education in patriotism is a cause that can
improve the overall quality of the whole nation and promote
socialist cultural and ethical progress," it says.
</P>
<P>
It quoted President Jiang Zemin as saying, "education in
patriotism is an important part of cultural and ethical progress,
and increased patriotic education should run through the whole of
the socialist modernization drive."
</P>
<P>
To give a patriotic education to more people, the Propaganda
Department of the CPC Central Committee has selected 100 patriotic
movies, 100 types of patriotic books, and the 100 Education Bases
of Patriotism.
</P>
<P>
These bases demonstrate China's splendid 5,000 years of
civilization, painting a grand picture of the Chinese people's
unremitting efforts in building the country.
</P>
<P>
They consist of four groups:
</P>
<P>
The first group is cultural relics sites, which tell the story
of how the nation's ancestors suffered many hardships to build
Chinese civilization, contributing to the progress of human
civilization.
</P>
<P>
The second is museums and memorials to the Chinese nation's
struggle against foreign invaders to defend the freedom, dignity
and sovereignty of the nation.
</P>
<P>
The third is memorials and sites which show the revolutionary
deeds of the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party in
modern times, telling people that only socialism can save China.
</P>
<P>
The fourth tells the stories of model workers and model
construction projects in the People's Republic of China, which was
founded in 1949, showing that only socialism can develop China,
and only the reforms and opening-up can make China prosperous and
strong.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Achieves Strong Growth in High-Tech Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's domestic exports of
high-tech products increased by about 16 percent per annum between
1990 and 1996 to reach about 39.3 billion US dollars in 1996, the
Singapore Trade Development Board (TDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
This is higher than the corresponding growth rate of 11 percent
per annum achieved for total non-oil domestic exports, the TDB
said.
</P>
<P>
The TDB said the share of high-tech products as a percentage of
the non-oil domestic exports has risen from 52 percent in 1990 to
65 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"This reflects the success of Singapore's efforts to
restructure and upgrade its economy to one based on high-tech and
high value-added industries," it said.
</P>
<P>
The TDB also noted that in the period of 1990-95, Singapore's
share of all high-technology exports by the four Newly
Industrialized Economies (NIEs) was the highest at 35.4 percent.
The NIEs are Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
A comparison by products category showed that Singapore was
ahead of those three NIEs for domestic exports of bio-technology,
advanced materials, opto-electronics, and information and
communication products in 1995, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, Singapore was behind South Korea and Taiwan for the
exports of electronics and flexible manufactures. And it came in
second behind South Korea for its domestic exports of aerospace
products.
</P>
<P>
The TDB said it would step up its efforts to "safeguard and
expand" market access for Singapore's high technology exports. And
it would assist high technology companies to penetrate new markets
and make inroads into existing ones.

<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A forum on "Deepening Reforms and
Revitalizing State-Owned Enterprises" was held by the Propaganda
Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and
the State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC) today in Beijing to
discuss this urgent and difficult problem in China's economy.
</P>
<P>
It is also a popular topic with the press. The participants in
the forum said they agree that extensive media coverage of ten
successful state-owned enterprises sponsored by the Propaganda
Department and the SETC earlier this year have had a good effect.
</P>
<P>
The experience of the ten enterprises shows that state-owned
enterprises can be revitalized by market competition, they say,
pointing out that once state-owned enterprises decide to turn to
the market, their potential will become practical competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
They also spoke highly of the role the media has played in
pushing the reforms. The reforms have reached a critical stage,
and the participants urged governments at all levels to create
external conditions that are conducive to changing the methods of
operation of the state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
They also called on the media to provide accurate reports of
the state-owned enterprises' experiences to help the reforms.

TOKYO, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto expressed the wish today that Japanese-Russian relations
could be fully normalized by the signing of a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
He was meeting Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister Boris
Nemtsov here.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said he would discuss with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin ways for a comprehensive improvement of Japanese-Russian
ties, at the Denver summit scheduled for later this month. He
would also notify Yeltsin whether he would accept Yeltsin's
invitation to visit Moscow this year.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister hoped the two countries could work hard for
a quick solution to disputes over the safety of Japanese fishing
boats operating around four Russian-held islands off Japan's
northernmost main island of Hokkaido.
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov, who arrived here Monday for a three-day visit, handed
Yeltsin's personal letter to Hashimoto at the prime minister's
official residence.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Yeltsin said no issues could not be solved
between Russia and Japan and the two nations' basic interests were
close or unanimous.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president repeated his proposal that the two states
hold a summit every year to strengthen bilateral political
dialogue and settle issues.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo and Moscow have held a series of talks since March 1995
following incidents in which Russian patrol boats fired at
Japanese fishing vessels in waters near the disputed islands.
</P>
<P>
The decades-old row over the islands has prevented the two
countries from signing a peace treaty.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Meteorological Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XICHANG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- China successfully launched a
meteorological satellite here at 20:01 Beijing time today.
</P>
<P>
The satellite, called the Fengyun 2, is a second-generation
meteorological satellite developed by Chinese scientists. It was
launched by a Long March 3 carrier rocket at the Xichang Satellite
Launching Center in southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three minutes after the launching, the satellite and the
rocket separated, and the satellite went into its predetermined
orbit.
</P>
<P>
This is the 45th time that a satellite has been launched by a
Long March carrier rocket.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng has showed great concern for the launching, and
inquired about the progress of the launching several times.
</P>
<P>
Liu Huaqing, Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau
of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and vice-chairman
of the Central Military Commission, came to the launching site to
examine the preparations for the launching.
</P>
<P>
The Fengyun 2 satellite was developed mainly by the Shanghai
Aerospace Technology Research Institute under the China Aerospace
Corporation. Weighing 1.38 tons, the satellite is equipped with a
scanning radiometer, a cloud coverage information system, and a
data collection translator. The satellite is designed to have a
life span of three years.
</P>
<P>
Different from the two Fengyun 1 synchronous solar orbit
meteorological satellites launched in 1988 and 1990, the Fengyun 2
is a meteorological satellite that is in synchronous orbit with
the earth.
</P>
<P>
The Fengyun 2 can cover about 100 million sq km of earth
surface, keeping China at the center. It can also provide
meteorological information such as cloud maps, temperatures, and
wind movements over China and its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The satellite will help improve medium- and long-term weather
forecasts and those for natural disasters in the country.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the satellite has been operating normally,
and the Xi'an Satellite Control Center and marine surveying ships
will track and control the satellite, which will be positioned
over the equator at 105 degrees east longitude.

</P>
<P>
The Africa Resources Trust which prepared the document said
Malawi, South Africa and Zimbabwe were reaching the point where
land requirements by rural people could no longer be satisfied.
</P>
<P>
The future of elephants outside protected areas in the
southern Africa region was critically dependent on their
competitiveness in a land use context, said the Trust, a local
non-governmental organisation.
</P>
<P>
Current estimates of the elepnant population in southern
Africa stand at 187,239, with most of the animals found in
Botswana which has 71,586, Malawi 1,651, Namibia 8,901, South
Africa 10,010, Zambia 26,275 and Zimbabwe 67,971.
</P>
<P>
Latest data list the number of elephants inside protected
areas in Zimbabwe at 54,377, while 13,594 are outside.
</P>
<P>
Elephant densities were generally higher in protected areas
while survival of the jumbo outside these areas was highly
dependent on their value as a component of land use systems.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Help Private Sector Promote Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Lokendra
Bahadur Chand said here today that the government has started
organizing training programs to provide management expertise and
manpower to the private sector in order to promote exports and
strengthen their competitive capabilities.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the 31st annual general meeting of the
Federation of Nepalese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI),
Chand said it is the need of the hour to move ahead promotional
activities to attract investment in Nepal by making the
government's concepts of open, liberal and free market more
practical and suitable to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Chand noted that as new challenges will be faced in the
international trade sector at the beginning of the 21st century,
close relationship should be maintained between the government and
the private sector by realizing the fact that we will be compelled
to work in accordance with the norms and values developed by the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
He said the governments and the private sectors of the South
Asian countries should make necessary preparations to build the
capability of facing the challenges and converting the available
opportunities into benefits in the process of translating
preferential trade into free trade between the South Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his commitment to provide maximum attractive
benefits to broaden the scope for investment by increasing
domestic savings, Chand said the government is flexible in
improving and refining the policies if they are found inadequate
for setting up business enterprises and developing a sense of
security for the investments being made by national and foreign
investors.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Government to Raise Water Charges by 4 folds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government has
decided to raise water charges by four folds over the next three
years to get Singaporeans to treat water as a precious and
strategic resource, and make water conservation a way of life,
Acting Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Lee noted the steady 4.7
percent rise in water consumption in Singapore over the past ten
years. At the present rate, Singapore would be short of water by
year 2011 if the first water agreement with Malaysia was not
renewed.
</P>
<P>
The two Water Agreements between the Public Utilities Board
(PUB) of Singapore and the Johor State Government of Malaysia were
signed in 1961 and 1962. In 1965, when Singapore became
independent, the Malaysian Federal government specifically
guaranteed these two Water Agreements in the Separation Agreement.
</P>
<P>
According to the Separation Agreement, the two Water Agreements
will expire in 2011 and 2061 respectively. Water supply from
Malaysia accounts for about 50 percent of Singapore's water
consumption.
</P>
<P>
"We must revise the present pricing structure. Water
conservation must apply equally to all households and firms. As
water is a strategic resource, the first drop is precious," the
acting prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government's long term objective is to
restructure the water tariffs and water conservation tax into
uniform flat rates, and that the adjustments to the water tariffs,
water conservation tax, and waterborne fees will be phased in over
four annual increments of roughly equal dollar amounts, starting
from July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The new rates will apply each year from the August cycle of
meter readings and the price of water will be raised to about two
Singapore dollars (about 1.4 US dollars at current exchange rate)
per cubic meter by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Although the financial impact of these adjustments will be
significant, Lee stressed however that this is necessary for the
revisions to have an impact on consumers, and to get them to
conserve water.
</P>
<P>
But he also said that the government would offset the increases
for lower income households with utilities rebates and higher
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The government was doing its best to ensure that Singapore was
able to cater to its own water needs, he said. This, as he
disclosed, included concluding water agreements with Indonesia,
building desalination plants, and exploiting water sources to the
limit.

just struggle of the South African people and its important role
in international affairs. The normalization of South Africa-China
relations will be conducive to democracy and development in South
Africa, he said, and that his country is expecting cooperation
with China in international affairs.
</P>
<P>

countries will also increase with the normalization of bilateral
ties.

diplomatic relations. Chinese Vice-Foreign Ministry Tian Zengpei

<HEADLINE> Soeharto: Car Policy Talks Should Not Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
today ordered the continuation of the talks with Japan, the United
States and European Union (EU) on Indonesia's national car program
without impairing the national interests.
</P>
<P>
Industry and Trade Minister Tunky Ariwibowo met with Soeharto
to report on his talks with the Japanese government and EU
concerning the national car program.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters after the meeting that Japan has submitted
some proposals, including a reduction on import duty.
</P>
<P>
The national car program, launched in February 1996, grants
tariff and luxury sales tax exemptions to national cars on
condition that their local content rises to 60 percent in three
years.
</P>
<P>
However, only a joint venture between Pt. Timor Putra Nasional
and South Korean Kia motors is qualified to produce national car
until 1999.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the EU have taken Indonesia's national car policy to
the World Trade Organization's (WTO) dispute settlement body. The
United States has also protested the policy but is still trying to
resolve the dispute through bilateral negotiations. The trio
claimed that Indonesia's car policy is discriminatory and against
multilateral trade rules.
</P>
<P>
The government, Tunky said, is preparing to continue talks with
the three groups on the national car dispute, but he did not
reveal the timing for the talks.

<HEADLINE> Iran Benefits from Chemical Weapon Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran's membership in the chemical
weapons prohibition convention, which was approved by the
Parliament last Sunday, would improve the standards of its
chemical industries, a high-ranking official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Javad Zarif, Deputy Foreign Minister for
International Affairs, said "the Parliament's approval would pave
the way for the transfer of technology in the chemical industry"
as well as for Iran's active participation in the decision-making
of the convention.
</P>
<P>
"With this approval, Iran will confront any discrimination
that it might see in the area of transfer of technology or in
the field of inspection," Zarif was quoted by the state-run
Tehran Radio as saying.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Iranian Parliament approved a bill that would give
the government the go-ahead to join the Convention on the
Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use
of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction.
</P>
<P>
However, a number of MPs expressed their disapproval of the
bill Sunday, saying that as long as Iran is surrounded by
enemies, it can not join such conventions.
</P>
<P>
Today, the MPs who opposed the bill submitted a request to
Parliament's Presiding Board, asking it to take another
vote. They said that the vote taken Sunday was not taken
properly.
</P>
<P>
The convention, which was signed in Paris by 130 countries in
1991, calls for countries that have chemical weapons to eliminate
them over 10 years.

WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Just 19 minutes after it arrived in the Oval Office
yesterday, President Clinton vetoed a bill to provide disaster
relief money to help flood-stricken states -- leaving Republicans
scrambling for a plan to counter his charge that they were
"playing politics with the lives of Americans in need."
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton will help host a private dinner here on
Wednesday at which Democratic National Committee officials will
plead with the party's biggest fund-raisers to raise or give
250,000 dollars each over the next two years to help rescue the
DNC from its worst financial crisis in three decades.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The chief Republican tax writer unveiled his plan for
apportioning the first big federal tax cut since 1981, making good
on his party's promise to reduce tax bills for investors and
families but prompting criticism from Democrats that the plan
favors the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
-- Leaders of a task force investigating a series of bombings
in Atlanta said today that they were "all but positive" that the
same person or people planted bombs at a lesbian nightclub and at a

confidence" that those incidents were linked to last summer's
explosion at Centennial Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Ralston withdrew as candidate for chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. The move ends a period of controversy that began

<HEADLINE> Philippine Court Upholds Ban on Charter Change Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Supreme Court today
upheld an earlier ruling prohibiting a non-governmental group from
proceeding its bid to change the Constitution to extend the term
of President Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
In a vote of seven to six, the court rejected the petition
filed by the People's Initiatives for Reform, Modernization and
Action (PIRMA), a pro-Ramos group, seeking the reversal of the
tribunal's March 19 decision.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution issued after the voting, the court said the
motion lacked "sufficient cogency to persuade the requisite
majority of the court to modify or reverse the decision of March"
and was "denied with finality."
</P>
<P>
Thirteen of the 15 justices of the high bench participated in
the voting, with the other two being on leave.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after learning the court's decision, Executive
Secretary Ruben Torres, a close aide to Ramos, expressed his
disappointment over the ruling.
</P>
<P>
"We hoped that the people's right to petition through a
signature campaign to amend the constitution would be upheld by
the Supreme Court, but we respect the Supreme Court's decision in
this regard," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Torres also denied persistent reports that officials at the
Presidential Palace attempted to influence the positive outcome of
the court decision.
</P>
<P>
The court's March 19 ruling said that there is no enabling law
which provides for a people's initiative for charter change.
</P>
<P>
It stopped the Commission on Elections from entertaining
PIRMA's petition to hold a plebiscite on constitution changes and
banned PIRMA leaders from further gathering signatures needed for
a people's initiative to amend the charter.
</P>
<P>
The PIRMA, launched late last year by Ramos' supporters, has
sought to remove the term limits for all government officials,
including that of Ramos, by changing the country's 1987
constitution.
</P>
<P>
The existing charter, which was promulgated after the downfall
of former dictatorial president Fernand Marcos, provides for a
single six-year term for the president.
</P>
<P>
Ramos himself has repeatedly indicated that he will step down
when his term of office expires in June 1998.

<HEADLINE> State-Owned Sector Remains Backbone of China's Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- According to the State Statistics
Bureau's monthly report, which was made public here today, China's
state-owned enterprises had 84.5 billion yuan (about 10.18 billion
US dollars) in added value output last month, accounting for 47
percent of the nation's total in industrial sector and
representing a year-on-year increase of 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although performance is still slack in China's state-owned
sector, a revival is hoped for and the state-owned enterprises
remain a major force in the country's economic take-off. Since the
beginning of the year, state-owned enterprises have maintained a
growth rate of 6.2 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Xiaohua, chief economist of the SSB, says that the sector's
competitive edge was largely improved by practice in the market
economy, and a number of large state-owned enterprises which
benefited from structure readjustments are now taking the lead in
the revival.
</P>
<P>
He said that until the end of the century, the state-owned
sector will generate a third of the country's economic output, and
their assets will account for two-thirds of the country's
total. So, state-owned enterprises will still play a decisive role
in the national economy.
</P>
<P>
A number of government officials and economists share Qiu's
optimism and point out that the sector is now in better shape than
before because most large and medium-sized enterprises, the output
value and sales of which amount to 60 percent of the country's
whole, are making a profit. At least 77 percent of the enterprises
running in red are small ones.
</P>
<P>
After several years of structural reform, a good number of
state-owned giants, such as Changhong, Chunlan and Baoshan Iron
and Steel Group, have increased per capita productivity to a level
similar to that of advanced nations, and have become money makers
for local governments.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, despite the number of loss-making enterprises, which
account for 30 percent or more, sound growth was achieved in the
state-owned sector as a whole, analysts say.

<TEXT>
<P>
Structural reforms have proven an effective means of revamping
China's big enterprises and are now spreading over the country. In
Shanghai, 80 percent of the state-owned enterprises participated
in the reforms. The debt to asset ratio dropped from 80 percent to
65 percent in the state-owned sector by the end of 1996, and will
reach 60 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Chen Qingtai, deputy director of State Economic and Trade
Commission, says that in addition to structural readjustments, the
central government will quicken the pace of enterprise reform this
year, in optimizing asset mix, encouraging mergers, and using
bankruptcy to improve business.
</P>
<P>
He said that, as the country enters a new round of economic
growth, the status of state-owned enterprises will not change.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Haihang, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences, says that China's economic growth over the past
two decades has been based on the stable development of the
state-owned sector.
</P>
<P>
Even though there were serious losses in the 1991-1996 period,
state-owned enterprises generated an annual increase of 15.53
percent in added value, which was quite high for an economic
sector as a whole, said Zheng.
</P>
<P>
It is the state-owned enterprises that make up most of the
central government revenues and have borne the cost of reforms
during the past several years, Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
As long as the Chinese government sticks to an open-door reform
policy, a steadily growing state-owned sector playing a leading
role in the national economy will be the best means to maintain
social stability and balance economic development.

<HEADLINE> Chinese General Meets Zimbabwe Army Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- General Zhang Wannian, the
vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission (CMC), in a
meeting with Zimbabwe's Army Commander C. G. Chiwenga here today,
said that China attaches importance to improving relations with
Zimbabwe and other African nations.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that bilateral cooperation in politics, the economy,
culture, and other areas has developed greatly since the two
countries established diplomatic relations, and that, "We are very
satisfied with it."
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin visited six African nations last year and
Premier Li Peng visited seven African countries last month,
bolstering Sino-African cooperative relations, he said. Generally
speaking, the international situation is becoming more relaxed,
the multi-polar pattern continues to grow, and peace and
development are now seen as two major topics in the world, he
added.
</P>
<P>
However, the world is not yet peaceful, he noted, because
hegemony and power politics still exist, and some regional
conflicts are not ending.
</P>
<P>
Zhang expressed his appreciation for Zimbabwe's adherence to
the "one China" policy and its support for China in international
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Chiwenga said that the two countries have a long-standing
friendship, and he expressed his thanks to the Chinese government
for its help, and said that no matter how the international
situation changes, the Zimbabwean people will be friends of the
Chinese people forever.
</P>
<P>
Present on the occasion were Xiong Guangkai, deputy chief of
the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and
Lucas Pande Tavaya, Zimbabwe's Ambassador to China.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today ordered the investigation of reports that at least two
Filipino women have been detained and raped by their employers in
the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI).
</P>
<P>
In a handwritten note, President Ramos ordered Foreign
Secretary Domingo Siazon and Labor Secretary Leonardo Quisumbing
to submit a report on their findings as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, two congressmen urged the government to immediately
revoke its labor agreement with CNMI, citing that US federal
authorities have documented at least two Filipino women detained
and raped by their employers in CNMI.
</P>
<P>
They also claimed that cases of abuses against Filipino workers
in CNMI have increased by 160 percent. From January to March this
year, the Philippine labor office in CNMI received 151 complaints
for labor violations from Filipino contracted workers.
</P>
<P>
There is a total of 25,000 Filipino migrant workers in CNMI, a
chain of islands in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
Stories of abuses against Filipino overseas workers often hit
the headlines of local media, which reported that everyday there
are two Filipino overseas workers dying of abuses.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has six million contracted workers in more than
100 countries and regions.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government began
distributing application forms for post-handover passports this
morning, with local residents queuing up at immigration offices
throughout Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Over 91,000 application forms for Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) passports were handed out up to
16:00 local time, an official with the Immigration Department told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
It was only part of the overall figure on the first day of
issue, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The new passports will be signed and issued to local residents
starting on July 3.
</P>
<P>
In Wan Chai, specially set up counters were jammed with
applicants and the Immigration Department has allocated over 200
staff to process the expected over five million applications.
</P>
<P>
Chinese citizens living abroad can go to over 200 Chinese
embassies for collecting application forms for HKSAR passports,
said the Immigration Department official.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the Basic Law, all the Chinese citizens
living in Hong Kong have the right to apply for a HKSAR
passport. Some local residents said a HKSAR passport not only
serves as an identification paper for a Chinese citizen but also
makes travel more convenient.
</P>
<P>
So far at least 27 countries have publicly announced that they
will grant visa-free access to HKSAR passport holders.

<HEADLINE> Feature: 99 Years Make A Difference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Yesterday's headlines were
business as usual at China's leading newspaper, the People's
Daily, with news centering on the country's economic successes and
foreigners' growing awareness of the powerhouse status China is
attaining.
</P>
<P>
What a difference 99 years make.
</P>
<P>
On June 9, 1898, Britain forced the then Chinese government to
sign "The Convention Respecting An Extension of The Hong Kong
Territory," under which the New Territory were leased to Britain
for 99 years.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting marking the event yesterday, historians from the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences referred to it as "The Day of
National Humiliation."
</P>
<P>
News about the signing of the Convention was published in local
newspapers one week later. At first, no one paid much attention.
</P>
<P>
In the late 19th century, many Chinese thought of their country
as the center of the universe; only a few pioneer spirits were
awakened by the cannon fire of British warships and joined the
struggle for the country's reunification.
</P>
<P>
"Zongli Yamen," or the Foreign Ministry of the Qing Dynasty
(1644-1911), is located in a hutong, or side street, near
Tiananmen Square. Its main building was burned by Western allies
during their 1900 invasion of Beijing. Only parts of it are
preserved and are expected to be put on a relics protection list.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday, the movie "Opium War" premiered in the Chinese
capital city. The film about Britain's overtaking of Hong Kong is
the most expensive in Chinese movie-making history.
</P>
<P>
"The aim of shooting such a movie is to remind all Chinese of
the past. For any nation, ignorance of the outside world means
backwardness, and a backward country is doomed to be bullied,"
said Xie Jin, the 74-year-old director of the movie.

JAKARTA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia, along with other
southeast Asian countries, has been indirectly offered
Russian-made su-27sk and mig-29 warplanes long before it canceled
its plan to purchase nine f-16s from the United States, a Russian
diplomat here said today.
</P>
<P>
"Russia never links the selling of warplanes to political
affairs. This is our policy. We do not want to interfere in the
domestic affairs of other countries," information officer of the

</P>
<P>
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said last Friday that
Indonesia had decided to cancel its purchase of the f-16s and
forego its participation in a military training program offered by
the U.S. due to "unjustified criticism in the US Congress against
Indonesia."
</P>

Noskov did not comment on the cancellation.

He said Russia has also offered its warplanes to other Asian
countries, which he described as a good market for its products.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Airlines today
launched an electronic ticketing system, which marked the
beginning of a ticketless air travel era.
</P>
<P>
The system introduced by the airlines in cooperation with
Maybank will be convenient to air travelers and improve
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, air travelers need only to go through three
simple steps -- first they phone the Malaysia Airlines ticket
office for booking their flights and get their transaction number,
then with that number they could effect payment for their seat
through their Automated Teller Machine (ATM) cards at Maybank ATM
machines in any part of the country, and with the receipt issued
by the ATM machine, they could proceed straight to the check-in
counter at the airport for their boarding pass.
</P>
<P>
However, this facility would only be available to domestic air
travelers in the country for the time being, according to the
airlines officials.
</P>
<P>
At a launching ceremony for the ticketing system, Malaysia
Airlines Chairman Tajudin Ramli said an electronic ticketing
system for international flight bookings would be introduced once
confirmation was received from the International Air Travel
Association.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Welcomes Admission of New Members to ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today welcomed the forthcoming admission of Cambodia, Laos and
Myanmar into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
The three new members will be formally admitted into ASEAN this
July despite the U.S. strong opposition against Myanmar's entry
into the body which groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam at present.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of ASEAN to encompass all ten nations in
Southeast Asia fulfills the vision of a regional group free from
animosities, divisions and barriers of the past, Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
"With an ASEAN Ten, we are in a better position to consolidate
understanding, solidarity and cooperation, as well as insure
steady progress for the members of the Southeast Asia family which
constitutes a vast market of 440 million people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos added that the more economically-advanced ASEAN states
would now be able to assist the three countries within an ASEAN
framework.
</P>
<P>
"We will help them more capably and, within a shorter
time-frame, integrate themselves into our growing and increasingly
prosperous regional market in Southeast Asia," he said.

<HEADLINE> Project Hope: From a Small Village to Whole Country (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Shengli, a young boy
from a small village in north China's Taihang Mountain, never
expected the letter he wrote 10 years ago would lead to a
nationwide movement for aiding poor school dropouts.
</P>
<P>
The program, which over the past decade has received assistance
from hundreds of millions of people, has benefited 1.55 million
school dropouts in poor areas across the country.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Zhang found himself unable to continue his studies at
the primary school in Taomugeda Village in north China's Hebei
Province, because his family could not afford school fees.
</P>
<P>
Eager to return to school, he wrote a letter to Che Zhizhong,
vice-chairman of Hebei's Laiyuan County Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, asking for help.
</P>
<P>
Che had been a teacher in the Taihang mountainous area for 30
years, ever since his graduation from Beijing Normal University in
the 1950s. He was familiar with the situation in Zhang's village,
where the high mountains and deep valleys made it difficult for
villagers and domestic animals to get enough drinking water.
</P>
<P>
The 11 schoolchildren in the village faced the same situation
as Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Che urged his family, friends and colleagues to make donations
both in cash and in kind for the youngsters, and then reported the
story to higher authorities.
</P>
<P>
After investigating the situation in the village, the Central
Committee of the Communist Youth League of China came to the aid
of the children.
</P>
<P>
A report was also sent to the central government, explaining
the situation of Zhang Shengli and millions of other children in
poor areas around the country who cannot continue their
studies. Chinese leaders were deeply concerned by the report.
</P>
<P>
On October 30, 1989, the China Youth Development foundation was
established in Beijing, and in turn started a movement called
Project Hope the same year to help children in poor areas go to
school and at the same time improve the primary education system
in those areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
The project has received donations from hundreds of millions of
people, including state leaders, celebrities, enterpreneurs,
government officials, workers and students.
</P>
<P>
Late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping took the initiative to donate
to the project, and through the years other Party and government
officials have taken substantial action to support the effort.
</P>
<P>
In its first year, Project Hope received more than 100 million
yuan (about 12 million US dollars) from all over the country.
</P>
<P>
International organizations and overseas circles also
contributed. A "Hope primary school," the first of its kind in
China, which was sponsored by a United Nation organization, was
built in a village of Fengning county in Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
To date, the project has received 130 million yuan (15.7
million US dollars) in gifts from overseas Chinese, foreign
enterprises and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The project has collected 980 million yuan (118 million US
dollars) over the past eight years, set up more than 3,600 Hope
primary schools and helped more than 1.5 million children.
</P>
<P>
About 60 million yuan (about 7.2 million US dollars) was
collected from Hebei Province, where the program originated, and
163 primary schools have been built there, with 68,000 children
returning to school.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Shengli, the first child to benefit from the project, has
been helped through primary and middle schools by the program's
foundations at various levels. He has already been enrolled in a
teacher's college in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"I will return to my village to teach, and try to help my
fellow villagers out of poverty," Zhang said.

<P>
China has set a national policy to popularize nine-year
compulsory education, including six years of primary school and
three years of middle school education.
</P>
<P>
Project Hope is a supplement to government-funded education,
which gives new opportunities to the poor rural areas, especially
those remote residential places inhabited by ethnic minorities,
where funds for education are limited.
</P>
<P>
The project has concentrated on eight poverty-stricken counties
in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, one of the country's poorest
areas, and helped 23,000 school dropouts there.
</P>
<P>
Small libraries have been established in 240 primary schools,
using donation from across the country.
</P>
<P>
China has combined Project Hope with the Spring Bud Project,
which was sponsored by the Children's Foundation of China to help
female school dropouts.
</P>
<P>
In east China's Zhejiang Province, about 80,000 people have
made financial contributions to both projects, and more than
60,000 school dropouts in the province have been aided.
</P>
<P>
The enrollment rates of girls of primary and middle school age
have been kept above 99.7 percent and 89.5 percent respectively in
the province, while the overall enrollment rate of children for
the nine-year-education plan rises steadily every year.
</P>
<P>
Project Hope has already begun its last round of nationwide
fund-raising, said Xu Yongguang, general-secretary of the China
Youth Development Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The program plans to raise 500 million yuan (about 60 million
US dollars), help 300,000 dropouts, and build 1,000 Hope primary
schools within one year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Construction Bank of China began receiving money for the
project from all around the country on June 1. The German
Volkswagen Group has given one million yuan (about 120,000 US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Xu said that Project Hope will end by the year 2000, when China
expects to eliminate poverty and significantly reduce the number
of school dropouts.

<HEADLINE> HK's Fund Sales Approaches 700 Million U.S. Dollars in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Gross sales of Hong Kong's
unit trust industry soared to a record high of 699.64 million
U.S. dollars in April, a report of the Hong Kong Investment Funds
Association (HKIFA) said today.
</P>
<P>
It said that the industry continued for the fourth consecutive
month to register strong inflows.
</P>
<P>
In April, net sales reached 258.01 million dollars, leaving the
 industry with an aggregate net inflows of 924.74 million dollars
for this year, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the sales trend, Andrew Lo, chairman of the
HKIFA, said: "If one analyses the sales figures, one would notice
that the strong sales volume recorded in the past few months were
mainly related to two sectors: Hong Kong equity funds and Single
Asian countries (excluding Hong Kong and Japan) funds."
</P>
<P>
As to why both sectors had been so popular despite some
volatility in the markets in the past months, he said: "For Hong
Kong equity funds, a key reason is probably because investors are
positive on the outlook of both the China and Hong Kong economy as
 well as the local property market, especially as the investment
sentiment in the run-up to the handover has been positive."
</P>
<P>
This has been fueled by the fervor in "red-chips," which has
possibly increased investors interest in both Hong Kong funds and
the Chinese mainland's funds, Lo added.

<P>
TEHRAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran has decided to offer free
consultations to citizens who worry that they might have
contracted the AIDS disease, a local report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Akhbar reported that the free-of-charge
service will be provided by Iran's Blood Transfusion Organization
(IBTO) in a bid to reduce the anxiety among the Iranians.
</P>
<P>
Director of the IBTO Jahangir Ahmadi said that the service was
offered to all, and no blood donation was requested in return at
the IBTO headquarters.
</P>
<P>
"It does not matter if they do not want to offer blood. The
people can take advantage of the guidance provided by the
centers established by IBTO," he said.
</P>
<P>
The health official here claimed that Iran has the lowest
number of AIDS patients in the world.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of AIDS cases are not regularly
disclosed. The latest official figure on AIDS cases in Iran is
some 260 AIDS patients in the country.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Ali Reza Marandi was quoted by another Persian
daily Salam as saying last December that 122 of the Iranian
AIDS victims have died.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 260 AIDS patients who are living in Iran, 233 are
male and 27 are female, added the minister.
</P>
<P>
The discussion of the AIDS is usually hushed in Iran's mass
media. The government-controlled radio and TV stations rarely
touch upon the issue.

<HEADLINE> Prince: Jordan to Continue Aid to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Jordan will continue to contribute
a major part of its annual budget to support the programs for the
Palestinians living in 13 refugee camps in Jordan, Jordanian
Crown Prince Hassan said here today.
</P>
<P>
The crown prince made the remarks while addressing a conference
of the donor countries to the United Nations Relief and Work
Agency (UNRWA), which is aimed at calling on more help to the
U.N. agency to overcome its current financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Jordan spent 300 million U.S. dollars annually on the
Palestinian refugees, including rents for camp sites, the cost of
education for Palestinian students at government schools,
improvements of camp facilities and the provision of medical care
in government schools, Hassan said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jordan has exerted its utmost effort to create a
stable environment for the Palestinians by offering them the
same civil liberties and political freedoms that all the
Jordanians enjoy, said Hassan to the donors.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, with some one-fourth of its 4 million-strong
population as of Palestinian origins, has been a firm support of
the UNRWA and stands for the Palestinians' request to restore
their sovereignty on their own soil.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's annual expenditure for the refugees in the UNRWA camps
in the country equals to 80 percent of the agency's estimated
annual budget of 360 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some one million Palestinians were made homeless during the
First Middle East War in 1948 when Israel annexed part of the
Palestinian land.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians then went to live in the refugee camps in
Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Praised for Growing Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Uganda developed its economy
despite its debt burden, a senior International Monetary Fund
(IMF) official said here yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Ulrike Wilson, Resident Representative of IMF in Uganda, told
a workshop organized by the Forum for Women Democracy (FOWODE)
that Uganda got debt burden relief.
</P>
<P>
"It was the first country to get relief at highly
concessionaire 'Naples' terms from the Paris Club. It is also the
first to get HIPC (highly indebted poor countries) debt relief,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Despite Uganda's debts are increasing in sum, its debt ratio
is decreasing from 100 percent in 1990/1991 financial year to 56
percent in 1995/1996 financial year due to the rapid growth in
gross domestic product, she noted.
</P>
<P>
According to "the New Vision" today, the workshop was
sponsored by Friedrich Ebert Foundation and the Danish
International Development Agency.

<HEADLINE> China Maps out Plan for Asset Evaluation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- China will set up a unified policy
and legal system for asset evaluation before the end of this
century, a senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000),
China will establish a unified sectoral self-discipline system, a
unified system for asset evaluation methods and standards, and a
unified research, education and training system for asset
evaluation, Zhang Youcai, Chinese Vice-Minister of Finance said at
the opening of a symposium on international appraisal standards
today.
</P>
<P>
As China develops a market economy, asset evaluation has become
an important channel for protecting the rights and interests of
asset owners and operators, said Zhang, who is also
director-general of the State Administration of State Property.
</P>
<P>
Asset evaluation is also playing an increasingly big role in
optimizing the distribution of resources and improving the
economic structure, he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to existing Chinese laws and regulations, state
assets must be appraised in economic activities such as setting up
Sino-overseas joint or cooperative ventures, asset auctions and
transfers, and enterprise mergers, bankruptcies and alliances.
</P>
<P>
The latest official statistics show that since China began to
evaluate assets in 1989, assets worth more than 2,202 billion yuan
(about 265.3 billion US dollars) in book value have been
appraised. As a result, the appreciated asset value has increased
by more than one trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Asset evaluation in China first started in the state sector and
in recent years it has rapidly spread to non-state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Official record also shows that China had more than 3,300 asset
evaluation agencies by the end of last year and more than 50,000
professional appraisers.
</P>
<P>
Since the China Asset Evaluation Association was founded in
December 1993, grassroots associations have been set up in 23
provinces and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The symposium drew hundreds of officials and experts from
related Chinese government departments, the International
Valuation Standards Committee and countries and regions including
the United States, France, Australia, Denmark and Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Hong Kong's Oldest Business Club Aims at Close Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will step into a new
era with good prospects after the changeover on July 1, said the
newly-appointed director of Hong Kong's leading chamber of
commerce.
</P>
<P>
"Now a smooth transition in Hong Kong is out of question, and
I'm optimistic about the future of Hong Kong," said Dr. Eden Woon,
the first director of Chinese origin sitting in the 136-year-old
Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce (HKGCC).
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will continue to be a good middle man between foreign
investors who want to do business with China's inland areas which
need great resources ranging from capital to expertise, according
to Woon, who just returned from the United States to assume the
post in the HKGCC.
</P>
<P>
Woon and his family left Hong Kong more than 30 decades ago to
emigrate to the United States. Before he came back, he had been
engaged in promoting trade between China's inland areas, Hong Kong
and the United States for five years.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, he said he believed that Hong Kong
would play a even bigger role of a money machine to channel
foreign investment into China's inland areas to fuel one of the
world's fastest growing economy. Currently, more than 60 percent
of overseas investment in China's inland areas comes from Hong
Kong. A sound legal system, good infrastructure facilities and
high-quality personnel sharpen the competitive edge of Hong Kong,
added Woon.
</P>
<P>
After July 1, the top priority of the chamber is to explain to
foreign investors that Hong Kong is still the best spring pad to
jump into the huge market in China's inland areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We'll tell them that Hong Kong's position as a trade and
financial hub will remain unchanged after the handover," said
Woon.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he wanted to inject fresh blood into its
4,000-member chamber of commerce. His target is at those
China-backed companies, which are registered and operating in Hong
Kong, and which act as investment vehicles of the central and
local governments.
</P>
<P>
Now only 150 China-backed companies have joined the chamber,
which is the largest and most populous business club in Hong
Kong. At present, multinational companies account for 30 percent
of the total number of the affiliated members and local companies
make up two thirds.
</P>
<P>
Woon hoped to attract more China-backed companies, which are
emerging as one of the heavy players in Hong Kong's free economy.
</P>
<P>
As a further step, Woon wanted to strengthen ties between
members of the HKGCC and enterprises in China's inland areas.

<HEADLINE> Major Reshuffle Expected in Nigerian Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A major reorganization of Nigeria's
cabinet, the Federal Executive Council, is expected before the end of
this year, the Nigerian Tribune reported today.
</P>
<P>
At least two-thirds of the federal ministers will be appointed from
the Vision 2010 Committee, Nigeria's first ever organization launched
by the government to sketch national long-term socio-economic
development strategies.
</P>
<P>
The 197-member committee, comprising some ministers, experts from
all circles and religious leaders, is expected to submit its final
report to the head of state, General Sani Abacha by September this
year, according to the local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Quoting government sources, the report said the new
ministers, whose identities will be made public by General Abacha in
his October 1 independence anniversary broadcast to the nation, would
be selected across the 13 sub-committee of Vision 2010.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that this is the first public report of the
speculated reshuffle which has long been spreading among diplomatic,
business and journalist circles.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Vision 2010 Chairman Chief Ernest
Shonekan, an economist and once temporary head of state, is said to be
currently consulting with members of his committee so as to present a
credible list of the new ministers to General Abacha.
</P>
<P>
He is reported to be insisting on pure merit, instead of the usual
lobbying, to enhance high productivity. However, his conviction, based
on which the selection is to be made, is subject to ratification of the
head of state.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Balkan Foreign Ministers Agree to Have Annual Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers participating in
the Thessaloniki conference decided Monday to establish an annual
meeting on a rotational basis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the conclusion of the first day of the conference,
Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos announced that they had
agreed to hold their next meeting in Turkey next year, in 1999 in
Romania and in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) in
2000.
</P>
<P>
They had also decided to propose an informal meeting of Balkan
leaders to take place annually, starting with Greece at the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also agreed that such meetings should also be held
by the ministries of national defense, public order and commerce
from Balkan countries.
</P>
<P>
The proposals raised by the ministers also include a crisis
prevention and management center in Sofia, Bulgaria, and a mutual-
assistance fund for aid and development.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos said that Balkan cooperation had entered a new era.
</P>
<P>
"Up to now, there were ideas and meetings that had an uncertain
outcome. Today we succeeded in establishing Balkan cooperation as a
perspective for the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Balkan people should be able to discuss
their problems on their own, "without foreign intervention."
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference of Balkan foreign ministers is to end
today with a joint statement.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Progress in Asset Evaluation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- China has made significant
progress in asset evaluation since it was initiated eight years
ago, a senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese evaluators appraised assets worth more than 2,202
billion yuan (about 265.3 billion US dollars) in book value
between 1989 and last year. The post-evaluation value of the
appraised assets reached 3,241 billion yuan, over one trillion
yuan more than the book value.
</P>
<P>
Asset evaluation has become an inseparable part of China's
socialist market economy, Pan Yue, deputy director of the State
Administration of State Property (SASP), told a symposium on
international appraisal standards.
</P>
<P>
Through asset evaluation, the State's rights and interest as
asset owner have been safeguarded, he told the symposium, which
was co-sponsored by the China Asset Evaluation Association, the
United Nations Development Program and the China International
Center for Economic and Technological Exchanges of the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to existing Chinese laws and regulations, state
assets must be appraised for economic activities such as setting
up Sino-overseas joint or cooperative ventures, asset auctions and
transfers, and enterprise mergers, bankruptcies and alliances.
</P>
<P>
Asset evaluation in China first started in the state sector and
in recent years it has rapidly spread to non-state firms. Official
statistics show that the non-state sector accounted for more than
a quarter of the combined value of assets appraised last year.
</P>
<P>
Officials and experts participating in the symposium, including
those from the United States, France, Australia, Denmark and Hong
Kong, noted that asset evaluation has become a rudimentary
instrument for China to optimize the distribution of resources and
promote economic reorganization.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, China had more than 3,300 asset
evaluation agencies and over 50,000 professional
appraisers.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Computer Expert Hopeful About Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Software production could become a
major earner for Zambia if fully exploited, a Zambian computer expert
has said.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia today quoted the expert, Jeremiah Phiri, as
saying in Kitwe, northern Zambia, at the weekend that the
computer software production is a potential money spinner because
it requires very little material inputs.
</P>
<P>
"All you need is a computer and diskettes and a brain, then you can
produce your software," Phiri said.
</P>
<P>
He said the market is readily available in the country as 60
percent of companies are using computers.
</P>
<P>
At present few local companies produce software and most firms
only sold computers, he said.
</P>
<P>
People face problems because they prefer to import software, some
of which is of inferior quality, said the computer expert.
</P>
<P>
"Because the software is from developed countries, people think it
is always of high quality. Some of the software packages have been
rejected in developed countries and are just dumped in Africa where
people accept anything," Phiri said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- While 14 other European Union (EU) countries agreed on Monday
that a pact of budgetary stability should be signed one week later
at the Amsterdam EU summit, France asked for a delay of the signing
of the pact. French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin wishes to add
clauses on employment and economic coordination to the text of the
pact, which is aimed at punishing those countries which have
excessive budgetary deficit after the launching of the European
single currency.
</P>
<P>
-- Attending Monday for the first time the EU finance ministers'
meeting in Luxembourg, the new French Finance Minister Dominique
Strauss-Kahn Monday played the difficult role of showing the change
of attitude of the French government over the European single
currency while not creating a crisis in Europe. He said that while
France does not call for a renegotiation of the budgetary stability
pact on European single currency, it cannot accept the present text
of the pact either and wants to discuss it again with other European
countries.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- During his first ``sortie'' to the Economic and Financial
Council of the 15 EU countries, new French Finance Minister
Dominique Strauss-Kahn made the first coup of restraint of the
Socialist government on European integration by calling for ``time
of reflexion'' on the monetary stability pact for European single
currency. This action will no doubt block the EU Amsterdam summit
to be held on June 16-17 from adopting the text of the pact.
</P>
<P>
-- Apart from the European single currency, the new French
government is expected to make public its attitudes on several other
key issues, including the raise of the guaranteed minimum wage, or
the SMIC, the reduction of the 20.6 percent added value tax, and the
dispute over the closing by the Renault automaker of the Vilvoorde
car assembly plant in Belgium.

job ads came out," Austock Brokers' David Perry said.
</P>
<P>
The ANZ Bank job ads series, which fell 7.3 percent in May but
was 8.6 percent higher in the three months ended May, had a

bond yields and the Reserve Bank of Australia's decision to lower
the prime assets requirement for banks to three percent from six
percent.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index closed 50.5 points, or 1.24 percent,

BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- China and Oman should establish
long-term and stable cooperative relations, Vice-President Rong

Shihab Al-Said, a special representative of Oman's Sultan Qabus
Bin Said.
</P>
<P>
Saying that China treasures its friendship and cooperation with
Oman, Rong said the two countries should jointly explore new
cooperative paths which can meet the demand of the times and cater
to the conditions and development of the two countries. They
should also expand bilateral economic cooperation in economy,
trade, petroleum, metallurgy, agriculture, fishery and water
conservancy.
</P>
<P>
In his welcome to the Omani guest, Rong said that Thuwainy's
current visit to China is very important as it offers the

cooperation, he noted.

<P>
Oman has played a positive role in promoting the unity among
Arab states and working toward peace and stability in the Gulf
Region, added Rong.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his appreciation for the warm reception he received
during this visit, Thuwainy said that the sincere welcome has
revealed the depth of the friendship the Chinese government and
people have for the Omani government and people.
</P>
<P>
Thuwainy said that Oman, under the leadership of Sultan Qabus,
is concentrating on the country's economic development -- just as
China is doing.

<P>
He noted that his country places great emphasis on its ties
with China, hoping to further bilateral friendship and cooperation
in various fields including politics, economy and technology, and

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Commence Fencing Around Mt. Kenya Forest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is
scheduled to commence an electric fence program around the Mt.
Kenya and Aberdare forests next month to reduce the conflict
between human beings and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a three-day Partnership Stakeholders Workshop held
in Nyeri, about 160 kilometers north of Nairobi, Central
Provincial Commissioner Wilson Chepkwony said yesterday that the
program was estimated to cost over 17 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
He told the on-going workshop, which brought all mountain
region stakeholders together, that the fencing of 80 kilometers
around the Aberdare Forest had already started and the program
was expected to cover some 370 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan official was quoted by the local paper East African
Standard today as noting that the conflict between the human
beings and wildlife must be reduced at all costs because both are
important to the economy of the country.
</P>

<HEADLINE> COMESA Remains Main Market for Zambia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 10 (Xinhua)-- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) has continued to be Zambia's biggest
market for its non-traditional exports (NTES), absorbing 88.2
million U.S. Dollars of its total NTES exports in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The 88.2 million Dollars represents 36.3 percent of Zambia's
total NTES valuing 242 million Dollars in 1996, according to the
latest exporter audit.
</P>
<P>
Although COMESA still accounts for Zambia's largest market,
manufacturers and other exporters are still finding it difficult
to increase exports to this market due to non-tariff and tariff
barriers.
</P>
<P>
The European Union remains Zambia's second largest market for
NTES that accounted for 73 million Dollars, representing 30.1
percent of the total NTES, with Britain being Zambia's largest
market in the EU.
</P>
<P>
The Far East accounted for 31.6 million Dollars, the third
largest export market for Zambia's NTES.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, equally emerging as crucial market with a
shorter distance, accounted for about 28.5 million Dollars of
NTES with products exported there including scrap metal, cotton,
soya beans, gemstones, tobacco, and calcium carbide.

<HEADLINE> Xu Fu Story Still Hot for Japanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A group of Japanese in May
investigated a site said to be the port from which an ancient
Chinese Taoist began his journey to Japan 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Members of the group belong to a society that studies Xu Fu,
who was sent by emperor Qinshihuang, the first man to unite China,
to seek longevity methods in the Pacific Ocean. But Xu finally
arrived on an island which was part of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Xu has been a hero in Japan for thousands of years as he took
with him advanced Chinese culture. Modern study shows that it was
Xu who helped Japan move into a mature agricultural society.
</P>
<P>
Xu's story becomes hot again this year when China and Japan are
celebrating the 20th anniversary of the normalization of relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
But there is a mystery as where was the actual port at which Xu
and his 3,000 followers aboard the ships.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese visitors believed that the historical site was
located in Cixi city in Zhejiang province. The finding was first
made by a Chinese geologist who is also a Xu Fu expert. However,
it is still being debated.

<HEADLINE> Chinese NPC Chairman Meets Macedonian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese
National People's Congress (NPC), made the remarks at a meeting
with President Gligorov in the Great Hall of the People here today.
</P>
<P>
Qiao welcomed Gligorov on behalf of the NPC and himself. He
said China and Macedonia are friendly countries and the two
peoples have a traditional friendship. He said he was deeply
impressed by the kindly sentiments of the Macedonians towards the
Chinese during his visit to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
In the period since Macedonia obtained its independence in
1991, there has been new progress in Sino-Macedonian cordial and
cooperative relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
China respects the choices of the Macedonian people, attaches
importance to the bilateral relations, and wishes to expand and
develop the friendly exchanges and mutually beneficial cooperation
in political, economic, scientific and technological and cultural
fields, Qiao said. This should be carried out in line with the
principles of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit and
non-interference in each other's internal affairs, he added.
</P>
<P>
President Gligorov said the long-term ties of friendship
between Macedonia and China are illustrated by the lack of
questions and obstacles between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia held that the road of development China has chosen
conforms entirely to China's conditions, and the Macedonian people
are concerned about its economic development and the building up
of its legal system while appreciating China's economic
achievements, he said.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia is interested in developing its friendly and
cooperative relations with China, including economic relations and
trade, President Gligorov emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said China's NPC is attentive to its relations with the
Assembly of Macedonia, and the ties constitute an important part
of the Sino-Macedonian relations as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The increase of the exchanges between the two parliaments will
be conducive to the deepening of bilateral friendship between the
two peoples and help to promote the sustained, steady and
all-round cooperation, Qiao noted.
</P>
<P>
He also promised that the NPC will work jointly with the
Macedonian Assembly, through various forms of exchange and
cooperation, to help push ahead bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Qiao briefed the Macedonian president on China's economic
development targets and the NPC's work. He also asked the
President to convey his regards to President Tito Petkovski of the

<HEADLINE> Philippines, Singapore to Enhance Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines and Singapore today
agreed to set up a Philippine-Singapore Action Plan to enhance
bilateral cooperation in the economic, diplomatic, cultural and
other areas.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Fidel Ramos proposed the plan in his
one-hour meeting with visiting Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong, according to a news release from the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
The proposed plan will include cooperation in the areas of
information technology, education, human resource development,
science and technology and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Details of the action plan, which will serve as a blueprint for
bilateral cooperation, will be tackled by concerned Filipino and
Singaporean officials soon after Goh's three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Both Ramos and Goh agreed to meet again next month during the
30th anniversary of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in
Kuala Lumpur to review the progress in the formulation of the
action plan.
</P>
<P>
After their meeting, the two leaders also witnessed the signing
of a memorandum of understanding on cultural cooperation between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference after the meeting, they said the
"turbulence" in Philippine-Singapore relations is "finally over"
and pledged to elevate their partnership to greater heights of
cooperation and mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the Philippines and Singapore were strained
in March 1995 after the execution of Flor Contemplacion, a
Filipino domestic helper who was found guilty of murder by a
Singapore court.
</P>
<P>
Goh assured the Philippine public at the press conference that
Singapore will protect Filipino workers under Singapore laws and
will treat them "fairly and squarely."
</P>
<P>
Singapore is the Philippines' third largest trading partner
after the United States and Japan, getting 5.6 percent of the
country's total export.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade between the two countries surged from 803.17
million U.S. dollars in 1992 to 2.96 billion dollars last year.

disasters, which greatly affect local people's normal life and
production operations, the local source said.
</P>
<P>
Lacking funds, the victims are often incapable of conducting
self-salvation.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has ordered that, starting this year,
all localities must list flood control funds within their budgets,
and no less than 500,000 yuan for prefectures (cities) and at
least 200,000 yuan for counties (districts) should be allocated.
</P>
<P>
And the flood control funds will be further expanded in the
coming years to take 3 to 5 percent of a locality's financial
revenue.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May this year, some 9 prefectures (cities) and 72
counties (districts) have worked out policies governing
administration and utilization of the flood control funds.

<HEADLINE> Central, Local Governments Cooperate in Sending Scholars Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Cooperation between the China
Scholarship Council (CSC) and local governments has brought in
three million yuan (about 360,000 U.S. dollars) to sponsor
scholars for overseas studies or academic exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The CSC, a designated institution handling affairs related to
international studies on behalf of the State Education Commission
(SEC), has announced its first cooperation contracts with Hebei
and Liaoning provinces in sending scholars abroad.
</P>
<P>
According to the contracts that CSC signed with the two
provinces this week, CSC and the local governments will join hands
in aiding scholars abroad financially to help with local economic
and scientific advancement.
</P>
<P>
The local governments promised to pay half of a scholar's
expenses abroad, which used to be paid fully by the CSC.
</P>
<P>
Applicants from the two provinces will also have to sign a
contract with CSC and deposit a sum of honest money in an
appointed bank before they leave for abroad.
</P>
<P>
CSC sources said that such cooperation marked a new step in
China's reform on sending scholars abroad.
</P>
<P>
China started to reform its way of sending scholars abroad in
April, 1996 by making competition for international studies open
and welcoming individual applications. The reform also asks those
who go abroad at state expenses to sign an agreement with CSC,
pledging to return after completing their overseas studies.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that approximately 270,000 Chinese went
abroad for advanced training over the past 18 years. Over 120,000
of them were sponsored by the State or their work units, with the
remainder self-supporting.
</P>
<P>
Some 90,000 of these people have completed their overseas
studies and returned.

<P>
NANJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu province is
stepping up efforts to ensure that 385 enterprises in the Huaihe
River valley meet the State-set standards in industrial pollutant
discharge.
</P>
<P>
The Huaihe River valley covers an area of 66,800 sq km, with a

To curb deteriorating pollution, the provincial government has
worked out a program, targeting at controling the pollutant
discharge volume below the 1992 level.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, the province banned and closed down 343
small enterprises with serious pollution problems last year.
</P>
<P>
To reinforce the move, the provincial government has demanded
another 385 enterprises nearby the river to meet the standards in
pollutant discharge within the prescribed time.
</P>
<P>
The province will still put in 20 million yuan this year for
the purpose of preventing and treating river pollution.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Return Historically Significant: Peruvian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's return to China on
July 1 this year is of historical significance of the mankind,
Peruvian Congress President Victor Joyway Rojas said here.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong enables China to resume the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong, which has been part of China's
territory in history and by law, Rojas said recently in an
interview with Chinese reporters.
</P>
<P>
The return also puts an end to colonist rule in the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the principle of "one country, two systems,"
China keeps the economic system in Hong Kong unchanged, the top
legislator noted, and ensures that Hong Kong will enjoy extensive
autonomy in economy and culture after the return. Thus it can be
expected that the economy and culture of Hong Kong will continue
its normal development in the future, he added.
</P>
<P>
Rojas said that Peru and the People's Republic of China have
enjoyed good relations in economy and trade, finance, culture and
international cooperation, and on international issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
"These bilateral relations are in their best period, and we are
willing to continue strengthening them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rojas, an ethnic Chinese born in Peru, said that as a Chinese
descendent and a friend of the Chinese people, he is especially
concerned with the development of China and happy over Hong Kong's
return.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman on Interim Report of Japanese-US Defense Cooperation Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- China hopes that Japan would,
drawing lessons from history, act with prudence and keep to the
path of peaceful development.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Cui Tiankai made the remark here
today at a routine press conference when asked to confirm on the
report that Japan recently sent officials to China to brief the
Chinese side on the interim report issued by Japan and the United
States on revision of the Japanese-US defence cooperation
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Cui said the Japanese side emphasized that the rights and
obligations of Japan and the United States which were laid down in
the Japanese-US Security Treaty and some relevant agreements as
well as the basic framework of the Japan-US alliance would remain
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Japan would take all its actions within the restrictive
confines of the Japanese Constitution and in keeping with the
basic guidelines of its carrying out defence limited to its own
territory and coastal waters and observing the three nuclear-free
principles etc, and Japan and the US would take their bilateral
actions in accordance with the UN Charter and norms of
international law, Cui noted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side reiterated its basic position and views
regarding the Japanese-US security cooperation and pointed out
that the Japan-US security alliance was a bilateral arrangement
which was formed during the Cold War times, Cui said, adding that
with the collapse of the pattern of the Cold War, such an
arrangement should especially not go beyond its bilateral
framework, in order not to arouse disquiet among neighboring
states in the Asia-Pacific region and bring about added
complication to the security situation in this region.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side also noted that due to historical reasons in
particular, the orientation of Japan's security policy was always
a matter highly sensitive to its Asian neighbors, Cui said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenyans face the risk of
contracting sleeping sickness, which is said to have re-emerged
in its neighbors, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The disease is on the rise in southern Sudan, northern Uganda
and parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo (former Zaire),
Michaleen Richer, an officer with the International Medical
Corps, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If not checked, it will soon re-emerge in the northern parts
of Kenya" as tsetse flies, which spread the disease, know no
boundaries, she warned, adding that the prevalence rate in
southern Sudan has reached 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Every year, a quarter million of the African population die
of sleeping sickness", which causes irreversible brain damage.
Most of them die mainly due to lack of early diagnosis, she said.
</P>
<P>
She called for joint efforts by the government and related
non-governmental organizations to preempt the re-emergence of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
"The control program requires an active mobile team going out
every year to screen the public so that anybody with the disease
can get treatment at the right time," she said.
</P>
<P>
Only two cases of sleeping sickness have been reported in
Kenya since December 1995. enditem

<HEADLINE> Northwest China's Ancient Caverns Becoming Popular Tourist Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The ancient caverns created
millions of years ago in Benxi of northwest China's Liaoning
Province have now become a popular tourist site.
</P>
<P>
The caverns consist of a water cavern, and a dry cave with a
length of 280 m.
</P>
<P>
The water cavern, with an area of 36,000 sq m and a
3,000-m-long underground river, is a super limestone karst cave
formed several millions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
The water flow in the cavern is two to seven meters deep,
through unique formations of stalactite and stalagmite and
surrounding walls. A wide gate of the water cavern is situated on
the bank of a local river, where archaeological findings proved
the existence of human activities some 4,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The cavern region has so far attracted more than 6.5 million
tourists from 119 countries and regions since it was developed
into a tourist site in the mid-1980s, according to local sources.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan province
has closed 1,575 factories with serious pollution problems --
nearly 81 percent of those ordered to be shut down by the state.
</P>
<P>
The province's environmental report said that Yunnan has 1,951
polluters that should be closed. These factories mainly use
backward production methods and their discharge of pollutants is
far above the country's standards.
</P>
<P>
They have seriously polluted water and soil, and endangered
people's lives, officials said.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid development of the province's industries and
cities, the pollution problems have also become more
serious. Dianchi Lake has become the most polluted lake in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has decided to spend nearly 1.5
percent of its gross natioanl product every year on
pollution control, and to spent a total of 3.5 billion yuan (about
437 million US dollars) during the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
The province spent 590 million yuan on environmental protection
last year, or about 0.4 percent of its GNP.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho's New Party Controls Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho Prime Minister Ntsu
Mokhehle yesterday declared a handover of government to his newly-
formed political party from the long-ruling Basutholand Congres
Party (BCP).
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle made the announcement in a statement issued in
Maseru, capital of the mountain kingdom in southern Africa,
according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle said his new Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) had
taken over the resigns of power from the BCP, and controlled a
majority of parliament with the support of 41 of the 64 parliament
members.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle's cabinet ministers would all remain the same, having
made the jump to the new party along with their leader.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho Foreign Minister Albert Maope, a new member of the LCD
government, said the country's constitution allowed members of
parliament to "align themselves with any other political movement
parliament".
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the BCP, which tried to expel Mokhehle as
its leader in March, condemned the move as a "coup d'etat", adding
that the prime minister showed disrespect for the people who
elected him.
</P>
<P>
Some extra-parliament parties, including the Basutho National
Party and the National Progressive Party, also condemned the
move, which they termed unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
The two parties said they would consider protest action against the
government.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho's supreme court had ordered the BCP to elect a new leader
at its annual congress at the end of July, after several senior members
attempted unsuccessfully to oust Mokhehle earlier this year.

<P>
XIAMEN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Express train service from Beijing
to Xiamen, a port city in east China's Fujian Province, will be
started in early 1998 during traditional Spring Festival season.
</P>
<P>
There is currently no through-train service from Beijing to
Xiamen or vice versa, and people travelling to both cities have to
change trains in order to reach their destinations.
</P>
<P>
Before this new route opens, express train service from Beijing
to Xiamen will be available July 1 through August 31, both to gain
experience for the express train service and to lighten the
summertime passenger overload caused mainly by college students
going home for summer holiday, according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
The first train service leaves from the Beijing Railway Station
at 00:46 hours of July 1, arrives at the Jinan Railway Station in
Shandong Province at 8:29 AM the next morning and reaches the
final stop of Xiamen, 39 hours and 26 minutes later.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Over 100 foreign and Taiwan-funded
enterprises were recently commended by the Tianjin municipal
government for their outstanding business performances.
</P>
<P>
Among the 137 firms cited are the U.S.'s Motorola, Otis,
Japan's Honda, France's Merlin Gerin, and a Taiwanese fast food
business.
</P>
<P>
They now rank among China's leading enterprises. Motorola alone
made 350 million US dollars in profit in China last year, and the
figure is expected to exceed 500 million US dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
"Overseas-financed enterprises have become one of the major
driving forces in promoting Tianjin's economic growth. They have
contributed greatly to the improved urban infrastructure and the
double-digit increase over the past four years," said Tianjin
Mayor Zhang Lichang.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin had approved 10,800 overseas-funded ventures by the end
of April, with total contractual investment worth 16.8 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Overseas enterprises produced nearly half the city's industrial
output last year, making up 70 percent of the total profits and 34
percent of the taxes. And they account for more than half of the
city's total exports.

<HEADLINE> Israel Negotiates Billion-Dollars Of Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli defense firms are
negotiating some 10.5 billion U.S.dollars worth of contracts with
foreign clients and expect more than half to be signed by the
year 2000, The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The pro-government English daily quoted Ilan Biran, Defense
Ministry director-general as saying that more than 60 percent of
the contracts are being negotiated with clients from the Far East
and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Ilan Biran said at a news conference in Tel Aviv Monday that in
1996 Israel signed contracts that totaled 2 billion dollars, and
this year, it has so far concluded more than 1 billion dollars in
contracts.
</P>
<P>
Currently the second most active area is Western Europe,
where Israeli firms are negotiating nearly 1.4 billion dollars
of contract, according to the source.
</P>
<P>
The potential lies more in Eastern Europe, where officials
expect to win contracts of 1.47 billion dollars by the year
2000. North America is expected to collect close to 700 million
dollars in defense contracts within the next two to three years.
</P>
<P>
Biran said that he hopes the Israeli defense firms will
cooperate with each other abroad and embark on joint marketing
and manufacturing ventures. This, he said, would eliminate
inefficiency and needless competitions.
</P>
<P>
Military sales are a major foreign currency earner for
Israel. The country's large defense industry has suffered much
in recent years, due to a fierce competition at the shrinking
post-cold war market.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Starting from Yingkou, in
northeast China's Liaoning Province, a container ocean shipping
route has opened in the country.
</P>
<P>
The itinerary begins at Yingkou's Bayuquan New Port, goes via
Shanghai, Huangpu, Shekou, and reaches Xiamen; and then returns to
Shanghai, via Qingdao, and arrives at Bayuquan.
</P>
<P>
There are three voyages on the route every month, reaching
Bayuquan port on the 5th, 15th, and 25th of a month, and starting
another voyage the next day.
</P>
<P>
For a long time, the country's coastal areas had no domestic
container shipping services. The new route, opened by the China
Ocean Shipping (Group) Company, has linked all major sea ports in
north and south China, as well as a number of inland cities.
</P>
<P>
Port authorities say that the effort will speed up the
circulation of materials between the northern and southern parts
of the country, and promote economic expansion of northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Bayuquan is a new port in Yingkou. Work on the port was
completed by 1984. The port handled nearly 15 million tons of
cargo last year.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Politicians to Be Probed for Connection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Several Israeli cabinet
ministers and members of the Knesset (Israel's parliament)
are to be interrogated by Israeli police for their suspected
connection to a reputed Russian Mafia boss.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported today that eight leading figures from
the Likud, Labor Party and Yisrael Ba'aliya would be questioned
by police.
</P>
<P>
Zvi Ben-Ari, believed by police as one of the most powerful
and dangerous heads of the Russian Mafia, was arrested on May 12
on suspicion that he defrauded Russian banks of 85 million
U.S. dollars and was involved in the murders of two prominent
critics of the Russian Mafia.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police said that Ben-Ari, formerly known as Gregory
Lerner, immigrated to Israel in 1989, was detained, along with
five aides, at Israel's Ben-Gurion Airport while allegedly
trying to flee the country.
</P>
<P>
The radio reported that the suspicions against Ben-Ari
have widened and police now suspect he tried to "take over" one
of the three political parties to win greater legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
However, police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin would not confirm
the report, saying that "the police will call any public
figure for investigation, if it is necessary."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ben-Ari was remanded for an additional 13 days
Monday by Petah Tikva Magistrate's Court near Tel Aviv. He has
already been in jail for 30 days.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ari, known for leading a flamboyant lifestyle in Ashkelon
in southwest Israel, was arrested in Switzerland in 1991 on the
request of Russian police on suspicion of extortion.
</P>
<P>
He was imprisoned and then released.

<P>
FUZHOU, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Privately-run enterprises and
individually-operated household firms in Fujian Province, east
China, have begun to join the government's effort to ease local
reemployment pressure by employing more workers laid off from
state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-five private enterprises and more than 20 individual
households in the provincial capital city of Fuzhou held a job
fair for laid-offs on 7 June, briefing employment information for
the applicants.
</P>
<P>
Around 3,000 laid-off workers visited the fair and some of them
were hired on the spot. "My company welcomes laid-off workers,
because they have specialized skills, a good sense of professional
integrity, and cherish new job opportunities," said manager Lin of
an automobile parts factory.
</P>
<P>
Lu Weiya, owner of a bakery, hired six laid-off women workers,
as she herself had been one of them. "The important thing is you
should still have confidence when you are displaced," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We mean to tell society by this fair that private enterprises
and individual households are willing to help the State get over
the difficulty," another provate owner said.
</P>
<P>
Laid-off workers have begun to get accustomed to the
unfavorable change in looking for jobs. "I have no other choices,
and would like to do any hard job if offered fair treatment," said
a laid-off worker.

<HEADLINE> Guizhou Attracts Overseas Funds for Road Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Transfer of road management rights
will soon become a widely accepted way of fund-raising in
southwestern Guizhou province, which is actively pooling money to
fulfil aits road building plans.
</P>
<P>
In its first try at pooling, the province earned nearly 300
million yuan from selling 30 percent of the management rights of
two high-grade roads to a Hong Kong bank.
</P>
<P>
"All the funds raised from the management rights transfer will
be put into new road building projects, and this makes it an
effective way of capital raising and will surely expedite
Guizhou's road construction greatly," said Lu Wanli, director of
the Provincial Communications Administration.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou is a mountainous province, and as much as 87 percent of
the province's transportation depends on the highways. However,
capital shortage remains a problem, since at least ten billion
yuan is needed to complete its road-building goals during the
Ninth Five Year Plan (1996--2000).
</P>
<P>
The province has opened its arms to overseas capital inflow in
a variety of ways, including BOT (Build-Operate-Transfer),
management rights transfer and overseas government loans. In its
regulations on overseas investment last year, the province grants
preferential treatments to foreign investors interested in
Guizhou's infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors have since shown increasing interest in the
province's road building projects and held negotiations on
cooperation with the province's communications authorities.

<HEADLINE> China to Ensure Power Supply for Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- By the year 2000, the average
annual power outage will be less than one hour for all big or
mid-sized Chinese cities, according to Lu Yanchang, vice minister
of the Power Industry.
</P>
<P>
The reliability rate of the power supply for major Chinese
cities has reached 99.3 percent, and is expected to hit 99.9
percent by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
Currently the major reason for China's unsustainable power
supply is the scarcity of power resources, which cannot meet the
fast-growing demand. The situation especially aggravates during peak
seasons of electricity use.
</P>
<P>
Also contributing to the problem are the regular check-ups and
poor management of the electricity network.
</P>
<P>
As many as 238 Chinese cities reported their average power
outage period had been shortened by 16.55 hours in 1995, marking a
great improvement in the power-supply situation, statistics from
the Ministry of Power Industry show.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Pilots and engineers in
Kuwait Airways Corporation (KAC) started a strike this morning
which is expected to last 24 hours to demand pay rise.
</P>
<P>
A source at the Kuwait International Airport said all the
flights of Kuwait Airways would be canceled today because of the
strike.
</P>
<P>
An emergency meeting for the general assembly of the Kuwait
Aircraft Engineers and Pilots Association unanimously decided
Monday to observe a 24-hour strike, the source said.
</P>
<P>
They were demanding pay rise and improvement in work
conditions. The decision was made after Kuwaiti government and
KAC abruptly withdrew an offer relating to their demand that
was agreed and accepted by the pilots a few day ago.
</P>
<P>
In a strike statement, the association declared that
beginning from Wednesday June 11, all outgoing KAC flights
will be delayed for one hour apart from a 24-hour strike
every Tuesday before their demands are met.
</P>
<P>
It also said the association would meet again on June 18
to decide on the future course of action if KAC insists on
rejecting their legitimate demands.
</P>
<P>
This decision will not apply on incoming flights, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
KAC's aircrafts fly to more than 30 destinations around the

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The telecom authorities in
Chongqing, China's fourth municipality after Beijing, Shanghai and
Tianjin, have mapped out a plan to speed up telecom construction
and turn the city into a telecommunications hub in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
"Chongqing has set the goal to build advanced, efficient and
safe telecom networks so as to meet the rapid social and economic
development in the city," said He Tingchang, director of the
Chongqing Telecommunication Administration.
</P>
<P>
According to He, by the year 2000, every 100 people in the
whole city share eight telephone sets while in the city proper 100
people have 52 sets. The number of mobile phone users is to
increase from the current 80,000 to 400,000 in 2000.
</P>
<P>
He believes this goal is attainable, as previous work in the
area has laid a solid foundation for future development.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing is now the key node of two state optical cables
linking southwest China with the country's central region.
</P>
<P>
Also, the city has opened direct telephone service with more
than 700 domestic cities and 180 countries and regions
worldwide. Its mobile telecom network has hooked up with China's
national nets.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Drops in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in Kenya declined to
2.4 percent last month from 4.0 and 2.8 percent in March and
April, the Daily Nation newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank Monthly Economic Review for this month said
the underlying month-on-month inflation also fell to 6.9 percent
in May from 7.3 percent in March in the eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
The underlying average annual inflation declined to 8.8
percent in May from 9.0 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
The continued decline in inflation that started in January has
been attributed to the monetary and fiscal policies that have
significantly slowed down the expansion of the money supply, said
the review.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in money supply expansion is partly due to
reduced government borrowing from the central bank, which fell to
3.7 million U.S. Dollars compared with 339 million Dollars during
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
This has eased the inflationary pressures that stem from
excess demand, said the review.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the strengthening of the Shilling exchange rate
throughout 1996 and early 1997 has helped reduce prices of the
imported inputs, said the report. enditem

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Cabinet Reshuffle Strengthens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga effected a cabinet reshuffle yesterday, making a
series of changes in the cabinet and increasing the number of
cabinet members from 23 to 30 in an effort to strengthen her
position.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here see these changes as a move by
Kumaratunga to strengthen the position of herself and that of the
main coalition partner, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), in her
Peoples' Alliance government by giving key portfolios to her
loyalists and loyalists of the SLFP. They also believe that it is
a move to clean up the government and close its ranks.
</P>
<P>
This may also be a forerunner to a possible snap election later
this year in the event of her political package, namely the
government's devolution proposals, being unable to obtain the
required two-thirds majority in the parliament. Loyalists in key
positions will be helpful in such an eventuality.
</P>
<P>
In bringing about these changes, Kumaratunga dismissed from the
cabinet the leader of another coalition partner, the New
Democratic United National Lalith Front (NDUNLF), Srimani
Athulathmudali, who held the portfolios of transport, environment
and women's affairs.
</P>
<P>
Athulathmudali refused to agree to her party contesting last
April's local government elections under the People's Alliance
banner and instead put up the Independent Groups, owing to
political views different from those of the president.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on the cabinet reshuffle, Athulathmudali accused
the People's Alliance of breaking another election pledge by
stripping her of her cabinet post. It violates the terms of an
agreement entered into by her party and the Peoples Alliance, she
charged.
</P>
<P>
She claimed that despite several constraints, she discharged
her duties as a minister with utmost responsibility. She added
that obstacles such as this does not block her party, instead they
will serve as a stepping stone to the future.
</P>
<P>
Among the surprise changes made by Kumaratunga was the removal
of the popular Dharmasiri Senanayake, the SLFP party secretary,
from the media portfolio. Senanayake however retains his post as
the aviation and tourism minister. He had proposed legislation to
set up a broadcasting authority which the Supreme Court ruled
against a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
Posts and Telecommunications Minister Mangala Samaraweera, a
close associate of the president, has obtained the additional
media portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga has also divested herself of some of the portfolios
she held. She keeps only the defense, finance and planning
portfolios and has given that of Buddha Sasana to Cultural and
Religious Affairs Minister Lakshman Jayakody. The portfolio of
plan implementation has gone to new entrant Jeyaraj Fernandopulle
while that of ethnic affairs and national integration was given to
Justice and Constitutional Affairs Minister G. L. Peiris.
</P>
<P>
Besides, 10 of the 11 new deputy ministers appointed by
Kumaratunga in the reshuffle are members of the SLFP Mulberry
Group (backbenchers), which has been fighting against particularly
waste, corruption and other illegal activities involving ruling
party members. And They are Kumaratunga's strong supporters,
according to political sources here.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Har Homa Settlement Building to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu has stressed that the construction of Jewish
settlement at Har Homa (or Jabal Abu Ghoneim) in Jerusalem, as
well as in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, would continue.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remarks late Monday night at a meeting of
the Knesset (Israel's parliament) members of the hardline
Likud-Gesher-Tsomet coalition. He categorically rejected reports
that any sort of promise had been made to halt the settlement
building.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Israeli media reported that the Israeli
and Palestinian negotiating teams, along with Egyptian
mediators, were trying to resolve the problem of the settlement
construction in Jerusalem through Israeli agreement to "slow
down" the construction at Har Homa to a near halt.
</P>
<P>
"We are now in the midst of a negotiating process in which we
first must make sure that the Palestinian side lives up to its
commitments to combat terror and to cease murdering land dealers
and other innocent people," the Israeli premier said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Sunday's negotiations between Israel and
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) in the Egyptian capital
of Cairo did not result in any understanding about renewing the
process.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the two sides stalled again in March
after Israel started building a controversial new Jewish
neighborhood at Har Homa in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The PNA said that Israel must stop the construction before
talks can resume, while the Jewish state insisted that the PNA
crack down on terror and reestablish full security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Through Egypt's mediation, Israel and the PNA resumed contact
by holding a meeting in Cairo Sunday; however, no progress was
made in renewing the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"But we are meeting again on Thursday," Netanyahu said. "For
my part, I still would like to see the Palestinian side live up
to its bargain and then I would like to enter a speeded up
negotiation for the final status agreement."
</P>
<P>
His guidelines for that agreement, Netanyahu said, will "take
into account the reality and conditions already created on
ground, but we will strive to maintain in Israeli hands the most
vital national assets."
</P>
<P>
Among the guidelines for a final status deal, Netanyahu
listed "fortifying the Jordan River as our eastern boundary and
enhancing Israel's direct control over the Jordan Valley and the
mountain ranges which control it."
</P>
<P>
He added that "it should be self-evident that we should have
absolute responsibility and exclusive sovereignty in greater
Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu again emphasized his objection to the establishment
of a Palestinian state in the Palestinian autonomous areas,
saying "such a state means an Arab army which would threaten
Israel's very existence."

<HEADLINE> Beijing Urges to Recycle Fast Food Containers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The capital city of China has
urged all units or individuals who manufacture or sell plastic
food containers to recycle their products or face possibile
shut-down.
</P>
<P>
The move, which has been in effect since June 1, is part of an
effort to wipe out the city's "white pollution" caused by the
widespread use of the plastic products, said Ye Hanmin, deputy
director of the city's environmental protection bureau.
</P>
<P>
The regulation was jointly issued by the city's Environmental
Protection Bureau and the municipal Industrial and Commercial
Administration.
</P>
<P>
It requires all manufacturers or sellers of plastic fast food
containers to be registered and get permission to use the prodcut
from the two bureaus, and says their businesses could face a
forced closure if found acting against the rules.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's eight suburban areas yearly use more than 23,000 tons
of plastic products, which have posed as problems for the
environment. Fast food containers can be recycled more easily than
other plastic products.

<HEADLINE> Pacific Economic Outlook Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The annual GDP growth rate in the
Pacific region is predicted to stand at 4.1 percent, according to
the recently-published report "Pacific Economic Outlook 1997-1998."
</P>
<P>
The region's GDP rate for 1997 and 1998 will be 5.5 and 5.7
percent, respectively, excluding that for the United States and
Japan, said the report, which was compiled by the Pacific Economic
Outlook of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC).
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the growth rate of the consumer product
index for the two years will be 3.9 and 3.5 percent in the region,
lower than 8.6 percent in 1995 and 4.1 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the low inflation rate to the drastic
drop in the inflation rate in Russia and the Mexico, and the
continued high economic growth and low inflation rate in China and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The PECC gives regular seminars annually, and bases its annual
report on economic forecasts of the participants.

<HEADLINE> Per-capital Income in Northeast China Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Per-capita income of urban
residents in northeast China's Liaoning province reached 4,210
yuan last year, according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey finds that the population in this major industrial
province accounts for half of its four million people. Per-capita
income last year was up 13.3 percent from the previous year, and
was up 4.7 percent when adjusted for inflation.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted by the province's urban social and
economic investigation team. A random sampling was made among
3,350 households in the province's cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
Households with an annual income of less than 3,000 yuan were
down from 46.7 percent to 36.1 percent of the total last year,
while those with more than 3,000 yuan annually were up 10.6
percentage points from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The research result shows that more money is being spent on
phone bills, entertainment, and health care rather than on basic
necessities like food and clothing, according to the study.

<HEADLINE> Farmer-Turned-Graduate Student Pursues New Life (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Among graduate students enrolled
in the Chinese Department of Hangzhou University last year,
32-year-old Wu Guofu stands out.
</P>
<P>
In addition to being older than most of his classmates, his
bronzed skin and callused hands reveal his past occupation as a
farmer.
</P>
<P>
Wu, now working toward his graduate degree in Chinese Ancient
Literature, lived six months ago in a small mountain village in
Jiangxi province, spending his days plowing and weeding. He
dropped out of high school at the age of 18 to help support his
family.
</P>
<P>
"At that time I was very interested in literature and hoped to
be a writer one day," he said. "I was not reconciled to being
only a farmer, I wanted to work to fulfill my dream."
</P>
<P>
During the day, he turned his attention to the rigors of
farm work. At night, he cultivated his education.
</P>
<P>
Wu had limited access to books. For months, he saved money for
a book on ancient Chinese literature, then walked a long distance
to buy it.
</P>
<P>
After his enrollment in Hangzhou University, he spent more than
1,000 yuan (120 US dollars) for books, an almost unimaginable sum
for a village farmer.
</P>
<P>
To have sufficient materials, Wu made copies of textbooks. Over
the past two years, he has transcribed more than 1 million Chinese
characters.
</P>
<P>
The road to knowledge was rough, and Wu was ridiculed by his
neighbors, who considered farm work the only respectable
profession. A grocery he opened with his wife to help support his
family added even greater responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
In spite of obstacles, Wu passed the national examination for
students pursuing an independent course of study, and later the
graduate school entrance exam.

<P>
Six years later, Wu was listed as one of the 46,000 students
enrolled by graduate schools across the country in 1996. That year
alone, 244,000 students in China took the graduate school entrance
test.
</P>
<P>
Wu became the first farmer to be enrolled by a graduate school
in his province, and perhaps in the entire country, according to
university authorities.
</P>
<P>
He now spends most of his time in the library or reading in his
dormitory room. Sometimes, he goes to the cinema, a favorite
spare-time activity.
</P>
<P>
So far in his graduate career, he has written five papers, one
of which soon will be published in a scholarly journal.
</P>
<P>
Called "Elder Brother" by his young roommates, Wu shares his
life experience with them, offering advice on how to get along in
society.
</P>
<P>
Wu has a great liking for his chosen field of study, but knows
there isn't much money in it. No matter what he does in the
future, he says, he will not abandon his goal to be a scholar.
</P>
<P>
Every month, he receives many letters from all over the
country, from other farmers hoping to pursue a new life through
education. Their words show their admiration for Wu.
</P>
<P>
Wu answers nearly every letter, dispensing advice when
asked. And in an article in "Today's Youth" magazine, he suggests
that others like him should carefully plan out their lives
according to their own circumstances, and make full use of their
own advantages.
</P>
<P>
"Entering graduate school is not the only way to pursue a new
life," he wrote. "What's important is to have your own dream and
never give it up."

<HEADLINE> Yangtze River Valley Produces One-fourth of World's Rape Seeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Yangtze River Valley has become
the world's largest rape growing belt.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, more than 5.7 million ha of rape were planted in the
area, producing over 7.8 million tons of rape seed last year --
more than one-fourth of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
In addition to favorable soil and climate conditions, strong
science research programs have helped the area to become a rape
producer, according to Dr. Wang Hanzhong, a researcher of the
Oil-bearing Plants Institute (OPI) under the Chinese Academy of
Agricultural Science.
</P>
<P>
An oil-bearing plant research system centering around Wuhan,
the capital of central China's Hubei Province, has taken shape, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s, OPI raised the per ha output from 750 kg to
1500 kg with a new species known as "Zhongyou 821." The seed
strain is now planted at an annual rate of 200 ha nationwide and
has become one of the most popularly-raised varieties of the seed
in China.
</P>
<P>
There is still great potential for the expansion of the rape
growing area in the river basin, Dr. Wang said, adding that is
because there is approximately 6.7 million ha of idle farmland
there in winter, about half of which could be used for growing
rape, and the production level in the region is quite unbalanced.

<HEADLINE> Marital Bliss Permeates Families in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A survey has shown that marital
status in Shanghai is holding steady, despite what many believe to
be eroding moral standards brought about by the tremendous changes
in China's economy.
</P>
<P>
Some 97 percent of the respondents said that they get along
well with their spouse, and no husband and wife said their family
life is not good.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by two social sciences researchers in
the Pudong New Area, Shanghai's most rapidly-developing economic
zone. Some 1,000 families responded the questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
"Although there exist income and educational disparities, they are
no doubt affectionate couples," said Hu Shenshang, one of the
researchers, in reference to the survey respondents.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai resident Lu said, "The tip to get along with my wife
is to give up some of my hobbies to suit her tastes, and share my
time with her. And vice versa."
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that most Shanghai men want a virtuous
and honest wife who is tender and has homemaking skills, while
most women wish their husbands to be honest and good
providers.

<HEADLINE> India's Textile Exports Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 10 (Xinhua) -- India's textile sector, which
accounts for more than one-third of the country's exports, has
managed to resist the current export slowdown much better than
other sectors, the Hindustan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
During the month of April, textile exports recorded a
5.5-percent growth in U.S. dollar terms while the country's
overall exports declined by 10 percent, according to data released
by the Textile Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Total exports from the textile sector during April amounted to
975.74 million U.S. dollars as against 924.54 million dollars a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The main push to textile exports has come from cotton yarn
whose exports soared by 34.6 percent and wool and woolens, 24.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
Export of man-made textiles increased by 9.7 percent to 80.66
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, export of ready-made garments declined by 14 percent
in the month, a dramatic drop as such garments account for 38.9
percent of all exports from the textile sector.
</P>
<P>
The export target for the textile sector has been set at 13.3
billion dollars for the current fiscal year.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF)
of Pakistan has seized a total of 10 million U.S. dollars in fake
notes in a dramatic swoop on a printing press in Lahore at the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The raid was conducted on Friday but the details were released
on Monday by Ejaz Hussain Shah, the ANF's regional director, at a
press briefing in Lahore, capital of Pakistan's eastern Punjab
Province.
</P>
<P>
He said the ANF had received a tip-off sometime back that the
fake notes were being used to pay for narcotics.
</P>
<P>
He said the raid led to the discovery of this huge amount which
was hidden in various text books and took the ANF almost two days
to count.
</P>
<P>
The haul was perhaps by far the biggest of its kind in the
recent past, said Shah.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Former triple world boxing
champion Jeff Fenech was fined 360 Australian dollars (284
U.S. dollars), admitting Tuesday damaging a police car.
</P>
<P>
However, no conviction was recorded and Fenech, 33, was quoted
as saying that he was considering pursuing possible charges of
wrongful arrest and assault against police, a report from Gold
Cosast said,
</P>
<P>
The charges relate to Fenech's arrest in Surfers Paradise, on
Queensland's Gold Coast, in the early hours of February 16.
</P>
<P>
In Southport Magistrates Court Tuesday a further charge of
obscene language during arrest was amended to insulting words to a
police officer.
</P>
<P>
The court heard the incident was triggered by an alleged
domestic dispute at a nightclub on February 15.
</P>
<P>
Police attended the scene but Fenech's wife denied any
wrong-doing by her husband and the officers left.
</P>
<P>
They departed the nightclub by the back entrance to escape
autograph hunters but police were called again after another
complaint.
</P>
<P>
Up to eight officers arrived and arrested Fenech who allegedly
swore at them. The wilful damage charge related to Fenech kicking
a police vehicle at the police watchhouse.
</P>
<P>
Fenech told journalists he kicked the police car through
frustration.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Have Highest Number of Senior Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will have the highest
number of senior citizens in the world by the year 2025, when more
than 20 million of the nation's people will be aged 60 or above, a
population analyst said.
</P>
<P>
The projected figure marks a 414 percent increase in the number
of senior citizens since 1990, Professor Boedi Darmojo, who is
from Diponegoro University's School of Medicine in Semarang,
Central Java, said Monday, according to reports reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
the percentage is relatively high compared to other nations, he
added, citing that Kenya's senior citizen number will increase by
347 percent, Brazil by 255 percent, India by 242 percent, China by
220 percent, Japan by 129 percent, Germany by 66 percent and
Sweden by 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
Darmojo said Indonesia will rank fifth or sixth in the world in
the number of senior citizens by the year 2020, but should be at
number one by 2025.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is the world's fourth most populous country and its
aging population will cause an increase in spending on health
care, which many elderly people may not be able to afford.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the results of a recent study, Darmojo said 71.2
percent of Indonesia's senior citizens, most of whom are women
living in rural areas, have no formal education. Most of them are
unskilled workers, he said, adding that only 21.2 percent of male
senior citizens and 7.5 percent female senior citizens are
professionals.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Soeharto has said various programs must be
established to solve the many problems faced by Indonesia's senior
citizens.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Sunday's celebration of senior citizen day, the
president said national development has successfully reduced the
infant mortality rate and improved life expectancy in the country.
</P>
<P>
Life expectancy increased to 61.3 years in 1992, from 45.7
years in 1968. At the end of the sixth five-year development plan
in 1999, life expectancy will rise to 65, he added.

<HEADLINE> Chopper Lands in Bangladesh due to Bad Weather: Delhi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government Monday
formally informed Dhaka, "An Indian helicopter strayed from its
planned route due to bad weather on May 20 and was compelled to
force-land in Bangladesh territory," said an official handout.
</P>
<P>
The handout did not mention whether Delhi has expressed regret
to this incident.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government Sunday lodged a protest with India
against the intrusion and violation of Bangladesh air space by an
Indian Air Force helicopter on May 20.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka said that an Indian helicopter landed at Chunarghat in
Habiganj district on May 20, at 1815 hours (local time). The
helicopter carried six persons in uniform and one in civilian
clothes.
</P>
<P>
"After they were told by the local people that the place they
had landed was inside Bangladesh, the helicopter took off at 1820
hours (local time) and flew eastward towards India," said the
Bangladeshi Foreign Ministry in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Bangladesh opposition leader Khaleda Zia, who
has been accusing the government of selling out sovereignty to
India, expressed concern over the landing of the Indian
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
"It is unholy and dangerous exercise that a foreign fighter
could safely intrude into our airspace, safely landed, stayed and
took off without obstruction," said the former prime minister.

BANGKOK, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Sales of Mercedes-Benz cars are
slowing down in Thailand due to the economic downturn in the
country, according to the local press today.
</P>
<P>
Benz Thonglor, a leading Thai Mercedes dealer, said that only
7,000 Mercedes cars were sold in 1996 in Thailand, sharply down
from the figure of 13,000 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Dealers are being stuck with the overstock as they misjudged
the market, said Wasant Popimpanont, managing director of Benz
Thonglor.
</P>
<P>
Wasant said that his company sold 1,958 Mercedes cars during
the first four months this year, 38 percent lower than the 3,151
units it sold in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the prices of Mercedes cars on the Thai market are
slightly expensive compared with other German cars, Wasant said
that Mercedes dealers are launching an interest-free payment
marketing campaign to attract customers who want to buy the cars
with installments.

<HEADLINE> China Hopes to See Enhanced Environmental Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TORONTO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- China puts great emphasis on the
protection of environment and hopes to see enhanced cooperation with
Canada and other countries, a senior Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, administrator of China's National Environmental
Protection Agency (NEPA), made the remarks at a function organized by
Canada-China Business Council here.
</P>
<P>
China has always attached great importance to environmental
protection, and made it one of the nation's basic policies in
early 1980s, Xie said.
</P>
<P>
This policy has ensured that China's environment has not
deteriorated rapidly while its economy forged ahead.
</P>
<P>
Despite all this, the Chinese government knows too well that the
country faces a serious environmental protection task, said Xie, who
is here to participate in the three-day APEC Environment Ministerial
Meeting.
</P>
<P>
As China is moving toward industrialization and urbanization, it
has witnessed more and more pollution and increased destruction of
ecosystems, which in some cases has imposed threats to human lives.
</P>
<P>
To tackle this problem, China has adopted a series of legal and
administrative measures to enhance the environmental protection. And
it plans to inject some 450 billion Renminbi yuan into environmental
protection in the 1996-2000 period, Xie said.
</P>
<P>
China, while relying mainly on its own to protect the environment,
also needs the financial and technical support from the international
community and other countries.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to enhance environmental protection cooperation with
Canada, and the rest of the world as well," Xie said.
</P>
<P>
Xie noted that in recent years, China and Canada have conducted
fruitful cooperation in the management of pollution in China's Huaihe
River and Haihe River. They have also done a good job in the
prevention of overall environmental protection in Sichuan, Shandong
and other provinces.
</P>
<P>
"There is great potential for China and Canada to further enhance
their cooperation in this regard," he added.
</P>
<P>
Canada has an edge in environmental protection technology and
capital, while China boasts the relatively good basis of environmental
management and huge market. There exists great complementality between
the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that more Canadian entrepreneurs would go and
invest in China's environmental protection sector.

<HEADLINE> France Calls for Re-writing of Single Currency Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- France is seeking to redraw the
single-currency Stability Pact which commits European Union
countries wishing to adopt the euro on January 1, 1999, to rigorous
budgetary and financial discipline.
</P>
<P>
The pact is due to be adopted at a summit of EU leaders in
Amsterdam next week. But at a meeting of EU finance ministers in
Luxembourg, France's Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn
voiced the concerns of the country's new Socialist-led government
about the document.
</P>
<P>
He said a new chapter should be added to the pact, committing
countries adopting the euro to much closer coordination of
economic policy, focussing on growth and job creation, to offset
the potential deflationary impact of the financial constraints in
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Strauss-Kahn called for a "period of reflection" before EU
countries adopt the accord. But he said France would stick to the
timetable and conditions for the launch of the single currency.
</P>
<P>
France's request to redraw the Stability Pact came in the wake
of the formation of the new Socialist-led government last week
following the general election.
</P>
<P>
The Socialists pledged not to impose unpopular tax increases
and spending cuts considered essential for France to cut its
budget deficit to the level required for joining the euro.
</P>
<P>
New Prime Minister Lionel Jospin is insisting on a more
flexible interpretation of the strict economic criteria set by the
Maastricht Treaty for EU countries joining the single currency.
</P>
<P>
But Strauss-Kahn denied that the request for economic
coordination was made to challenge the independence of the future
European central bank that will conduct monetary policy in the euro
zone.
</P>
<P>
He said France too saw budgetary discipline as necessary.
</P>
<P>
Even so, France's request has cast doubt on whether the
painfully-negotiated pact can be approved as scheduled next week
in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
Gerrit Zalm, Finance Minister of the Netherlands which currently
holds the EU presidency, said today that EU members would try
hard to find solutions to the problems thrown up by France's requests
before the Amsterdam summit on June 16-17.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Remain Stable, Prosperous: Malaysian NA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will remain stable
and prosperous after its return to China on July 1, 1997, said
Malaysian National Assembly Deputy Speaker Ong Tee Keat.
</P>
<P>
Ong said this in a recent exclusive interview with Xinhua here.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the "one country, two systems" concept put
forth by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, saying it was an
"epoch-making" masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
He said the concept provided the Hong Kong people with
confidence and he believed that it would be fully implemented in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Ong criticized the arguments by some Western media and some
western governments that Hong Kong as a world financial and
shipping center would collapse overnight after its return to
China.
</P>
<P>
The Deputy Speaker, who is also a member of the Presidential
Council of the Malaysian Chinese Association, said the western
arguments did not "hold water as they were ill-grounded."
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, after its return to China, Hong Kong will
maintain its prosperity with the assistance of the inland areas of
China," he said.
</P>
<P>
For Hong Kong's future administration, Ong said "it must be
entirely based on the Basic law."
</P>
<P>
On the significance of the resumption of the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong by the People's Republic of China, Ong
said what was most important was that the Chinese nation could be
able to wipe out the humiliation it was subjected to over the past
100 years and more.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the people of Hong Kong and the inland areas
would make efforts in the future to narrow differences in the form
of value and living style created under the different systems.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Purchases of US Firms Up Sharply in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Foreign spending to buy U.S.
companies increased to a record 80.5 billion dollars last year, 41
percent more than that in 1995, U.S. Commerce Department reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that most of the outlays represented
spending to acquire existing companies, 90 percent of the total
compared to 10 percent to establish new firms.
</P>
<P>
The number of individual purchases that totaled more than 1
billion dollars more than doubled to 19, compared to nine in 1995.
The very largest investments -- those over 2 billion dollars --
increased to eight from five the previous year.
</P>
<P>
British spending on U.S. companies totaled 15.5 billion
dollars, the largest amount for any nation, followed by 13 billion
in German investments and 10.2 billion in Canadian investments.
</P>
<P>
Japanese investments in the U.S. increased to 9.3 billion in
1996, up sharply from 3.6 billion in 1995. But the level was still
less than half of the peak of 19.9 billion set in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investments in service industries more than doubled to
15.3 billion dollars last year, compared to 5.9 billion the
previous year. Finance, insurance, communication and business
service companies were the most in demand.
</P>
<P>
Investments in manufacturing companies totaled 29 billion
dollars, an increase of 8.8 percent from 1995 with purchases
concentrated in industries featuring advanced technologies.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in the United States to acquire or establish
companies was 57.2 billion dollars in 1995. The investment has
been climbing sharply for the past four years after hitting a low
of 15.3 billion in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Shows Signs of Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Positive signs of a recovery
of Argentina's economy, which has been in a recession since
Mexico's economic crisis of 1994, have emerged since the beginning
of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Economy Ministry said that Argentina's gross domestic
product (GDP) increased 8.1 percent during the first quarter of
this year compared with the same period in 1996 and this was the
fourth quarter in a row to show increase in the GDP.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural, manufacturing and construction sectors showed
the biggest increases between January and March.
</P>
<P>
During the first four months, the output of Argentina's
industrial sector increased 7.8 percent over the same period last
year, spurred by the increase in consumption in the automobile,
food and construction sectors, in particular.
</P>
<P>
The production of automobiles increased 43.7 percent in April
compared with the same month last year. During this period,
exports increased 111 percent and domestic sales rose 12.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
As for the consumer price index (CPI), Argentina reported three
consecutive months of deflation, -0.5 percent in March, -0.3
percent in April and -0.1 in May.
</P>
<P>
This has been a great accomplishment for the administration of
President Carlos Menem as inflation has been contained since the
beginning of 1991, with the start of the Convertibility Program
(one peso equals one U.S. dollars), which has contributed to the
economic stability in this country.
</P>
<P>
In the tax arena, tax collections reached the unprecedented sum
of 4.614 billion dollars in May, an increase of 28.6 percent over
May 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the financial circles, liquid international reserves reached
the record sum of 19.25 billion dollars compared with the sum of
15.173 billion dollars for last May, an increase of 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bank deposits reached the historical figure of 60.466 billion
dollars in May, an increase of 28 percent with deposits rising by
nearly seven billion dollars during the first five months of this
year.
</P>
<P>
During the first five months of this year peso deposits climbed
more than 16 percent versus 7.4 percent increases in dollar
deposits. Of the total deposits, 49.2 percent were made in pesos
and 50.8 percent in dollars.
</P>
<P>
As for foreign trade, thanks to the good performance of the
Southern Common Market, Argentina has increased its exports and
imports.
</P>
<P>
During the first 4-month period in 1997, Argentina's foreign
trade reached the unprecedented level of 16.895 billion dollars,
an increase of 25 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Due to the increasingly better climate for investments, foreign
capitals increased 28 percent during the first quarter compared
with the previous year and it is expected that they will grow
another 10 billion dollars over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, Argentina's economy has shaken off its
lethargy and is expected to grow six percent this year in face of
the recovery that is appearing along all its fronts, even though
an elevated fiscal deficit persists.
</P>
<P>
The government still faces a number of economic as well as
social problems.
</P>
<P>
The high rate of unemployment, of nearly 17 percent, is a
headache for the government in spite of its efforts to stimulate
the creation of jobs.
</P>
<P>
The delays in paying salaries, pensions and retirement funds as
well as the high unemployment levels have aggravated social
discontent.

<HEADLINE> Banana Bunch, Believed to be World's Largest, Picked in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A bunch of bananas containing 17
clusters, measuring 160 centimeters long and weighing 97 kilograms
has been cut in the eastern Cuban province of Guantanamo.
</P>
<P>
The harvest of a single banana bunch, reported by the
Trabajadores weekly published here today, was expected to make an
entry into the Guinness Book of World Records.
</P>
<P>
The bunch, of a variety locally known as the Fhia-01, exceeded
the previous record of 77 or 78 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
William Napoles, head of the plantation where the bunch was
grown, said each banana tree was fertilized three times with
potassium and urea, and given 75 liters of water each day.
</P>
<P>
Talking about his plantation, Napoles was quoted as saying that
there are several bunches of bananas containing up to 19 clusters,
therefore newer records are likely.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Considers Buying Jets From Other Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian authorities are
considering buying fighter jets from countries other than the
United States, a military leader said.
</P>
<P>
"We are thinking of purchasing warplanes from other countries,"
Armed Forces Chief Gen. Feisal Tanjung said in Cilangkap, East
Jakarta, Monday, according to military sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came after the Indonesian government announced last
Friday that it had decided to cancel its plan to purchase nine
F-16s from the United States in reaction to U.S. Congress critics
who linked the purchase to the human rights situation in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Washington offered Indonesia 28 F-16 fighter jets that were
initially built for Pakistan in 1995. Jakarta was only interested
in buying nine and sought soft loans for their purchase.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision to cancel the F-16 deal and also
withdraw the country from a U.S. military training program has
received strong support from local observers and politicians who
see it as a snub against superpower encroachment.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ambassador Justifies Resumption of Arms Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Leslie Alexander, the U.S. ambassador
to Ecuador, has justified the decision by the U.S. government to
lift its 20-year ban on arms sales to Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Alexander said the prohibition, announced by the then
U.S. President Jimy Carter, had not halted the arms race in Latin
America "since several countries acquired arms from Russia and the
arms are not very different from ours," the media today quoted him
as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that following this new decision, Latin American
countries will be able to purchase arms from the United States,
just as other countries in Europe and Asia are now able to, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The arms available to Latin American countries from the United
States would not be very different with the ones they own now, he
added. Endiem

<HEADLINE> Hungary, Czech Republic Discuss NATO Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian and Czech Republic
foreign ministers held talks today over their membership bids for
NATO and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Both countries hope to be in the first wave of countries
invited to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as it
expands eastward through Europe.
</P>
<P>
Laszlo Kovacs, the Hungarian foreign minister, told a joint
press conference here following his talks with his Czech
counterpart, Josef Zieleniec, it was possible both countries would
become new members of the two organizations.
</P>
<P>
He said that though NATO and Russia signed an agreement last
month setting out their new relationship in the context of the
military alliance's expansion plans, new NATO members would not be
reduced to second class status and would enjoy the same safety
guarantee as existing members.
</P>
<P>
Kovacos said that Slovakia's participation in the first wave of
NATO expansion and in the EU was also in the interests of Hungary
and the Czech Republic and would promote regional stability.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Beijingers Respect Teachers Most </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that
residents in the Chinese capital think that teachers, scientists
and medical doctors belong to the three most highly-respected
professions in the city.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which took four months to complete, is the first
of its kind conducted in Beijing. Respondents selected their
favorite jobs from a list of 14.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 45.85 percent of those questioned
answered that they respect teachers most, followed by scientists
(43.65 percent), doctors (43.45 percent), engineers and
technicians, lawyers, and star athletes.
</P>
<P>
Art performers, people who are self-employed, and owners of
private businesses are among those on the bottom of the list.
</P>
<P>
With more and more Chinese realizing the importance of
education, teachers are regarded by many as the carriers of the
torch of civilization and have won widespread respect.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, a string of scandals among well-known pop singers
and movie stars, ranging from tax evasion to indiscreet behavior
in their personal lives, has dimmed their glow of fame.
</P>
<P>
Self-employed people, especially owners of private businesses,
take much of the blame when ordinary Chinese complain about
low-quality products and poor social responsibility.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Bill for Imported Crude Oil Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's bill for imported crude
and oil products jumped by 24.7 percent in the first four months
of this year over a year earlier, according to the Thai Commerce
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The country paid 56.062 billion baht (about 2.24 billion U.S.
dollars) for supplies to meet most of its energy needs. The oil
import volume rose by 8.1 percent to an average of 798,060 barrels
per day.
</P>
<P>
The bills for crude oil imports rose by 63.6 percent on those
for the same period of last year to 51.077 billion baht (2.04
billion dollars). The country paid 4.985 billion baht (199 million
dollars) for imports of refined oil products, a drop of 64
percent.
</P>
<P>
In volume terms, crude imports soared by 38.3 percent to
739,220 barrels per day while imports of finished oil products
plunged by 70.1 percent to 60,790 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
The shift in balance between crude and refined products in the
period was due to the extra crude intake capacity offered by the
country's two new oil refineries -- Star Petroleum Refining Co.
and Prayong Refinery Co. -- in Rayong Province, eastern Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Man With Transplanted Heart Dies 13 Years After Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A Czech man living with a heart
transplanted into his chest 13 years ago died last Saturday, said
a report in the newspaper Pravo published today.
</P>
<P>
Josef Divina, believed to have carried a transplanted heart for
the longest time in the world's medical history, was 57.
</P>
<P>
Once suffering a life-threatening heart condition, Divina
underwent a surgical procedure at a hospital here on January 31,
1984, to receive a donated human heart.
</P>
<P>
The surgery proved a success. And he was able to lead a normal
life, traveled abroad three times, and served as the top quality
supervisor at a factory.
</P>
<P>
However, while family members and friends were reportedly
gathering on June 3 to mark another anniversary of his birthday,
Divina fainted and collapsed.
</P>
<P>
His death three days later at a hospital was attributed by
doctors to cerebral hemorrhage, a condition apparently unrelated
to the heart transplant.

cancer are the top three killers of Bangkokians inflicted with
non-communicable diseases in recent years, according to
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that deaths attributable to heart disease have
increased from 262 six years ago to 418 last year while the number

<HEADLINE> China Sees Huge Personal Computer Market This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Cross sales of personal computers
in China are likely to hit 3 million units this year, today's
China Daily cited a senior engineer of the Ministry of Electronics
Industry as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the first four months of this year, Chinese PC companies
sold 215,000 units, up 126 percent over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
"Such a situation hinted at a rosy picture of the year's
computer market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Legend Group, a major personal computer supplier in China, sold
103,336 units during the first four months, an increase of more
than 140 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese PC companies usually take 40 percent to 50 percent of
the domestic market share," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, sales of PCs in the first four months would be at
least 430,000 units.
</P>
<P>
A review of market history indicates the first six months are
usually the off season for PC sales and the past six months the
peak period.
</P>
<P>
"Sales of PCs are expected to surpass the previously predicted
250,000 units for the whole of 1997," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Personal computers of the 586-class, based mainly on Pentium
and AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) chips, led the PC market in the
first four months, he said.
</P>
<P>
The average price of a PC is mow about 10,000 yuan (1,205 US
dollars) on the Chinese market. And it may continue to drop as
competition between Chinese and foreign PC makers becomes even
fiercer this year, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
With a higher standard of living, a growing number of Chinese
families are able to buy desktop PCs for processing information
and accessing the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a nationwide information infrastructure is being
built with the widespread application of desktop servers and
computers in insurance, taxation, finance, commerce and power
generation.
</P>
<P>
Despite strong business challenges from IBM, Compaq, AST,
Hewlett-Packard and other international firms, Chinese companies
will continue to play a major role in the domestic PC market.
</P>
<P>
During the first four months, Chinese PC companies produced
250,000 units, up 103 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Major PC makers such as Legend Group and Great Wall Group
turned out 102,727 units and 69,824 units, up 140 percent and 120
percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Chinese consumers owned 5 million PCs by the end of last year,
ranking second in Asia following Japan where consumers owned about
8 million units.
</P>
<P>
"But we have every reason to believe that by the year 2000, PCs
owned by Chinese families and units will surpass those owned in
Japan," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, sales of PCs chalked up an increase of 70 percent to
2.05 million units.

<P>
JAKARTA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing Information Minister
Harmoko will most likely become Indonesia's next chairman of the
House of Representatives (DPR) and People's Consultative Assembly
(MPR), a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
"There are strong indications to believe Harmoko will become
DPR/MPR chairman," Supreme Advisory Council (DPA) Chairman Sudomo
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Harmoko is currently chairman of the ruling Golkar party, the
virtual winner of the recent general election in the country.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto last Friday appointed Harmoko as state
minister for special affairs while Army Chief of Staff General
Hartono will replace him as minister of information.
</P>
<P>
Sudomo said he believed the replacement of Harmoko as
information minister had been planned before. He said he did not
believe the change was linked with the next vice president.
</P>
<P>
MPR will elect president and vice president in March next year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Harmoko said here Monday that he would stay in
cabinet as state minister of special affairs until September 30,
before taking a seat in the House.
</P>
<P>
"Our administrative system does not allow a legislator to serve
concurrently in a government position, so I will leave the cabinet
before October," he said.

<P>
YANGON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A Myanmar senior official has
called for setting up more forest plantations in the country to
develop wood-based industries especially by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting here on Monday reviewing the accomplishments in
the 1996-97 fiscal year ending in March, Minister for Forestry
Chit Swe also urged modernization of the country's wood-based
industries to produce quality finished goods for the international
market, the official paper The New Light of Myanmar reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is rich in forest resources with different types of
forests covering about 51 percent of its land area, of which 6.1
million hectares are covered with teak
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's teak export in the 1996-97 fiscal year was at 184,000
cubic meters while that of hard wood at 142,000 cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The export of Myanmar's forest products amounted to 218 million
U.S. dollars in the 1996-97 fiscal year, accounting for 24.4
percent of the total export, second only to that of agricultural
products, according to the latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar restricts export of logs, banning the private sector
from exporting teak logs after the enactment of the country's
Forest Law in 1992. However, export of value-added wood-products
is encouraged.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Upholds Death Sentence on Iranian Terrorist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A court of appeals of Thailand
Monday upheld the death sentence on an Iranian who attempted to
blow up the Israeli Embassy in Thailand in 1994 with a truck-bomb,
a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The court upheld the ruling on the grounds that prosecutors had
substantial evidence to prosecute Iranian Hossein Shahriarifar,
The Nation said.
</P>
<P>
Shahriarifar was found guilty of murder, robbery, possession of
explosives and attempted sabotage by Bangkok South Criminal Court
in July last year, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The court also indicated that Shahriariafar's testimony that he
crossed the Thai-Malaysian border as a trader carried no weight,
as eleven witnesses identified him as the driver of the vehicle
carrying the explosives.
</P>
<P>
Shahriarifar was arrested along with two others in Hat Yai
district in southern Thailand in June 1994, ten weeks after police
found a ton of a powerful explosive mixture made from plastic
explosives and chemical fertilizer in a water tank on the back of
a six-wheel truck abandoned less than a kilometer from the Israeli
Embassy.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Increase Scholarships for Africans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will increase the number
of scholarships it offers to African students to 280 a year under
a decision to be announced at an Asia-Africa conference opening
here tomorrow, according to a Thai Foreign Ministry source.
</P>
<P>
The scholarships will be offered under an existing program
which gives Africans the chance to undertake a wide range of
studies in Thailand, in fields such as agriculture, education,
health, trade, investment, tourism and environment.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents a dramatic increase from the five
scholarships offered when the program started in 1970. Last year,
100 scholarships were granted, Kobsak Chutikul, the Foreign
Ministry's director-general for economic affairs, was quoted today
by the local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh would announce the
plan when he opened the Second Asia-Africa Forum.
</P>
<P>
The increase would become effective next year, Kobsak said.
</P>
<P>
The three-day Asia-Africa Forum will be attended by 48 African
and 10 Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Capacity building, sustainable agricultural development and
food security and private sector development are on the agenda.

<HEADLINE> Australian Kids in Orphanages Used in Experiment: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of children in
orphanages and babies' homes in the state of Victoria were used in
post-World War II medical experiments and research that continued
until 1970, the national newspaper the Age reported today.
</P>
<P>
The experiments included trials of new vaccines that did not
work or failed to pass safety tests in animals.
</P>
<P>
Babies less than 12 months old were injected with large doses
of an experimental vaccine against herpes. Other experiments
included giving children a test vaccine against whooping cough
which was never put into production.
</P>
<P>
An investigation by the newspaper has discovered that hundreds
of children were used to test vaccines and antigens for toxic
effects before the new products were used on children in the wider
community.
</P>
<P>
In a number of the tests babies developed adverse reactions,
including vomiting and abscesses.
</P>
<P>
Those carrying out the experiments included researchers from
the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (CSL) and the Walter and Eliza
Hall Institute of Medical Research.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said it has identified four of the church-run or
independent institutions where experiments and tests took place.
Others remain unidentified.
</P>
<P>
In the largest experiment, which was still running in 1970, 350
infants between the ages of three months and 36 months in unnamed
institutions were injected with full adult doses of trial
influenza vaccines to test for toxic reactions.
</P>
<P>
CSL researchers admitted at the time that they approached the
test with "some trepidation" because influenza vaccines had "long
been known to produce more severe toxic reactions in children than
in adults."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said it has learnt that two previous tests of
influenza vaccines on children produced severe toxic reactions. It
is believed that the results of the tests were never published.
</P>
<P>
Production of a whooping cough vaccine used by the CSL on
groups in babies' homes was halted after it failed to pass a
safety test in animals.
</P>
<P>
The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research
confirmed it had conducted tests with a killed herpes simplex
vaccine on 16 children at St. Joseph's Foundling Hospital, which
was also known as the Broadmeadows Babies' Home. The experimental
vaccine failed to protect the children against the virus.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper report did not mention how many of the orphans
were white, aboriginal or other racial backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
It said in a separate report that Victoria's crowded orphanages
and babies' homes made convenient laboratories for post-war
medical researchers.
</P>
<P>
It explained that the numbers of infants taken from their
families by the state government began rising sharply in the 1950s
because of a social policy based on the belief that children of
the poor, or those with only a single parent, would be better off
in institutions.
</P>
<P>
However, an official inquiry report issued last month said the
forced removal of tens of thousands of aboriginal children from
their homes during the 1910s-1960s constituted genocide.

<HEADLINE> Process for Nepal's WTO Entry Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government is close
to finalize a draft memorandum on foreign trade regime seeking the
country's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO),
official sources here said today.
</P>
<P>
The government formed a special committee comprising
high-ranking officials last year to speed up the process to seek
WTO membership, according to an official of the Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The draft memorandum will be sent to the WTO working party in
Geneva for study, he said.

Experts at the seminar urged the government to adjust the
country's economy to address the lingering problems like low
export base, export volatility and trade payment imbalances.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Mine Production at Letpadaung to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 10 (Xinhua) - Myanmar's annual mine production in
the Letpadaung area in the northern part of the country will reach
 63,500 tons by the year 2000, said a senior mining official.
</P>
<P>
Briefing foreign diplomats here on Monday, Myanmar Deputy
Minister for Mines U Hlaing Win said feasibility study at the
Letpadaung Hill reveals that there exist more than 400 million
tons of mineral deposits which can be exploited on a commercial
scale.
</P>
<P>
The official paper The New Light of Myanmar today quoted the
deputy minister as saying the study was conducted by Canada's
Invanhoe Company under a contract with the state-run Myanmar
Mining Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
Letpadaung is one of the areas granted to foreign companies for
mining which shows encouraging signs of becoming a major mine in
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The two parties had earlier reached an agreement to form a
joint venture to produce 25,000 tons of copper annually from the
mineral deposits at the Kyezin and Sabei hills in Mongywa and
Salingyi townships beginning 1998, the deputy minister added.
</P>
<P>
Companies from Australia and the United States also joined in
mining other minerals such as gold, lead, zinc and nickel together
with Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official statistics, foreign investment
in Myanmar's mining sector amounted to 498 million U.S. dollars in
42 permitted projects at the end of March this year.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's gross domestic product of mines increased by 6.5
percent in the 1996-97 fiscal year over the previous fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> China to Build First CT Scanner Production Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Alpa Software Group under
Northeast China University has just gained approval from the state
to build China's first CT scanner production base with designed
capacity of 100 a year.
</P>
<P>
Approved by the State Pharmaceutical Administration, the group
is to produce its newly developed CT-C2000 scanners, which detect
tumors in the human body.
</P>
<P>
The company is also China's first producer of CT scanner for
whole body check-ups which was developed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The latest CT-C2000 scanner is believed to be up to the world's
standard technologically, but only is half of the price
compared with similar models on the world market.
</P>
<P>
It is also equipped with a Chinese character display
system. The group can conduct remote-control maintenance of their
scanners among its customers all over the country with the help of
their computer network.
</P>
<P>
China has been relying on imported CT scanners in the past
years. Since the 1980s, the country has spent over one billion US
dollar to buy the CT scanners.
</P>
<P>
The production base is expected to become operational this fall.

<HEADLINE> Former Ecuadoran Minister Detained for Forging Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Former Ecuadoran Education and
Culture Minister Rafael Pandam was detained by police on charges
of forging travel documents for overseas travelling, police
authorities reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under the charges, Pandam changed documents for children so
that they could go abroad, particularly to the United States. He
received one thousand U.S. dollars for each service for obtaining
a U.S. visa.
</P>
<P>
The police general command office is preparing a report on this
case.
</P>
<P>
Pandam took charge of the Education and Culture Ministry under
the government of former President Abdala Bucaram who was deposed
by Congress for "mental incapacity in February of this year. The
former minister was accused of taking advantage of his official
duties and his links with local national and international
organizations to deceive diplomatic authorities for obtaining
visas for children who wish to leave the country, the authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
The police confiscated four falsified passports which
supposedly belonged to Pandam's children and an invitation to
attend an ethnological congress to be held abroad.
</P>
<P>
He appeared in the U.S. embassy several times, sparking the
suspicion of the diplomatic authorities over his formalities.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic authorities have placed this case in the hands
of the National Police's Criminal Investigation Bureau.
</P>
<P>
In their investigations, Pandam was suspected to have
participated in sending people abroad with falsified papers.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Welcomes Withdrawal of Mexican Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's decision to withdraw its
new ambassador to Costa Rica after he made disparaging comments about
the government has been welcomed by politicians here.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo said today the
presence of Mexican Ambassador Jose Rafael Castelazo, who said
Costa Rica is ruled by an oligarchy, could complicate relations
between the two countries, the media here reported.
</P>
<P>
Mexico made the right decision, because an ambassador
should not interfere in the internal affairs of another nation,
Naranjo said.
</P>
<P>
Castelazo, who only arrived in Costa Rica on May 22, was cited
by last week's edition of the Mexican magazine "Siempre", as
saying that "political power in Costa Rica is highly
concentrated. Even though there are only two principal parties,
they both belong to the same oligarchy."
</P>
<P>
He said "the government (of Costa Rica) is almost paralyzed
because it cannot make any decisions," the Siempre reported.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres refused to comment
on the Mexican government's decision, but said "our relations with
Mexico continue to be close and very good."

<HEADLINE> China to Mark Discovery of Dunhuang Caves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, June 10 (Xinhua) -- China will hold a series of
activities in the year 2000 to mark the 100th anniversary of the
discovery of the scripture-filled caves in the Dunhuang Mogao
Grottos, located in northwest China's Gansu province.
</P>
<P>
Discovered in 1900, the grottos have five scripture-filled
caves, which once stored tens of thousands of historical books and
and art works.
</P>
<P>
Duan Wenjie, president of the Dunhuang Cultural Research
Institute, said his institute is preparing to host a large-scale
international symposium on Dunhuang studies and an exhibition of
the findigs of the caves.
</P>
<P>
The symposium will be held in 1999 in the cities of Dunhuang
and Lanzhou, the provincial capital of Gansu. Several Chinese and
overseas scholars of Dunhuang studies will be invited.
</P>
<P>
Duan said his institute also plans to collect the Dunhuang
findings on loan from various sources worldwide for an exhibition
in Dunhuang, in an effort to promote the study of Dunhuang's
history.
</P>
<P>
He said his institute promises to return the borrowed
historical relics to whoever they belong to.
</P>
<P>
Most of the scripture and artifacts found in the caves were
stolen and smuggled out of China by Western invaders long time
ago. So far, at least 13 other countries have Dunhuang cultural
relics in their possession.
</P>
<P>
The Mogao Grottos, which were carved in the face of a cliff,
dates back to 366 A.D.. Four hundred and ninety-two grottos carved
between the sixth and 14th centuries remain intact.
</P>
<P>
The Dunhuang Mogao Grottos, designated as one of the world's
treasure-houses of cultural relics by the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), are
known for their murals and the extensive collection of
literature.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Pledges to Help Raise Up Its Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, a newly-established
municipality directly under the State Council, is determined to do
all it can to eliminate poverty in the next two years, China Daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
To help do so, the municipality is on the watch for new
investors.
</P>
<P>
"It will not be easy for Chongqing to lift its 3.6 million poor
rural residents, mostly in Wanxian and Fuling counties, out of
poverty before the end of the century," Zhou Jianzhong, vice-mayor
of Chongqing, said.
</P>
<P>
But Zhou was confident that the municipality would try its best
to realize that goal by accelerating the development of local
infrastructures and making full use of its resources.
</P>
<P>
The major difference between Chongqing, which has 30 million
inhabitants, and China's three other giant cities -- Beijing,
Shanghai and Tianjin each with a population of more than 10
million -- is the proportion of the poor in Chongqing: one-10th of
its population falls below the State-set poverty line.
</P>
<P>
The State's annual funding earmarked for the municipality's
help-the-poor program has reached 450 million yuan (54 million US
dollars), Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Such an amount of funds earmarked for the megacity's
help-the-poor program has been much more than other provinces,
but more investments are necessary.
</P>
<P>
Zhou made it clear that the top priority for building up a new
Chongqing is the development of transportation, energy and
communication infrastructures in order to improve the local
investment environment.
</P>
<P>
The vice-mayor is urging overseas investors to introduce
advanced technology and funding to take a hand in the construction
of a new Chongqing, freeing all its inhabitants from the yoke of
poverty.
</P>
<P>
Promising opportunities abound for overseas investors,
particularly in the construction of highways and in side-line
production processing with already available local resources, Zhou
said.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing used to be part of Sichuan province, the country's
largest pork-producing and processing center. The municipality
raises 1.8 million pigs a year but only 1.3 million -- 70 percent,
are sold annually.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhou, construction of several highways, including
the section from Chengdu to Fuling and the highway from Shanghai
to Chengdu, will begin this year. They will improve the city's
transportation network and are obvious projects for overseas
investors.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Chongqing encompasses many arable fields suitable for
use as orchards, particularly for oranges and tangerines. The city
is located next to China's largest orange and tangerine orchards
along the Yangtze River. Investors interested in developing a
fruit-processing industry, especially soft-drinks, would have on
hand rich local resources.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing is now negotiating with a company from the United
States for a project in Wanxian to produce fresh fruit juice.
</P>
<P>
The municipality also is about to introduce advanced
cultivation techniques from Israel for growing vegetables.
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, Chongqing has succeeded in developing
its orchards and fishponds by using loans granted by the World
Bank. With the help of European Economic Community donations, the
city has begun producing milk products, Zhou said.

Central Asia, to reach Eastern Mediterranean and Europe.
</P>
<P>
With bright prospects for further development, the relations
between Georgia and China will serve as a model for those between
big and small countries, the foreign minister added.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Australia plans to step up its
military ties with Vietnam and the Philippines with agreements
soon to be announced with the two countries to regularly share
sensitive information on defense and strategic issues.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper the Australian said today that just 22 years

exchanges with the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The first round of talks with the two countries is expected to

</P>
<P>
Vietnam and the Philippines are vital elements of a strategy to
be confirmed in the forthcoming foreign policy White Paper to
create a web of security arrangements which embraces every leading
East Asian military power.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, Australia has reached agreement for
so-called "polmil" talks with Japan and the Republic of Korea,
signed a security treaty with Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Following the agreements with Vietnam and the Philippines,
Australian officials are aiming to conclude negotiations for
security talks with Thailand by the end of the year, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
It is likely to be joined later by India. Senior defense
officials are due to go to New Delhi by the end of the year to
discuss options for establishing regular defense exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The push to expand security ties started with the previous
government but has gathered pace in the past year. Behind the move
is a deliberate strategy aimed at avoiding the outbreak of
conflict through the greater sharing of defense and strategic
information and other confidence building measures.
</P>
<P>
Australia's foreign policy White Paper, due to be released
mid-year by Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, emphasizes this
approach by restating the need to seek "security in and with the
region" by building bilateral defense and security relationships.
</P>
<P>
Australia's navy has 12 ship visits planned to ports in the
Philippines this year at a time when U.S. naval ship visits have
been suspended because of a dispute between Manila and Washington
over an armed forces agreement.
</P>
<P>
Australia is now the biggest defense partner of the Philippine
armed forces, offering extensive training under a 3.2 million U.S.
dollar defense aid program.

KIEV, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine expected to buy oil from
Iran, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Gennady Udovenko said Monday
at a meeting with his Iranian counterpart Ali Akbar Velayati.
</P>
<P>
Velayati, who paid a one-day visit to Kiev, said Iran has no
limits or misgivings in providing oil for Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The most important part of the oil cooperation is a three-way
deal among Iran, Ukraine and Turkmenistan, Velayati added.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal to be signed on June 27, Ukraine will pay part
of its multi-million U.S. dollars gas debt to Turkmenistan by
supplying 52 million dollars worth of railroad cars and wheels to
Iran. In turn, Iran would pay Turkmenistan in hard currency.
</P>
<P>
Velayati also expressed Iran's wishes to build a pipeline to
link Iran with Ukraine and to invest in the renovation of the
latter's largest oil terminal Odessa, a port in southern Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> German's Hoechst Signs a Joint Venture Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Hoechst Group, one of the top
three chemical companies in Germany, has signed a 29 million US
dollar joint venture with a company in east China's Jiangsu
province to produce food preservatives, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture with Hoechst holding 60 percent of the equity
and its partner, the Nanjing Chemical Industrial Group Co., taking
the other 40 percent, will be capable of producing 4,000 tons of
sorbic acid and potassium sorbate a year. This will enable them to
capture a bigger share of Asia's food ingredient market, the
English-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Sorbic acid and potassium sorbate have proved to be highly
efficient and safe preservatives with a broad range of application
for food and beverage products.
</P>
<P>
The Nanning group is the largest chemical enterprise in
southern China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Hoechst, with
its focus on health care, agronutrition and industry, reported
32.6 billion US dollars in total sales last year.

<P>
ROME, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
held talks here today with South African Trade and Industry
Minister Alec Erwin on ways to expand bilateral trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries has grown steadily over the
last few years. Italy has moved up from being South Africa's
seventh largest trading partner to fifth. In 1995, Italian exports
to South Africa rose 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the two men agreed that the countries should further tap
the great potential for cooperation, between enterprises and trade
and financial sectors.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers signed an agreement on the promotion and
protection of investments as a follow up to a double taxation
agreement concluded at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed South Africa's negotiations for a free
trade agreement with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Erwin, who arrived in Rome today, will open an investment
conference Tuesday in Milan which is expected to be attended by a
large number of Italian businessmen and entrepreneurs from both
public and private sectors.
</P>

A similar conference to present Italy to the South African

<HEADLINE> Sino-Italian Aluminium Plant to Set An Example </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A major Sino-Italian co-operative
project, the Chengdu Aluminium Foil Plant was inaugurated by
Italy's Foreign Trade Minister Augusto Fantozzi yesterday in
Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan province.
</P>
<P>
It is to serve as an example for prospective Italian businesses
in the country, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Four aluminium plate and foil rolling lines, from Turin-based
Fata Hunter, a leading aluminium industry developer and
contractor, were announced to be in full operation at the plant, a
700 million yuan (84 million US dollars) investment.
</P>
<P>
With the 31 million US dollars worth of Italian-built
equipment, the plant is to produce high-grade aluminium plates and
foils for flexible packaging of products for the growing food and
pharmaceutical industries.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, leading a 130-member
business delegation, visited China last week. The delegation
remains in the country and Fantozzi, who leads the delegation now,
said a new era in cooperation with China is expected.
</P>
<P>
Fata Hunter, a key division of the diversified Fata industrial
group, also has provided the Chinese plant with technical
assistance and personnel training.
</P>
<P>
Fata Hunter was awarded the contract for the four rolling lines
for the plant in 1992 by the China National Technical Import and
Export Corp (CNTIC) in an international tender that elicited
competition from British, French and German companies.
</P>
<P>
Fata Managing Director Ignazio Moncada, a member of the Italian
delegation, said that the successful operation of the project had
proven CNTIC's decision wise.
</P>
<P>
The plant received financial support from the government of
Kuwait through the Kuwait Fund and the Italian SACE-Medicocredito
through export credits.

<HEADLINE> Hebei Revives State Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Hebei province is renewing its
campaign to invigorate its 14,000 State-owned enterprises,
according to China Daily today.
</P>
<P>
A major step to stimulate the drive, according to Deputy
Governor Guo Shichang, is to get more firms to follow the
successful example of the State-owned Handan Iron and Steel Group
Co Ltd, which not only has survived fierce market competition, but
is thriving.
</P>
<P>
Some 6,723 State-owned enterprises are now involved in the
campaign, Guo said, of which 3,892 have improved their management
procedures since the drive started in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Enlightened by the example of the Handan Group, 1,345
enterprises have adapted to compete in a market economy and now
offer workers incentives for better performance.
</P>
<P>
The Handan Group was a money-losing business in the days of
central economic planning. When the State began pressing its
enterprises to become market-oriented, Handan took appropriate
measures to meet the requirements of surviving in a market economy.
</P>
<P>
Under a centralized plan, prices were determined by what it
cost to manufacture goods. The price was far higher than the
market was willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
Shoved into the fierce market economy, where it was sink or
swim, Handan priced its products in line with what customers were
willing to pay. Meanwhile, Handan cut production and management
costs by eliminating waster and inefficient managerial practices.
</P>
<P>
Handan stood out like a beacon amid many other iron and steel
producers which had failed to adjust to the often brutal market
conditions and continued to bleed money. Handan paid off its debts
and began to make money. Last year, it reported a profit of 700
million yuan (84 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Another step to revitalize the province's State enterprises is
to encourage and support the development of large State firms,
particularly those with comparatively good performance records,
Guo said.
</P>
<P>
The province will support and encourage the development of 100
such companies, Guo said.
</P>
<P>
Hebei intends to create 30 pillar industry groups by the year
2000, the deputy governor said.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government is expected to offer a set of
preferential policies to enterprises that upgrade their
technologies, develop their funding sources and move into the
export-import trade.
</P>
<P>
Hebei will not neglect its smaller firms, Guo said. The
province has 10,780 small State firms employing 700,000
workers. Their assets come to 29.1 billion yuan (3.5 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Although these firms do not play a vital role in Hebei's
economy, they contribute to it by providing re-employment
opportunities to local workers and revenue to the county-level
governments.
</P>
<P>
To salvage the money-losing small businesses, Guo said, many
have merged, or become limited corporations or share-holding
companies with interests spread among several enterprises.

BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A major exhibition is to be held in
Beijing which will focus on the economic achievements of people of
Chinese origin living all over the world, according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the September event, the first of its kind
in China, will include a second show dedicated to displaying art
works by women of Chinese origin.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to encourage overseas Chinese to contribute more to
the prosperity of the mainland, said Zhang Qi, director of the
China Women and Children Development Center.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 enterprises in the United States, Thailand,
Malaysia, Singapore and other countries have so far applied to

said Zhang, whose center is sponsoring the two shows.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day exhibition, meetings for technological
exchanges, product shows, trade talks and discussions with senior
officials from the Chineses Government and its financial
departments will be arranged for the exhibitors, she said. This
will be a chance to give an overview of the country's investment
policies and priorities, it will also act as a warning to avoid
random investments which do not suit the State situation.

<HEADLINE> Vast Forest Area Springs Up in Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 2.2 million hectares of
bare land in China was converted into forest during the spring,
said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
More than half the year's tree planting plan had been
accomplished by the end of April, according to the Ministry of
Forestry.
</P>
<P>
In fact, it has almost certainly exceeded that quota, said Chen
Yingfa, a ministry official.
</P>
<P>
This year is regarded as critical to achieve the country's
afforestation target of raising China's forest coverage to 15.5
percent by the year 2000, compared with the present 13.92 percent.
</P>
<P>
In general, spring forest conversion accounts for a large
percentage of the total in a year in China.
</P>
<P>
Most of the trees this spring were planted by a land-based
workforce. But China also deploys airplanes which encircle
mountains to plant and nurture trees in high and remote areas that
are difficult to reach.
</P>
<P>
Many volunteers in major cities took part in the spring tree
planting campaign, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping, the late senior Chinese leader who died in
February, had been a primary advocate of the tree planting drive.
</P>
<P>
More than 4.5 million people in Beijing volunteered to plant
trees this spring. And about 100 million trees were planted by
volunteers in Chongqing, doubling the city's target for the whole
year.
</P>
<P>
More and more farmers would like to plant trees on their land
rather than cultivate less-lucrative crops, Chen said. This is in
line with the forestry-coverage policies in provinces such as
Shaanxi with its barren Loess Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen is one of the cities which has increased its
investment to promote afforestation.
</P>
<P>
It invested more than 100 million yuan (12 million US dollars)
this year to plant trees, half of which will be used to green
roads.

<HEADLINE> NZ to Close Five TV Stations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Five regional television
stations in New Zealand will soon go off the air to make way for a
youth-oriented station, local newspaper The Dominion reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The stations to be closed are located in the five major cities:
Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, Dunedin and Hamiton. A total
of 120 people are expected to lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a TVNZ source as saying that the new-look
youth station is to be based in Auckland and comes as a
"competitive response" to the plans of the privately owned TV3 to
start a new youth channel at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The mayors of the Wellington region issued a statement last
night, opposing the closure. But a spokesman for Communications
Minister Maurice Williamson has said that it is up to TVNZ what it
does with its regional stations.
</P>
<P>
TVNZ is owned by the government. But there is no need to get
government approval for the move to a youth station because it
does not involve a big capital investment, the TVNZ source was
quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Israel Urged to End Its Occupation of Palestine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A UN committee said today
that the international committee must recommit itself to ending
the decade-long illegal occupation by Israel of the Palestinian
territory, including Jerusalem and other Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting to mark the 30th anniversary of the Israeli
occupation, the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable
Rights of the Palestinian People said that as a direct result of
the Israeli occupation, the Palestinian people were living at
hostages in their own land and had not been able to enjoy their
inalienable rights under the UN Charter and the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
In a statement delivered at the meeting, Ibra Deguene Ka of
Senegal, chairman of the Palestinian Rights Committee, said that
the Middle East peace process remained laborious, intense and
difficult. The Palestinian people were surrounded by the thicket
of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, including Jerusalem and
the Gaza Strip. Declared Israeli plans for new settlements
jeopardized the livelihood of present and future generations of
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"Thirty years of occupation had a devastating impact on the
economic activity of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russian ambassador Sergey Lavrov, president of the Security
Council for June, said that as the Palestinian people were going
through a crucial transition phase, fraught with set-backs, it was
of paramount importance that the international community continued
to work hard to make the peace process a genuine success.
</P>
<P>
Felipe Mabilangan, vice-president of the General Assembly,
reading out a statement by Assembly President Razali Ismail, said
the question of Palestine remained the most intractable conflict
situation in the history of the United Nations. It was regrettable
that the prospect of a just and durable peace for the peoples of
Palestine and the Middle East was now seriously at risk and had
been jeopardized owing to recent actions taken by the Israeli
Government, he said.
</P>
<P>
Julio Londono-Paredes of Colombia, reading a statement by the
President of Colombia in his capacity as chairman of the Movement
of Non-Aligned Countries, said that the decision to proceed with
the settlements at Jabal Abu Ghneim, in flagrant violation of the
Madrid and Oslo agreements, had altered the atmosphere of
cordiality and frankness in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
At this delicate juncture, the Non-Aligned Movement reiterated
its unflinching support for the legitimate struggle of the
Palestinian people for self-determination and independence, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Arizal Effendi of Indonesia, speaking on behalf of his foreign
minister in his capacity as chairman of the 24th Islamic
Conference of Foreign Ministers, urged Israel to fully and
consistently comply with the provisions of its agreements with the
Palestinians and proceed with final status negotiations, based on
recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinians as an
independent state.
</P>
<P>
Machivenyika Tobia Mapuranga of Zimbabwe, reading a message
from the president of Zimbabwe in his capacity as chairman of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), stated that the OAU had kept
the situation in the Middle East, and especially Palestine, as
permanent items on its agenda and had consistently opposed any
attempts to derail the peace process. The OAU considered all
measures and actions taken by Israel to change the legal status of
Jerusalem as null and void, as they violated the letter and spirit
of the Declaration of Principles, he said.
</P>
<P>
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and observers for Palestine and
for the League of Arab States also made statements at today's
meeting.

WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin said today that the U.S. government still supports a strong
dollar despite the U.S. currency reaching a six-month low against
the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
"We favor a strong dollar as we always have, and for the
reasons we always have -- it helps keep inflation down, it helps
keep interest rates down, both of which are good for the economy,"
Rubin said.
</P>

Rubin made the remark when he was questioned at a White House
briefing today on congressional budget negotiations as the dollar
fell again in early New York trading to 1.7143 German marks and
112.63 Japanese yen.

<HEADLINE> China to Host 1999 Universal Postal Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The People's Republic of China will
host the last Universal Postal Congress in the 20th century,
according to an official agreement signed here today between China
and the Universal Postal Union (UPU).
</P>
<P>
The next Universal Postal Congress will be held in Beijing from
August 23 to September 15, 1999. China's Minister of Posts and
Telecommunications Wu Jichuan and Director General of the
International Bureau of the UPU Thomas Leavey signed the agreement
at the UPU's headquarters in the Swiss capital of Bern.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Wu Jichuan said that the
Chinese government attaches great importance to the development of
the post and is there therefore giving special attention to the
upcoming Universal Postal Congress.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin is the honorary chairman of the
Chinese Organizing Committee for the Congress established on July
18, 1996. What President Jiang has written for the Congress,
"Developing the modern post to meet social needs," has expressed
his expectations for the progress of the post in China and other
parts of the world, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Leavey stressed that China will take up an important leadership
role after the congress as the chairman of the UPU's newly elected
Council of Administration. The host country will further benefit
by the large number of foreign visitors attending the Congress
while Chinese and other stamps will be on show at the philatelic
exhibition to be held during the congress, Leavey said.
</P>
<P>
He said the UPU congress should further result in development
opportunities for staff members of the Chinese Department of Posts
and Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 delegates from 189 postal administrations of the
UPU's member countries, restricted postal unions and various
governmental and non-governmental organizations are expected to
attend one of the biggest international gatherings on the Chinese
calendar for 1999.
</P>
<P>
Leavey said the Beijing congress is of special significance as
it will take place at the dawn of the next millennium and will
serve as a platform for postal services to discuss ways and means
to ensure that the postal service keeps track with the latest
technological developments in a highly competitive communications
environment and adapts to the new realities of a rapidly changing
economic world.
</P>
<P>
As one of the United Nations agencies, the UPU was founded in
1874. The Universal Postal Congress, held once every five years,
is the highest governing body of the UPU.

<P>
LONDON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Shares on Europe's major stock
markets mixed today, with London finishing higher and Frankfurt
and Paris ending lower.
</P>
<P>
British shares closed with solid gains as investors shrugged
off a weak gilts market and tumbling European bourses and instead
looked to Wall Street, where the Dow scaled new peaks, dealers
said. The benchmark FTSE-100 share index ended 41.7 points higher
at 4,686.7.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares turned sharply lower after a strong
start in the morning, as an upsurge in worries about monetary
union offset initial optimism about U.S. economic prospects. The
DAX index closed down 27.86 points at 3,667.43, dropping nearly 70
points from the historic intraday high of 3,734.05 points set in
pre-bourse electronic dealings.
</P>
<P>
French shares ended 1.22 percent lower, after a sudden panic
over the future of the European Economic and Monetary Union. The
CAC-40 index closed down 33.05 at 2,686.2.

<P>
SARAJEVO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Bosnia's four religions
today jointly called on the leadership and people of the country
to pursue "a durable peace based on truth, justice and common
living."
</P>
<P>
The joint statement was signed by Dr Mustafa Ceric, chief of
the Islamic Community, chief priest Metropolit Nikolaj of Orthodox
Church, Cardinal Pulijic of Roman Catholic and Jakob Finci,
president of the Jeswish Community.

The religious leaders said in the statement that they were
concerned by the "visibly slow and inefficient implementation of
the civilian provisions of Dayton peace accords and deeply
disturbed by "recent unpleasant events in the Zone of Separation,"
referring to demolition of abandoned houses and clashs between
Muslim refugees and Serb police in the inter-entity boundary
areas.
</P>
<P>
"The peoples of Bosnia-Herzegovina have undergone enormous
suffering," said the statement. "Our task now is to establish a
durable peace based on truth, justice and common living."
</P>
<P>
The leaders condemned specially the acts of hatred, the
obstruction of free right to return, the acts of revenge and the
abuse of the media with the aim of spreading hatred. They also
expressed their concern at the burning of houses, the desecration
of religious buildings and the destruction of graveyards.

<HEADLINE> US Says NATO Membership Not Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States today said
that a membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
is not a "free lunch" and new members would have to pay.
</P>
<P>
"Joining NATO is not free. This is about security," said Robert
Hunter, U.S. ambassador to NATO. "It's about mutual pledges of one
country to another."
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference here that any country that thinks
it's going to be free should not apply for the membership.
</P>
<P>
NATO leaders would choose the first group of countries as new
members at their special summit meeting in Madrid in July. Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic are on top of the list.
</P>
<P>
Estimates on the cost range from eight to 10 billion U.S.
dollars during the next 10 years covering the first wave of
expansion.
</P>
<P>
Hunter said that there are three levels of the cost, including
"what new countries do for themselves," NATO itself and assistance
to new members by individual NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
"Now all of the NATO allies will accept their full fair share
of this NATO budget, because we have worked this out many years in
the past. We pay -- the United States -- about 26 percent on
average," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. estimates that it will have to invest between 150
million U.S. dollars and 200 million U.S. dollars a year in NATO's
expansion in the next 12 years.

<HEADLINE> Ralston Drops Bid for US Joint Chiefs Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Air Force General Joseph
Ralston today withdrew his name from consideration as the chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff because of an adulterous affair a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
Ralston said in a statement that he made the decision "with a
sense of regret."
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen, in a statement issued at the
Pentagon, said Ralston would remain as vice chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
"General Ralston believes that a prolonged fight for Senate
confirmation would be harmful to his family and would be a
distraction from other serious national security issues," Cohen
said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Ralston was considered the top candidate for the seat until he
admitted to having had an adulterous affair 13 years ago and
that brought criticism from lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Several high-ranking officers have retired or been relieved
recently after admitting to improper sexual conduct.
</P>
<P>
Seeing the lawmakers were not supportive, Ralston informed
Cohen of his intentions this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> US Computer Software Giant to Acquire Cable TV Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Microsoft Corporation, the
largest software designer in the United States, is nearing a deal
to invest 1 billion U.S. dollars in the Comcast Corporation, the
nation's sixth-largest cable television operator, the New York
Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The move, which was said to be the most aggressive beyond the
software arena and into the media business, would give the
computer software giant a crucial foothold in controlling and
distributing television programming, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In one deal after another over the last two years, the
Microsoft Corporation has shown its determination to have a big
role in creating and distributing information and entertainment
over whatever technologies exist or may emerge.
</P>
<P>
In the current deal, the company's immediate interest is in
using Comcast's distribution pipeline for the Microsoft Network,
an information service that the company has created to compete
with on-line services.
</P>
<P>
If completed, the deal would match up the nation's largest
software designer with one of the cable industry's most
independent family-owned companies. Comcast, which is based in
Philadelphia in the eastern United States, has built a 4 billion
U.S. dollar company with properties in cable, television, cellular
telephone and home shopping.
