<HEADLINE> Report: Florida Agency Stole Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Administrators for one of South Florida's largest  
not-for-profit social service agencies siphoned off tax dollars to 
boost their salaries while neglecting care for their mentally 
retarded clients, a state investigation found. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive director of Metatherapy Institute Inc. was fired  
and the agency forced into receivership in early March after state 
investigators found she padded her annual salary to $180,000 and 
drove a 1997 Jaguar XJ6 insured with agency funds. The agency was 
on the brink of financial collapse, investigators said in a report 
reviewed by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Metatherapy, which also provides services to the homeless, is  
the fourth not-for-profit agency serving the mentally handicapped 
in Miami-Dade County to be put into receivership in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping tabs on not-for-profit providers has become increasingly  
difficult as government hires private companies to provide a 
variety of services. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no controls. We have little accountability. Our social  
services delivery system needs a major overhaul,'' Gov. Jeb Bush 
said when he learned of Metatherapy's collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Contracts that aren't complied with ought to be terminated. We  
ought to enforce the law if people are taking money,'' Bush said. 
``This is a white-collar crime. It is as bad as someone with a gun 
walking into a business and saying, `Give me the money in your cash 
register.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The financial problems at Metatherapy, which takes in at least  
$4.6 million a year in state contracts and federal grants, surfaced 
when a former employee stepped forward. The investigation found 
Metatherapy hid financial discrepancies by falsifying medication 
and safety records, sometimes with names of sick or vacationing 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Department of Children and Families on March 10 fired  
Maureen Robinson, Metatherapy's director of 20 years. Robinson was 
pulling money from several grants for her salary and may have used 
Metatherapy funds to insure and even lease the Jaguar, the 
department said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said they are still trying to untangle the  
company's finances. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, executive compensation is a major contributing factor  
to the financial difficulties the agency has been experiencing,'' 
said Anita Bock, appointed by the state to oversee Metatherapy. 
``Every time a new grant gets written, there is a new layer of 
executive compensation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators noted the salary of Annette Green, a top  
administrator, increased 51 percent from $58,000 to $88,000 in 1996 
-- about the time Metatherapy received a federal grant to provide 
services to the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said Green's pay had increased to $127,260 by 1998.  
When asked about her salary, Green said it increased ``not 
dramatically at all. Slightly, very slightly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, who has hired an attorney, had no comment. Her  
husband, George Robinson, said, ``She has never had a forum to 
respond. She was terminated without any discussion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state investigation also found that many members of  
Metatherapy's board of directors were being paid as consultants to 
the institute, a direct conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	The state has asked Metatherapy to repay $62,800 for not living  
up to a contract to provide alcohol, drug abuse and mental health 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Bock, former director of the Children and Families Department  
for Miami-Dade and Monroe counties, said Metatherapy is worth 
salvaging. It provides good programs to 63 retarded adults who 
yearn for jobs and independence, helps move homeless families off 
the streets and provides much needed counseling to women struggling 
with substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	On the palm-studded main campus south of Miami, residents live  
in bungalows and relax under cabanas. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people whose lives are affected by this,'' Bock  
said. ``The department would not have stepped forward in good faith 
if it didn't believe what is here is very much worth saving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In their 43-page report, investigators found that medication,  
including psychotropic drugs that must be given on a timely basis, 
were frequently given late or not at all. The state probe cited 52 
instances in which one resident did not receive medication as 
prescribed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lots of patients were getting seizure medicine,'' said Tracy  
Collier, the staffer who made the allegations against Metatherapy 
after he was fired last year. ``I knew one patient who if he didn't 
get his 1 p.m. medication he would have a seizure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green, who runs the developmentally disabled program, said  
Collier was a disgruntled employee, most of whose allegations were 
never substantiated. She acknowledged periodic oversights regarding 
medication, saying, ``You can give clients all the medication that 
was prescribed and they will still have a seizure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shelly Slapion-Foote, whose 41-year-old brother has lived 16  
years at one of the Miami area's three Metatherapy group homes, 
said the disabled clients considered Robinson a mother figure. She 
feels the director could have been fined or reprimanded, not fired. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the continuity, the normalcy, has been taken away from  
them because of this,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Metatherapy's extensive homeless program, financed by more than  
$1.4 million in federal grants and a county tax, has not been 
affected so far, but there are concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly don't want to hear of agencies that are one  
reimbursement away from being homeless themselves,'' said Hilda 
Fernandez, executive director of the county's Homeless Trust.

<HEADLINE> Strong 'Forces' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The romantic road-movie ``Forces of Nature''  
blew away competition at the box office in its second weekend, 
beating out new films like the voyeuristic comedy ``EDtv'' and 
retro crime-drama ``The Mod Squad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Forces of Nature,'' starring Ben Affleck as an uptight  
groom-to-be who falls for free-spirited Sandra Bullock on the way 
to his wedding, grossed an estimated $9.6 million in ticket sales, 
according to figures released Sunday by Exhibitor Relations Co., 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``EDtv,'' the Ron Howard-directed comedy about a dim-bulb video  
store clerk played by Matthew McConaughey, who agrees to have every 
minute of his life captured by television, grossed $9 million for 
second place. 
</P>
<P>
	The film did favorable business, but came nowhere near the $31.5  
million opening weekend gross of last summer's ``The Truman Show,'' 
another tale of a man who lives his life on television. 
</P>
<P>
	``Analyze This'' dropped to No. 3 in its fourth weekend, earning  
an estimated $8.8 million. The comedy about an anxiety-ridden 
mobster portrayed by Robert De Niro with Billy Crystal as his 
psychiatrist placed second last week after spending two weeks in 
the top spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Mod Squad,'' an updated version of the 1960s TV show about  
three youths who become undercover cops to stay out of jail, opened 
with $6.1 million for fourth place. 
</P>
<P>
	With its pounding soundtrack, MTV-style editing and hip stars  
Claire Danes, Giovanni Ribisi and Omar Epps, the film was geared 
more toward a younger audience than the baby boomers who may 
remember the original. 
</P>
<P>
	The low-budget children's cartoon ``Doug's 1st Movie'' hit the  
big screens with $4.4 million in its opening weekend for No. 5, 
tying with ``Shakespeare in Love.'' Named best picture at last 
week's Academy Awards, ``Shakespeare'' rose from last week's No. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess the small screen doesn't work for the big screen,''  
said Robert Bucksbaum of Reel Source, Inc., noting the lackluster 
business of this week's new releases. ``All three of them were 
based on television projects or were based on television shows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Chuck Biane, general sales manager of ``Doug'' distributor  
Buena Vista, said the cartoon's small budget makes it an easy 
success. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doug's 1st Movie'' ``is one of those rare films where making a  
profit is easy because of low production costs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life is Beautiful'' climbed back into the top ten at No. 8  
after being named best foreign film at the Oscars, where its 
exuberant star and director, Roberto Benigni, also won for best 
actor. 
</P>
<P>
	Clint Eastwood's ``True Crime'' was No. 7 with $3.3 million,  
while ``Baby Geniuses'' and ``Cruel Intentions'' rounded out the 
top ten with $2.7 million and $2.4 million, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North  
American theaters. Final figures were to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Forces of Nature,'' $9.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``EDtv,'' $9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Analyze This,'' $8.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``The Mod Squad,'' $6.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. (tie) ``Doug's 1st Movie,'' $4.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. (tie) ``Shakespeare in Love,'' $4.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``True Crime,'' $3.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Life is Beautiful,'' $3.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Baby Geniuses,'' $2.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Cruel Intentions,'' $2.4 million.

<HEADLINE> Panel Backs SBC-Ameritech Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Illinois Commerce Commission hearing officers  
Monday conditionally recommended approval of SBC Communications' 
takeover of rival Ameritech Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite heated arguments from consumer groups and rivals who  
contend the merger is anticompetitive and would result in few 
benefits to Ameritech's customers, the hearing officers said they 
could find no such grounds for rejecting the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	But they did recommend the full commission approve the merger  
with conditions applied -- largely the divestitures of certain 
properties, which Ameritech and SBC officials had already said they 
would make. 
</P>
<P>
	The full ICC is likely to accept the hearing officers'  
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendation comes less than a week after the U.S. Justice  
Department also gave conditional approval to the deal, valued at 
$55 billion when it was announced last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal still requires approval from Ohio regulators and the  
Federal Communications Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately today, the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow PUSH  
Coalition issued a statement of support for the merger, saying it 
would benefit consumers, workers and businesses. Ameritech's two 
major unions also have publicly endorsed the deal after receiving 
assurances there will be no net job losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritech would become a subsidiary of SBC under the proposed  
stock swap that would create a 13-state system with 57 million 
phone lines, or about one-third of the nation's total. 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritech operates in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and  
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC operates Southwestern Bell, Pacific Bell, Southern New  
England Telephone Co. and Nevada Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritech and SBC have said they hope to close the deal by the  
end of the summer.

<HEADLINE> Racer Al Schill Jr. Dead at 24 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RACINE, Wis. (AP) -- Al Schill Jr., who followed his father into  
stock car racing at 16 and became a frequent winner at area tracks, 
was found dead in his garage Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	One day after a second-place finish at Rockford, Ill., the  
24-year-old Schill was found by his girlfriend. She was awakened by 
a carbon monoxide detector, the Racine County Sheriff's Department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the race in Rockford, Schill celebrated with family and  
friends and returned to his town of Norway home about 2:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Schill stayed in his car to listen to a song on the radio while  
his girlfriend went to bed, the statement said. She was awakened by 
the detector about 6:30 a.m. and found him in his car, which had 
its ignition shut off and the radio on. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death remained under investigation pending results  
of laboratory tests. A friend of the family, speaking on behalf of 
Schill's parents, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel they did not 
think he would commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Schill's father, Al Schill Sr., won four track championships at  
Hales Corners Speedway in Franklin and six at Slinger Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Schill began racing late-model stock cars when he  
was 16, earned rookie of the year honors at Slinger Speedway and 
was winning regularly by 1995, the year he won his first 
championship in the late-model division at Lake Geneva Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he raced regularly at Slinger and Madison  
International Speedway in Oregon, while also working fulltime as 
the manager at the salvage yard. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1997, the Schills became the first father-son duo in  
Slinger Speedway history to finish 1-2 in a feature event. The son 
passed the father for the lead and pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't even wave when he went by,'' the elder Schill said  
afterward. ``I wanted to race some more, but he went right on 
around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schill also was a champion wrestler, winning the 135-pound title  
in the 1993 state public schools meet as a senior at Franklin High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last few years, Schill made 53 starts in the NASCAR  
Re/Max series and its predecessor, the ARTGO Challenge Series. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished second Sunday in the season opener for the Re/Max  
Series, a touring series that races primarily in the upper Midwest. 
That tied his best finish in the series. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his father and mother, Gwen, Schill is survived  
by two sisters.

<HEADLINE> Xerox Buys SET Electronique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Xerox has purchased Paris-based SET  
Electronique, which makes high speed printers, for an undisclosed 
sum. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately-held SET Electronique builds high speed printers that  
use newsprint style rolls of paper and print 200-1,000 pages per 
minute, the company said Sunday. The machines are used mostly by 
banks and utilities to print statements and direct mail packages. 
</P>
<P>
	Xerox, a leader in cut-sheet production printing technology, has  
less than 10 percent of the market for rolled paper-style printers, 
Jim Hamilton, a consultant with CAP Ventures Inc. in Norwell, 
Mass., told the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle in Monday's 
editions. The company's only other competitors are IBM Corp. and 
Netherlands-based Oce N.V., he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are now in a unique position to become the strategic vendor  
of choice for any type of printing requirements, from desktop to 
high volume production, from cut sheet to continuous feed, from 
black and white to highlight color and full color,'' said Anshoo 
Gupta, president of Xerox's Production Systems Group. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, Karl Cerny, director of Xerox's production  
systems group, will become chairman of the new SET Electronique 
operations. SET Electronique's Georges Viallix will remain with the 
company as a director. 
</P>
<P>
	SET Electronique employs about 100 workers in France, Belgium,  
Italy and the United Kingdom. The company has about 400 blue chip 
customers.

<HEADLINE> Study Eyes Test-Tube Fertilization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A widely used technique for test-tube  
fertilization might cause genetic abnormalities in the fertilized 
egg, researchers suggest in a study of monkey eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	But doctors should continue to use the ``ICSI'' technique and  
couples who have used it or are thinking about it should not be 
alarmed, said co-author Gerald Schatten of the Oregon Health 
Sciences University in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	The abnormalities might stop a pregnancy naturally, or they can  
be detected by amniocentesis, allowing couples to terminate the 
pregnancy if they wish, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schatten and his colleagues used ICSI on rhesus monkey eggs and  
reported the results in the April issue of the journal Nature 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	They found an altered choreography between the sperm and  
surrounding egg, because the sperm head still carried two proteins 
that normally are stripped off when it penetrates the egg membrane. 
</P>
<P>
	Schatten also said he can only speculate that ICSI might cause  
the abnormalities, or improper numbers of X or Y chromosomes. Even 
if it does, most cases of such abnormalities after ICSI would 
probably be due to defective DNA from the father, rather than the 
procedure itself. 
</P>
<P>
	ICSI, used for treating male infertility, allows doctors to  
fertilize an egg by injecting a single sperm. Experts familiar with 
Schatten's article said studies in humans show the technique is 
safe.

<HEADLINE> Crocodiles May Have Been 30 Feet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A giant dinosaur-munching crocodile that grew to 30 feet in  
length and tipped the scales at 10,000 pounds achieved its 
gargantuan proportions by sheer longevity, new research suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighty million-year-old fossils of Deinosuchus, or ``Terror  
Crocodile,'' contain annual growth layers like tree rings in the 
bony, armor-like plates that lined the saltwater reptile's back and 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Microscopic analysis of those bones suggest Deinosuchus was a  
slow-grower like modern crocs, but grew much larger by living to 
about 50 years -- some two decades longer, paleontologist Gregory M. 
Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You either grow very fast like the dinosaurs or take the slow  
road and extend your development over a long period of time. That's 
what these animals did. They just prolonged their growth,'' said 
Erickson, a postdoctoral fellow in mechanical engineering at 
Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a polarizing microscope, he and a colleague studied  
microstructures inside bony plates called scutes from specimens 
that grew to about 27 feet in length. 
</P>
<P>
	They found evidence that during their peak growth period the  
huge reptiles grew just under a foot a year. At about age 35, their 
growth tapered off. Modern crocodiles' growth spurt lasts until 
about age 10 and they rarely live beyond 30 years, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Christopher A. Brochu of Chicago's Field Museum of  
Natural History reported their findings March 18 in the journal 
Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	The first Deinosuchus remains -- teeth and pieces of a skull and  
jaw -- were discovered in North Carolina in 1858. But it wasn't 
until 1909, after larger finds in Texas and Montana, that the 
fossils were described as belonging to a giant extinct crocodile. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, what emerged from the fossil record was more like an  
alligator than a crocodile. It had a broad, flat alligator-like 
snout unlike most crocs' thin narrow snouts, said Brochu, a 
postdoctoral research scientist at the Field Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	And that huge snout was lined with dagger-like teeth 5 to 6  
inches in length that are similar to those wielded by Tyrannosaurus 
Rex. 
</P>
<P>
	While T-Rex ruled the land, Deinosuchus (pronounced  
Dine-oh-sue-cuss) loomed large along the estuaries and shores of a 
shallow tropical sea that covered much of North America's present 
interior. It probably dined on dinosaurs, though teeth marks found 
on the fossil shells of giant sea turtles suggest it was also on 
the terror crocodile's menu. 
</P>
<P>
	But Deinosuchus' reign during the late Cretaceous period was  
brief -- only about 10 million years. They became extinct about 80 
million years ago, perhaps falling victim to their inability to 
slake their enormous appetites. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gigantism is rare to evolve and tends not to lead onto other  
species compared with smaller animals. In this case, it was a dead 
end,'' Erickson said. ``Actually, it's a pretty good thing 
Deinosuchus isn't still around. It would be out attacking ships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The age of the dinosaurs ended about 65 million years ago, when  
scientists believe a comet or asteroid collided with Earth, 
creating a sudden ice age that snuffed out three-quarters of life. 
</P>
<P>
	Dinosaurs and their oversized croc cousins -- including a species  
of crocodile found in India that may have reached 40 feet in length 
-- perished. But smaller crocodiles lived on, and their lineage now 
extends back about 200 million years. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest existing crocodiles are saltwater crocs from  
Indonesia that have been recorded up to 18 feet in length and 2,000 
pounds in weight. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Stucky, chief curator of paleontology at the Denver  
Museum of Natural History, said the Deinosuchus findings are 
interesting because they show that dinosaurs, which scientists 
believe grew about as fast as mammals, didn't have a lock on 
reaching gigantic proportions. 
</P>
<P>
	Stucky also said crocodiles' slow-growing, more adaptable nature  
may be the reason they were able to weather the cataclysm that 
ended the reign of the dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be that something in their physiology helped them  
survive. They can go without food for a long time -- up to a year 
without eating -- and they're relatively cold-tolerant,'' Stucky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only fragments of Deinosuchus had been found until 1997, when  
paleontologists made a relatively big find at Texas' Big Bend 
National Park. That specimen includes a large portion of the 
animal's five-foot-long skull and lower jaw. It is still being 
chipped from its rocky tomb by University of Texas at Austin 
researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a pretty good piece of the skull and lower jaw, but  
the rest of the animal is just bits and pieces. We still don't know 
what the back end of this critter looks like,'' said Wann Langston 
Jr., a retired professor of geology at the University of Texas at 
Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Digging this out has been a big job. This thing was a  
monstrous creature.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Takes Break To Play Golf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton turned his attention away  
from a nearly constant focus on the Kosovo crisis Monday to play a 
round of golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton went to the Army-Navy Country Club in suburban Virginia  
shortly after he finished receiving an update from national 
security adviser Sandy Berger on the NATO mission in Kosovo. 
Apparently, Clinton wanted to take advantage of sunny weather with 
temperatures approaching 70 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Save for a few speeches and a journey to Camp David, the  
president has been virtually sequestered at the White House over 
the past six days, as NATO carried out air strikes against 
Yugoslavia for its repression of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	While at the golf course, Clinton placed telephone calls to  
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder 
of Germany. National security spokesman David Leavy said the 
leaders discussed the status of the air campaign; Serb action 
against Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, driving thousands of them from 
their homes; and Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's pending 
visit to Belgrade.

	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Stephanie White-McCarty spent the final  
minutes of her remarkable college basketball career writhing on the 
bench in pain and clutching an assistant coach's hand as her Purdue 
Boilermakers won the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarty, second on the school's scoring list, severely  
sprained her left ankle while missing a shot with less than five 
minutes remaining in Purdue's 62-45 win over Duke on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	She squirmed on the court, and spit her mouthpiece about 10 feet  
away as play continued. When play finally stopped, she was helped 
to the bench by teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Grimacing in pain, she sat on the bench as a trainer took off  
her left sneaker. White-McCarty then went to the end of the bench 
and had her ankle heavily taped, limping severely when she tried to 
walk. 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarty, who had 12 points in the game, then took a seat  
on the bench next to assistant coach Kerry Cremeans, tightly 
gripping the coach's left hand and still looking agonized. 
</P>
<P>
	Missing their leading scorer, the Boilermakers blew open a close  
game in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stephanie has meant so much to this program,'' teammate  
Michelle Duhart said. ``As soon as she went out, we became 
determined to rally around her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the win, teammate and best friend Ukari Figgs helped  
White-McCarty -- who was on crutches -- up to the victory stand as 
the Boilermakers received the championship trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	Figgs then also helped White-McCarty hop up four rungs on a  
ladder to become the first Purdue player to cut down part of the 
net at the San Jose Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what we stayed for,'' said White-McCarty, who remained  
at Purdue when many players left the team as it switched coaches 
twice during her tenure. ``The special group we have on this team 
makes it really nice and really special. It's been a lot of fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarty had X-rays on the ankle after the game and was not  
available for the post-game interview session. But coach Carolyn 
Peck said her star shooting guard left the court with a sense of 
satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you she's a happy young lady,'' Peck said.

<HEADLINE> Not Much Charm in Dubai World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Silver Charm traveled halfway  
around the world for this? 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 Kentucky Derby winner finished sixth in an eight-horse  
field at the $5 million Dubai World Cup, won by Almutawakel -- a 
44-1 shot owned by Dubai's ruling family. The 2-1 favorite hardly 
resembled the horse that won this showcase race last year, 
finishing 4 1/4 lengths back. It was Silver Charm's third loss in four 
races this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Silver Charm has had a history of bleeding, and without  
medication it just got bad and he got scared,'' said trainer Bob 
Baffert, who was at Turfway Park on Saturday to watch Kentucky 
Derby hopeful Straight Man finish fourth. ``I'm in mourning because 
of Silver Charm and Straight Man. When horses bleed, it just scares 
them and they don't run. That's what happened to Silver Charm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drugs used to control bleeding at many U.S. tracks are not  
allowed in Dubai. 
</P>
<P>
	``For some reason today, he just felt flat,'' said jockey Gary  
Stevens, who rode Silver Charm to victory in Dubai a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Had Silver Charm earned the winner's purse of $3 million, he  
would have moved past Skip Away and into the No. 2 spot in career 
earnings with $9.8 million. Cigar, now retired, is No. 1 at just 
under $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The two other U.S. horses in the 1 1/4-mile race were Malek, who  
finished second, a half-length short, and Victory Gallop, third, 1 1/2 
lengths behind the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Almutawakel, timed in 2:00.65, is owned by the Godolphin stables  
that belong to the Al Maktoum family. The bay colt came into 
prominence when he won the Prix Jean Prat. 
</P>
<P>
	Malek, fourth in Dubai last year, was ridden by Alex Solis and  
earned $1 million. Victory Gallop, the 1998 Belmont Stakes winner 
ridden by Jerry Bailey, won $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Malek had raced sparingly since his fourth place in Dubai last  
year. The 6-year-old Chilean-bred is trained by Dick Mandella, who 
has had a horse in all four Dubai World Cups. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll get it right someday,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Victory Gallop, a 4-year-old colt, is trained by Elliott Walden  
and owned by brothers Art, Jack and J.R. Preston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Victory Gallop ran well,'' Walden said. ``I thought in the  
straight that he could win, but the others were too strong for 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Central Park was fourth, followed by Daylami, Silver Charm,  
Running Stag and English Derby-winner High Rise. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of about 5,000 at the Nad Al Sheba course watched the  
horses break evenly at the start. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm quickly fell behind, trailing Central Park and  
Malek, and then dropped back even further and never threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew after two furlongs that it wasn't going to be his  
day,'' Stevens said. ``He was down on the rail, which was OK, but 
when I started to maneuver him out I did not have any horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With three furlongs to go, jockey Richard Hills sent Almutawakel  
into the lead, where he held off Malek's challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything was good for me,'' Hill said. ``The pace was not as  
strong as I thought, and I did everything I wanted out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Betting is not allowed in Dubai, in accordance with Islamic  
teachings. In North American simulcast wagering, the winner 
returned $91.30. 
</P>
<P>
	Almutawakel had lifetime earnings of $169,721 before Sunday.  
Silver Charm's earnings of more then $6.5 million matched the 
combined winnings of the seven other horses in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm was second in the Breeders' Cup Classic on Nov. 7  
at Churchill Downs and opened 1999 by taking the San Pasqual 
Handicap at Santa Anita. But he was third in the Donn Handicap at 
Gulfstream Park and the Santa Anita Handicap on March 6. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maktoums, who have won some of the biggest races in Europe,  
had half the horses in the field. High Rise, Daylami, Central Park 
and Almutawakel were making their dirt-racing and 1999 debuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every race has its own pleasure, but to win in Dubai is  
something special,'' said Sheik Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum, 
deputy ruler of Dubai.

<HEADLINE> Russia Moves To Curb Capital Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian government on Monday set a $5,000  
limit on the amount of hard currency Russian citizens can take out 
of the country legally. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cabinet met in a brief special session Monday to discuss  
capital flight from Russia, which Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov 
estimated at $20 billion to $25 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a huge sum,'' he said. ``The time has long passed when  
we should have erected a barrier to this, and we will erect a 
barrier to this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the new regulation, Russian citizens could take out  
virtually unlimited amounts of hard currency, as long as they had a 
bank declaration. 
</P>
<P>
	The customs service reported that according to all personal  
customs declarations submitted in 1998, some $10 billion had been 
exported from the country, according to a report on the ORT 
television station. Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Ignatiev said 
private individuals had submitted declarations for amounts as high 
as $1.5 million.

<HEADLINE> THAAD Missile Fails Test Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE, N.M. (AP) -- An antimissile missile  
failed today for the sixth time to hit a flying target and the 
prime contractor will have to pay the government $15 million for 
the miss. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately known why the Theater High-Altitude Area  
Defense missile failed to intercept the target missile this 
morning, said Bob Hunt, spokesman for the Army program executive 
office for air and missile defense in Huntsville, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	``The telemetry data is still coming in and they're still  
analyzing it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the THAAD missile has repeatedly failed to hit its  
target, Congress revised its contract with Lockheed Martin Corp., 
making the company financially liable for any misses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, Lockheed is going to pay us $15 million,'' Hunt said.  
</P>
<P>
	The test was the ninth in a series of 13 flight tests for the  
THAAD missile program and the sixth attempt at intercepting a 
missile. The system has cost $3.8 billion so far. 
</P>
<P>
	The target missile was launched from the northern end of the  
Army's restricted White Sands Missile Range in southern New Mexico, 
said Jim Eckles, a White Sands spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The target -- a modified Minuteman 2 missile called a Hera -- left  
behind a squiggly, colorful contrail seen as far away as Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	The THAAD is designed to strike enemy missiles at higher  
altitudes than the Pac-3 antimissile missile, which for the first 
time hit a flying target missile March 15 over White Sands, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The THAAD missile system is being developed to protect U.S. and  
allied troops from attacks by short- and medium-range missiles such 
as the Scuds used in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	The missile is designed to destroy, early in their flight, enemy  
missiles that could be carrying chemical, biological or nuclear 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	There were four THAAD missile flight tests in 1995, two in 1996  
and one each in 1997 and 1998.

<HEADLINE> Figgs Had That Championship Look </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Four minutes remained, the game was  
still close and Ukari Figgs was helping her injured teammate, 
All-American Stephanie White-McCarty, off the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	On the verge of its biggest moment ever, Purdue suddenly was in  
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Then coach Carolyn Peck looked at Figgs and she knew right away:  
the Boilermakers were not going to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	``When she helped Steph over to the sidelines, she gets that  
look in the eye,'' Peck said. ``And the rest of the team just 
follows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On this night, the Boilermakers followed Figgs to the national  
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-9 senior with quick feet and a disposition of steel  
shook off a scoreless first half to drop in 18 second-half points 
as Purdue beat Duke 62-45 Sunday for its first NCAA title. 
</P>
<P>
	It was just the opposite of her game against Louisiana Tech in  
the semifinals Friday night, but so typical of Figgs: she delivered 
when the Boilermakers needed her the most. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's just the way our team flows,'' said Figgs, named the  
outstanding player in the Final Four. ``Somebody goes down, we 
rally around them. I think we did a great job at the end of the 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarty collapsed to the floor in pain with a sprained  
left ankle after missing a shot with a little more than four 
minutes to play. By the time the officials could stop the game with 
4:01 remaining, Duke's Hilary Howard had made a 3-pointer and 
Purdue led only 47-42. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone had to take charge if Purdue was to hold on, and there  
really was only one choice. It had to be Figgs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steph and I have been through so much together and we dreamed  
about it,'' Figgs said. ``We talked about winning the national 
championship and I knew that it was hurting her probably more not 
being on the court than her ankle or foot was. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to go out and win it for her and myself and the  
rest of this team, but just more for her at that time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Figgs made a steal and sank six free throws in the final 2:50 as  
Purdue pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody stepped up and played great and Ukari carried us,''  
White-McCarty said. 
</P>
<P>
	The only thing Figgs carried in the first half was the burden of  
her lousy shooting. After scoring 18 points in the opening half 
against Louisiana Tech, Figgs was 0-for-7 with four turnovers in 
the first 20 minutes against Duke and her team trailed 22-17. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone suggested Figgs might have been sick.  
</P>
<P>
	``No, I wasn't sick. I don't even know what I was feeling,'' she  
said. ``There were a lot of emotions going through my mind and I 
was thinking about a lot of things, and I think that might have 
been one of the reasons I came out not as aggressively as I usually 
am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There certainly was a lot for Figgs to think about. She and  
White-McCarty had stayed behind in 1996 after most of their 
teammates bailed out following the dismissal of coach Lin Dunn. In 
their first three seasons at Purdue, the two close friends had 
three different coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, Figgs' grandmother died right before a game at Penn  
State. Figgs made it to the game by taking a three-hour cab ride 
from Pittsburgh and scored 21 points while playing all but one 
minute as Purdue won in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	After all that, one lousy half wasn't going to rattle her.  
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like I let my team down,'' Figgs said. ``I wasn't  
aggressive. I wasn't attacking the basket. I just knew I had 20 
minutes to be either a winner or a loser. I don't like being a 
loser.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fittingly, Figgs scored the last points of the game with two  
free throws. When the final buzzer sounded 41.7 seconds later, she 
made a beeline for the bench to embrace White-McCarty. 
</P>
<P>
	They seemed immune to the celebration raging around them, one  
last special moment together.

<HEADLINE> Potential Jury Warned in Gay Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Potential jurors in the trial of a man  
charged with the beating death of Matthew Shepard were warned 
Monday to expect intense media scrutiny, the possibility of three 
weeks away from their families and graphic evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Murder is not a pretty subject,'' prosecutor Cal Rerucha said.  
``These pictures are very graphic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Henderson, 21, is charged with first-degree murder,  
kidnapping and aggravated robbery in last October's death of 
Shepard, a gay college student. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Wyatt Skaggs also warned jurors to expect  
disturbing testimony, but he told them they should not be swayed by 
national opinion in the case. In the aftermath of the killing, some 
dismissed Laramie as a small-minded backwater. 
</P>
<P>
	The second panel was called in after attorneys went through the  
first pool of 71, dismissing two-thirds of them in the first three 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Albany County District Court officials plan to select 12 jurors  
and three alternates and begin opening statements early next week. 
Officials ended last week with 26 potential jurors, yet they wanted 
a larger pool. 
</P>
<P>
	Police allege Henderson and Aaron McKinney, both 21, pretended  
to be homosexuals, took Shepard to a remote area east of Laramie 
and attacked him Oct. 6, leaving him bloodied and tied to a fence. 
Shepard died five days later.

<HEADLINE> Fans Await Venus Vs. Serena Rematch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. (AP) -- Tennis fans, tournament promoters and  
Serena Williams are ready for a rematch. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Williams wants to recover from Sunday first.  
</P>
<P>
	As the father of the finalists at the Lipton Championships,  
Williams admitted that the occasion was emotionally wrenching. He 
led the cheers at the start of the match and was in his seat at the 
finish, when Venus completed a 6-1, 4-6, 6-4 victory for her second 
consecutive Lipton title. 
</P>
<P>
	But during the match, Richard's thoughts turned to the poor  
neighborhood in Compton, Calif., where the family lived before 
moving to Florida in 1991. The memories stirred his emotions and 
sent him out the stadium tunnel for a calming cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' hands shook during a news conference the day before  
Serena played big sister Venus, and he wasn't much calmer at a news 
conference after the match. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're used to being on the corner in Compton where people are  
shouting and doing drugs,'' he said. ``This is very strange to me, 
sitting up here and you people talking to me. I actually feel like 
a fool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sibling showdown attracted attention from the international  
media. They're eager for a rematch, but they'll have to wait, 
because Serena and Venus aren't scheduled to play the same 
tournament again until the Italian Open in early May. 
</P>
<P>
	The consensus, however, is that Sunday's Williams-Williams final  
could be the first of many. 
</P>
<P>
	Venus, 18, is ranked sixth this week. Serena, 17, is a  
career-high 11th. Dad predicts they'll eventually be 1-2, and his 
opinion counts, because he said years ago that his daughters were 
destined for greatness. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time I ever took Venus to the tennis court, I walked  
home and told my wife, `Baby, we have a champion. This girl is 
rough, tough, strong and mentally sound. Those are the four 
qualities all champions have.''' 
</P>
<P>
	How old was Venus at the time?  
</P>
<P>
	``Four years, six months and one day,'' her dad said. ``At 5  
years old, I took the racket out of her hand. I wouldn't let her 
play for a year because she loved it too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serena started playing at about the same age, and she benefited  
from such practice partners as John McEnroe and Pete Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because Serena couldn't beat those guys with power, she had to  
learn to do angles and drop shots,'' Richard Williams said. ``Right 
now, I think Serena is hitting angles and drop shots better than 
anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But will she overtake Venus? Serena trails 3-0 in the sibling  
rivalry, and there's division within the family regarding how many 
tournaments she and Venus should enter together. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Williams said he once paid a psychiatrist to study the  
effects when sisters play each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``We learned that tennis is the only game that's extremely rough  
on a family,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said his daughters are old enough to decide for  
themselves which events to enter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be in a lot of the same tournaments,'' Venus said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're Jehovah's Witnesses, and we really believe that family  
comes first,'' Serena said. ``No matter how many times we play each 
other, I could never say that it would affect my relationship with 
Venus.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up, Japan Stocks End Mixed / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen today amid investor  
uncertainty about the U.S.-led NATO bombing against Yugoslavia.

	The dollar bought 120.04 yen in late trading, up 1.28 yen from  
late Friday in Tokyo but below its level of 120.26 yen in New York

	In currency dealings, the dollar was little changed from its

	NATO Says Attacks Will Go On  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO officials are denying that airstrikes on  
Yugoslavia are responsible for the increased killings and 
repression in Kosovo, causing tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians 
to flee the Serb province. British Prime Minister Tony Blair says 
the attacks will become more intense. The Pentagon said more 
American warplanes, including four of the B-52 long-range bombers, 
will join the nearly 200 planes already participating in Operation 
Allied Force. NATO has been paying more attention to striking at 
Serb ground forces in Kosovo, where there have been reports of 
increased atrocities against the Albanian majority.

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Thousands of ethnic Albanians under  
attack from Serb forces are streaming out of Kosovo and into 
neighboring Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro. Meanwhile, NATO 
officials said Fehmi Agani, an ethnic Albanian politician and one 
of the negotiators at the Rambouillet peace talks, has been 
executed by Serb forces. Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov 
said he will go to Belgrade tomorrow in a new diplomatic bid to end 
the crisis. But one ethnic Albanian in southwestern Kosovo called 
for NATO to bring in ground troops.

landslides and killing at least 87 people, officials said. It was 
the strongest earthquake this century in the quake-prone mountains, 
with a magnitude of 6.8 and lasting nearly 40 seconds, India's

Mellon University discovered the virus, and they warn it's a 
potential security breach that should worry businesses and 
governments. The virus spreads via infected e-mail attachments and 
attacks computers loaded with Microsoft's Word 97 or Word 2000 
programs. A Microsoft spokesman says company programmers are 
working with other experts to develop an antidote. Microsoft has a

	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The Connecticut Huskies beat  
top-ranked Duke, the team no one thought could be beaten in this 
NCAA tournament, for their first national championship in their 
first Final Four appearance. The 77-74 victory tonight ended Duke's 
32-game winning streak, kept the Blue Devils from an NCAA record 
for wins in a season, and prevented them from ending the '90s with 
a third national championship. Richard Hamilton led third-ranked 
Connecticut (34-2) with 27 points, but it was some tremendous team

Milosevic's tactics amount to crimes against humanity. ``We do

plans to seek ``an immediate halt'' to bombing. The NATO attack 
widened Monday to include low- and slow-flying tank-killer aircraft

Commodore David Wilby said the latest air attacks targeted Serb and 
Yugoslav units involved in atrocities in Kosovo, a province in

<HEADLINE> Kilborn Takes Over CBS Talk Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Talk show host Craig Kilborn may be a smart  
aleck with ``the greatest hair in television'' but he's certainly 
not arrogant, his former college basketball coach says. 
</P>
<P>
	Kilborn, a 1984 Montana State graduate, takes over ``The Late,  
Late Show with Craig Kilborn'' on Tuesday. Tom Snyder's final 
broadcast was Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of many promotional spots for his show, Kilborn says he  
played Division I basketball at Montana State in Bozeman until his 
senior year, when his coach told him he was too selfish and 
arrogant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I have my own talk show on CBS,'' he says in the ad.  
</P>
<P>
	But his former coach, Stu Starner, says he never thought of  
Kilborn as arrogant. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a line,'' he said. ``He was a neat guy. We chuckle when  
we see that because Craig was just a solid guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starner recalled that Kilborn's ``was not overly gifted  
physically.'' But 15 years later, he said, ``look who's on top of 
the world.''

<HEADLINE> New Web Site Features Rare Van Gogh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Call it virtual Vincent.  
</P>
<P>
	Amsterdam's famed Van Gogh Museum on Monday launched a new site  
on the World Wide Web aimed at ensuring art lovers get a glimpse of 
the Dutch master's work -- including rare paintings, drawings, 
watercolors and letters not on display anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	The site provides access to an expansive database of reference  
material, 15 of the artist's greatest works and numerous detailed 
studies seldom seen by the public. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many drawings and letters of Van Gogh's which are  
normally not seen because they are in safe keeping,'' said Melanie 
ver Hoeven, a museum employee who helped develop the site. 
</P>
<P>
	Ver Hoeven said some of the most interesting pieces are photos  
of original French and English letters in the artist's own hand. A 
timeline with in-depth information lays out the milestones in the 
painter's life and the society in which he lived. 
</P>
<P>
	Separate artist studies show Van Gogh's build up to famous works  
such as ``The House,'' ``Self Portrait of an Artist,'' and 
``Sunflowers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five paintings of peasant men and women in their daily lives  
were the parts which created the ``Potato Eaters,'' the painter's 
first work involving several characters. 
</P>
<P>
	Early this summer, the site will be broadened to incorporate a  
three-dimensional virtual museum, a ``chat room'' for discussions 
and an online store. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the depth of the site, Ver Hoeven said she doesn't  
expect it will replace a real museum visit. ``It can be good 
preparation for a visit, but it could never be compared to the real 
thing. The colors, images and sizes cannot be seen on a web page,'' 
she said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Van Gogh Museum, home to an unrivaled collection of  
paintings, will reopen June 24 after 10 months of renovation. About 
70 paintings from the collection have been on tour in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum, which opened in 1973, houses 200 paintings, 500  
drawings and 700 letters of the artist who died in 1890 at the 
early age of 40.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Claims New Eritrea Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- Ethiopian forces repelled an  
Eritrean offensive to recapture a key western front that had been 
lost during an 11-month border war, Ethiopia's government said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack at the Badme front was an Eritrean bid to retake the  
disputed border, Ethiopian government spokeswoman Selome Tadesse 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said that Eritrean forces at the central Zalambesa  
front, 60 miles south of the Eritrean capital Asmara, pounded 
Ethiopian positions with heavy artillery, wounding two civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Eritrean forces attacked twice Monday with tanks and heavy  
artillery, but they were repelled both times,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	No Eritrean response was immediately available, and the report  
could not be independently confirmed. Earlier Monday, Eritrea 
denied the report on the Zalambesa attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Eritrea occupied Badme in early May, sparking the simmering  
conflict into a full-scale war. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest escalation in the fighting followed a flurry of  
claims and rebuttals between the two warring countries over 
casualties suffered by both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Eritrea on Monday denied Ethiopia's claim that 45,000 Eritrean  
troops had been killed, wounded or captured and 77 tanks destroyed 
in fighting on three different fronts between Feb. 23 and March 26. 
</P>
<P>
	In both countries, journalists have mostly been barred from  
front lines, making verification of victory claims difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	Eritrea took journalists to the Tsorona front, along the central  
part of the border, 60 miles south of Asmara, after claiming to 
have killed 10,000 Ethiopian in a three-day battle that ended March 
16. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethiopia denied Eritrea's claim as ``drama staged for the  
benefit of journalists,'' but reporters said they saw hundreds of 
bodies of Ethiopian soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	The two countries have been at war since last May over areas on  
their 620-mile border that were not clearly demarcated when Eritrea 
gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Acknowledging the Badme defeat in February, Eritrea agreed to  
accept a peace plan proposed by the Organization of African Unity 
that required belligerents to withdraw from areas occupied by force 
after May 6, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethiopia had already accepted the plan as a basis for  
negotiations. But since then, neither country has made a move 
towards implementing a cease-fire to put the talks in motion.

<HEADLINE> Braves Send Bruce Chen to Minors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- Rookie Bruce Chen, tabbed as the Atlanta  
Braves' fifth starter after Denny Neagle was traded to Cincinnati, 
was sent to the minors today and replaced in the rotation by 
another rookie, Odalis Perez. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen did not have a good spring. The left-hander was 1-2 with a  
6.00 ERA in five appearances, four of them starts. He gave up 23 
hits and 12 runs in 18 innings, walking 12 and striking out 14. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking Odalis Perez as the fifth guy,'' manager Bobby  
Cox said. ``He'll be able to spot start and relieve. It makes a lot 
of sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, a left-hander, was 6-5 with a 4.02 ERA at Double A  
Greenville as a starter last season. At Triple A Richmond, where he 
was used in relief, he was 1-2 with a 2.96 ERA and three saves. He 
was 0-1 with a 4.22 ERA with the Braves in 10 relief appearances 
and made three relief appearances in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez will follow Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz and  
Kevin Millwood in the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez has pitched 14 innings this spring, allowing 16 hits,  
walking five and striking out 18 with a 4.50 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Chen was 13-7 at Greenville with a 3.29 ERA,  
walking only 48 in 139 1-3 innings and striking out 164. He was 2-1 
with a 1.88 ERA in four starts with Richmond and 2-0 with a 3.98 
ERA in four starts with the Braves in September.

<HEADLINE> Rates Mixed in Treasury Auction / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities were mixed in Monday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $6.51 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.380 percent, up from 4.375 percent last 
week. An additional $7.51 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.340 percent, down from 4.420 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the highest since March 15, when the  
bills sold for 4.470 percent. The six-month rate was the lowest 
since Jan. 25, when the rate was 4.280 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.502 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,889.30 and 4.511 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,780.60. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 4.75 
percent last week from 4.74 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> D-Backs' Womack Gets Cast Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The cast was removed from Tony Womack's injured  
right wrist Monday and the Arizona Diamondbacks said he could be 
ready to play as early as April 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Womack fractured the wrist March 7 when he was hit by a pitch  
from Chicago White Sox pitcher Jim Parque. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury came shortly after Womack was traded to Arizona from  
Pittsburgh. Womack, who led the National League in stolen bases the 
last two seasons, is scheduled to play left field as well as be the 
leadoff hitter, providing some much-needed speed in an otherwise 
slow lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	The wrist was placed in a splint that can be removed for  
range-of-motion and strengthening workouts, manager Buck Showalter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Womack could return as early as April 9, Showalter set the  
probable date for his return as April 12, one week after the start 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Showalter hasn't decided whether to start the season with Womack  
on the injured list.

finishing 4 1/4 lengths back. It was Silver Charm's third loss in four 
races this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Silver Charm has had a history of bleeding, and without  
medication it just got bad and he got scared,'' said trainer Bob 
Baffert, who was at Turfway Park on Saturday to watch Kentucky 
Derby hopeful Straight Man finish fourth. ``I'm in mourning because 
of Silver Charm and Straight Man. When horses bleed, it just scares 
them and they don't run. That's what happened to Silver Charm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drugs used to control bleeding at many U.S. tracks are not  
allowed in Dubai. 
</P>
<P>
	``For some reason today, he just felt flat,'' said jockey Gary  
Stevens, who rode Silver Charm to victory in Dubai a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Had Silver Charm earned the winner's purse of $3 million, he  
would have moved past Skip Away and into the No. 2 spot in career 
earnings with $9.8 million. Cigar, now retired, is No. 1 at just 
under $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The two other U.S. horses in the 1 1/4-mile race were Malek, who  
finished second, a half-length short, and Victory Gallop, third, 1 1/2 
lengths behind the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Almutawakel, timed in 2:00.65, is owned by the Godolphin stables  
that belong to the Al Maktoum family. The bay colt came into 
prominence when he won the Prix Jean Prat. 
</P>
<P>
	Malek, fourth in Dubai last year, was ridden by Alex Solis and  
earned $1 million. Victory Gallop, the 1998 Belmont Stakes winner 
ridden by Jerry Bailey, won $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Malek had raced sparingly since his fourth place in Dubai last  
year. The 6-year-old Chilean-bred is trained by Dick Mandella, who 
has had a horse in all four Dubai World Cups. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll get it right someday,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Victory Gallop, a 4-year-old colt, is trained by Elliott Walden  
and owned by brothers Art, Jack and J.R. Preston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Victory Gallop ran well,'' Walden said. ``I thought in the  
straight that he could win, but the others were too strong for 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Central Park was fourth, followed by Daylami, Silver Charm,  
Running Stag and English Derby-winner High Rise. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of about 5,000 at the Nad Al Sheba course watched the  
horses break evenly at the start. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm quickly fell behind, trailing Central Park and  
Malek, and then dropped back even further and never threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew after two furlongs that it wasn't going to be his  
day,'' Stevens said. ``He was down on the rail, which was OK, but 
when I started to maneuver him out I did not have any horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With three furlongs to go, jockey Richard Hills sent Almutawakel  
into the lead, where he held off Malek's challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything was good for me,'' Hill said. ``The pace was not as  
strong as I thought, and I did everything I wanted out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Betting is not allowed in Dubai, in accordance with Islamic  
teachings. In North American simulcast wagering, the winner 
returned $91.30. 
</P>
<P>
	Almutawakel had lifetime earnings of $169,721 before Sunday.  
Silver Charm's earnings of more then $6.5 million matched the 
combined winnings of the seven other horses in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm was second in the Breeders' Cup Classic on Nov. 7  
at Churchill Downs and opened 1999 by taking the San Pasqual 
Handicap at Santa Anita. But he was third in the Donn Handicap at 
Gulfstream Park and the Santa Anita Handicap on March 6. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maktoums, who have won some of the biggest races in Europe,  
had half the horses in the field. High Rise, Daylami, Central Park 
and Almutawakel were making their dirt-racing and 1999 debuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every race has its own pleasure, but to win in Dubai is  
something special,'' said Sheik Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum, 
deputy ruler of Dubai.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic could be  
tried as a war criminal, the Clinton Administration said today, 
citing the Serb leader as instigating a genocide on the ethnic 
Albanians in Kosovo. State Department spokesman James Rubin said 
Milosevic's tactics amount to crimes against humanity. ``We do 
believe that ethnic cleansing is going on,'' he said. Rubin 
suggested the Yugoslav president could be charged by an 
international tribunal and face a lifetime prison sentence.

tomorrow to seek ``an immediate halt'' to the NATO bombing. The 
NATO attack widened today to include low- and slow-flying 
tank-killer aircraft that could be used to strike Serb ground 
forces. NATO spokesman Air Commodore David Wilby said the latest 
air attacks targeted Serb and Yugoslav units involved in atrocities 
in Kosovo, a province in Serbia, which is the main republic in 
Yugoslavia.

	New Trial Sought in Dragging Death

<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- A man sentenced to die for the dragging  
death of a black man said today his chances for a fair trial were 
jeopardized because his attorneys failed to investigate his version 
of where he was the night of the attack. In a motion for a new 
trial, 24-year-old John William King claims his alibi never was 
investigated properly by his trial attorneys, said David Schulman, 
King's appeals attorney. King, condemned last month for the June 7 
dragging death of James Byrd Jr., has claimed he was dropped off at 
his home while the 49-year-old black man was still alive.

<HEADLINE> Suburb Bans Drivers' Use of Phones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLYN, Ohio (AP) -- Drivers who feel the need to talk to  
someone on their cellular phones better keep both hands on the 
steering wheel in this Cleveland suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	The town that claims to have pioneered the mandatory seatbelt  
law has extended its traffic safety laws to the use of cell phones. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor John M. Coyne said the issue came to his attention when  
police determined that an inattentive driver on a cell phone caused 
a minor accident involving two cars near a recreation center. 
</P>
<P>
	The week-old ordinance makes it a minor misdemeanor, punishable  
by a fine, to use a cell phone while driving unless both hands are 
on the steering wheel. Exceptions are allowed for an emergency, 
using the phone when the transmission is in ``park'' or if a 
speakerphone is used. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have issued a few warnings but no one has been ticketed  
yet, Police Department dispatcher Linda Walker said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief James F. Maloney said motorists wouldn't be pulled  
over for using a cell phone as a primary offense, but drivers 
weaving in traffic would be cited if they're holding a phone in one 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Maloney said a judge could impose a fine of up to $100.  
</P>
<P>
	The City Council approved the measure by a 5-2 vote on March 22.  
The Ohio Municipal League called it the first of its kind in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Nelson, a spokesman for the Cellular Telecommunications  
Industry Association in Washington, said he's unaware of a similar 
law anywhere else in the country. Other states have considered 
similar bills but none have come to a vote, said Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
	Coyne said Brooklyn passed an ordinance in 1966 requiring people  
to use seat belts. At the time, that was believed to be the first 
such ordinance in the nation.

<HEADLINE> Trial Date Hurt WR Tony Martin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Wide receiver Tony Martin lost his chance Monday to  
have his trial on money-laundering charges postponed until after 
the 1999 NFL seaosn. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Michael Moore set trial for May 3 rather  
than agree to a defense request for a January date for Martin, who 
played last season for Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision complicates Martin's plans to negotiate an NFL  
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who led the Falcons last season with 66 catches for  
1,181 yards and six touchdowns, was released by the team last 
month. Since then, the Miami native has drawn interest from a 
half-dozen NFL teams, including the Falcons and Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is scheduled for three weeks, but the estimates are  
often too short. A May trial could easily run into June mini-camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Sexton, Martin's agent, refused comment and referred  
comment to his criminal attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin had wanted to hire Roy Black, who has represented former  
NBC sportcaster Marv Albert and Kennedy family member William 
Kennedy Smith, is busy with trials for the rest of the year. Black 
was out of town Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Law partner Howard Srebnick said before the decision that a  
trial date this year ``leaves Mr. Martin in a difficult position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin faces trial with Rickey Brownlee, who served seven years  
in prison for 1980s drug convictions. Martin, 33, met Brownlee in 
high school when his aunt dated Brownlee. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors charge Martin wrote checks to lease luxury cars and  
pay legal fees for his friend because Brownlee's lawyers wouldn't 
take cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin is not charged with any involvement in drug activity.  
When arrested, Brownlee was driving a Mercedes-Benz leased in 
Martin's name.

<HEADLINE> 3 Die in Mich. Fireworks Plant Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSSEO, Mich. (AP) -- A fireworks plant where seven workers died  
in a blast last December was hit by a fire and a possible explosion 
today, leaving at least three people dead and one critically 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency workers rushed to the Independence Professional  
Fireworks plant shortly after 8:30 a.m. to find smoke pouring from 
a building 100 yards from the structure destroyed in the December 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	Two bodies were found inside a building and another outside the  
building, Sheriff Stan Burchardt said. Another person was missing, 
Burchardt said. 
</P>
<P>
	A 40-year-old man suffered burns and was in critical condition,  
according to hospital officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillsdale County Sheriff's Deputy Steve Morgan said callers  
initially described the incident as an explosion and fire. But Tom 
Jackson, who lives near the factory, said that while he saw a 
building on fire when he passed by, he did not hear anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``All you could see is black smoke,'' Jackson said.  
</P>
<P>
	A man who answered the telephone at the plant this morning  
refused to talk and hung up. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dec. 11 explosion killed six women and one man and injured  
13 other people. Investigators have said they may never fully 
understand what caused that blast, which leveled one section of the 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the December explosion, the factory was free to resume its  
operations, said Maura Campbell, spokeswoman for the Department of 
Consumer and Industry Services, which licenses fireworks 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation ``was all but ready to be made public, and now  
this,'' Ms. Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Osseo is about 80 miles southwest of Detroit and 15 miles north  
of the Ohio state line.

<HEADLINE> Personal TV Recorder Debuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Eight years ago, Anthony Wood decided  
that he didn't want to miss another second of Star Trek, so he set 
to work designing a digital VCR that could search for programs and 
record them on a computer disk. 
</P>
<P>
	This week the first personal video recorder is rolling out for  
consumers. For $500 to $1,000, viewers get on-demand programming 
from a black box that sits on their television set and collects 
shows based on their individual taste. 
</P>
<P>
	Want to see every show coming through your television about  
bananas? Beer? Starring Doris Day? Just program your television and 
watch away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Up to now, we've all been slaves to television schedules, but  
with personal television, viewers are now in control,'' said Wood, 
the Star Trek junkie who is now CEO of Replay Networks Inc., one of 
two companies offering the systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar to the established WebTV, ReplayTV and TiVo, a device  
made by a company also named TiVo, store programs on an internal 
hard disk for viewers to watch when they're ready. In addition, the 
systems give viewers the power to pause, rewind and ``instant 
replay'' live television. 
</P>
<P>
	Both devices connect to a telephone line, which downloads  
commands from the personal video recorder companies to the set-top 
boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Replay will cost $699 for six hours of recording time; more  
storage costs more. TiVo, which is shipping the first models this 
week, will cost $499 plus $9.95 a month for 14 hours of 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the systems are going to change the way people  
watch television. 
</P>
<P>
	By 2004, 14 million television viewers will be using personal  
video recorders to control their programming, estimates Forrester 
Research analyst Josh Bernoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Forrester Research also predicts that in just two years, the  
systems will store 24 hours of video and cost less than $500 each. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing the systems won't do now is filter out the $60 billion  
worth of television advertisements broadcast each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Technologically it's possible, but it's not particularly a  
good idea if you want to be a part of the entertainment industry,'' 
said TiVo vice president Ed MacBeth. 
</P>
<P>
	But Forrester Research predicts that too will change.  
</P>
<P>
	``By 10 years from now, personal video recorders will penetrate  
four out of five homes and overall TV ad viewing will be cut nearly 
in half,'' said Bernoff. ``With its advertising base gutted, 
television will turn upside down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Coursey, a promoter and review of high-tech products, said  
the systems have ``created a great deal of buzz in the industry and 
among consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``On-demand viewing is likely to change dramatically the way  
television content and advertising are created and delivered,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Energy Futures Up on Gasoline Worry  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Energy futures prices continued their sharp gains Monday on the  
New York Mercantile Exchange amid concern about the availability of 
gasoline going into the peak driving period. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, hog futures fell sharply, as did copper.  
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline futures helped boost heating oil and crude, reflecting  
market nervousness about recent refinery problems and oil 
producers' intentions to reduce available supply. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline prices soared last week after world oil producers moved  
to take some 2.1 million barrels of crude off the market daily, in 
a bid to boost prices per barrel above $17. While analysts noted it 
will not be possible to determine compliance until the end of 
April, at the earliest, positive statements from many of the 
world's top producers have supported the gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices also were supported by a spate of refinery problems, many  
of them on the West Coast, that could shift gasoline destined for 
the Atlantic Coast westward. 
</P>
<P>
	With mild weather already boosting gasoline demand across the  
eastern half of the United States, many market participants are 
beginning to fear spot shortages may occur this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Unleaded gasoline for April delivery rose 1.07 cents to 51.70  
cents a gallon; May crude rose 27 cents to $16.44 a barrel; April 
heating oil rose .46 cent to 43.20 cents a gallon; May natural gas 
fell 1 cent to $1.870 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork prices fell sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in  
reaction to a government report that suggested supplies will be 
ample through the summer barbecueing months. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork producers have moved to shrink herds in the face of a glut  
that has depressed prices, but the U.S. Agriculture Department's 
quarterly hogs report released Friday showed the number of piglets 
born before March fell only 1 percent. Market participants had been 
expecting a 3 percent decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Since it generally takes about five months to fatten pigs for  
slaughter, that means retailers and slaughterhouses are likely to 
have ample supplies during peak consuming months. 
</P>
<P>
	Most-active June hogs fell 2 cents to 53.72 cents a pound, while  
July pork bellies fell the limit 3 cents to 54.47 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper futures fell sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange  
as warehouse inventories worldwide began to post sharp increases, 
signaling long-awaited new supplies are coming to market. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper futures recently had staged a recovery as warehouse  
supplies remained steady or declined amid talk of a slight rebound 
in the Japanese economy, which would spur industrial demand. Copper 
is used in electronics and plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
	But the London Metal Exchange posted its biggest gain in three  
weeks, boosting its warehouse inventories to 714,150 metric tons, 
as new supplies from world's largest producer Chile, and elsewhere, 
began to pour out of mines. 
</P>
<P>
	May high-grade copper fell 2.7 cents to 62.45 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE>  Dow Closes at Record of 10,006.78 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the Dow Jones industrial average, the fourth  
time was lucky. 
</P>
<P>
	The 103-year-old index finally had the staying power Monday to  
make its first close above 10,000 after failing three times earlier 
this month. The blue chips rose 184.54 points to 10,006.78, and the 
floor of the New York Stock Exchange began a long-awaited 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE chairman Richard Grasso, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani  
and John Prestbo, index editor for Dow Jones &AMP; Co., banged the 
gavel symbolizing the close of the trading day and then began 
tossing baseball caps with ``Dow 10,000'' embroidered on the front. 
</P>
<P>
	In investment houses across the country, market watchers  
observed the occasion as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a moment to uncork the champagne and celebrate what a  
truly phenomenal bull market this has been,'' said Hugh Johnson, 
the longtime market strategist at First Albany Corp. in Albany, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	News that several big corporate mergers may be in the works  
spurred the Dow over 10,000 Monday. But, Grasso said at a press 
conference that credit for the milestone goes to investors who have 
poured money into stocks -- either directly or through mutual funds 
or pension plans -- for the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stock exchange had nothing to do with Dow 10,000. It had  
to do with the huge number of participants in the marketplace. I 
want to send thank-yous to the 70 million Americans who participate 
directly in equities and another 130 million who participate 
indirectly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow first crossed 10,000 on March 16 but was unable to close  
above the milestone amid profit-taking and worries about upcoming 
quarterly profit reports. The same thing happened two days later 
that week. 
</P>
<P>
	For a while Monday, it looked like that pattern would be  
repeated. The blue chips hit 10,000 several times, but kept being 
knocked back down by computer-guided trading programs that sell 
stocks when the market reaches a predetermined level. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was enough underlying strength this time across a  
broad spectrum of stocks that the Dow was able to climb back up 
10,000 and stay there. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's staying power was helped by an expansion of Wall  
Street's recent rally to a broader range of stocks -- it wasn't just 
the large, big-name companies like IBM and General Electric that 
gained, but smaller companies and lesser known names finally 
started to join the upward trend after some prolonged weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides merger news, including a possible deal between oil  
companies BP Amoco Corp. and Atlantic Richfield Co., incentive to 
buy came from the sense that Wall Street had seen the worst of 
warnings from companies that expected to report disappointing 
first-quarter profits. 
</P>
<P>
	But these were just the immediate reasons behind Monday's  
advance. The Dow -- and the overall stock market -- has surged higher 
on eight years of U.S. economic growth, a boom in mutual fund 
investment, and, most recently, a boom in high technology and 
investor fascination with the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's first close above 10,000 came just under a year after  
it closed above 9,000, on April 6, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	At several points over the past year, a Dow 10,000 seemed like  
an impossibility -- particularly on Aug. 31 of last year, when the 
blue chips plunged 512.61 to 7,539.07 amid concerns about 
struggling overseas economies and how they might hurt U.S. 
corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	But the market's resilience, due in large part to individual  
investors' confidence in stocks, has carried the Dow back.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T, Mall Giant Join Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. will advertise and sell its phone  
service throughout much of the nation's largest shopping mall 
empire under a marketing deal with Simon Property Group. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T joins companies such as PepsiCo Inc. and Visa International  
that see an alliance with Simon as an easy way to get their 
products exposed to more than 100 million shoppers a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mall environment is a new and innovative way for AT&AMP;T to  
reach and reward consumers,'' said Jim McFarland, vice president of 
AT&AMP;T consumer services. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a deal expected to be announced Monday, Simon will  
advertise AT&AMP;T's services at 135 of its more than 200 malls and 
also allow customers to switch their services over to the nation's 
largest phone company. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies declined to disclose financial details of their  
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, AT&AMP;T residential customers can participate in  
Simon's MALLPeRKS loyalty program, which rewards shoppers with 
discounts and other offers for every $1 they spend in any Simon 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T users can redeem one MALLPeRKS point for every $1 that they  
spend in monthly long-distance, calling card and local toll 
charges. They must bring their bill to the mall to get the points. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vast majority of the incentive programs that exist in the  
market today really relate to the top end of the market and the 
business consumer,'' said Karen Corsaro, president of Simon Brand 
Ventures, the marketing arm of Simon Property Group. ``But this 
program is really targeted at the average American who is a mall 
shopper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The AT&AMP;T deal is the latest move in Simon's aggressive branding  
effort. Simon is facing increasing competition for shoppers as 
consumers are more pressed for time and have other resources by 
which to buy, such as catalogs and the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon wants shoppers to know they are at a Simon mall, and get  
benefits at Simon's malls that they can't find anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Indianapolis-based company announced that it  
would plaster the Simon name throughout its malls, a move intended 
to differentiate Simon's malls from others. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon also has been aligning with companies not traditionally  
marketed at the mall, but see shopping centers as an outlet to 
reach new customers. PepsiCo has the exclusive rights to sell 
drinks at vending machines in Simon malls, Visa offers a Simon 
credit card, and Simon partnered with Time Inc. to create S 
magazine that will be distributed at all Simon malls. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mall is a perfect venue because people are already there  
primed to shop and are ready to receive commercial messages,'' 
Corsaro said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts, however, question whether all of its branding efforts  
means anything to the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, they will be able to attract a few people with all this  
new marketing,'' said Al Ries, who runs the Atlanta-based marketing 
consulting firm Ries &AMP; Ries. ``But it is a dubious conclusion to 
think most will care.''

<HEADLINE> Pepper Barely Misses 20-Under Par  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (AP) -- As Dottie Pepper was cruising  
through the final few holes of the Nabisco Dinah Shore, 
``20-under'' popped into her mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she didn't go quite that low, Pepper did shoot her way  
into the LPGA record book. 
</P>
<P>
	After she hit a 7-iron shot 144 yards and into the cup on the  
16th hole to go 19-under, Pepper said, ``My thoughts went to 
20-under from there. I was trying to take it as deep as I could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A scrambling par on the final hole Sunday kept her at 19-under,  
good for a six-shot victory and a niche in LPGA history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to finish up with a bogey,'' said Pepper, who  
sank her 8-foot par putt on No. 18 for a 6-under 66 final round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although nothing could really have taken the (excitement of  
winning) away, I wanted to get in without having a blunder on the 
card late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pepper's 19-under bettered the previous mark for an LPGA major,  
Brandie Burton's 18-under in last year's duMaurier Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	The 269 also was four shots lower than the Dinah Shore record  
Amy Alcott set in 1991, when Pepper finished eight shots back in 
second. The next year, Pepper beat Juli Inkster in a playoff for 
the title. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Amy shot 15-under, I thought that was so far out of  
reach,'' Pepper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The win -- and the traditional leap into the murky water around  
the 18th green at Mission Hills -- ended a long dry spell for 
Pepper. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was baffled that I hadn't won in so long; this is just  
incredible,'' she said after her six-shot win over Meg Mallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepper's only other major title also came in the Dinah Shore,  
seven years earlier at Mission Hills Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``This place has a lot of great memories, and some bad ones for  
me. But to come back and win after 2 1/2 years and have it happen 
here, that's special,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seemingly typical of Pepper's game during the four days of the  
tournament were a couple of holes after she bogeyed No. 13 to go to 
16-under and allow Mallon within two shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepper came back to chip in a 45-footer from the fringe for  
birdie on No. 14 while Mallon bogeyed. Then Pepper eagled No. 16 
and Mallon bogeyed and Pepper suddenly was 19-under, seven shots in 
front and in clear control. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still amazed at how well it went. I just tried to stay out  
of my own way,'' said Pepper, who added that she had some good luck 
omens. ``I even had ladybugs following me around. I had it all 
going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also had ideal conditions going for her. The weather was  
mild and calm for the most part, although there were some afternoon 
winds the second day. Pepper teed off early and was already 
finished when the gusts began. 
</P>
<P>
	Were it not for the sizzling play of her friend, Mallon herself  
could have been a runaway winner -- it was another five shots back 
to Karrie Webb in third place. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I was playing really well and I lost by six shots,''  
said Mallon, who led the first two days, began the final round 
three shots back and lost three more strokes despite shooting a 69. 
</P>
<P>
	``On a major championship course, that (Pepper's total) is  
awesome. We're great friends. I can't be disappointed. Dottie just 
played excellent golf.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Tops 10,000 Again / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrials hovered around 10,000  
today as news of possible mergers propelled the entire stock market 
sharply higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue chips crossed 10,000 shortly before 2:30 p.m., and then  
wavered, slipping below that milestone only to regain momentum, 
pass it once more, and then fall again. At 3 p.m., the Dow was up 
175.38 at 9,997.62. At 3:30, it was back up, gaining 202.58 to 
10,024.82. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the Dow passed 10,000 on four separate  
trading days, but it fell back each time before the closing bell. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are probably some traders who have sell programs  
written'' to kick in at 10,000, said Ken Gehl, senior vice 
president for equity marketing at Everen Securities in Chicago. 
However, Gehl said, the rest of the market looks very strong, and 
leadership has continued to broaden beyond those of large, 
blue-chip companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is quite a bit of resilience and quite a bit of  
firepower being put to work here today,'' Gehl said. ``It seems as 
though everything is participating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were higher as well. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was up 23.94 at 1,306.74, approaching its record 
closing high of 1,316.55 set March 18. The technology-heavy Nasdaq 
composite index was up 63.32 at 2,482.49. 
</P>
<P>
	News of possible corporate mergers helped traders ignore a jump  
in interest rates and uneasiness about Yugoslavia. And the imminent 
end of the first quarter also prompted buying by institutional 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues led decliners by 8 to 5 on the New York Stock  
Exchange, where volume came to 584.47 million shares, down slightly 
from Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The market opened stronger after Britain's BP Amoco confirmed it  
is holding merger talks with Atlantic Richfield only months after 
completing the merger between British Petroleum and Amoco. The 
Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal reported BP Amoco is 
discussing buying Arco for about $25 billion. The companies said 
today no definitive agreement had been reached nor was one assured. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlantic Richfield was up 8 3/16 at 73 5/8. BP rose 4 1/8 to 104 5/8.  
</P>
<P>
	And unconfirmed talk that Glaxo Wellcome and Bristol  
Myers-Squibb were discussing a combination moved drug stocks 
higher. Glaxo Wellcome was up 2 3/8 at 64. Bristol Myers-Squibb rose 2 
15/16 at 62 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	In the technology sector, Computer Associates agreed to buy  
Platinum Technology International for more than $3.5 billion, or 
$29.25 a share. Shares of software maker Platinum Technology closed 
Friday at 9 7/8. They were up 14 1/2 at 24 3/8, while Computer Associates 
was up 2 1/2 at 36 7/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger news helped U.S. equities shrug off lower prices and  
higher yields in the bond market. The 30-year Treasury bond was 
down 3/4 point and its yield, which moves opposite from its price, 
rose to 5.64 percent from 5.59 percent Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also benefiting from the sense that the Federal  
Reserve was unlikely to raise interest rates at its policy meeting 
on Tuesday. Moreover, the ``confessional season'' for corporate 
earnings is now over and analysts believed investors have seen most 
or all of the downside earnings predictions that they are going to 
see this quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, investors want to add to their holdings rather than  
sell them going into the end of the first quarter, and there are 
about $1.5 trillion of funds in money market accounts they can use 
to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.4 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index soared 2.13 percent after 
Friday's selloff. Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.66 percent, and 
France's CAC-40 was up 0.92 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Dow Closes at Record of 10,006.78 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the Dow Jones industrial average, the fourth  
time was lucky. 
</P>
<P>
	The 103-year-old index finally had the staying power Monday to  
make its first close above 10,000 after failing three times earlier 
this month. The blue chips rose 184.54 points to 10,006.78, and the 
floor of the New York Stock Exchange began a long-awaited 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE chairman Richard Grasso, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani  
and John Prestbo, index editor for Dow Jones &AMP; Co., banged the 
gavel symbolizing the close of the trading day and then began 
tossing baseball caps with ``Dow 10,000'' embroidered on the front. 
</P>
<P>
	In investment houses across the country, market watchers  
observed the occasion as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a moment to uncork the champagne and celebrate what a  
truly phenomenal bull market this has been,'' said Hugh Johnson, 
the longtime market strategist at First Albany Corp. in Albany, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	News that several big corporate mergers may be in the works  
spurred the Dow over 10,000 Monday. But, Grasso said at a press 
conference that credit for the milestone goes to investors who have 
poured money into stocks -- either directly or through mutual funds 
or pension plans -- for the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stock exchange had nothing to do with Dow 10,000. It had

<HEADLINE> Shepard Jury Selection in 2nd Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- The trial of a young man charged with  
killing gay college student Matthew Shepard will include graphic 
photos and witnesses with felony convictions, a prosecutor told 
prospective jurors today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you keep in mind that if you cast a play in hell, you're  
not going to get angels for actors?'' prosecutor Cal Rerucha asked 
the jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection entered its second week in the trial of Russell  
Henderson, one of two men charged in the beating death of Shepard 
last October. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson's attorney, Wyatt Skaggs, put his arm around his  
client and told the jury pool that the case is not about politics 
or Shepard's lifestyle. ``It's about judging a human being, 
possibly the life and death of a human being,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we list the elements of this case, you'll not see hate as  
an element. It's not there. This crime is not about hate, it's 
about more mundane motives such as robbery and theft,'' Skaggs 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson remained expressionless through the morning court  
session. 
</P>
<P>
	Court officials plan to select 12 jurors and three alternates  
and begin opening statements early next week. Officials ended last 
week with 26 potential jurors, yet they wanted a larger pool; 
today, 70 more people were brought in, but five immediately were 
dismissed because of physical ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	Police allege Henderson and Aaron McKinney, both 21, pretended  
to be homosexuals, lured Shepard out of the Fireside Lounge and 
took him to a remote area east of Laramie and attacked him Oct. 6, 
leaving him bloodied and tied to a fence. The University of Wyoming 
freshman died five days later at a Fort Collins, Colo., hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say believe Henderson and McKinney intended to rob  
Shepard, but also targeted him in part because he was gay. 
Henderson and McKinney face the death penalty if convicted.

<HEADLINE> Texas Race Fans Stuck in Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Many NASCAR fans spent as much as 7 1/2  
hours trying to get away from the Texas Motor Speedway's muddy 
parking lots -- more than twice the time it took Terry Labonte to 
win the Primestar 500. 
</P>
<P>
	After two years of complaints, drivers said the racing surface  
at the $165 million facility -- where water seeped through the 
asphalt last year -- was improved. But fans in the parking lots on 
Sunday weathered puddles and knee-deep mud following heavy 
thundershowers. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was the cluster of cars stranded in some lots that  
frustrated people even more. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst part was just plain old waiting. Not moving, not  
knowing what was going on, and not knowing why we weren't moving,'' 
said Sandra Young of Longview, who said her vehicle made less than 
a foot of headway in more than 5 1/2 hours. ``There were people 
standing outside of their vehicles ... trying to see what was going 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Track spokeswoman Sarona Winfrey said a two-car accident and a  
broken recreational vehicle clogged the main corridor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you get an accident, trying to get it flowing again is  
difficult,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even at the best of times, the track empties from only three  
exits onto only two highways. Construction to widen one of the 
highways is supposed to be finished later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Discontented fans, who had no lavatory facilities available,  
used the field. After several hours, folks stranded without 
supplies were offering money for beer, soda and water. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people went so far as to build a bonfire in the parking  
lot. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were pouring straight diesel fuel on it because they were  
bored,'' Young said. ``It started with three pieces of 
newspapers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One conspiracy buff, who didn't give his name, joked that he  
thought the NASCAR fans might be corralled in the parking lot as 
part of an ``experiment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fort Worth Police, who directed traffic at the track, had no  
log records of any delays, wrecks or even of the bonfire, which 
smoked for several hours. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lt. Ric Clark said there was a shooting on the track  
campground. Allen R. Davies of Livingston, was charged with 
attempted murder in the shooting of Bryan Austin of Mesquite. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin, shot in the left shoulder, was helicoptered from the  
track to a nearby hospital. He was released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they also were not familiar with an earlier  
bottleneck on a track walkway. 
</P>
<P>
	People were sardined into a small walkway between a chain-link  
fence and the grandstand until the claustrophobic crush ripped the 
fence from the ground and thousands of people poured through the 
opening. 
</P>
<P>
	Winfrey said an overwhelming number of fans tried to use the  
same walkway immediately after the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``That walkway was there last year and not a problem. It was a  
problem this year,'' she said, adding that officials will consider 
blocking the area for the next Winston Cup race, forcing people to 
go in other directions. 
</P>
<P>
	Attendance Sunday was second only to crowds for race at the  
Indianapolis Motor Speedway. But, Indy fans don't usually endure as 
long a wait as those in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``They also have roadways. We only have roadways on three  
sides,'' Winfrey said.

<HEADLINE> IOC To Meet Sponsors for First Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Olympics' top marketers will meet with their  
highest-level sponsors Tuesday for the first time since an 
emergency assembly to deal with the biggest scandal the games have 
ever faced. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time they met in mid-February, representatives of the  
11 corporations that pay $50 million each to use the Olympic Rings 
in their ads told the IOC that drastic change was needed to erase 
the stain from the bribery scheme linked to Salt Lake's winning bid 
for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the International Olympic Committee has expelled six  
members, the greatest purge in its history, and taken the first 
steps toward what it says will be watershed reforms in the 
committee's membership and structure. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of those steps -- including membership of an ethics  
commission and a task force to essentially rewrite the Olympic 
bylaws -- are still being worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of several sponsors said Monday they did not  
know what to expect at the briefing, which will include IOC vice 
president Dick Pound and marketing director Michael Payne. 
</P>
<P>
	The representatives, speaking on the condition of anonymity,  
said Pound, Payne and other IOC officials had given them a thorough 
briefing in a conference call at the end of the special session at 
Lausanne, Switzerland, March 18. 
</P>
<P>
	But, the representatives said, the IOC had assured them that  
enough action had been taken since then to warrant another 
face-to-face meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Payne and Pound were traveling to New York Monday and  
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the IOC and the sponsors, Tuesday's meeting is  
expected to be attended by U.S. Olympic Committee officials, led by 
marketing chief John Krimsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Although nine of the 11 top-level IOC sponsors are American, the  
USOC was not represented at the last meeting when companies 
concerns were aired. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies involved in the TOP marketing plan -- for The  
Olympic Program -- include Coca-Cola, Eastman Kodak, VISA, Xerox, 
Sports Illustrated, Panasonic, McDonald's, IBM, UPS, John Hancock 
and Samsung.

<HEADLINE> Duke, UConn Deliver The Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The game everybody wanted has been  
in the making for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke and Connecticut, inexorably linked by Christian Laettner's  
shot in 1990 and a whole season of quiet anticipation, meet tonight 
in a national championship game that can settle a lot of scores. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies (33-2) finally can give coach Jim Calhoun the prize  
he's been chasing all these years. Duke (37-1) can establish itself 
as one of the best teams in college basketball history. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in 34 years, the only two teams to be ranked  
No. 1 all season are playing for the national championship. The 
brackets and basketball gods gave us Duke, Connecticut and a lot of 
baggage for rivals who have met only five times. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the most anticipated championship game since North Carolina  
beat Michigan's Fab Five in 1993, the perfect way to culminate a 
great decade of basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's the matchup everyone's really been looking  
forward to,'' said UConn forward Jake Voskuhl, who will share the 
task of guarding player of the year Elton Brand. ``This is the 
matchup the media and the fans have wanted, because we don't play 
each other during the year. You guys wanted it, now you've got 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consider it redemption for all those NCAA tournaments that  
didn't quite give us The Game. Duke and UConn have been so dominant 
this season and so good this decade, this might just make up for 
the premature matchup between Louisville and Houston's Phi Slamma 
Jamma team in the national semifinals in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew that Connecticut was one of the teams that could  
win,'' said Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, recalling the preseason 
rankings that placed Duke and UConn 1-2 in the land. ``And we felt 
we were one of them. So we're the two who felt all year long that 
we were the guys. I think that's what will make it a great game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Duke is the essence of college basketball excellence in the  
'90s, Connecticut isn't far behind. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils are playing in their fifth championship game  
under Krzyzewski, the winningest active coach in the NCAA 
tournament with a 48-12 record. Only North Carolina's Dean Smith 
has more victories, 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke won back-to-back national titles in 1991-92, lost to  
Arkansas in 1994 and Louisville in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you talk about Final Fours, you're talking about Mike  
Krzyzewski,'' said Calhoun, going for his first national title in 
his first trip to the Final Four. ``He's the coach for our 
generation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun has transformed UConn from a regional basketball outpost  
into a national power during a 13-year reign that lacks only a 
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	UConn appeared in the regional final in 1990, '95 and '98,  
losing each time. The first of those was a 79-78 loss to Duke when 
Laettner hit a jumper on an inbounds play at the buzzer in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``It made me sick,'' said Duke forward Shane Battier, who was 11  
at the time. ``Growing up in Michigan, I was a huge Michigan fan. I 
loved the Fab Five. I couldn't stand Duke. I couldn't stand Coach 
K. I hated Christian Laettner. It wasn't until the recruiting 
process that I came to love Duke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke and Connecticut have met only five times, with the Blue  
Devils holding a 4-1 advantage. As if the Laettner game wasn't 
enough for Huskies fans to bear, Duke beat UConn 81-67 in the Sweet 
16 in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much of a great person Mike Krzyzewski is, there are some  
people in Connecticut who don't truly like him,'' Calhoun said. 
``They're never going to forgive him for Christian shooting that 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my opinion, they're the epitome after Kentucky, or probably  
with Kentucky if they're fortunate to beat us, as the best team in 
the '90s. Clearly, they've broken our hearts a couple of times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke seeks a place in history. Calhoun just wants to make peace  
with the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe, just maybe,'' he said, ``we'll have an opportunity to  
do a little heartbreak on them, too.''

<HEADLINE> Phillies Announce Starting Rotation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) -- A week before opening day in Atlanta,  
the Philadelphia Phillies on Monday announced their starting 
rotation, made a decision on the final opening in the bullpen and 
inched closer to settling on a 25th man. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-man rotation -- Curt Schilling, Chad Ogea, Carlton  
Loewer, Paul Byrd and Paul Spoljaric -- has been a foregone 
conclusion for at least a week, but wasn't announced until Monday 
because Mike Grace was in the mix. 
</P>
<P>
	Grace won a job in the bullpen when pitchers Billy Brewer and  
Steve Montgomery were cut. Outfielders Billy McMillon and Jon 
Zuber, and infielder/outfielder were also sent down, reducing the 
roster to 26. 
</P>
<P>
	The last roster decision is down to a utility job between second  
baseman David Doster and outfielder David Miller, who was taken in 
December's major league draft. He must spend the entire season in 
the majors or be offered back to his former team, Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``These were tough decisions,'' Phillies manager Terry Francona  
said. ``But you want tough decisions. If you don't have tough 
decisions, then you have a bad ballclub.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the cuts, all but McMillon, who hit .200, had big springs.  
</P>
<P>
	Brewer, despite having ligament transplant surgery in his elbow  
last April, was 2-0 in seven games and didn't allow a run. 
Montgomery was 0-1 with a 1.74 ERA and four saves in eight 
appearances. Zuber hit .400 with a homer in 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Grace, who had offseason shoulder and elbow surgery, also has  
been impressive, going 1-0 with a 1.93 ERA in five games, including 
one start. The right-hander, who has 35 starts in 41 major league 
appearances, could return to the rotation if Spoljaric or Byrd get 
off to bad starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Spoljaric is 0-1 with a 5.21 ERA in five spring games. Byrd has  
a 7.30 ERA in three games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've had some success as a starter, but I'm going to  
concentrate on my job, which is pitching in relief,'' Grace said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer felt he deserved a spot, but said he wasn't shocked.  
</P>
<P>
	Brewer was demoted because he pitched only one-third of an  
inning last year after blowing out his elbow in the first week of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He needs to go get some innings under his belt,'' Francona  
said. ``I don't think he'll be in Triple-A all year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The starting rotation, while not announced until Monday, has  
been settled for weeks. The only other candidates were Grace, who 
hasn't pitched more than three innings in a game this spring, and 
Tyler Green, who had two offseason surgeries and is throwing 82-84 
mph fastballs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Grace is going to be a jack-of all trades, a swing guy,''  
Francona said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because he had offseason shoulder and elbow surgery, Grace  
wasn't expected to make a run at a roster spot. That changed March 
10, when he allowed one hit and no runs in three innings against 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``That day in Winter Haven really perked me up,'' Francona said.  
``He was coming off the mound like I hadn't seen in a while. He 
threw the ball by some hitters, was throwing some good changeups. 
He pitched himself onto the club.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Backup catcher Tom Prince had surgery to repair torn  
ligaments in his left wrist yesterday and the injury is more 
serious than first thought. Instead of missing six to eight weeks, 
Prince will be out at least three months.

<HEADLINE> Five NCAA Finals To Remember </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Connecticut and Duke, a pair of No.  
1 seeds with just three losses between them, and the only teams all 
season to occupy the top spot in The Associated Press poll, 
provided the chance for a memorable matchup in Monday night's NCAA 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``You obviously have the best two teams in the country playing  
for the national championship,'' Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said. 
``It can't get any better than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, though, it can, even when Nos. 1 and 1A aren't up  
against each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Here, in no particular order, are five championship games that  
remain etched in the memory of those who saw them. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Texas Western 72, Kentucky 66: The 1966 final, coming at a  
turbulent time in America, represented a sociological revolution in 
basketball with Texas Western starting five black players against 
Adolph Rupp's all-white Kentucky team. Texas Western coach Don 
Haskins thought it was no big deal. ``I'm not so sure it was the 
single event that integrated collegiate athletics,'' he said. ``But 
I know it changed the way basketball was played, period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Villanova 66, Georgetown 64: The Hoyas had lost just three  
games all year and beaten Villanova twice in the Big East 
Conference. The Wildcats, however, pitched a perfect game in the 
1985 finale, hitting a tournament record 78.6 percent of their 
shots against the nation's top defensive team and missing just one 
shot in the second half to pull off the upset. ``It was 
incredible,'' said Dwayne McClain, who led the Wildcats with 17 
points. ``I had no idea we were shooting that well. We were taking 
our time, looking for good shots, close shots and that's what we 
got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- N.C. State 54, Houston 52: At the 1983 Final Four, Houston's  
skywalking team of dunkers was considered a major mismatch against 
a North Carolina State team coached by scrappy Jim Valvano. With no 
shot clock, NC State decided to play a delay. ``If we get the 
opening tap,'' Valvano said, ``we might not shoot until Tuesday.'' 
Phi Slama Jama could dunk, but it couldn't shoot free throws. The 
Cougars were 10-for-19 from the foul line and were beaten when 
Lorenzo Charles grabbed Dereck Whittenburg's 30-footer and stuffed 
it in for the winning basket. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Michigan 80, Seton Hall 79, OT: Charge or block? The trickiest  
call in basketball decided the 1989 championship game. With three 
seconds left in overtime and Michigan trailing by a point, the 
Wolverines' Rumeal Robinson drove down the lane and collided with 
Gerald Greene of Seton Hall. Referee John Clougherty blew his 
whistle called it a block and Robinson dropped in the game-winning 
free throws. ``The call could have gone either way,'' Greene said. 
``I saw him penetrate to the hole. I tried to cut him off. I 
thought I had the defensive position to pick up the offensive foul. 
The ref called a block.'' It was the last time the championship was 
decided by a single point. 
</P>
<P>
	-- UCLA 87, Memphis State 66: John Wooden's UCLA teams had won  
six straight championships and seven out of eight in what would 
become a remarkable dynasty of 10 titles in 12 years. In 1973, Bill 
Walton made sure the streak remained intact, hitting a record 21 of 
22 field goal attempts to rout Memphis State. Most of the 6-foot-11 
Walton's baskets were short layups because the NCAA's no-dunk rule, 
an anti-Lew Alcindor weapon, was still in effect. Occasionally, 
though, he soared over the hoop and was called for offensive 
goaltending. ``They took four baskets away,'' he said. ``I was 
really 25-for-26.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average finished for  
the first time above the 10,000 milestone today, closing up 184.54 
at 10,006.78. Boosting prices were the sense that the market had 
seen the worst of first-quarter earnings reports, and investors' 
desire to put money to work in the stock market before the end of 
the quarter on Wednesday. On the NYSE, advancers led decliners 
1,844-1,141. The Nasdaq was up 72.78 at 2,491.95.

border were being stripped of their passports, identity papers, 
even their car license plates, in an apparent effort to make it 
impossible for them to return, authorities said. Reports also 
surfaced of ethnic Albanian leaders -- including one of the 
negotiators at the failed Rambouillet peace talks -- being summarily 
executed.

planes, government officials say. Pentagon officials said the

air defense tactics and intelligence about possible arms deals 
between the two countries all suggest Yugoslavia sought information

Friday peace accord. The talks are supposed to produce by Friday a 
new joint Protestant-Catholic government. The government should 
have been formed by last October, but David Trimble, the Protestant 
elected to head the government, insists that Sinn Fein politicians 
cannot fill any posts unless the party's IRA allies start to

Ballmer said today. ``This new structure is part of the reinvention 
of Microsoft,'' Ballmer said. The computer software giant has been 
organized to meet the needs of today ``but not those of the next 
decade,'' he said. In a telephone news conference, Gates and 
Ballmer insisted the move had nothing to do with the ongoing

challenging his 68-game suspension for choking his coach, was 
dismissed today by a federal judge who said it was so worthless 
that Sprewell must pay the league's court costs. Sprewell, whose 
original one-year suspension was cut to the remaining 68 games of 
the 1997-98 season by an arbitrator, claimed in his $30 million 
suit that the punishment still exceeded the arbitrator's authority 
and that he was a victim of racial discrimination.

	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Right-hander Jason Johnson was  
traded from the Tampa Bay Devils to the Baltimore Orioles on Monday 
for outfielder Danny Clyburn and a player to be named. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 25, was Tampa Bay's seventh pick in the 1998 expansion  
draft. and went 2-5 with a 5.70 ERA in 13 starts with the Devil 
Rays last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just another good arm. He can start and we believe he can  
be a power reliever as well,'' Orioles manager Ray Miller said. 
``He's a big, strong kid who throws in the mid-90s. We may take a 
look at him Wednesday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clyburn, 24, has a .278 average and 110 home runs in parts of  
seven minor league seasons with Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and 
Baltimore. He played in 11 games with the Orioles last year, 
hitting .280.

<HEADLINE> Hamilton Leads UConn to NCAA Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Last spring, Richard Hamilton  
thought seriously about leaving Connecticut for the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	He had all the credentials including a couple of Big East  
championships and the conference's Player of the Year award. So he 
talked it over with coach Jim Calhoun and together they decided 
there was one more piece of business for him to complete. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won the Big East but never the national championship,'' he  
said. ``I thought about that. I didn't want to end my season on a 
loss. The only thing I could do about it was come back and play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday night, he made sure to finish with a win, pouring in  
27 points as the Huskies beat Duke 77-74 for the national 
championship he wanted so much. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton was heroic in the victory. Every time UConn needed a  
basket, he seemed there for it. He slashed to the basket, he nailed 
shots from outside and he took the game over in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	There was one sequence near the end that showed just how much he  
means to Calhoun's program. 
</P>
<P>
	With the score tied at 68 and 3:50 left to play, he took a shot  
to the midsection from Duke's Chris Carrawell. Hamilton was doubled 
over for a moment, trying to catch his breath. Finally, he stepped 
to the foul line and nailed the free throws for a lead the Huskies 
would never again surrender. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, just for emphasis, the next time down the floor, he  
drained a 3-pointer, extending UConn's lead to five points. 
</P>
<P>
	For the game, he finished with 10-of-22 from the floor seven  
rebounds and three assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton was the heart of the UConn season, averaging 19.7  
points and becoming the second highest scorer in school history 
when he went over the 2,000-point mark in Saturday's semifinal 
victory against Ohio State. He was an All-American and co-Player of 
the Year in the Big East Conference, joining Patrick Ewing and 
Chris Mullin as the only two-time winners of that award. 
</P>
<P>
	And when he wasn't around, UConn missed him.  
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies won their first 20 games this season but when he and  
Jake Voshkul were hurt and missed a Feb. 1 game against Syracuse, 
the Huskies lost. It was no coincidence and something Calhoun said 
he thought about when he talked about the NBA with Hamilton last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had two major injuries,'' Calhoun said. ``I would never  
want to have him in a situation where he's sitting there in 
crutches or in a cast or something and passed on a great deal of 
money. I'd feel very badly about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That said, the coach believes the extra year in college has  
prepared Hamilton more completely for the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, he's more ready this year than he was last year,''  
Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
	And there's one other thing. Now, he also has the national  
championship he wanted so badly.

<HEADLINE> Service Merchandise Files Chapter 11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Service Merchandise Co. has filed for  
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, claiming total debts of $1.3 
billion owed to more than 1,000 creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	The discount jewelry and home products chain filed its petition  
Saturday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, outside normal court hours 
because of the large amount of paperwork involved. 
</P>
<P>
	The company listed assets of $1.5 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Service Merchandise announced March 16 it would file for Chapter  
11 after five vendors filed a petition claiming Service owed them 
more than $8 million. The vendors, including Remington and 
Samsonite, sought court supervision of the firm's restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said at that time that Service Merchandise  
would first have to arrange up to $750 million in financing to 
continue to pay its bills during reorganization. That financing was 
completed late last week, according to newly named chief executive 
officer Sam Cusano. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Saturday, the company said its stores,  
distribution centers and offices will continue to operate as usual 
during the reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
	Service Merchandise opened its first store in 1960 in Nashville  
but has struggled to stay competitive in the past decade with the 
emergence of mega-discounters like Wal-Mart and Circuit City. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reorganized its operations last year, narrowing its  
product offerings to jewelry, housewares and furnishings and 
shifting from warehouse distribution to off-the-shelf sales. 
</P>
<P>
	But sales continued to sag and the company's stock hit an  
all-time low last year of 25 cents a share, down from a 15-year 
high of $15 a share in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	After disappointing sales in the most recent holiday shopping  
period, the company changed its leadership, cut jobs at its 
headquarters in Brentwood, Tenn., and began closing more than a 
third of its 347 stores in 34 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the largest unsecured claims listed in the company's  
petition Saturday were Icon Health &AMP; Fitness, owed $12.4 million; 
Lucent Technologies, owed $8.2 million; and Dorel Industries, owed 
$6.7 million.

<HEADLINE> P&AMP;G's Suit Against Amway Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit  
accusing Amway Corp. and an Ogden salesman of spreading rumors 
linking Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. with the Church of Satan. 
</P>
<P>
	Procter &AMP; Gamble has countered the devil-worship rumors that  
began widely circulating in 1981 with repeated lawsuits, including 
a similar case pending in Houston that also targets rival Amway. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Procter &AMP; Gamble sued Amway distributor Randy L. Haugen  
of Ogden for spreading the Satanic rumor to other Amway salesmen on 
a phone-message system. Procter &AMP; Gamble later named Amway as a 
defendant in the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, U.S. District Judge Dale A. Kimball in Salt Lake  
dismissed the suit, ruling the rumors were not defamatory and that 
Procter &AMP; Gamble hadn't made a case for specific damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the Utah ruling is wrong and we are appealing it  
immediately,'' company spokeswoman Elaine Plummer said from 
Cincinnati on Monday. ``The case in Houston remains strong and the 
trial will begin May 3.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael More, deputy general counsel for Ada, Mich.-based Amway,  
said, however, that Procter &AMP; Gamble ``could never express how they 
were harmed by this voice mail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rumors grew out of Procter &AMP; Gamble's former corporate logo,  
which depicted a bearded man on the moon and stars, and were 
further fueled by a rumor that the company's president had promoted 
devil worship on a Phil Donahue show. No such show was ever taped.

<HEADLINE> Mich.'s Stabenow To Run for Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTHFIELD, Mich. (AP) -- Rep. Debbie Stabenow plans to seek the  
Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate seat of Republican 
Spencer Abraham. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats regard Abraham, a first-term senator, as vulnerable  
and have made him a national target in next year's election. 
Stabenow is in her second term in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Still unknown is whether Jack Kevorkian's former lawyer,  
Geoffrey Fieger, will run and if so, whether he'll do it as an 
independent or in the Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Stabenow said Monday she had asked Fieger for his support.  
``Geoff's got to make up his mind on what he wants to do,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stabenow, 48, is known for her outgoing personality and  
energetic campaign style. 
</P>
<P>
	``This (campaign) will be about the issues that matter most,''  
she said, listing Social Security, Medicare, medical patients' 
rights and education as top concerns. 
</P>

	Fieger, a Democrat who lost a bid for governor last year, said  
he is considering the Senate race.

<HEADLINE> Michigan City Cleans Up After Riot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Some were concerned about Michigan  
State University's reputation. Others worried about how the 
administration would react. Most were just embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
	The university and East Lansing were cleaning up Sunday and  
dealing with the aftermath of a violent disturbance by thousands 
following the school's basketball game with Duke University. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence after Michigan State's loss in the national  
collegiate basketball tournament's Final Four left eight cars 
torched, 24 windows broken in downtown businesses and 24 people 
arrested -- so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so stupid,'' said Brian Petitpren, a marketing senior  
from Troy. ``They should have more respect for the city and the 
university.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to look very good,'' agreed Eric Martin, a  
junior who said he feared the riot may tarnish the accomplishment 
of the Spartan team that finished 33-5 and one game shy of the 
national title game. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had a good reputation with the basketball team, and now  
it's all down the drain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they would be reviewing videotape to see if more  
arrests would be made. Of the two dozen people arrested, 11 were 
Michigan State students, East Lansing Police Capt. Louis Muhn said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first bottles were thrown at police officers and the first  
fire reported shortly after 10 p.m. Saturday, before the game -- 
held in St. Petersburg, Fla. -- even ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``These students would have rioted if our debate team made it to  
the Final Four,'' said Terry Denbow, Michigan State vice president 
of university relations. 
</P>
<P>
	About 230 police officers, included mounted patrols, were on the  
scene Saturday night and into early Sunday morning. Some 300 
canisters of tear gas were used to dispel groups of students that 
threatened police or firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence stunned Michigan State basketball coach Tom Izzo.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's totally embarrassing and ridiculous. That upset me more  
than anything,'' Izzo said. ``If any Michigan State students hear 
me, if you have season tickets, I'll buy them from you and I hope 
you never come to a Michigan State game again.''

<HEADLINE> Blue Devils Falter in Close Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The question lingered all season. As  
the blowout wins mounted, how would Duke fare in a close game with 
everything on the line? 
</P>
<P>
	When it came to that time at the Final Four, the Blue Devils --  
this team of 20-point blowouts and unbeatable proportions -- were no 
better than a .500 club. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Krzyzewski had been here plenty of times. He told his team  
that a national title most people all but handed to Duke weeks ago 
wouldn't be as easy as everyone predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke's six-point victory over Michigan State in the national  
semifinals Saturday raised some questions. The Connecticut Huskies 
answered them with a 77-74 victory Monday night that denied the 
Blue Devils their third national championship of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski said he could handle Duke losing the title if his  
team didn't beat itself. He and the Blue Devils came face-to-face 
with that prospect late in the game as the Huskies refused to 
wither or be intimidated by Duke's gaudy record or reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing by one with 24 seconds left, Krzyzewski put the ball in  
the hands of his senior leader Trajan Langdon, who led the Blue 
Devils with 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, however, Langdon didn't come through.  
</P>
<P>
	His path halted by UConn defensive stopper Ricky Moore, Langdon  
traveled trying to drive into the lane with Duke trailing by one. 
Then, after a pair of free throws by Khalid El-Amin, Langdon lost 
the ball trying to make a play, any play that would save Duke, 
falling to the ground as the clock ran out. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski's wife, Mickie, buried her hands in her face, and  
Langdon was consoled by assistant coach Quin Snyder as the Blue 
Devils walked off the court in stunned disbelief, heads hanging 
low. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, all the double-digit wins didn't matter as Duke  
became the 20th straight team with zero or one loss entering the 
NCAA tournament to come away without the crown.

<HEADLINE>  NY Rally Held for Kosovar Albanians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Some 3,000 supporters of Kosovar Albanians held  
a rally and march today demanding that the United States and NATO 
send ground troops into Kosovo and recognize it as an independent 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot allow the 20th century to close in Europe with a  
repetition of the Nazi era,'' former Rep. Joseph DioGuardi, head of 
the Albanian-American Civic League, told the crowd gathered near 
the United Nations on 42nd Street and First Avenue. ``We must do 
everything to save the Albanian people from genocide and prevent a 
wider war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After each speaker, the orderly but noisy crowd, broke into  
chants of ``USA, USA'' and ``Free Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. James Traficant, D-Ohio, told demonstrators that he plans  
to introduce a resolution in Congress calling for the U.S. 
government to arm the Kosovo Liberation Army and to send ground 
troops in to help. He also called on the United States to recognize 
the region as an independent country, saying it was the only way to 
stop the killing there. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO bombs pounded Yugoslavia for a sixth day as thousands of  
ethnic Albanians streamed out of Kosovo, trying to escape Serbian 
paramilitary forces.

<HEADLINE> Japan Jobless Rate Hits Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's unemployment rate soared to a record high  
of 4.6 percent in February and the number of people looking for 
work in the struggling economy hit a historic 3 million, the 
government said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The jobless rate rose sharply from the previous month's figure  
of 4.4 percent, which had stood as a record for three straight 
months, the Management and Coordination Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sour figures come as Japan is battling its deepest recession  
in 50 years. The government has pumped billions of dollars into the 
economy in an all-out campaign to prod consumers to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	``The unemployment situation is still harsh, but the most  
important thing for the improvement of that situation is to put the 
economy back on track,'' said Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu 
Nonaka. 
</P>
<P>
	The total number of people without jobs rose by 670,000 from a  
year earlier to 3.13 million -- the most since the agency began 
recording the data in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising joblessness comes as many companies fighting to regain  
competitiveness are restructuring by trimming staffs, selling off 
subsidiaries and closing offices. 
</P>
<P>
	The total number of jobholders shrank by 770,000 from a year  
earlier to 63.34 million, the agency said. It was the largest-ever 
decrease in the number of jobholders and marked the 13th 
consecutive month of declines. 
</P>
<P>
	The new jobless rate is the latest in a long string of dour  
economic announcements in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said earlier this month that the economy shrank  
0.8 percent in the last three months of 1998 -- the fifth quarter in 
a row that the economy has failed to grow. 
</P>
<P>
	That figure put Japan's economy on track to shrink 3.2 percent  
in the 1998-99 fiscal year if the pace continues -- the first time 
it would have shrunk two fiscal years in a row since the end of 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	To fight the recession, the government has earmarked a mammoth  
$682.5 billion dollars in the budget for the next fiscal year, 
starting April 1, for public works spending, tax cuts and other 
stimulus measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials are also spending $62.5 billion to bail out the  
country's troubled banks, which are saddled with loads of bad debt 
from the collapse of the a speculative bubble in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the disheartening numbers, many in Japan are saying the  
economy has hit bottom and should be on the mend over the next 
couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Keizai newspaper published a survey of 112 company  
presidents on Tuesday, showing that nearly 90 percent believe a 
turnaround should come before the end of 1999. The newspaper gave 
no margin of error. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said one factor behind the rise in the jobless  
rate was the growing number of previously unemployed women who have 
entered the job market in search of employment. 
</P>
<P>
	With real wages declining at many companies because of reduced  
bonus payments and fewer overtime hours, many wives have entered 
the job market in hopes of supplementing household income.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs. Euro, Down Vs. Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the euro and other major  
European currencies Monday as the continued fighting in Kosovo 
threatened to halt the region's already stagnant growth. The euro 
fell to yet another low. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar edged lower against the yen.  
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0735, down from $1.0769. During the  
trading day, the euro fell to $1.0697, its lowest level since the 
launch of the new currency in January. The euro has mostly fallen 
since its inception. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading, the dollar was quoted at 120.13 Japanese yen,  
down from 120.26. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia entered their sixth day  
Monday, having failed so far in efforts to get Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic to the negotiation table to sign a peace accord. 
Thousands of refugees were fleeing the country to an uncertain 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	``The longer it goes along, the more likely it is to slow  
economic growth in the region,'' said Jim Culnane, a senior trader 
at Norddeutsche Landesbank. 
</P>
<P>
	The European economy already is stagnant, with calls continuing  
for lower interest rates to spur borrowing and growth. The 
International Monetary Fund, according to Monday's Financial Times, 
called for lower rates at a private meeting over the weekend with 
officials from the European Central Bank. The ECB makes monetary 
policy for the 11 nations using the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	However, lower interest rates make a region's currency and  
assets less appealing to overseas investors. That too weighed on 
the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar benefited, as it typically does during  
international turmoil, by being deemed a safe-haven currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar initially rose against the yen during Asian trading  
as stocks fell in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	But once the dollar failed to rise past 120.60 yen, Japanese  
exporters and corporate traders sold off the U.S. currency. Other 
investors took to the sidelines ahead of the end of the Japanese 
fiscal year on Wednesday; uncertainty typically rules the beginning 
of the year, which begins Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4848 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4806, and 1.5139 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5142. The British 
pound was quoted at $1.6168, down from $1.6218. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8218 German 
marks, up from 1.8162; 6.1087 French francs, up from 6.0901; and 
1,805.05 Italian lire, up from 1,798.56.

<HEADLINE> NATO Races To Smash Serb Units </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Tens of thousands of ethnic  
Albanians streamed out of Kosovo today while NATO raced against 
time to smash Serb military units and ease what officials say is 
becoming Europe's worst humanitarian disaster since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, announced plans to go  
to Belgrade on Tuesday in a new bid to end the Kosovo crisis. 
Russia has strongly opposed NATO's air campaign against fellow 
Slavic Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	But the crisis showed no signs of abating.  
</P>
<P>
	About 60,000 Kosovo Albanian refugees have arrived in northern  
Albania as of today, the U.N. relief agency said, straining the 
already desperate resources of one of Europe's poorest countries. 
</P>
<P>
	And thousands more were heading today for Macedonia to the east  
and Montenegro to the West. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are you American?'' Nejmije Kelmendi, 50, asked an Associated  
Press photographer as she trudged up a steep mountain road near Pec 
in southwestern Kosovo, accompanied by her two daughters. ``Tell 
NATO that Pec is burning, and where are the ground troops?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early today, Yugoslav authorities closed at least one crossing  
point into Albania, erecting concrete barriers along the main road 
from the Kosovo city of Prizren to the Albania town of Kukes. It 
was unclear if other crossing points were also sealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Along Kosovo's border with Montenegro, about 3,000 Kosovo  
Albanians were trying to cross today. Police were charging $60 per 
car to allow refugees to enter Montenegro. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav officials said NATO's ``shameful'' attack was only  
inflaming the ethnic crisis in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels 
have been fighting for independence from Serbia, the main Yugoslav 
republic. Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev claimed 1,000 
civilians had been killed in Yugoslavia as the alliance pounded the 
country for a sixth day. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgrade has not announced casualty estimates, although Yugoslav  
U.N. envoy Vladislav Jovanovic claimed Friday that hundreds of 
civilians had been killed. It is impossible to independently 
confirm casualty figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Early today, Allied warplanes targeted mobile Serb units in  
Kosovo and cruise missiles launched from U.S. ships in the Adriatic 
joined in the barrage. Air raid sirens sounded again in the 
Yugoslav capital at mid-morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian state-run television repeatedly showed video of a raging  
fire in the center of Kosovo's capital of Pristina that it said was 
set off by a NATO missile attack on a police building. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than restraining the Serbs, however, the attacks appeared  
only to have intensified their anger at the ethnic Albanians, who 
make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pattern that emerges (from their accounts) is paramilitary  
forces arriving, rounding people up and telling them at gunpoint to 
go,'' said spokesman Kris Janowsky of the U.N. High Commissioner 
for Refugees in Geneva. ``So we are seeing officially sanctioned 
ethnic cleansing of the Albanian population in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 24-year-old refugee from the Suva Reka are of southern Kosovo,  
Jeton Vranovski, told a reporter in Albania that when NATO 
airstrikes began, Serb police ``came to our village and told us to 
go to America, go to NATO and they will help you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Western leaders insisted the air campaign would continue  
until its goals were achieved. 
</P>
<P>
	British Defense Secretary George Robertson said the campaign was  
intensifying today, focusing on Serb units as the Western alliance 
rushed to halt alleged Serb ethnic cleansing before too much damage 
was done. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will only be NATO airstrikes that will stop the violence,''  
he told CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	``Day by day, allied airplanes and cruise missiles have made a  
huge impact on the military machine on which Milosevic depends,'' 
Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said Sunday the situation is ``on the  
brink of a major humanitarian disaster,'' unprecedented since World 
War II. More than 500,000 Kosovars are now displaced from the 
crisis, NATO said -- the biggest population shift in Europe since 
1945. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bratislava Morina, the Serb refugee commissioner, called  
such accusations propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo whatsoever,''  
she said on state-run Serbian television. ``The fact is that some 
Albanians are leaving their home in the regions where NATO is 
attacking civilian targets, also because some of their leaders left 
the country and went abroad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marko Gasic of the government-sponsored Serbian Information  
Center told Britain's Sky Television today that ``NATO's role in 
this crisis is shameful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's assault is aimed at getting President Slobodan Milosevic  
to accept a peace plan that calls for 28,000 troops in Kosovo. But 
Gasic told Sky TV that while Milosevic will hold discussions if 
asked, ``he certainly won't be signing the capitulation that 
originally started the problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fifth straight night of airstrikes began Sunday night,  
according to the Pentagon in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 warplanes took off from the NATO air base in Aviano,  
Italy, just after dark. Among them were British Harrier jets, who 
returned to Italy after successfully hitting Serb targets even 
though they came under heavy anti-aircraft fire, said spokesman 
Group Captain Ian Travers Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent Beta news agency, quoting Serb TV, said six  
missiles hit the Pristina area, after which ``Albanian terrorists'' 
in the northern part of the town began a fierce attack on the 
police. The report said three missiles hit the center of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tanjug state news agency reported that NATO missiles  
targeting Djakovica in western Kosovo hit an army barracks and also 
damaged ``many civilian buildings'' including a Catholic church, 
and that some were destroyed. Albanian ``terrorist gangs'' 
repeatedly shot at police patrols throughout the night, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least three people were wounded in attacks in the region of  
Gnjilane southeast of Pristina, according to Tanjug. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO missiles fired at a military airport at Podgorica, capital  
of the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, hit a MiG-21 jet fighter 
and an army vehicle, a Yugoslav army source said. A television 
station in Nis, where a major military compound is located, 
reported a missile hit the airport there.

<HEADLINE> Fatal Shooting Rocks NY Police Dept </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After weeks of demonstrations that led to some  
1,000 arrests and a siege-like atmosphere at Police Headquarters, 
the protests over the fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man 
may be ending. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Al Sharpton said Sunday the daily protests would end  
today, perhaps taking some heat off a department buffeted by a 
series of embarrassing incidents that has thrown the nation's 
largest police force into its worst crisis in years. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sharpton said the behind-the-scenes pressure on the New York  
Police Department over its tactics and relations with minorities in 
the city will persist long after the protesters have gone. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's troubles come just two years after it was  
riding high on news that the city's crime rate was dropping, with 
murders under 1,000 annually for the first time in 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
	What's created the most anger is the case of Amadou Diallo, an  
unarmed West African immigrant shot to death by police in a Bronx 
apartment vestibule. The police, apparently believing Diallo was 
reaching for a gun, fired 41 bullets at him. He was hit by 19 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
	In daily protests outside Police Headquarters since March 9,  
charges have been hurled against police of prejudice against the 
black man and protesters have demanded the four white police 
officers be jailed. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a source close to the case, a Bronx grand jury  
indicted four New York Police officers last Friday on second-degree 
murder charges in the Diallo case. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some have hinted that protests will continue elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
	And the protesters have other cases to cite in their charge of  
police misconduct: 
</P>
<P>
	-- In Brooklyn, jury selection was to begin today for the trial  
of four other officers accused of brutalizing a Haitian immigrant, 
Abner Louima, in 1997. The trial -- centering on allegations 
officers sodomized the victim with a stick in a precinct 
stationhouse -- could stretch into summer. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Despite the Diallo controversy, Police Commissioner Howard  
Safir jetted off on an Academy Awards junket. He returned last week 
to find himself under fire for being insensitive to the anger in 
the Diallo case and possibly violating city conflict-of-interest 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	-- As many as 20 Manhattan cops may soon be indicted in what the  
tabloids have dubbed the ``sex-for-protection scandal.'' The 
officers have already been stripped of their guns and badges based 
on allegations they were getting free sex in a 60-woman brothel in 
exchange for shielding it from raids. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The federal Civil Rights Commission, U.S. Attorney's offices  
for both the Southern and Eastern districts of New York and State 
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer all have started investigations into 
the NYPD and how it disciplines its own. The commission will hold 
hearings in May on whether its ``stop-and-frisk'' tactics -- 
especially in minority neighborhoods -- violate the public's rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the more than 1,000 people arrested in the daily protests  
have been prominent whites, Latinos and Asians, as well as blacks. 
And high-ranking politicians have criticized city leaders for not 
paying more attention to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Minorities are humiliated and angered by the indignity of  
being treated all too often as presumptive criminals,'' said Sen. 
Charles Schumer in a speech calling on the department to close the 
racial rift. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's trouble have also sullied Mayor Rudolph  
Giuliani. In Sunday's editions, a Daily News poll found the mayor's 
popularity at an all-time low, with a 40 percent approval rating, 
down from 60 percent in November and 65 percent a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, Safir and the powerful Patrolmen's Benevolent  
Association have defended the 40,000-officer force, reminding New 
Yorkers that crime rates are at their lowest level in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent days, off-duty cops staged a counter-protest  
supporting the officers in the Diallo case. And Giuliani scoffed at 
reports that U.S. Attorney Zachary Carter may be preparing to order 
federal monitoring the department. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before you can start talking about federal micro-managing of  
this police department, there are about 200 police departments you 
have to put ahead of it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani had a similar response when a task force created after  
the Louima incident suggested a special monitor oversee brutality 
cases. The mayor said the panel's plans were ``unrealistic and make 
very little sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Task force member Norman Siegel, executive director of the New  
York Civil Liberties Union, said Giuliani has been proven wrong. 
``Maybe if he'd listened to us then, he wouldn't have this 
problem,'' Siegel said.

<HEADLINE> Test Reveals if Melanoma Has Spread </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- An experimental new test for people undergoing  
surgery for melanoma can apparently reveal whether deadly traces of 
the cancer have already spread to other parts of the body. 
</P>
<P>
	Melanoma is highly curable if caught early, but doctors often  
cannot be sure whether it has already spread. This new test could 
be the first simple and accurate way of revealing this spread so 
that the disease can be treated aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
	Melanoma is the most dangerous form of skin cancer. The American  
Cancer society estimates that 44,200 cases will be diagnosed in the 
United States this year and 7,300 will die. 
</P>
<P>
	The new test, developed at the John Wayne Cancer Institute in  
Santa Monica, Calif., looks for certain proteins that show up 
mostly on cancer tissue. Dr. Rishab Gupta reported on preliminary 
use of the test Monday at a cancer society conference in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The protein is called tumor antigen 90, or TA-90. Doctors look  
for it using a simple blood test that checks for antibodies to 
TA-90. If the protein is present, the sample turns yellow. 
</P>
<P>
	If TA-90 shows up after the cancer has been surgically removed,  
it means the cancer probably still exists somewhere else in the 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	For these patients, doctor are likely to remove a much larger  
section of tissue around the tumor, take out lymph nodes and offer 
chemotherapy, radiation or experimental cancer vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be reassuring to have a simple test that tells us if  
the tumor has spread or we have gotten it all,'' said Dr. Charles 
McDonald, a dermatologist from Brown University. ``This would be 
the first effective test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gupta and others tried out the test on 57 such early-stage  
patients whose disease turned out to have spread. They found that 
43 had a positive TA-90 test. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years after surgical removal of melanoma, they found that  
88 percent of patients with no signs of TA-90 were still alive, 
compared with 63 percent of those who tested positive for the 
protein. 
</P>
<P>
	It's still too early to know if the test might reveal melanoma  
in people who show no outward signs of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	But because the test would be cheap and easy to perform, Gupta  
said ``it could be of enormous benefit in nationwide screening 
programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gupta said his institute is negotiating with biotechnology  
companies. that could develop the test for commercial release. 
</P>
<P>
	The test is the latest development in what some call molecular  
detection of cancer, which look for traces of proteins unique to 
the disease. The most widely used example is the PSA test for 
prostate cancer; it reveals abnormal levels of a protein produced 
by dividing prostate cells. 
</P>
<P>
	One such test still in development attempts to spot ovarian  
cancer early by detecting lysophosphatidic acid, or LPA. Dr. Yan Xu 
of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation said this show promise for early 
detection, but more work is necessary to reduce the chances of 
false alarms. 
</P>
<P>
	She estimated that 50 of every 10,000 women have ovarian cancer.  
Testing for LPA would find 45 of them. However, it would 
erroneously label 1,000 women as having this form of cancer.

<HEADLINE> Fire Burns at Mich. Fireworks Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSSEO, Mich. (AP) -- A fireworks plant where seven workers died  
in a blast last December was hit by a fire today that critically 
injured one worker. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency workers rushed to the Independence Professional  
Fireworks plant shortly after 8:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are requesting ambulances,'' sheriff's deputy Steve  
Morgan said. ``All of our fire departments are at the scene.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan said callers initially described the incident as an  
explosion and fire. But Tom Jackson, who lives near the factory, 
said he saw a building on fire when he passed by but did not hear 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
	A 40-year-old man suffered burns and was taken to Hillsdale  
Community Health Center in critical condition, nursing director 
Doris Whorley said. He was later transferred to another hospital. 
She wasn't sure whether her hospital expected more patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dec. 11 explosion killed six women and one man and injured  
13 other people. Investigators have said they may never fully 
understand what caused that blast, which leveled one section of the 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
	A man who answered the telephone at the plant this morning  
refused to talk and hung up. 
</P>

	Osseo is about 80 miles southwest of Detroit and 15 miles north  
of the Ohio state line.

<HEADLINE> 'Jenny Jones' Civil Trial To Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Jenny Jones says she's looking forward to  
testifying in the civil trial stemming from the death of a gay man 
who revealed a crush on a heterosexual friend during a 1995 taping 
of her talk show. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection began Monday in the $50 million lawsuit the  
family of Scott Amedure brought against the Chicago-based show and 
its producer, Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure was killed three days after revealing a crush on  
Jonathan Schmitz. Schmitz was convicted of second-degree murder in 
1996, but the conviction was overturned last fall due to an error 
in jury selection. Schmitz's retrial is pending. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very much looking forward to testifying. I'm looking  
forward to being able to set the record straight,'' Jones said in 
Monday's editions of The Detroit News. 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure's family contends the show's producers lied to Schmitz  
about the gender of his admirer. Attorneys for Warner Bros. say 
Schmitz was repeatedly was told his secret admirer might be a man 
or woman.

<HEADLINE> Bond Fall as Stocks Soar / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *With BC-Bonds-Glance    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Long-term Treasury bonds fell Monday as the Dow  
Jones Industrial Average's race to 10,000 drew investors into 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 23/32  
point, or $7.19 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 5.64 percent from 5.59 percent late 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Dow's first-ever close above 10,000,  
long-term Treasurys suffered from competition from another round of 
big corporate bond offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	Conoco Inc. said Monday it will price a $3 billion, three-part  
offering within the next few weeks. In addition, General Motors 
Acceptance Corp., the financing unit of General Motors Corp., is 
expected to launch a $2 billion global offering this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Some $16 billion of corporate bonds were sold last week,  
including AT&AMP;T Corp.'s record $8 billion sale. Investment banks 
often sell Treasuries when they underwrite corporate debt to 
protect against losses in case interest rates rise before the sales 
are completed. They usually buy the government securities back 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, economic data released Monday did not change  
expectations that Federal Reserve policy-makers would leave 
interest rates unchanged at a meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The government reported sales of new homes in the posted a  
larger-than-expected decline of 2 percent in February, but the pace 
of home buying remained brisk as healthy economic fundamentals 
continue to propel the domestic housing market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department figures continue to portray an economy  
that continues to expand without a resurgence of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
fell between 1/32 and 1/8 point, while intermediate Treasury 
securities fell between 3/16 and 7/16 point, reported Bridge 
Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, remained at 
Friday's late level of 1,282.90. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.49 percent, while  
the discount fell 0.01 percentage point from Friday at 4.38 
percent. Six-month yields were 4.50 percent, as the discount fell 
0.02 percentage point to 4.34 percent. One-year yields were 4.72 
percent, while the discount rose 0.02 percentage point to 4.50 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.81 percent from 4.50 percent Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 12/32 to 124 11/32. The average yield 
to maturity was rose to 5.22 percent from 5.20 percent on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Strawberry's Return Put on Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry's return to the New York  
Yankees from cancer was put on hold Monday, when manager Joe Torre 
told the Yankees' slugger he would not make the opening day roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just another mountain that I have to climb. I'll get over  
it,'' said Strawberry, who had colon cancer surgery last October. 
``It's a relief to me not to sit through the last few days of 
spring training with a dark cloud over my head, not knowing what my 
situation is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old outfielder will remain at extended spring  
training when the Yankees open the season next week. He will go to 
Triple-A Columbus after he completes his chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good thing. I didn't think that at the beginning,''  
Strawberry said. ``From the point of finishing up chemo and being 
able to get a lot of work done, this is what I need to do. I don't 
want to have a setback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Treatments are scheduled to continue through at least April.  
</P>
<P>
	``I told him we'll work together on this thing,'' Torre said.  
``I think he understands that what happens will pretty much dictate 
what will happen. When he's ready, we'll have a place for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, who will miss 1-to-3 months of the season as he recovers  
from prostate cancer surgery, said Strawberry handled the news 
well. Torre, who has a close relationship with Strawberry, met with 
him for the past two days at Legends Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe felt it was best,'' Strawberry said. ``He knows the season  
is going to be stressful. He's looking out for me, knowing I'm 
still on chemo. He definitely understands what we're going 
through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry will accompany the team for two exhibition games this  
weekend at Los Angeles before returning to Florida. He will also 
visit with his doctor in Palm Springs during the west coast trip. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees, anticipating Strawberry wouldn't be ready for the  
start of the season, shifted him to a minor league contract during 
the offseason. While he still gets a $2.5 million salary, the 
Yankees save approximately $4,500 per day in luxury tax until he is 
placed on the major league roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a real experience,'' Strawberry said. ``Some days  
haven't been pleasant ... some have been very moody days. I got 
angry earlier in the spring about a lot of things because I wanted 
to play and show I can play. Now, I'm at a peaceful place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry saw time in left field and at designated hitter last  
year. Chili Davis, signed to be the DH, missed most of the regular 
season because of an ankle injury. With Davis back this year, 
Strawberry must be in shape to play left. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just told him we need him to play six innings in the  
outfield in games he starts,'' Torre said. ``This is what we're 
shooting for. With Chili on the club, he would have to play some 
outfield.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry has played just eight innings in left field this  
spring. He made his spring outfield debut last Thursday, playing 
four innings against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I can play. That's not a question in anyone's mind  
around here,'' Strawberry said. ``I think the biggest concern is 
finishing up chemo and my health. That's the most important 
issue.''

<HEADLINE> Magic Vs. Bird Changed Game's Soul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- It changed more than the face of  
college basketball. It changed the soul of the game, too. 
</P>
<P>
	When Larry Bird met Magic Johnson on a Monday night in March  
1979 with a national title on the line, the TV rights to the NCAA 
tournament cost what a light-hitting shortstop does today -- about 
$6 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty years later, CBS paid the NCAA 100 times that much to  
show Duke and Connecticut finish off the same tournament in 
tonight's title game. 
</P>
<P>
	Money is hardly the only measure of how the event has changed.  
But it is certainly the most revealing. As would happen with the 
NBA a decade later, the Bird vs. Magic rivalry laid the foundation 
that would make the Final Four one of sports' cornerstone 
properties, a showcase big enough to build personalities and a lore 
all its own -- and cash in on year after year. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, the stakes were raised all the way around. The influx  
of dollars was so great it gave teen-age stars enough leverage to 
make hostages of the schools that pursued them. It turned coaches 
into celebrities who could command six-figure contracts and 
multimillion-dollar shoe deals. It made the NCAA powerful beyond 
the most ambitious bureaucrat's wildest dreams. It fattened budgets 
at athletic departments that once struggled to pay for towels. 
</P>
<P>
	And maybe most important to its success, the  
one-loss-and-you're-gone format made for great TV drama that gained 
momentum on successive weekends as even casual fans tracked its 
progress in thousands of office pools. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gave college basketball a three-week window to tell  
hundreds and hundreds of great stories about student-athletes, 
about the programs, the schools, about so many different things,'' 
Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun should know, since his is one of the best stories  
around. Until this season, his Connecticut teams had won five Big 
East regular-season titles, a scintillating 72 percent of their 
games, advanced to the round of 16 on six occasions and the round 
of eight on three of those. 
</P>
<P>
	But without the instant credibility an appearance in the Final  
Four commands, Calhoun's resume was always found to be wanting. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's my only complaint,'' he said. ``Three weeks in March  
can't determine if somebody can coach or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This Final Four is the 28th he has attended, but the first where  
Calhoun is still on the job. In the past, he was one among dozens 
of coaches making the rounds at what has become the sport's annual 
convention and trade show. Now, he is where the young coaches 
working the lobbies for news on job openings aspire to be. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun's counterpart in tonight's game, Mike Krzyzewski, got  
his leg up at an early age, taking the Blue Devils to the Final 
Four in 1986, when he was just 40. But his success -- two national 
championships and eight trips to the Final Four -- has not erased 
the memory of what it was like to climb the ladder, especially in 
that magical year of 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski was then in his fourth year at Army, relatively new  
to the ways of the coaching fraternity. He remembers the tremendous 
anticipation surrounding that final game, the ``aura'' that Bird 
and Magic brought to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember wondering,'' he joked, ``why all these great  
players didn't want to be Army officers. I could see Bird and Magic 
being future generals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They would move on to the NBA the next year and become just as  
powerful as generals, and a good deal wealthier in the bargain. And 
so would the showcase they were leaving behind. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24.1 television rating that meeting generated has never been  
topped, but it set a target for the strong, steady growth of the 
college game that two decades later shows no sign of letting up. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the legacy of 1979 is that there are times during the  
weekend extravaganza that the Final Four seems to be less about the 
games and more about the industry. But maybe it was headed in that 
direction all along. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked for his recollection about that magical game 20 years ago,  
NCAA executive director Cedric Dempsey remembered having just moved 
out west to become athletic director at San Diego State. What 
almost nobody knew at the time was that for the three weeks leading 
up to the final, he had been talking with Magic's coach, Jud 
Heathcote of Michigan State, about taking the Aztecs' job. 
</P>
<P>
	``We kept talking and they kept winning,'' Dempsey recalled.  
``The morning after they won, he called me up and said, `Sorry, 
Ced, there's no way I'm leaving now.'''

<HEADLINE>  Castro, Cubans Meet Major Leaguers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Clearly, Fidel Castro enjoyed the game, especially  
each time a Cuban player got a big hit. He also seemed to like the 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	So what exactly did the 73-year-old president and Baltimore  
Orioles owner Peter Angelos talk about for all 11 innings Sunday? 
</P>
<P>
	``He was asking questions with respect to salaries and how the  
game operates,'' Angelos said. ``He knows about some of the stars 
of the game. It was a very interesting experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, perhaps, a surprising one. The Orioles, with a payroll of  
more than $80 million, held on for a 3-2 win over a Cuban all-star 
team in which players earn about $10 per month. 
</P>
<P>
	Though several Orioles previously said this would be just  
another spring training game, it was obvious it meant far more as 
soon as Castro stepped on the field about 20 minutes before the 
first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fi-del! Fi-del!'' the 50,000 fans chanted at Estadio  
Latinoamericano at the sight of the former University of Havana 
right-hander. ``Cu-ba! Cu-ba!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albert Belle, Brady Anderson and the rest of the Orioles  
gathered around Castro to shake hands, curious to see how he looked 
up close in his olive combat fatigues. Manager Ray Miller talked to 
Castro through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me this was a good baseball town,'' Miller said. ``He  
said not to worry, that we were playing in front of the greatest 
baseball fans in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castro watched from a front-row seat behind home plate, flanked  
by Angelos and major league commissioner Bud Selig. The night 
before, Castro and Selig spoke at a reception. 
</P>
<P>
	``He talked about his career,'' Selig said. ``But in all honesty  
he didn't build himself up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Castro knew about big league stars -- Cuban defectors  
Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, Livan Hernandez and Rey Ordonez, 
among them -- he hadn't seen any big league teams for a long time 
because none had visited the Communist island since 1959. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody came down here looking to make history,'' Orioles  
outfielder B.J. Surhoff said. ``Everybody came down here looking to 
play a baseball game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Surhoff carried the U.S. flag onto the field for the  
national anthems and later gave his bat to the Hall of Fame in 
Cooperstown, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``For many years, we have been trying to have this match,'' star  
Cuban third baseman Omar Linares said through a translator. ``I 
really hope these will not be the last games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Cuban team, this one probably even stronger, will visit  
Baltimore's Camden Yards on May 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will open the door so there might be more games between  
the U.S. and Cuba,'' said Joel Valdez, 26, a scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	By local standards, this Cuban crowd was rather tame until the  
late innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Tickets were issued on an invitation-only basis -- instead of the  
10 cents they normally cost -- ensuring the stands would be packed 
with loyal Castro supporters. But that left out many of Cuba's most 
passionate ``pelota'' fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Missing were the drums, sirens, air horns, singing, dancing and  
rumba music that enveloped the ballpark from the first pitch during 
Saturday night's playoff game between the Havana Industriales and 
Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
	No cheerleaders in black spandex jumped on top of the dugouts,  
no ballgirls served coffee to the umpires during the fifth-inning 
break. No one smuggled in Havana Club rum, and no beer was offered 
inside, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the 53-year-old stadium was spruced up -- gone were the wild  
dogs that usually roam the concourse, hoping for bits of the 
pork-leg sandwiches sold at concession stands. 
</P>
<P>
	There was the traditional first ball. Former Washington Senators  
pitcher Connie Marrero, 88, threw four of them, then three more to 
Anderson when he led off the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Johnson's two-run homer off Cuban ace Jose Ibar in the  
second kept things quiet until the home team started its comeback. 
Castro grinned when Linares' RBI single in the eighth made it 
2-all. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was delighted when the game was tied,'' Angelos said.  
</P>
<P>
	The teams played beneath big outfield signs that proclaimed  
``Socialist Cuba Sports'' and ``Sports for the People.'' The 
billboards that preach ``Remember the Revolution'' and 
``Antimperialistas'' are on the road the Orioles took in from the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
	When the game ended, Castro made an ``oh, well'' gesture with  
his hands and later congratulated the Cuban players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he was a little disappointed,'' Angelos said.  
</P>
<P>
	Once a Triple-A hotspot when the Havana Sugar Kings ruled, the  
Caribbean island had not seen a major league club since March 21, 
1959, right after Castro took power. On that day at the very same 
ballpark, guards strolled with machine guns while Sandy Koufax 
pitched Los Angeles past Cincinnati 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, it's been a blackout and blockade for Cuban fans  
trying to follow big league ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1963 Trading With the Enemy Act forbid most Americans from  
spending money in Cuba. Despite Angelos' efforts for several years 
-- he said he was driven by sportsmanship -- only President Clinton's 
recent relaxing of restrictions against Cuba made this game 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	The American government, however, has stressed that these two  
exhibitions are not a matter of sports diplomacy, such as the table 
tennis matches with China in the 1970s. Rather, these are 
considered ``people-to-people'' contacts, much like those conducted 
with Cuban artists and academics. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, these games drew opposition in the United States.  
Several members of Congress spoke out against them, and Florida 
Marlins owner John Henry joined a protest outside the Orioles' 
spring camp in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles pitcher Juan Guzman, who was born in the Dominican  
Republic and employs several Cuban domestics at his home in Miami, 
asked out of the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said there were ``issues that are above my head that I  
can't even discuss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linares, considered Cuba's best player at 32, was not concerned,  
for good reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not aware of any criticism,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Switched Baby's Mom To Fight Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- The biological mother of a girl  
switched at birth with another newborn in 1995 has gone to court to 
protest a proposed $2 million settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Paula Johnson said in court papers Friday that the settlement  
for Rebecca Chittum isn't enough and as the girl's biological 
mother, she must approve it. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sets of grandparents raising the other girl, Callie  
Marie Conley, have agreed to accept $2 million from the 
state-operated University of Virginia Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement is subject to court approval. A hearing is  
scheduled for next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls' switch was discovered last year as a result of  
court-ordered blood tests in a child-support case involving Callie. 
About the same time, the couple raising Rebecca -- Callie's 
biological parents -- died in a car wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	The families decided it would be best for the girls to leave  
them with the people they knew rather than switch them back. The 
two sets of parents of the couple who died are raising Rebecca and 
Ms. Johnson is raising Callie and already has rejected a $2 million 
offer.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Involvement in Kosovo Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- This decade -- never mind this century -- has  
been awash in blood, but the world's great power has been selective 
in using force to stanch the flow. 
</P>
<P>
	Multiply the loss of life in Kosovo by a magnitude of 100, and  
still it does not equal the toll in 90 days of Rwandan slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Mass starvation in North Korea brings food shipments but no  
force from the United States to break a repressive regime's relief 
bottleneck. 
</P>
<P>
	Sudan's civil war has left almost 2 million dead, and counting.  
</P>
<P>
	How the United States picks its enemies can bear little relation  
to the scale of suffering it wishes to ease, even when intervention 
is conducted on largely humanitarian grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any justification you can use for getting involved in Kosovo  
applies even more so to other conflicts,'' says Gideon Rose, a 
national security official in the first Clinton administration. 
``There is not a coherent intellectual rationale for doing just 
Kosovo but not a whole variety of other interventions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The naysayers -- and there are many -- will fall quiet if the NATO  
attacks on Yugoslavia somehow result in a stabler, safer life for 
Kosovars without major casualties among the allies. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, foreign policy analysts are hard-pressed to see a  
logical pattern that would explain why Somalia, but not Rwanda; why 
Bosnia, but not Sierra Leone; why Kosovo, but not so many other 
places where tyrants crush their people or their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're going to do humanitarian interventions, I'd rather do  
them in Africa because more Africans are dying,'' said Michael 
Mandelbaum, a European and national security scholar at the Johns 
Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Africans are suffering more and they don't have wealthy  
neighbors that can actually do something for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Kosovars push for more autonomy, so do others whose pain is  
not seen on TV -- among them Tibetans, Turkish Kurds, Tamils in tiny 
Sri Lanka and ethnic groups in Indonesia, where the bloodletting 
comes with a propensity for cutting off heads. 
</P>
<P>
	With so much going on, it probably is unfair to ask why the  
United States does not step in here and there, says Rose, senior 
editor at Foreign Affairs magazine and former associate director 
for Near East and South Asian affairs in the National Security 
Council. He says it may be more on the mark to ask why it does, 
when it does. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. decision not to support -- in effect, not to allow -- a  
sturdy and swift UN peacekeeping force in Rwanda in 1994, when at 
least 500,000 minority Tutsi and moderate Hutus were killed in one 
of history's worst bloodbaths, still weighs on the conscience. 
</P>
<P>
	Visiting Rwanda last year, President Clinton pledged ``never  
again must we be shy in the face of the evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The slaughter came six months after 18 U.S. soldiers were killed  
in a firefight in Somalia during an operation remembered as costly 
and messy, even if it did save thousands of Somali lives. 
Washington's taste for intervening in humanitarian crises not 
strongly and directly tied to American interests, soured. 
</P>
<P>
	So, why Kosovo?  
</P>
<P>
	Analysts largely accept the hard-nosed proposition that Europe  
is strategically more important than Africa. They are divided on 
whether the Balkans are an important part of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	In pitching intervention to a public always wary of foreign  
entanglements, Clinton cited a ``moral imperative'' to move against 
the brutality that killed more than 2,000 people in Kosovo and 
displaced perhaps a quarter of the population. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is why we have acted now, because we care about saving  
innocent lives,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also has tried to make the case that the conflict  
threatens instability well beyond Yugoslavia's borders, in other 
countries along the ``major fault line'' of continents and 
religions: ``We act to prevent a wider war, to defuse a powder keg 
at the heart of Europe, that has exploded twice before in this 
century with catastrophic results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether the administration believed the killing in Kosovo  
has been anywhere near as massive as elsewhere, Clinton spokesman 
Joe Lockhart said: ``The White House doesn't compare things like 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's been a real hallmark of this administration that  
we have around the world, whatever continent it's on, we've been 
involved in trying to bring peace,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Duke Women's Title Bid Celebrated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Students gathered around a giant-screen TV  
in Cameron Indoor Stadium to cheer for what they hoped would be the 
first of two Duke basketball championships on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Things didn't quite turn out that way.  
</P>
<P>
	Purdue defeated Duke 62-45 to win the NCAA women's championship  
and doused a potential on-campus celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	The students now must rely on the men for a national title. The  
Blue Devils play Connecticut on Monday night in St. Petersburg, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	For many of the approximately 1,000 students who crowded the  
floor at Cameron, the women's team provided more thrills than the 
men late in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most exciting game I've watched all year,'' said  
Jason Belk, a senior from Raleigh. ``They're used to be a 
difference between men's basketball and women's basketball at Duke, 
but there isn't any more. It's almost more exciting to watch the 
women because it's unexpected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They're just as important as the men's team,'' said Shannon  
Dooley, a freshman from Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the final seconds of Purdue's victory ticked away, the  
students filed quietly out of the arena and headed back to their 
dorms. A small group lingered outside in the grassy quad at the 
center of campus after the game had ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never expected the women to get this far. We're really  
happy for them,'' said Nicole Hess, a sophomore from Greensboro. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Junker, 23, an alumnus and a native of Germany, came back  
to Durham from his homeland just to experience the Final Four 
atmosphere. He said the disappointment will be much more widespread 
if the men lose. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't win with the men, it's going to be much worse,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> Duke Students Upset With Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM (AP) -- Students filed out of Cameron Indoor Stadium in  
stunned silence Monday night after the Connecticut Huskies upset 
the Blue Devils 77-74 to win their first NCAA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of students poured into the arena and crowded around a  
giant television screen to watch the game. Some spread out on 
blankets on the tarp-covered floor, while others sat in some of the 
arena's 8,800 seats to get a view. 
</P>
<P>
	Spotlights illuminated banners from Duke's NCAA titles in 1991  
and 1992 as the scoreboard ticked off the minutes before tipoff. 
</P>
<P>
	A Duke victory likely would have triggered a wild celebration,  
featuring a towering bonfire at the center of campus. At least nine 
car-sized wooden benches were piled up and set aflame after Duke's 
89-77 win over North Carolina on Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Many fans stood throughout the game as a band urged them on.  
</P>
<P>
	But as Connecticut built a five-point lead late in the second  
half, doubt started creeping in. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just need to play our game, mentally tough, relaxed,'' said  
a grim-faced Matt Weiss, a junior from Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	When Trajan Langdon lost the ball in the closing seconds to  
clinch the Huskies' victory, Duke's notoriously rowdy crowd fell 
deathly silent. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans marched to the center of campus and started a  
traditional bonfire, but the mood was grim. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel defeated, even though we weren't the ones playing,''  
said freshman Erica Biro, from Boca Raton, Fla. ``It's so shocking. 
That's why the silence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a fire of defeat,'' said Kristin Pitman, a freshman  
from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Talene Yacoubian, a graduate student in neurobiology from  
Chattanooga, Tenn., had her second painful experience watching Duke 
lose a national championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was here in '94 in this building when they lost to  
Arkansas,''she said ``I have to stick around in grad school until 
they finally win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yacoubian also said she may have to ditch her lucky shoes. She  
was wearing a pair of sneakers and said the only time this season 
she didn't wear them was when Duke lost to Cincinnati in the Great 
Alaska Shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	She was wearing her lucky shoes again Monday night, but they  
didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess their charm is gone.''  
</P>
<P>
	Several female fans wept after the game. Others took the  
shocking loss in stride. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not taking it as hard as some folks, maybe it's a freshman  
thing,'' said freshman Elizabeth Fulk of Winston-Salem. ``I am 
proud to be at this school.''

<HEADLINE> Duke Women Crushed by Finals Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- When faced with one of those inane  
questions about how she felt now that Duke had lost the national 
championship, center Michele VanGorp's disappointment turned to 
biting sarcasm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Extremely elated,'' she deadpanned, then corrected her  
inquisitor: ``Of course we feel disappointed and crushed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke had a halftime lead but couldn't hold sustain it over the  
final 20 minutes Sunday night, and lost to top-ranked Purdue 62-45. 
Afterward, guard Georgia Schweitzer pulled her long ponytail around 
to cover her face and sobbed quietly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a great year, and I love these guys,'' she said.  
``It's really sad it had to end this way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke (29-7) made its first Final Four with a stunning upset of  
defending national champion Tennessee in the East Regional finals. 
Then the Blue Devils moved on to defeat Georgia 81-69. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Duke's men were predictably charging through  
their tournament, landing in the title game Monday night against 
Connecticut. The only other school to send both a men's and women's 
team to the Final Four was Georgia in 1983, but neither of those 
teams advanced to the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday night, it appeared as if the Duke women might just  
pull off another upset because Purdue couldn't manage to score in 
the first half. The Boilermakers hit just 8-of-26 from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams were slow and sloppy, but Duke appeared energized in  
the waning moments of the first half and went into the locker room 
with a 22-17 lead. It was the lowest point total for a half in a 
women's title game. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke coach Gail Goestenkors attributed the sluggishness to  
nerves on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``Honestly, before the game, I thought we were ready to play. I  
thought we were relaxed and focused and we had one of our best 
warmups of the year,'' she said. ``I think it hit a lot of the kids 
when they sang the national anthem and they are looking up at the 
flag, and all of the sudden they realize, `Hey, this is a big 
deal.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue woke up in the second half. Senior guard Ukari Figgs, who  
didn't score at all in the first half, had 18 points for the 
Boilermakers as Duke's game stagnated. 
</P>
<P>
	``They play good pressure defense,'' Duke's Hilary Howard said.  
``We've seen that before, but unfortunately, we just didn't adjust 
to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goestenkors, who has coached the Blue Devils for seven years,  
has led her team to five straight tournament appearances. Duke's 
women have finished on top of the Atlantic Coast Conference for the 
past two consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach G -- a nickname that mirrors Duke men's head coach Mike  
Krzyzewski's easier-to-pronounce moniker, Coach K -- has an overall 
record of 147-68 with the Blue Devils. So she tried to paint a 
positive overall picture on the program despite going home without 
a title. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, we were last in the ACC, and I don't think we were a  
very-well-respected program, overall. We've come a long way,'' she 
said. ``I told the team after the game we have had a wonderful 
journey and they have set a new standard for Duke women's 
basketball. We have raised the bar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, after Goestenkors dutifully answered all the media's  
questions, she cast her eyes downward and bit her lip. For a 
moment, she looked close to tears. 
</P>
<P>
	Then she slowly rose and walked back to the locker room, back to  
her team.

<HEADLINE> Blooming Cherry Trees in Potomac </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even a bad year can have a note of grace.  
</P>
<P>
	For President William Howard Taft and his wife, Helen ``Nellie''  
Herron Taft, the year 1912 would prove politically difficult and 
personally bitter. 
</P>
<P>
	But like a paper boat sent bobbing on uncertain waters, Nellie  
Taft brought to completion that year a project that would outlive 
the troubles. She planted a grove of cherry trees near the Potomac 
that have blossomed for the last 87 springs. At the time, the 
planting seemed trivial. 
</P>
<P>
	The sinking of the Titanic on April 14, less than a month after  
the first cherry trees were planted, cast doubt on the era's belief 
in the march of technological progress and claimed some 1,500 
lives. Among those lost were Maj. Archibald Butt, a White House 
aide so close to the president he was considered an irreplaceable 
``younger brother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Butt had also worked loyally for Theodore Roosevelt and had  
suffered under the growing tension between the rough rider and his 
chosen successor in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1912, the blustery Roosevelt was back from a two-year African  
safari, ready to deny Taft a second term and reclaim the White 
House for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Taft had never enjoyed the presidency. Seeking it had been more  
Mrs. Taft's ambition than his. 
</P>
<P>
	The year was spent fighting off Roosevelt's challenge. Taft's  
control of the party machinery salvaged the challenger's 
nomination. But Roosevelt maintained the challenge with his Bull 
Moose splinter party. Thus, with the Republican Party fatally 
split, the fall elections were swept by Democrat Woodrow Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	The president would look back on 1912 and conclude he had been  
``a man of straw'' tossed on the winds, all 300 pounds of him. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the lonesomest place in the world,'' Taft remarked  
when the year was over. In a private letter he made clear his 
resentment of ``the hypocrisy, the insincerity, the selfishness, 
the monumental egotism ... that possess Theodore Roosevelt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Taft confided she had stopped reading newspaper accounts of  
the struggle because, ``I was in a state of constant rage which 
could do me no possible good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in March that year Mrs. Taft had put the final touches on a  
project that would live beyond her anger and her husband's 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	It was rooted in her efforts to establish West Potomac Park on  
reclaimed land next to the river, a place previously regarded as a 
``mosquito-infested swamp, rendezvous of tramps and hiding place of 
criminals.'' She modeled it after the fashionable Luneta, in 
Manila, which she had enjoyed when her husband served as governor 
of the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Sferrazza Anthony, a biographer of presidential wives, says  
it was ``the first truly public project of a first lady.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The final touch came in a suggestion from Eliza Scidmore, a  
world traveler and expert in Japanese culture, that the waterside 
park be planted with cherry trees from Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese quickly agreed. But in 1910 a shipment of 2,000  
saplings were found to be infested and were burned. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's mayor regrouped, rounded up 3,000 new and healthy trees,  
had them carefully watched for two years and sent them, disease 
free, to the Potomac. 
</P>
<P>
	So on March 27, 1912, Nellie Taft drove to the Tidal Basin,  
where she and the wife of the Japanese Ambassador planted Yoshino 
cherry trees one and two. 
</P>
<P>
	The blooming cherry trees reflecting in the water quickly became  
a symbol of the city, at times seeming to soften the sharp edges of 
politics, at times themselves becoming embroiled in controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt intervened personally  
to pledge the cherry trees would not be sacrificed to build the 
Jefferson Memorial on the Tidal Basin. During World War II some 
patriots objected to the origin of the still-popular trees, 
demanding that they be called Korean or Oriental or anything other 
than Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, with 3,700 cherry trees blooming on the 87th  
anniversary of Nellie Taft's grace note, only 125 rapidly aging or 
dying trees remain from the original 1912 batch. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department last week presented 500 saplings,  
grown from cuttings taken from the original trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Some gifts just keep giving, good years and bad.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco Looking To Buy Arco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A takeover of Atlantic Richfield by BP Amoco  
could spur more job cuts and mergers as the industry struggles to 
cope with historically low oil prices. However, it isn't expected 
to have much of an impact at the gas pump. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies confirmed Monday they are talking about combining,  
but have yet to conclude an agreement that sources close to the 
negotiations valued at $25 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A deal would be the eighth major merger in the oil and gas  
business in the past six months. During the same time, the industry 
has announced it was eliminating almost 43,000 jobs, including 
significant cuts at BP Amoco and Arco. 
</P>
<P>
	By combining in a deal that would create the world's  
second-largest oil producer, the companies could save $1 billion a 
year in overlapping costs, analysts said. But workers know that's 
usually just a diplomatic way of saying ``You're fired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Like all mergers, everybody waits until the other shoe  
drops,'' said Tom Evans, a spokesman for Teamsters Union Local 959 
in Anchorage, Alaska, a state where Arco and BP Amoco together 
control 75 percent of oil production. 
</P>
<P>
	If history is any guide, the companies could be expected to cut  
about 10 percent of their combined payroll, or about 10,000 to 
12,000 jobs. Most of the cuts probably would come on the Arco side, 
which could mean a loss of one-third of its work force of 19,000, 
said Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst with Fahnestock &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every single function in oil production is duplicated.  
Especially (in) Alaska,'' he said. ``You don't have to have dual 
management, dual accounting, dual transportation. All of the 
departments of the company are mirrored by the other company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the news of merger talks Monday, Arco's stock surged more  
than 13 percent, or by $8.68 3/4 to close at $74.06 1/4 a share on the 
New York Stock Exchange, where BP Amoco's U.S. shares rose 4.5 
percent, or by $4.56 1/4, to $105. 
</P>
<P>
	If BP Amoco is successful in its bid for Arco, it could spur  
further consolidation as companies like Unocal, Occidental 
Petroleum and Phillips Petroleum Co. look for partners to remain 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do believe this is an industry in need of further  
rationalization and consolidation,'' said Jay Wilson, an oil 
analyst with JP Morgan, which represented Exxon in its pending 
acquisition of Mobil, a deal that would create the world's largest 
company as well as the No. 1 energy business. 
</P>
<P>
	Occidental's stock rose almost 6 percent, or by $1, to $18.25.  
Phillips' shares jumped more than 5 percent, or by $2.43 3/4 to 
$48.06 1/4. Unocal's stock rose $1.18 3/4 to $37. All of the companies 
trade on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry's merger fest is being driven by a need to  
economize in the face of depressed oil prices, which last year 
plunged by a third. Prices have rebounded since December, surging 
recently on an agreement by the Organization of the Petroleum 
Exporting Countries to restrict production, but still are low by 
historical standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, petroleum executives are bracing for a continued decline  
in oil prices as manufacturers, including automakers, are under 
pressure to find cleaner alternative fuels. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent spurt in oil prices has raised prices at the gas pump  
back above $1 a gallon in the United States, but even with the rush 
to combine, no one company would have the clout to push up prices 
for motorists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even with combinations like this, no one has pricing power on  
the oil side,'' said Wilson, the analyst. ``It's still going to 
remain a very competitive business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance between BP Amoco and Arco would create a nationwide  
oil powerhouse by combining Arco's dominant West Coast business 
with BP Amoco's Midwest and East Coast operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In Alaska, BP Amoco and Arco jointly operate the 13-billion  
barrel Prudhoe Bay field. 
</P>
<P>
	While BP Amoco now produces more oil than Arco in Alaska, it's  
Arco that has the best prospects. The company expects to have its 
360-million barrel Alpine field operating in about two years, and 
it also is eyeing acreage in the vast National Petroleum 
Reserve-Alaska west of Prudhoe for additional opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers wondered Monday just how the deal may change their  
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's going to happen to the relationships we've developed  
through the years with BP and Arco? They've been good, open 
communications. But who's going to be in the top posts and what 
will happen to the top people?'' asked Mano Frey, head of Alaska 
State AFL-CIO.

<HEADLINE> `I Love Science' Teaches, Entertains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Educational software walks a thin line. It has to be  
entertaining enough to hold a kid's interest and educational enough 
to justify another bite into a household's already chewed-up 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	From toddler to first-grader, kids are pleased by just about  
anything that's brightly colored, loud and animated. After that, 
kids get fussier. Subject matter becomes more complicated, and the 
kids, now media-savvy, become a tough audience. 
</P>
<P>
	DK Interactive Learning has an offering for Windows and Mac PCs  
that could rise to the challenge. Called ``I Love Science,'' it's 
part of a series that includes ``I Love Math'' and ``I Love 
Spelling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I Love Science'' uses characters to guide players through a  
variety of experiments and lessons. Rosie's Treehouse handles 
biology, Al's Kitchen does chemistry, and Mo's Workshop is for 
physics. 
</P>
<P>
	Mo, for example, appears as a 10-year-old girl whose workshop is  
in a cartoonlike version of a sharecropper's shack. She speaks with 
a deep Southern accent, and if Southern colloquialisms were acorns, 
she could feed every squirrel in the country. (DK's parent company 
is in England, so perhaps the British view this as clever 
marketing.) 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mo Mentum (get it?) delivers solid information about heat,  
light, sound, motion and electricity in a way that is likely to 
stick to slippery little minds. The curriculum includes 100 science 
experiments, 1,000 problems and 100 reference screens. Points are 
awarded for correct performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The user interface has high playability and excellent sound. A  
bit more attention could have been paid to synchronizing the 
characters' lip movements to speech in close-ups. 
</P>
<P>
	DK gets points for keeping the minimum system requirements  
low-key, since not everyone buys a new computer every six months. 
</P>
<P>
	For Windows, you'll need at least a 33-megahertz 486DX with  
eight megabytes of RAM, 256-color monitor, sound card and 
double-speed CD-ROM drive. Mac users need at least a 25-megahertz 
68LC040 processor, System 7.0, eight megabytes of RAM, 256-color 
monitor and doublespeed CD-ROM drive. In both cases, more is 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	DK gets points also for setting the suggested price at $29.95,  
which could be even lower at some retailers. The lower the price, 
the better, of course. But since playing the software requires 
removing the CD from its package and replacing it when you're done, 
DK should have considered providing a more durable plastic jewel 
case instead of a cardboard sleeve.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes at Record of 10,006.78 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- This time, it's for keeps.  
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average climbed past 10,000 Monday and  
finally had enough momentum to stay above the milestone through the 
closing bell. The 103-year-old index closed at 10,006.78, up 184.54 
points, and the floor of the New York Stock Exchange began a 
long-awaited celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE chairman Richard Grasso, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani  
and John Prestbo, index editor for Dow Jones &AMP; Co., banged the 
gavel symbolizing the close of the trading day and then began 
tossing baseball caps with ``Dow 10,000'' embroidered on the front. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders on the floor obliged a crowd of TV cameramen,  
photographers and reporters with a minute or so of applause. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a moment to uncork the champagne and celebrate what a  
truly phenomenal bull market this has been,'' said Hugh Johnson, 
market strategist at First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	News that several big corporate mergers may be in the works  
helped send the Dow over 10,000 Monday. But, at a post-close press 
conference, Grasso gave credit for the milestone to investors who 
have poured money into stocks -- either directly or through mutual 
funds or pension plans -- for the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stock exchange had nothing to do with Dow 10,000. It had  
to do with the huge number of participants in the marketplace. I 
want to send thank-yous to the 70 million Americans who participate 
directly in equities and another 130 million who participate 
indirectly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow achieved its first five-digit close after four failed  
attempts earlier this month, when it crossed 10,000 only to fall 
back amid profit-taking and worries about upcoming quarterly profit 
reports. Two weeks ago, when the index appeared to close above the 
number, Grasso and others began tossing the congratulatory hats to 
the trading floor, only to be disappointed when the final number 
came in just shy. 
</P>
<P>
	For a while Monday, it looked like that pattern would be  
repeated. The blue chips hit 10,000 several times, but were knocked 
back down again by computer-guided trading programs that sell 
stocks when the market reaches a predetermined level. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was enough underlying strength this time across a  
broad spectrum of stocks that the Dow was able to climb back up 
10,000 and stay there. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's staying power was helped by an expansion of Wall  
Street's recent rally to a broader range of stocks -- it wasn't just 
the large, big-name companies like IBM and General Electric that 
gained, but smaller companies and lesser known names finally 
started to join the upward trend after some prolonged weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad-market indexes had big gains Monday, reflecting how  
democratic the rally was. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 27.37 to 1,310.17, and the Nasdaq  
composite, which represents many technology stocks and 
small-to-medium size companies, rose 73.67 at 2,492.84. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 10.81 to 613.16. And although the  
American Stock Exchange composite index eased 0.86 to 717.88, the 
Russell 2000 index, reflecting the performance of smaller 
companies, rose 5.84 to 399.76. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume was moderate at 
925.05 million shares, up from Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was buoyed by merger news, including a possible deal  
between the oil companies BP Amoco and Atlantic Richfield. Atlantic 
Richfield advanced 8 11/16 to 74 1/16. BP rose 4 5/8 to 105. 
</P>
<P>
	And unconfirmed talk that Glaxo Wellcome and Bristol  
Myers-Squibb were discussing a deal moved drug stocks higher. Glaxo 
Wellcome was up 2 7/16 at 64 1/4. Bristol Myers-Squibb rose 2 11/16 to 
62 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	In the technology sector, Computer Associates agreed to buy  
software maker Platinum Technology International for more than $3.5 
billion. Platinum Technology rose 14 3/16 to 24 1/16, while 
Computer Associates rose 3 1/16 to 37. 
</P>
<P>
	Another incentive to buy came from the sense that Wall Street  
had seen the worst of warnings from companies that expected to 
report disappointing first-quarter profits. 
</P>
<P>
	But these were just the immediate reasons behind Monday's  
advance. The Dow -- and the overall stock market -- has surged higher 
on eight years of U.S. economic growth, a boom in mutual fund 
investment, and, most recently, a boom in high technology and 
investor fascination with the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's first close above 10,000 came just under a year after  
it closed above 9,000, on April 6, 1998. At several points over the 
past year, a Dow 10,000 seemed like an impossibility -- particularly 
on Aug. 31 of last year, when the blue chips plunged 512.61 to 
7,539.07 amid concerns about struggling overseas economies and how 
they might hurt U.S. corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as recently as last Wednesday, when the Dow closed under  
9,667, a close above 10,000 seemed unlikely. But the market's 
resilience, due in large part to individual investors' confidence 
in stocks, has carried the Dow back. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.4 percent.  
Germany's DAX index soared 2.13 percent. Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 
1.66 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.92 percent.

<HEADLINE> UConn's Moore Gets Key Stop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Ricky Moore started with an unusual  
jolt of offense, then finished off Duke with the defensive stop of 
a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, the most famous defensive specialist in America, forced  
Duke's Trajan Langdon to travel with seconds ticking down in the 
NCAA championship game Monday night. Langdon lost the ball again, 
and Connecticut celebrated its first national title with a 77-74 
victory over Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	When it was over, Moore raised his arms to the crowd and walked  
off the court, a rare player who lifted his team to championship 
heights just because he could guard anybody. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't worried about my scoring in the second half,'' Moore  
said. ``I took it upon myself to play more defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That he did.  
</P>
<P>
	Moore sent Duke reeling for the first time in the Blue Devils'  
dominant season with seven points during a 15-4 run in the first 
half. But his biggest play, one that kids in his native Augusta, 
Ga., will be talking about on the playgrounds for years, came as 
Langdon was poised to shoot down UConn's quest for an upset. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had Ricky Moore,'' teammate Kevin Freeman said. ``No one  
could stop him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On offense, or defense.  
</P>
<P>
	After UConn point guard Khalid El-Amin lofted an airball on a  
tough running jumper, Langdon got the ball and Duke didn't call a 
timeout. Dribbling between his legs before spinning and driving on 
Moore, Langdon got his feet tangled and traveled with 5.4 seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin hit two free throws, and UConn did what few thought was  
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone underestimated Moore's impact.  
</P>
<P>
	Moore, who had all of his 13 points in the first half with a  
rare offensive outburst, made quite a name for himself in this 
tournament with a talent that usually goes unheralded. He held Ohio 
State's Scoonie Penn to 11 points and 3-for-13 shooting in the 
national semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
	This came after stellar defensive performances earlier this  
season against Michigan State's Mateen Cleaves (2-for-15) and 
Stanford's Arthur Lee (4-for-13). 
</P>
<P>
	Guarding his boyhood friend William Avery for some of the game,  
he started paying more attention to Langdon in the second half. And 
when Langdon got the ball in the closing seconds, the Ricky Radar 
was locked in. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore got in position as Langdon leaned forward and glided  
confidently -- a little like Grant Hill downcourt. After a fearless 
display of between-the-legs dribbling, Langdon tried to spin on 
Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	Big mistake. The whistle blew, and Duke had blown it.  
</P>
<P>
	After El-Amin's free throws, Langdon tried to redeem himself  
with a drive down the sideline through heavy traffic, but lost the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Moore's defensive clinic -- and UConn's long wait for a  
national title -- was over.

<HEADLINE>  Braves' Ligtenberg Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- Kerry Ligtenberg, who took over the  
Atlanta Braves closer's job last season when Mark Wohlers had 
control problems, said Monday he will have season-ending surgery to 
repair a torn elbow ligament. 
</P>
<P>
	Ligtenberg, 27, took over the closer's job last season when Mark  
Wohlers developed control problems. The rookie right-hander 
converted 30 of 34 save chances, going 3-2 with a 2.71 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 12, Ligtenberg was diagnosed with a partial tear of the  
medial collateral ligament. He has not thrown since and decided on 
surgery after an examination Monday by the Braves' orthopedic 
surgeon, Dr. Joe Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave me three choices -- wait three more weeks and try to  
throw, throw right now, and the third choice was to go get the 
surgery,'' Ligtenberg said. ``I figured I'd do it now. That would 
put me out 12 months and I'll be ready to go next season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ligtenberg, obtained by Atlanta from the independent Prairie  
League for six dozen baseballs and two dozen bats, is to meet next 
Monday with the surgeon, Dr. James Andrews of Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	While Ligtenberg is out, Wohlers appears to be coming back.  
</P>
<P>
	He was sent to the minors last season when he couldn't find the  
plate and his season ended early, but he has been getting better 
with each spring outing. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last three appearances, Wohlers has thrown four scoreless  
innings and lowered his ERA to 5.63. Since giving up four runs in 
his first appearance against Houston, Wohlers has allowed one run. 
Overall, in eight innings this spring, he has given up eight hits, 
walked six and struck out nine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, if we had to start the season today, I don't know  
why we wouldn't open up with him as the closer,'' manager Bobby Cox 
said. ``It's been an amazing turnaround. Who knows what the odds 
were? He certainly has beaten them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The way I feel right now, I would expect to get the ball,''  
Wohlers said Monday after his 1-2-3 outing Monday in Atlanta's 3-2 
exhibition victory over Florida. ``But John Rocker, Rudy Seanez and 
Mike Cather are also pitching well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker, a left-hander, also is expected to get some  
opportunities to finish games. Rocker hasn't allowed a run in nine 
innings this spring, striking out 11 and allowing six hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers began struggling in late May last season after hurting  
his side and going on the 15-day disabled list. He wound up with a 
10.18 ERA in 20 1-3 innings with the Braves, walking 33. At 
Triple-A Richmond, Wohlers gave up 36 walks in 12 1-3 innings with 
a 20.43 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this spring, Wohlers appears to have regained the form he  
had from 1995-97, when he had 97 saves, including a team-record 39 
in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Governor's Move Said Unprecedented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Utah's normally unflappable Gov. Mike  
Leavitt was angry. Attorney General Jan Graham had just told him he 
wasn't welcome at a news conference to share credit for the 
lucrative tobacco settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never supported the lawsuit,'' she told him.  
</P>
<P>
	As Graham recalls, a red-faced, finger-waving Leavitt replied,  
``I'll get the Legislature to take away your authority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was true to his word. In a brazen move, Utah's Republicans  
are stripping Graham, the only Democrat elected statewide, of much 
of her constitutional power. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt sealed his hostile takeover last Tuesday by signing a  
measure to relieve the attorney general of her mandate to ``take 
charge'' of civil lawsuits and settlements, giving the authority 
instead to the governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Scholars call the move unprecedented, and the nation's other  
attorneys general are vowing to back Graham in court. She has the 
``guaranteed'' legal support of the National Association of 
Attorneys General, said the group's president, Mike Moore of 
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	The Utah power struggle echoes an angry standoff in Alabama over  
new Senate operating rules that stripped the lieutenant governor of 
traditional powers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Gov. Steve Windom, the first Republican elected to the  
Alabama office this century, infuriated majority Senate Democrats 
on opening day, March 2, by swiftly gaveling through rules that 
restored most of the powers, ignoring Democrats' waving fists and 
howls for a roll call. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah's Leavitt says the confrontation over tobacco was just his  
latest tiff with the stubbornly independent Graham. The feuding 
between the popular baby-boomer politicians goes back years. 
</P>
<P>
	He's a conservative and a devout Mormon. She's a liberal and,  
while raised a member of the state's predominant church, no longer 
practices. Graham first ran for attorney general in 1992, the same 
year Leavitt became governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Early on, Leavitt complained Graham was unwilling to vigorously  
defend Utah's restrictive abortion laws, so the governor hired a 
private lawyer to do the job. Most of the restrictions were later 
thrown out of court. 
</P>
<P>
	More recently, Graham refused Leavitt's request that she endorse  
Vermont's defense of a law against same-sex marriages at the U.S. 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Their versions of the clash over the tobacco settlement, like  
much of their relationship, conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt heatedly insists he did support Graham's tobacco suit,  
although news accounts show him hedging in 1996 when he was 
supporting her Republican challenger in the election. 
</P>
<P>
	He also maintains he didn't ask for a place at the November news  
conference where Graham announced her decision to include Utah in 
the settlement. Furthermore, he learned less than two hours before 
she went before the TV cameras that he'd been shut out of 
settlement negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue was whether the attorney general, without consulting  
the governor, should settle the case,'' Leavitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt traces the conflict back decades, with Utah governors  
commonly complaining of being pushed around by their attorneys 
general. The Utah Constitution makes the attorney general a ``legal 
adviser'' to the governor and nothing more, he argues. 
</P>
<P>
	The largely Republican Legislature based its action on the  
constitution's limited language, ignoring the tradition in Utah and 
44 other states of independently elected attorneys general, 
scholars say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not aware of any state where there has been such an abrupt  
division of authority,'' said former Oregon attorney general David 
Frohnmeyer, author of a book on the powers of the office. ``It's 
very unusual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Utah Republicans' view of attorney general as loyal  
servant harkens back to English tradition -- ``and that won't do 
them any good,'' said Thomas G. Barnes, professor of English 
history and law at the University of California at Berkeley and a 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a different concept here,'' he said, adding that Graham  
answers to voters, not a governor. ``She represents the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stung by charges of partisanship, Republican legislative leaders  
offered Graham one concession, delaying the effective date of the 
new law until her planned January 2001 departure from office. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's little consolation to Graham.  
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a sad legacy for the first woman who holds this  
position to have the attorney general's office weakened on her 
watch,'' said Graham, who plans to file suit against the governor 
and the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham says voters need to know before the 2000 election whether  
they are electing ``an attorney general or a rubber stamp.''

<HEADLINE> Atlanta To Lead Job Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Wanted in Atlanta: plenty of able-bodied workers.  
</P>
<P>
	A new guide for job seekers projects that this Southern city  
will lead the nation in job growth, gaining 1.8 million new 
positions over the next 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix and Houston tied for second with 1.5 million jobs.  
Dallas, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C. followed in the rankings 
of the 20 best cities for job hunters through 2025. 
</P>
<P>
	The list is in Newsweek's guidebook, ``Careers 2000,'' which was  
to hit newsstands Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hot careers identified by the magazine include geriatric law,  
physical therapy, primary health care, network specialists and 
computer programming. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta boasted a tight labor market coupled with increasing  
home sales and construction through most of the 1990s. The booming 
economy and job growth started slowing a bit after the 1996 
Olympics. Even still, Atlanta has kept a low unemployment rate -- 
under 5 percent for the past three years. Last year, it averaged 
3.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But if Atlanta wants to remain a leader in the new millennium,  
it will have to make some adjustments, says University of Georgia 
economist Jeffrey Humphreys. The city is hitting its limits in 
terms of transportation, water delivery and sewer treatment 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we fail to meet demand, if we underinvested in basic  
infrastructure then Atlanta will no longer lead the pack,'' 
Humphreys said. ``We'll begin to lose our place at the head of the 
pack and that will have dramatic repercussions on people who live 
in Atlanta.''

<HEADLINE> Purdue Students Cheer NCAA Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- Looking weary after a long flight  
home, Purdue's NCAA women's basketball champions appeared to be 
re-energized after being greeted at the airport by about 75 
screaming fans today. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the Boilermakers headed into the crowd, where they  
hugged family members, friends and fans, signed autographs and 
proudly showed off their championship rings. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue defeated Duke 62-45 at San Jose, Calif., to win the title  
Sunday night. The plane arrived about 2 1/2 hours late at the 
university's airport after being fogged in and briefly rerouted to 
Indianapolis International Airport for refueling. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Carolyn Peck described the turnout, especially under the  
circumstances, as ``awesome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to be home,'' she said. ``It was so good for  
everyone to share in this win because they're all a big part of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few players boarded a bus, but most left with relatives or  
friends as they went their separate ways. Many talked about getting 
some sleep after flying most of the night. 
</P>
<P>
	The team planned to reunite for a pep rally at Mackey Arena  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, to celebrate the victory, thousands of cheering Purdue  
students crowded the streets near campus shortly after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin Shadle, a cheerleader who couldn't make the trip to San  
Jose because of a test, didn't mind being left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I was there I wouldn't get to experience this,'' he shouted  
over the sound of car horns and screaming fans. 
</P>
<P>
	University police, Indiana State Police troopers and law  
officers from West Lafayette and Tippecanoe County stood by as 
about 2,000 people took to the streets. Officers moved in with tear 
gas about 3 a.m. to disperse a crowd that had built a bonfire in 
the middle of a major campus street, Purdue spokesman Joe Bennett 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three minor injuries but no arrests were reported, although  
several traffic lights were vandalized and a police vehicle was 
damaged, Bennett said. A Tippecanoe County sheriff's cruiser and a 
small sports utility vehicle also were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	When the game ended, fans poured out of bars and into the West  
Lafayette streets. Every car in sight blew its horn as hundreds of 
students screamed and hollered. 
</P>
<P>
	Some waved Purdue flags, others wrapped themselves in the flags  
and ran through the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it was the Boilermakers' 10th tournament appearance, it  
was the first time the team had made it to the national title game. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's team never has won a championship in 18 tournament  
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last time we were a national contender for anything was  
the mid-90s and we never did it,'' student Darryl Grant said. ``The 
women made it for the first time and they did it.''

<HEADLINE> Court To Rule on Using Student Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide  
whether public universities can use mandatory student activity fees 
to subsidize campus groups that pursue political goals. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices said they will review rulings that barred the  
University of Wisconsin from dipping into activity fees it collects 
from every student to finance such groups. Advocates for gay-rights 
organizations say limiting subsidies will hurt ``disfavored 
groups'' nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision is expected next year.  
</P>
<P>
	A federal trial judge and an appeals court ruled that the  
subsidies unlawfully force some students to subsidize views they 
find objectionable and thereby violate free-speech rights. The 
lower courts barred the university from using fees collected from 
objecting students. 
</P>
<P>
	Several law students with conservative political views  
challenged the funneling of student-activity money to 18 
organizations on the Madison campus. 
</P>
<P>
	``The forced funding of such organizations significantly adds to  
the burdening of the students' free-speech rights,'' a three-judge 
panel of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year. It 
said the university ``cannot use the allocable portion of objecting 
students' mandatory activity fees to fund (those) organizations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court panel's ruling did not shield objecting  
students from paying any activity fees but gave them an opt-out 
privilege. They can identify the political or ideological groups 
they do not want to support and have their fees reduced on a 
prorated basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Among groups objected to in the 1996 lawsuit against the  
university were Students of National Organization for Women, 
International Socialist Organization, Campus Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual 
Center and an AIDS support network. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look to the Supreme Court to stop this narrow-minded  
assault on a neutral system for supporting campus dialogue,'' said 
Patricia Logue of the Lambda Legal Defense and Educational Fund, a 
gay-rights group. 
</P>
<P>
	In a friend-of-the-court brief supporting the university's  
appeal, Lambda's lawyers had argued that the appeals court's ruling 
``confuses payments to construct a stage with being forced to speak 
upon it or fund an organization that uses it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's highest court ruled in 1995 that public  
universities and colleges cannot create a ``public forum'' for 
students and then refuse to subsidize some student groups because 
of their viewpoint. That decision said the University of Virginia 
wrongly refused to subsidize a student-run Christian magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7th Circuit panel said: ``If the university cannot  
discriminate in the disbursement of funds, it is imperative that 
students not be compelled to fund organizations which engage in 
political and ideological activities -- that is the only way to 
protect the individual's rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The justices had left that issue undecided in their 1995 ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	The full 7th Circuit court voted 8-3 against reconsidering the  
panel's decision limiting the university's use of the 
student-activity fees. The three dissenters noted that the 
Wisconsin case involved a ``viewpoint-neutral forum'' in which all 
points of view were eligible for subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	That was not so, they said, in the Virginia case or in earlier  
cases in which the Supreme Court barred unions from using some 
collected dues to finance goals unrelated to collective bargaining.

<HEADLINE> Taiwanese Execs To Stand Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- For years, adhesive makers Avery Dennison Corp.  
and Four Pillars Enterprise Co. Ltd. of Taiwan appeared to be 
friendly rivals, exchanging letters and even discussing a possible 
joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors say that behind the scenes, Four Pillars  
executives were paying an Avery Dennison scientist in Ohio to steal 
trade secrets. Four Pillars President Pin Yen Yang, 72, and his 
daughter, Hwei Chen ``Sally'' Yang, 40, will go on trial Tuesday in 
the first economic espionage case to reach the courts since 
President Clinton approved a law specifically outlawing the theft 
of trade secrets in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yangs are each accused of economic espionage, conspiracy,  
mail fraud, wire fraud, money laundering and receipt of stolen 
goods. They have pleaded innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. corporations are keeping an eye on this trial to see if the  
new law is an effective weapon against economic espionage, said 
Joseph Ricci, a spokesman for American Society for Industrial 
Security in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	An ASIS survey reported U.S.-based businesses lost $250 billion  
to $300 billion worth of intellectual property to foreign and 
domestic spies in 1997. The FBI initially estimated Avery Dennison 
lost as much as $200 million in revenue from the alleged spying. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Fink, a spokesman for Pasadena, Calif.-based Avery  
Dennison, said the company still has not determined how much 
revenue it lost. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI says the Yangs paid about $150,000 to Ten Hong Lee, also  
known as Victor Lee, a research engineer at an Avery Dennison lab 
about 20 miles east of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, Lee slipped them trade secrets related to products  
such as self-stick postage stamps, name labels, diaper tape and 
battery labels from 1989 to 1997, the FBI said when the Yangs were 
indicted in Cleveland in September 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee pleaded guilty to wire fraud and is expected to testify  
against the Yangs. 
</P>
<P>
	Four Pillars says its executives have done nothing criminal.  
</P>
<P>
	``The case is a business dispute in which the government has  
decided to take sides,'' said Patricia Smith, a Four Pillars 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	The company released a statement in which it says ``the Economic  
Espionage Act was to keep high-tech, defense-oriented secrets from 
falling into hands of foreign governments -- not to aid a company 
competing for an advantage in the glue market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The product doesn't matter, Fink said. ``Theft is theft and  
economic espionage is economic espionage,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies have each filed lawsuits against each other. Avery  
Dennison has sued Four Pillars in U.S. District Court in Ohio for 
unspecified damages in a suit that essentially repeats the 
allegations made in the criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Four Pillars has sued Avery Dennison in China and  
Taiwan for $262 million worth of trade secrets it says Avery 
Dennison stole while the companies discussed a possible joint 
venture in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Fink called that suit an 
attempt by Four Pillars to divert attention from the Yangs' trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection is scheduled to begin Tuesday in U.S. District  
Court in Youngstown, Ohio.

<HEADLINE>  Duvals Share Winning Moments  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The Duval Double is complete.  
</P>
<P>
	And what an emotional payoff.  
</P>
<P>
	On the day David Duval got the biggest victory of his career,  
his father, Bob, was on the other side of the Florida panhandle 
picking up the very first of his. 
</P>
<P>
	David's victory at The Players Championship propelled him to No.  
1 in the world rankings. Bob's win at the senior Emerald Coast 
Classic near Pensacola made the Duvals the first father-son 
combination to win on the same weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I would win the award as the most proud,'' David Duval  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Duval had his doubts about that. A few hours after his  
victory, he stood in the clubhouse at The Moors Golf Club and cried 
as his son received the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's No. 1 now, don't you?'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The venues for these victories couldn't have been more  
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	David is a native of nearby Jacksonville and grew up around the  
TPC at Sawgrass. 
</P>
<P>
	How many times did he come to this tournament, hang around the  
driving range, follow the players down No. 18 and imagine it was 
him holding that trophy high in victory? 
</P>
<P>
	``The hardest place to win is at home,'' Bob Duval said. ``Every  
time he tees it up there, he wants to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A graduate of Florida State University in Tallahassee, Bob Duval  
has always held the Emerald Coast Classic close to his heart. 
</P>
<P>
	He got an exemption to the tournament in 1997, his first season  
on the senior tour. A third-place finish there allowed him to keep 
his card and turn the tour into a career, letting go the teaching 
jobs he had for years up and down the coast of North Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not looking back,'' Duval said of his late entry into the  
touring ranks. ``I had great club jobs and everything else. I can't 
look back at that. I'm playing probably better than I did then. And 
I couldn't win on the regular tour right now because those guys are 
too good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He found out just how good last week, when he worked in a few  
rounds with his son during David's four-week break before the 
Players. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were out here all last week,'' David Duval said. ``I gave  
him a good beating, but he was still pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two stayed in contact throughout the weekend, offering  
advice, words of encouragement and chit chat about other topics, 
just to take their minds off the history at hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, ``Tomorrow while you are playing, you are going to  
think about winning, OK?'' David Duval said. ``So don't try to not 
think about what it would feel like and everything that would come 
with it. You are going to think about that tomorrow, so don't waste 
energy trying to block it out. When you think about it, embrace 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The father took the son's advice. And those trophies might look  
good sitting side by side.

<HEADLINE> Kentucky's Quarterback Derby Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- For those accustomed to the practice field  
perfection of Tim Couch, Kentucky's initial spring football 
practice Monday offered some strange sights. 
</P>
<P>
	Overthrown receivers. Busted plays. The occasional wobbly pass.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, as the competition to replace Couch at quarterback got  
under way, coach Hal Mumme said he was pleased with the 
performances by Chase Harp and Dusty Bonner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw some good things,'' Mumme said. ``Some of the things  
that don't necessarily look so sharp are because we've got some 
other new guys out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Working behind an offensive line that returns none of last  
year's initial starters and with a fairly young corps of receivers, 
Harp and Bonner alternated running the Kentucky passing offense in 
6-on-6 drills Monday. A third quarterback candidate, Mike Scipione, 
worked on the side with the second string. 
</P>
<P>
	Scipione gets a chance to throw on Wednesday, when he and Bonner  
will share the passing snaps, and again on Friday, when he and Harp 
will run the passing offense while Bonner takes it easy. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar rotation will be employed each of the four weeks of  
spring practice, or until Mumme anoints a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just going to have to evaluate this over the next couple  
of weeks. Hopefully before the spring, one of them will rise,'' 
Mumme said. ``If not, we'll go into the fall looking more for the 
freshman to rise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The freshman'' is Jared Lorenzen, the Kentucky signee who  
quarterbacked Highlands High School to an undefeated season and 
last year's state Class 3A football title and was chosen Mr. 
Kentucky Football for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Lorenzen, on a break from school, attended Monday's practice  
with Highlands teammate and fellow Kentucky signee Derek Smith. The 
two watched the drills and picked up a few pointers from the 
coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Bonner nor Harp ran the Kentucky offense with the  
well-oiled precision of the NFL-bound Couch, who left after leading 
Kentucky to a 7-5 record and an Outback Bowl berth in his junior 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Mumme took note of the fact both quarterbacks completed  
more than 60 percent of their throws. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until we decide who the starter is, some of this is not going  
to look as polished as it did with Tim,'' he said. ``When you put 
all the reps on one guy, he's going to polish up pretty quick. If 
you've got to split reps, you're not ever going to be real 
polished. What you've got to do is you've got to see is who's going 
to make plays and perform. I thought both the guys we featured 
today made some plays.''

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Police used tear gas and rubber  
truncheons to quell a 26-hour prison riot in an Amazon state Monday 
that left six people dead, local media reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The uprising, sparked by a botched breakout by some 40 inmates,  
took place at the Americano maximum security penitentiary near the 
city of Belem, capital of Para state, 1,800 miles north of Sao 
Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebellion began Sunday when inmates, armed with at least two  
revolvers, seized six guards and 20 visiting relatives as hostages, 
Belem's TV Liberal reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Guards opened fire on the escaping inmates and forced them to  
retreat to the prison yard, the TV station said. 
</P>
<P>
	TV Liberal said riot troopers stormed the prison after the four  
inmates leading the rebellion killed one guard and five prisoners 
who refused to join the uprising. 
</P>
<P>
	Police would only confirm that the rebellion ended.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's government warned  
businesses Monday to raise the minimum monthly wage or face a 
mandatory increase ordered by President Hugo Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez last month raised public sector wages by 20 percent, from  
$172 to $206 a month, and said the private sector should implement 
its own increase. Many workers earn the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor Minister Leopoldo Puchi said Monday that Chavez may order  
the increase if private businesses take no action in the next 
month. Businessmen warned that would provoke mass layoffs since 
many companies can't afford the raise. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuela is suffering economic troubles caused by low prices  
for oil, the country's main export. Nearly 360 medium and large 
businesses have gone bankrupt in the last year, according to 
Conidustria, the country's main industrial chamber of commerce.

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A 25-year-old Colombian man has been  
indicted in the shooting death of a U.S. anti-narcotics agent 
outside a Bogota night club. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorge Figueroa stands accused in the Nov. 22 killing of U.S.  
Drug Enforcement Administration agent Frank Arnold Moreno, formerly 
of Edinburg Texas, chief prosecutor Alfonso Gomez told a news 
conference Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said Figueroa shot Moreno in the back after pursuing  
the U.S. agent into the street following an argument between the 
two inside the El Divino discotheque, in Bogota's Zona Rosa 
entertainment district. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno, who was 37 and recently married, had been in Colombia  
about a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have not said what Figueroa and Moreno argued about  
before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	The DEA has said the slaying was unrelated to Moreno's work,  
however Colombian police reported that members of Figueroa's family 
were being investigated for alleged money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	A 20-year-old Colombian man also died in the shooting, struck in  
the neck by an apparent stray bullet.

<HEADLINE> Kodak Predicts Strong Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Eastman Kodak Co. expects a strong  
performance in the second half of this year but said earnings for 
the first quarter would fall short of analysts' average 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak has been struggling because of a price war with Japan's  
Fuji Photo Film Co. and has been eliminating thousands of jobs to 
cut costs. Analysts said Monday's comments from Kodak may mean an 
acceleration of cost-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock initially shot up nearly 3 percent after the  
release of the forecast, but it later gave up most of its gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak said it expects earnings per share for the first quarter  
to be in the range of 73 cents to 80 cents when it reports results 
on April 16. Analysts surveyed by First Call had been looking for 
an average of 82 cents a share, although some had lowered their 
estimates in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kodak also said it still expects earnings for the full year  
of $4.81 to $5.24 a share, echoing a January forecast which could 
put the results above analysts' forecasts averaging $4.98. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak is looking for an earnings increase of 10 percent to 20  
percent for the year.

	Kodak stock closed up 37 1/2 cents to $65.62 1/2 a share in trading  
Monday on the New York Stock Exchange after initially jumping as 
much as $1.87 1/2 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not changing our view on full-year earnings. We are  
reaffirming our expectations,'' said Charles Smith, a spokesman for 
Rochester-based Kodak. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said first-half growth will be slowed by lingering effects  
of the pricing war Fuji, changes in foreign exchange rates and 
costs associated with integrating several businesses acquired from 
rival Imation Corp. in August. The benefits of the $520 million 
Imation deal will begin appearing in the second half, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak has been slashing jobs to bring down expenses and is well  
on its way to meeting plans to cut 20 percent of its 100,500-person 
work force through the end of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak's prediction that it would earn $1.50 to $1.59 a share in  
the second quarter was above the average $1.45 of analysts surveyed 
by First Call. Its forecast of $2.58 to $2.85 a share for the 
second half of this year compared with analysts' average 
expectations of $2.72. 
</P>
<P>
	``The numbers for the second quarter are higher than most anyone  
predicted, and that implies to me they're really going to 
reaccelerate the cost-cutting program,'' said Ben Reitzes, an 
analyst at PaineWebber. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Schnieder of Bear Stearns said firmer film prices, economic  
recovery in some emerging markets and continued cost-cutting moves 
have put the company on track toward a strong year. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the full year, the earnings will be pretty much on  
target,'' he said, ``but the configurations won't be what the 
analysts thought they would be.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks advanced moderately in early  
trading Tuesday after the Dow Jones industrial average closed above 
10,000 points for the first time. The dollar rose against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average gained 30.95 points, or 0.19 percent,  
to finish the morning session at 16,039.79. On Monday, the index 
slipped 8.15 points, or 0.05 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.64 yen in late morning trading, up 0.60  
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also above its level of 120.13 
yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the Nikkei index was up about 175 points  
early in the morning after the Dow gained 184.54 points to close at 
a record high of 10,006.78 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The main index later shed some of its early gains on  
profit-taking as domestic investors were holding back ahead of the 
end of the fiscal year Wednesday, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market remains heavy above the 16,000 level,'' said  
Masatoshi Sato, manager of the investment information group at 
Kankaku Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 8.18 points, or 0.64 percent, to 1,276.85. The 
TOPIX rose 0.89 points, or 0.07 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's release earlier Tuesday of Japan's February  
unemployment rate, which hit a record high of 4.6 percent, was 
having little effect on stock and currency trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 129.30 yen, up from  
128.78 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>

	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.775  
percent from Monday's finish of 1.820 percent, driving its price up

<HEADLINE> Court To Review Hazardous Waste Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to study the  
case of a Pennsylvania man whose conviction in a hazardous waste 
case was upheld even though his co-defendant's conviction was 
thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said it will hear William Fiore's argument that it is  
unlawful to keep him in prison after the state's highest court 
ruled that his co-defendant was prosecuted under the wrong law. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiore owned a hazardous waste disposal facility in Allegheny  
County in western Pennsylvania, and David Scarpone was its general 
manager. They were prosecuted in 1984 after state officials found 
that a monitoring pipe was altered so that hazardous material could 
be dumped without being noticed by inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiore and Scarpone were convicted of operating a hazardous waste  
facility without a permit. The plant had a permit, but prosecutors 
argued that the altered monitoring system was such a significant 
violation that it in effect canceled the permit. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiore and Scarpone appealed their convictions. Fiore's  
conviction was upheld by an appellate court, and the Pennsylvania 
Supreme Court denied review. 
</P>
<P>
	But a separate state appeals court threw out Scarpone's  
conviction, saying he could not be convicted of operating the plant 
without a permit. It would have been more appropriate to charge him 
with violating the permit's terms, the appeals court said. The 
state Supreme Court upheld that ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania courts refused to apply the ruling in Scarpone's  
case to Fiore's case. Fiore sought help in federal court, and a 
trial judge ruled for him. But the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals reversed that ruling, stating that federal courts could not 
force state courts to apply rulings in criminal cases 
retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, Fiore's lawyers said the 3rd  
Circuit court's ruling unconstitutionally ``denies liberty to an 
innocent man'' and violated his right to due process. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's lawyers said the ruling in Scarpone's case did not  
have to be applied retroactively to Fiore. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Fiore vs. White, 98-942.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court To Study Student Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to decide  
whether state-run universities can dedicate a portion of the 
activity fees collected from all students -- even those who object -- 
to subsidize groups that pursue political and ideological goals. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices said they will review rulings that barred the  
University of Wisconsin from using a portion of the activity fees 
it collects from every student to finance such groups. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal trial judge and an appeals court ruled that the  
subsidies unlawfully force some students to subsidize views they 
find objectionable. The lower courts barred the university from 
using fees collected from objecting students, ruling that to do so 
would violate their free-speech rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Several law students had challenged the funneling of  
student-activity money to 18 organizations on the Madison campus. 
</P>
<P>
	``The forced funding of such organizations significantly adds to  
the burdening of the students' free-speech rights,'' a three-judge 
panel of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year. It 
said the university ``cannot use the allocable portion of objecting 
students' mandatory activity fees to fund (those) organizations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court panel's ruling did not shield objecting  
students from paying any activity fees, but gave them an opt-out 
privilege. They can identify the political or ideological groups 
they do not want to support and have their fees reduced on a 
prorated basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the groups objected to in the 1996 lawsuit against the  
university were Students of National Organization for Women, 
International Socialist Organization, Campus Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual 
Center and an AIDS support network. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's highest court ruled in 1995 that public  
universities and colleges cannot create a ``public forum'' for 
students and then refuse to subsidize some student groups because 
of their viewpoint. That decision said the University of Virginia 
wrongly had refused to subsidize a student-run Christian magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Building on that ruling, the 7th Circuit panel said: ``If the  
university cannot discriminate in the disbursement of funds, it is 
imperative that students not be compelled to fund organizations 
which engage in political and ideological activities -- that is the 
only way to protect the individual's rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The justices had left that issue undecided in their 1995 ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	The full 7th Circuit court voted 8-3 against reconsidering the  
panel's decision limiting the university's use of the 
student-activity fees. The three dissenters noted that the 
Wisconsin case involved a ``viewpoint-neutral forum'' in which all 
points of view were eligible for subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	That was not so, they said, in the Virginia case or in earlier  
cases in which the Supreme Court barred unions from using some 
collected dues to finance goals unrelated to collective bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Board of Regents, University of Wisconsin vs.  
Southworth, 98-1189.

<HEADLINE> Heinz Announces Recall of Baby Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Heinz USA is recalling certain six-ounce jars  
of Heinz 3 broccoli, carrots and cheese baby food because it may 
contain pieces of plastic. 
</P>
<P>
	Deb Magness, spokeswoman for Heinz USA in Pittsburgh, said not  
all six-ounce jars of that variety of baby food contains plastic -- 
only those with the production code of P3388EA, which is printed on 
the jar lids. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Monday that varying sizes pieces of plastic that may be  
used in baby food containers likely got in the supply of raw 
ingredients during a single shift during which the food was made. A 
production number is assigned to products made during a certain 
shift, so they can be differentiated from the same thing made 
during a different shift. 
</P>
<P>
	Magness said officials don't know how many jars of food were  
affected, but the number was ``not significant.'' The bad jars were 
distributed nationwide with others that are normal. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Heinz officials informed grocers and other customers on  
Monday and advised them to remove the unsafe jars from shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers who have bought six-ounce jars of broccoli, carrots  
and cheese baby food should check the production number on the lid, 
she said. If it matches that of jars being recalled, they should 
return it to the place of purchase for a full refund. 
</P>
<P>
	Heinz USA is working with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  
to alert consumers to the recall. Consumers with questions can call 
Heinz USA at 1-800-782-8408 for further information.

<HEADLINE> Mariners Give Bill Swift Kick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- Right-hander Bill Swift was released by the  
Seattle Mariners today. 
</P>
<P>
	Swift, 37, had a 7.20 ERA in 10 innings this spring, allowing  
nine earned runs and 13 hits with six strikeouts and six walks. He 
did not have a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not feel Bill fit into our plans for the 1999 season,''  
Mariners general manager Woody Woodward said. ``We have made a 
commitment to our younger pitchers. Hopefully, today's move gives 
Bill time to catch on with another major league team prior to the 
start of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swift signed a minor league contract with the Mariners in  
January and had been invited to camp as a non-roster player. If he 
had made the team, he would have gotten an $850,000, one-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Swift originally was selected by the Mariners in the first round  
of the 1984 amateur draft. He has a career record of 94-78 with a 
3.94 ERA in 13 years with Seattle, San Francisco and Colorado.

<HEADLINE> Fire Destroys Church on Palm Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASPINWALL, Pa. (AP) -- George Heid was outside enjoying the end  
of a warm spring day when he noticed flames licking at the red 
brick Aspinwall Presbyterian Church next door. 
</P>
<P>
	Heid, 51, called 911 but it was already too late. The blaze  
Sunday left the church a charred shell in the midst of a quiet 
residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was baptized here; I was married here. This is very hard.  
It's like losing part of your life,'' said Anne Wyant, 46, a 
lifelong church member. ``You went here every week, everybody was 
like part of your family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One firefighter was slightly injured battling the blaze.  
</P>
<P>
	The fire quickly spread thick smoke over Aspinwall, a bedroom  
community of about 3,200 people along the Allegheny River just 
north of Pittsburgh. The blaze was contained in about four hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Heid described the church, which was built in 1905, as having an  
aging congregation and said about 40 or 50 people usually attended 
Sunday services. 
</P>
<P>
	The theme of the last sermon at the church was humility, he said  
</P>
<P>
	Aspinwall Fire Chief Lee Albacker said Sunday night that the  
church was a total loss. The blaze destroyed the roof and blackened 
the inside and front of the building. 
</P>
<P>
	Albacker said that it was too early to speculate on a cause.  
</P>
<P>
	Dan Boeh, an investigator with the federal Bureau of Alcohol,  
Tobacco and Firearms, said his agency likely would not be able to 
go through the church until sometime today. 
</P>
<P>
	The state fire marshal's office also will investigate, Albacker  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Easter's coming next week. It's kind of hard for it to happen  
now,'' said Jim Mead, the executive presbyter who oversees 166 
churches in Allegheny County.

<HEADLINE> Alabama Professor Killed by Rock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- A University of Alabama professor driving  
on Interstate 75 was killed by a 20- to 30-pound rock tossed from 
an overpass. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Catherine Laible, 32, was heading south under the Erie  
Road overpass, a few miles west of Tampa, when the rock crashed 
through her car's windshield Sunday, hitting her in the face. 
</P>
<P>
	Passenger Tara Sue Wells, a graduate student at the university,  
reached over and guided the 1995 Honda to the shoulder of the road. 
No one else was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Six to eight other cars were damaged by rocks thrown from three  
different overpasses late Saturday and early Sunday, said Florida 
Highway Patrol Sgt. Doug Dodson. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators believe the suspects brought the rocks with them  
since they had coral bases and contained pieces of shell. Each were 
about half the size of a concrete block. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no evidence of anything up there that looked like  
this,'' Dodson said. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman, who struck a large rock in the roadway, told  
authorities she saw two men on the overpass running toward a parked 
car after she stopped. No arrest had been made as of late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Laible was an assistant professor of professional studies at  
the College of Education at the University of Alabama in 
Tuscaloosa.

<HEADLINE> Mark Langston Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- San Diego Padres left-hander Mark Langston  
retired Monday, five months after pitching in his first World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Langston, who finally made it to the Series after 15 big league  
seasons and 432 appearances, was in Padres camp as a non-roster 
player after signing a minor league contract in the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no regrets,'' Langston said. ``I was able to get to the  
World Series with this team last year. It's something I'll never 
forget. I appreciate the opportunity. It's just time to walk 
away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Langston, 38, had thought about retiring last August, but some  
of his teammates talked him into staying. That at least meant he 
was around for his first World Series, although in his only 
appearance he gave up Tino Martinez's momentum-swinging grand slam 
as the New York Yankees won Game 1, 9-6 at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	With the score tied at 5-5 and two outs in the seventh, Langston  
threw a 2-2, two-out pitch that umpire Rich Garcia ruled a ball, 
angering the Padres. Martinez homered on the next pitch. Langston 
also walked two that inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Langston was 178-156 with a 3.88 ERA for Seattle, Montreal, the  
Angels and the Padres. He ranked 27th on the career list with 2,421 
strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	He made the Padres' rotation last year as a non-roster invitee  
and finished the season in the bullpen. He made six relief 
appearances down the stretch after having pitched out of the pen 
only three times in his first 14 big league seasons. He was 4-6 
with a 5.88 ERA in 16 starts, and 0-0 with a 6.00 ERA in six relief 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Langston won 15 or more games six times. In 1990, his first  
season with the Angels, he combined with Mike Witt on a no-hitter 
against Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Langston pitched for Seattle from 1984 until May 25, 1989, when  
he was traded for three pitchers, including Randy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a guy who had a great career,'' Padres manager Bruce  
Bochy said. ``He's walking out of here with his head up.''

<HEADLINE> Jackson: SBC-Ameritech Merger Good </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The planned merger between two local Bell  
telephone companies, SBC Communications and Ameritech, won support 
Monday from civil rights activist Jesse Jackson, who said the union 
would be good for minorities, jobs and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, an advocacy group, conducted  
its own review of the merger, cleared by the Justice Department 
last week and supported by major phone unions and some businesses. 
Consumer groups and long-distance companies oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission still is reviewing the  
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger would create the nation's largest local telephone  
company, which would control 57 million phone lines in spread 
through 13 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson applauded the two companies' efforts to recruit and hire  
minorities, as well as their financial support of minority-owned 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	And, he said, the merger ``promises to deliver the benefits of  
growth in the telecommunications industry to consumers, workers, 
small business and big business.''

<HEADLINE> Stephen Got Even Wins Gallery Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLORENCE, Ky. (AP) -- Nick Zito, lately overshadowed by fellow  
trainers Bob Baffert and D. Wayne Lukas, likes the new hand he's 
been dealt. 
</P>
<P>
	When Stephen Got Even roared past Baffert's Straight Man at the  
top of the stretch and won the $750,000 Gallery Furniture.com 
Stakes on Saturday, Zito knew he had another horse bound for the 
Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been trying all spring to get myself into position,''  
Zito said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baffert over the years and Wayne have had a pretty good hand,  
and I just wanted to be equal with them when I go in this year. I 
think I've got a pretty strong hand now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zito, Baffert and Lukas have accounted for six of the nine Derby  
winners this decade -- Zito in 1991 with Strike the Gold and in 1994 
with Go for Gin, Lukas with Thunder Gulch and Grindstone, and 
Baffert the past two years with Silver Charm and Real Quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Zito already had one fairly solid Derby prospect -- Wondertross,  
who was second by a nose to Vicar in the Florida Derby. And Adonis 
gets another chance to redeem himself April 10 in the Wood 
Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stephen Got Even may have moved ahead of those, said Zito,  
who was thinking of taking the A.P. Indy colt to the Derby without 
another prep. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really want to cool it this year because I want to be strong  
for the Derby,'' Zito said. ``We've got a ticket right now, and a 
lot of times if you've got a ticket you take it because if you 
don't, you get left out. Maybe I'll go to this Broadway show right 
from here. We'll see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owner Stephen Hilbert said Zito told him long ago that Stephen  
Got Even was a promising colt, even though the Gallery was only his 
fourth race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nick told us last November,'' Hilbert said. ``I said, `What  
are your plans here?' and I was thinking about the next race. And 
he said, `My plan's the first weekend in May, and that's at 
Churchill Downs.' 
</P>
<P>
	``If he stays healthy and keeps getting better, we think we've  
got a great shot at being there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert had spent all day Saturday in airplanes in a futile trip  
to see Straight Man run at Turfway Park. He flew from Dubai to 
London to Cincinnati only to see Straight Man lead for six furlongs 
in slow fractions and fade to fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Then on Sunday, the horse he left behind in the United Arab  
Emirates -- 1997 Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner Silver Charm -- 
finished sixth in the eight-horse field at the $5 million Dubai 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert still has a top prospect, Prime Timber, and possibly  
another Triple Crown colt, General Challenge. But his best horses 
might be the fillies Silverbulletday and Excellent Meeting, which 
could end up running in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Straight Man, which has run only three times, will go back to  
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll go to Churchill and he'll have plenty of time,'' Baffert  
said. ``He didn't really run hard (Saturday). He may run in 
something like the Lexington Stakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jockey Shane Sellers rode four winners Saturday, including three  
lesser stakes, but might not be aboard Stephen Got Even again. He 
was subbing for regular rider Jerry Bailey, who was in Dubai and 
finished third in the World Cup with Victory Gallop.

<HEADLINE> Taking Steps To Avoid Computer Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The e-mail might be smiling but the danger is  
real. 
</P>
<P>
	Security experts are warning computer users to be on guard today  
for ``important'' e-mail messages that carry a damaging computer 
virus called ``Melissa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa, heralded by symbols that form a winking smiley face,  
usually contains the subject line, ``Important message,'' and the 
body says ``Here is that document you asked for ... don't show it 
to anyone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The virus launches documents into cyberspace and can clog e-mail  
servers, security experts said Sunday. Unwitting users may think 
they are receiving e-mail from a friend because the virus plunders 
address books. 
</P>
<P>
	Several businesses and governments around the world have  
contacted Carnegie Mellon University's Computer Emergency Response 
Team for help with the virus, said CERT manager Katherine Fithen 
</P>
<P>
	Fithen said the e-mail should be considered a potential security  
breach. ``It's safe to say we're bracing ourselves,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Melissa virus spreads via Microsoft's widely used Word 97  
and Word 2000 documents which can be attached to e-mail messages, 
as well as Microsoft's Outlook and Outlook Express e-mail program, 
according to CERT. 
</P>
<P>
	If a computer user opens the infected Word-format document, the  
virus propagates itself by reading the user's e-mail address book 
and sends an infected message to the first 50 entries, CERT said. 
</P>
<P>
	By sending out that many messages, office e-mail servers can  
become clogged and crash, although the virus apparently causes no 
direct damage to a computer's memory or programs. 
</P>
<P>
	CERT first learned of the virus Friday afternoon and its members  
worked through the night to analyze it, Fithen said. But the full 
reach of the virus may only become clear today when millions sit 
down at their computer terminals. 
</P>
<P>
	Several antivirus software makers, including McAfee, Symantec,  
Trend Micro and Sophos, have posted patches on their Web sites to 
detect and reject the virus. People can also protect themselves by 
not opening the attachments, Fithen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft was among the companies hit by the virus, but it  
suffered no problems, said company spokesman Adam Sohn. The company 
limited its e-mail transmissions and didn't lose any confidential 
information, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft officials said company programmers worked with CERT  
and antivirus companies to develop a solution. 
</P>
<P>
	Fithen declined to say if any government's security was breached  
and wouldn't name anyone whose files had been damaged. The New York 
Times reported today that files at Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., Lucent 
Technologies and the Intel Corp. had been affected. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------

	EDITOR'S NOTE: CERT information about the Melissa virus is  
available on the Web at

<HEADLINE> Complaints Mark World Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- The World Figure Skating Championships  
were marked by complaints that top skaters are having to do too 
much and suspicions that they're doing too little. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelle Kwan might have suffered from both factors.  
</P>
<P>
	The championships also saw men doing plenty, with a record 14  
quadruple jumps by nine skaters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian contingent could hardly have done more, sweeping the  
golds in all four events: Maria Butyrskaya and Alexei Yagudin in 
the singles, Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze in pairs and 
Anjelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov in ice dancing. It was the 
first time a country won all four events; Russians took six of 12 
medals in all. 
</P>
<P>
	Butyrskaya, three months shy of turning 27, became the oldest  
women's champion in taking the title from 18-year-old Kwan, who got 
the silver. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's worlds were the first held under the new scoring  
system in which the qualification round counts toward the final 
score. In previous years, a top skater could go into the qualifying 
round confident of making the cut, but now is under pressure right 
from the start. 
</P>
<P>
	It's difficult for a skater to work up the concentration to  
perform the short program with full competitive fire twice within 
three days, and many resent it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is too stupid,'' Yagudin said after his qualifying round,  
which lacked the vigor and control he later demonstrated in winning 
the free skate to take the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan's coach, Frank Carroll, also complained. ``If you have 40  
or 50 skaters ... then some of those skaters should not be here. 
The reason for the qualification is to more or less weed them out, 
but I don't think if you're probably one of the top three, four or 
five skaters in the world that you need to be weeded out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan, a two-time world champion, shrugged it off, saying ``It  
doesn't really bother me.'' But her qualifying round, although 
solid enough to place her first, struck many as being short on her 
usually intense focus. 
</P>
<P>
	A qualifying round that counted in the final score was a  
particular burden on Kwan because it came as she was trying to 
overcome a head cold. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cold hit me harder mentally than physically,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the cause, she fell on a double axel, usually a  
trouble-free jump for her, in the short program, and ended up 
losing her title to Butyrskaya. 
</P>
<P>
	There were suggestions that what Kwan needed was more  
competition, not less. Prior to the worlds, she had entered only 
the U.S. championships and several open competitions -- pro-am 
events that use ISU rules, but are not strictly competitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether the minimal schedule banked her fires, she said,  
``That wasn't the reason why I missed the double axel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan, waiting to hear about college acceptances, hasn't decided  
what her plans are. But if she stays skating, the competitive 
regimen will be tougher. 
</P>
<P>
	The ISU has issued a directive that all skaters who finish in  
the top six in the world championships must take part in two of the 
Grand Prix series competitions, or they could be barred from next 
year's worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	The level of competition is also likely to be tougher next year,  
particularly for the men, judging by the flurry of quads at the 
world championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The jump was rare just a couple of years ago, but this year was  
common currency for the top skaters and even for some who were far 
off the medals list. 
</P>
<P>
	American Timothy Goebel finished 12th, but threw down a  
challenge to those above him by landing a quad salchow -- more 
difficult than the usual quad toe loop -- in the qualifying round, 
then combining it with a triple toe loop in the free skate. 
</P>
<P>
	China's Guo Zhengxin landed a quad in all three phases of the  
competition. American Michael Weiss took the men's bronze, landing 
his first clean quad in qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Julia Soldatova won the women's bronze and compatriot  
Yevgeny Plushenko won the men's silver. 
</P>
<P>
	In ice dancing, France's Maria Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat won  
the silver and Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor Kraatz of Canada took 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	In pairs, China's Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo were second and  
Poland's Dorota Zagorska and Mariusz Siudek won bronze. 
</P>
<P>
	The choice of the Russian pair over the Chinese was widely  
unpopular with the audience. The event's Russian and Ukrainian 
judges were suspended after television footage showed them 
appearing to converse with each other.

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco May Buy Atlantic Richfield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Only months after buying a large American oil  
company, Britain's BP Amoco is negotiating to buy Atlantic 
Richfield Co. for about $25 billion in stock, according to people 
familiar with the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies confirmed they were discussing a ``possible  
combination transaction,'' but that no definitive agreement had 
been reached, nor was one assured. 
</P>
<P>
	A deal, however, could be announced later this week, after the  
boards of the two companies vote, said the people familiar with the 
acquisition, who spoke today on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	If completed, the merger would be the latest integration in a  
rapidly consolidating oil industry and the second major acquisition 
for the former British Petroleum Co., which completed its $57.6 
billion purchase of Chicago-based Amoco Corp. in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Any deal would have to be approved by U.S. regulators.  
</P>
<P>
	A potential advantage of the linkup is cost savings to be gained  
by uniting the two companies' production operations in Alaska. 
Spokesmen for the ARCO and BP Amoco operations in Alaska said 
separately that they could not comment on rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, they want to spread costs over a wider base,'' said  
Leo Drollas, chief economist at the London-based Center for Global 
Energy Studies. ``ARCO is another good fit. ... It's another 
example of BP Amoco moving cleverly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles-based ARCO's exploration activities would enable the  
combined company to improve production efficiency, while its 
refining and marketing businesses would not conflict with BP 
Amoco's operations, Drollas said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there's a danger because there comes a point where it's so  
big that you lose track of what's going on in the empire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The merged company would produce 2.53 million barrels of crude a  
day, according to 1997 output figures, putting it into a tie with 
Exxon Corp. as the world's largest non-government oil producer, 
Drollas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Friday's closing stock prices of $65.37 1/2 on the New  
York Stock Exchange, Arco has a market value of about $21 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Arco were up 10 percent, or by $6.75 at $72.12 1/2 at  
midday on the New York Stock Exchange, where the U.S. stock of BP 
Amoco was up $3.43 3/4 at $103.87 1/2 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	In Alaska, BP Amoco and Arco jointly operate the 13-billion  
barrel Prudhoe Bay field, the 800-pound gorilla of U.S. oil 
discoveries. But from a peak in 1988 of 2.1 million barrels a day, 
production has fallen off to about 1.2 million barrels daily. 
</P>
<P>
	While BP Amoco now produces more oil than Arco in Alaska, it's  
Arco that has the best future prospects. The company expects to 
have its 360-million barrel Alpine field operating in about two 
years, and it also is eyeing acreage in the vast National Petroleum 
Reserve-Alaska west of Prudhoe for additional opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	About 80 percent of the state's revenues come from oil, and most  
of that is generated by Arco and BP. A combined BP-Arco company 
would own more than 70 percent of the trans-Alaska pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
	Arco is the seventh-largest U.S. oil company, earning $452  
million in 1998 on revenue of $10.3 billion. It has more than 1,700 
gas stations in the Western U.S. and British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	It has interests in places like Indonesia, the Gulf of Mexico,  
the North Sea and Africa. But supply and sales are centered in 
Alaska and California. 
</P>
<P>
	Low crude prices, however, have hurt Arco; since October, it has  
announced plans to lay off 1,200 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco, the world's third-largest oil company, sells its  
products through a network of about 27,000 stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the BP-Amoco deal was completed, the new company has  
announced 10,000 in merger-related cuts, roughly 10 percent of the 
combined company's work force. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the combined BP Amoco earned $4.65 billion on revenue  
of $83.7 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil companies worldwide have been devastated by the low cost of  
oil, causing them to lay off employees and find other ways of 
savings -- including entering into mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon announced in December it would purchase Mobil Corp. in a  
deal currently valued at $75.7 billion that would combine the two 
biggest U.S. oil companies and create the second-largest private 
oil company in the world, behind the Royal Dutch/Shell Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in December, French petroleum giant Total and Belgian  
refiner Petrofina announced plans to merge in a deal that would 
create the world's fifth-largest oil company.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Teens Succeed in Tobacco Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- The flabby guy at poolside smokes a  
cigarette and wears a bikini. The caption of the newspaper ad: ``No 
wonder tobacco executives have to hide behind sexy models.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-smoking message, along with others like it, was crafted  
by Florida students. All the ads, both print and electronic, are 
blunt and catchy, and every penny financing them once belonged to 
tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, the so-called ``Truth'' campaign seems to be working --  
in the year since it began, youth smoking in Florida has plunged. 
Ask teen-agers in Florida about the program, and 98 percent of them 
know about it, according to a survey conducted by the group. 
</P>
<P>
	What's baffled the youths in recent days is this: If they're  
doing such good work, why do some politicians want to cut their 
funding? And why was their leader -- the director of Florida's 
Tobacco Pilot Program -- recently forced out? 
</P>
<P>
	``In this world of conflicting messages, I suppose these kids  
are probably the most confused in the country,'' said state Rep. 
Bob Henriquez, D-Tampa. ``How do you explain this? Your program is 
the first in the nation to be successful, so we're killing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The provocative ad campaign is not dead yet. But it's not quite  
as alive as supporters say it should be. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jeb Bush and the Florida Senate wants to provide the  
program with around $61 million -- $9 million less than the students 
got last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Students Working Against Tobacco, or SWAT, the teen  
component of the Florida pilot program, is most concerned by what's 
going on in the House. That chamber agreed to allocate $30 million 
Friday, after initially balking at giving anything at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of the final amount, students just don't understand  
why they have to fight so hard for a program they believe is so 
obviously effective. 
</P>
<P>
	They're also miffed at Florida Health Secretary Bob Brooks, who  
just last week called the Truth campaign a program that ``is 
cutting edge and has helped to lead us to these early encouraging 
results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, Brooks proudly presented a department  
study that shows teen smoking dropped at every age level after SWAT 
got part of the state's $13 billion tobacco settlement and the kids 
developed the anti-smoking campaign for their peers. 
</P>
<P>
	But less than a week before breaking that news, Brooks told the  
program's director, Peter Mitchell, that he either had to leave or 
be replaced. Mitchell left. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks said the move was sparked by contrasting strategies.  
Mitchell wanted to focus on marketing, such as the Truth campaign, 
while Brooks wanted to shift the focus to education and outreach. 
</P>
<P>
	The students sided with Mitchell.  
</P>
<P>
	``Without the Truth campaign, it's like you take the teeth out  
of the program,'' said Jared Perez, the 18-year-old marketing 
director for SWAT. ``We've concluded using schools is simply not 
effective. No one wants to be lectured, no one wants to be talked 
down to -- and that's what you do in schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's more than coincidence, Perez reasoned, that Mitchell was  
sent packing one day after 40 students held a visible -- and vocal -- 
protest at the state Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	They targeted Republican state Rep. Debby Sanderson of Fort  
Lauderdale, who contends the ads must go because they're costly and 
of questionable taste. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm curious if we're really getting to our target audience,''  
Sanderson said. ``I don't think making fun of the tobacco 
executives is a message to teen-agers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida tobacco lobbyists have remained mostly tight-lipped on  
the matter, and have denied any role in the debate over settlement 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mark Smith, a spokesman for Louisville, Ky.-based Brown &AMP;  
Williamson Tobacco Corp., said the students' position makes no 
sense. With lawsuits filed constantly, it's against a tobacco 
company's best interests to lure youngsters to smoke, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems as if these ads are designed not to reduce teen  
smoking but rather to influence a jury pool for future lawsuits,'' 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	One TV commercial depicts the 125th Annual Demon Awards, live  
from hell. For the ninth year in a row, tobacco proudly accepts the 
award for ``Most Deaths in a Single Year.'' Other contestants -- 
murder, suicide and illicit drugs -- are noticeably upset. 
</P>
<P>
	Other ads feature youngsters making prank calls to tobacco  
executives, and a company spokesman telling Congress that smoking 
isn't addictive, with a laugh track playing in the background. 
</P>
<P>
	Hard-hitting ads designed to steer teen-agers away from smoking  
have been tried in California, Massachusetts, Arizona, Utah and 
Maine -- some funded by tobacco settlement dollars, others by tax 
increases on cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates are concerned when lawmakers start talking about  
shifting the program's focus, and wonder why anyone is tinkering 
with a program that appears to be effective. 
</P>
<P>
	``The heart of the matter is, we don't know what's working here  
yet,'' said Don Webster, CEO of the Florida chapter of the American 
Cancer Society. ``But the truth is, something is working. We'd 
encourage that the program not be changed until we know.''

<HEADLINE> Missile Defense System Tests Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A weapon designed to knock enemy missiles out  
of the sky failed its sixth direct-hit attempt Monday, raising 
questions about the technological feasibility of a defense system 
that is now a national priority. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials in charge of the Army's Theater High-Altitude  
Area Defense missile program put a positive spin on the test, 
saying all targeting, radar and launch systems worked well together 
for the first time. And they predicted a complete success soon, 
although they couldn't say exactly what caused the miss. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything seemed to work very, very well with the exception,  
obviously, of what happened relative to the closing end game for 
the missile,'' Lt. Gen. Lester Lyles, director of the Ballistic 
Missile Defense Organization, told a Pentagon news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the program were skeptical, however, given that the  
Pentagon has spent more than $50 billion on research and limited 
testing on missile defense with few results, dating to the Reagan 
administration's ambitious space-based ``Star Wars'' system. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point you have to wonder if this is in the category of  
developing fusion power,'' said John Pike of the Federation of 
American Scientists. ``The fact is, even the smallest malfunction 
means you missed the target. It says something about how difficult 
this is to do. Everything has to work exactly right or it doesn't 
work at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The THAAD is designed to strike enemy missiles at altitudes of  
800 miles and higher -- just the kinds of weapons nations such as 
Iran, North Korea and Pakistan are developing, raising the threat 
to U.S. troops and allies overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyles said scientists won't know exactly what went wrong with  
the THAAD hit-to-kill part of the missile test until reviewing 
radar, infrared and visual data. The telemetry system, which tracks 
how the THAAD is performing, went down one minute into the test, 
which could hamper efforts to figure out the problem and try to 
correct it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's test was the ninth in a series of 13 flight tests for  
the THAAD program and the sixth attempt at intercepting a missile. 
The system has cost $3.8 billion so far. 
</P>
<P>
	The THAAD -- by definition a regional rather than national  
missile defense system that could protect American cities from 
attack -- has technology that is the most sophisticated military 
weaponry, and it would contribute to development of a system that 
could protect the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In mid-March, the House and Senate passed separate bills making  
the deployment of a national missile defense as soon as possible a 
U.S. government priority. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, who had threatened to veto similar  
legislation in the past, this year proposed spending $6.6 billion 
more through 2005 for missile defense work. 
</P>
<P>
	Given the technological hurdles, the administration moved its  
target date for deploying a national missile defense system -- if 
one can be built -- from 2003 to 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the THAAD missile came within 10 to 30 yards of  
hitting its target, a modified Minuteman 2 missile called a Hera, 
during an early morning test at the White Sands Missile Range, N.M. 
The THAAD self-destructed 10 seconds after the miss, which occurred 
about 300 meters above the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon charged Lockheed Martin Corp., the maker of the  
anti-missile system, a $15 million penalty for not achieving a 
body-to-body hit during Monday's test as required by its $15 
billion contract, modified last June under congressional order. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed will have to achieve two successful hit-to-kill missile  
tests by June 30 or be penalized another $20 million, according to 
the contract. In all, the company could face up to $75 million in 
penalties by the end of 1999 if there are more failures. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Pentagon could scrap the program or pump more money into  
the Navy's high-altitude missile defense system, which is still a 
year away from its first hit-to-kill test. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking at backup plans just in case,'' Lyles said.  
</P>
<P>
	The next THAAD flight test is scheduled for May.  
</P>
<P>
	Army Lt. Gen. Paul Kern, a top official in the Army's research,  
development and acquisition agency, said he was more convinced than 
ever after Monday's near-miss that Lockheed has turned around the 
troubled THAAD program, which had suffered from poor management and 
quality control.

	``While we are not where we would like to be, I am encouraged by  
the test today that we are much closer to achieving success than we 
have been for quite some time,'' Kern said. ``I am convinced that 
American industry can do this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kern pointed to a mid-March test of a souped-up version of the  
Patriot missile interceptor as proof that hit-to-kill is possible. 
The Pac 3 test wasn't designed to hit the target missile but 
nonetheless did so during a test of radar, tracking and other 
systems.

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Stock Markets Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed lower Monday,  
with the key indexes falling in Tokyo and Hong Kong on 
profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 8.15  
points, or 0.05 percent, ending the day at 16,008.84 points. On 
Friday, it closed up 30.95 points, or 0.19 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices remained moderately higher for most of the trading  
session on the U.S. dollar's strength and buying from foreign 
investors, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Tokyo market retreated in late trading as players took  
profits on concern the market had become top-heavy, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, domestic institutional investors were reluctant to take  
big positions in stocks ahead of Tuesday's meeting of the U.S. 
Federal Open market Committee as well as the April 1 start of the 
new fiscal year in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the dollar rose against the yen amid investor  
uncertainty about the U.S.-led NATO bombing against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 120.04 yen in late trading, up 1.28 yen  
from late Friday in Tokyo but below its level of 120.26 yen in New 
York on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange slumped in light trading.  
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, fell 114.84 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 
10,688.47. On Friday, the index had lost 22.82 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said the index dropped on selective profit-taking  
following sharp gains in share prices over the past month. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was light as many investors stayed on the sidelines to  
await the outcome of a meeting on Tuesday of the U.S. Federal Open 
Market Committee. Hong Kong tends to follow U.S. interest rate 
moves because the local currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The markets were closed in Kuala Lumpur and Singapore for public  
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower in a late session sell-off as  
bearish sentiment took hold of technology stocks. The key Weighted 
Stock Price Index fell 131.57 points, or 1.87 percent, to 6,901.68. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed slightly lower, with  
brokers saying the market drifted off its session highs due to an 
absence of direction. The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 5.68 
points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,117.48. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower in lackluster trading.  
The 30-company Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 12.81 points, 
or 0.6 percent, to 2,009.26. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower, dragged down by  
sharp losses in the resources sector as well as declines in the 
heavily weighted banking and telecommunication sectors, dealers 
said. The All Ordinaries Index fell 22.6 points, or 0.8 percent, to 
2,974.0. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed lower as some institutional investors  
dumped their holdings ahead of the close of the fiscal year in 
March. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 8.72 points, or 
1.4 percent, to 601.07. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesia shares closed mixed. The Composite Index  
slipped 0.086 point, or 0.02 percent, to 392.862. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed lower as investors waited on  
the sidelines ahead of the government's announcement of measures to 
kickstart the economy, traders said. The SET index fell 3.59 
points, or 1 percent, to 363.92.

<HEADLINE> Purdue Star Ends Hurt, on Bench </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Stephanie White-McCarty spent the final  
minutes of her remarkable college basketball career writhing on the 
bench in pain and clutching an assistant coach's hand as her Purdue 
Boilermakers won the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarty, second on the school's scoring list, severely  
sprained her left ankle while missing a shot with less than five 
minutes remaining in Purdue's 62-45 win over Duke on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	She squirmed on the court, and spit her mouthpiece about 10 feet  
away as play continued. When play finally stopped, she was helped 
to the bench by teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Grimacing in pain, she sat on the bench as a trainer took off  
her left sneaker. White-McCarty then went to the end of the bench 
and had her ankle heavily taped, limping severely when she tried to 
walk. 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarty, who had 12 points in the game, then took a seat  
on the bench next to assistant coach Kerry Cremeans, tightly 
gripping the coach's left hand and still looking agonized. 
</P>
<P>
	Missing their leading scorer, the Boilermakers blew open a close  
game in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stephanie has meant so much to this program,'' teammate  
Michelle Duhart said. ``As soon as she went out, we became 
determined to rally around her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the win, teammate and best friend Ukari Figgs helped  
White-McCarty -- who was on crutches -- up to the victory stand as 
the Boilermakers received the championship trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	Figgs then also helped White-McCarty hop up four rungs on a  
ladder to become the first Purdue player to cut down part of the 
net at the San Jose Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what we stayed for,'' said White-McCarty, who remained  
at Purdue when many players left the team as it switched coaches 
twice during her tenure. ``The special group we have on this team 
makes it really nice and really special. It's been a lot of fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarty had X-rays on the ankle after the game and was not  
available for the post-game interview session. But coach Carolyn 
Peck said her star shooting guard left the court with a sense of 
satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you she's a happy young lady,'' Peck said.

<HEADLINE> Analysts Say Arco Move Is a Bad Bet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Atlantic Richfield Co. executives may have  
made a bad bet when they focused the company almost exclusively on 
oil production and refining. 
</P>
<P>
	The move left the company especially sensitive to crude oil  
prices. So when the crude market began to collapse in late 1997, 
Arco went with it, turning the nation's seventh-largest oil company 
into a potential takeover target for bigger, more diverse 
competitors like BP Amoco, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, they were hit by slumping oil prices,'' said  
Fadel Gheit, an analyst with Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York. ``Their 
timing was just awkward and bad. It's more bad luck than anything 
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arco and BP Amoco confirmed Monday that they are discussing a  
possible merger, but that no definitive agreement has been reached. 
Neither company would comment in detail on the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	For months Los Angeles-based Arco has been considered a prime  
takeover target in an industry where mergers have become 
commonplace. London-based ABN Amro Inc. identified Arco in January 
as the company most likely to be picked off. Key reasons were the 
company's tight focus on production and refining and its large, 
undeveloped holdings overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``These mergers are all about oil and gas,'' said Eugene Nowak,  
an analyst with ABN Amro who is based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In their breadth of operations, Arco and BP Amoco are a study in  
contrasts. Arco sold off its coal mining and petrochemicals 
operations in 1997 and 1998, becoming an almost ``pure play'' oil 
operation. Arco develops untapped fields, pumps and refines oil 
into gasoline and sells refined gasoline through its am/pm chain of 
convenience stores. 
</P>
<P>
	As Arco has narrowed, BP Amoco has expanded, most notably  
through the $57.6 billion merger in December of British Petroleum 
Co. and Chicago-based Amoco Corp. The merged company is one of the 
world's largest oil producers. It also is one of the biggest 
manufacturers of petrochemicals, the petroleum byproducts used to 
manufacture a wide range of products from polyester slacks to the 
carbon-fiber components of jet airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies lost money when oil prices plummeted, but Arco  
suffered more because a bigger piece of its revenue comes from 
crude production, said Gheit. As production has declined from 
Arco's Alaska holdings, the company has invested heavily in new 
ventures in Russia, Algeria and the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	If the merger becomes reality, BP Amoco will pick up Arco's 4.5  
billion barrel reserve of crude oil -- increasing its holdings by 
one-third. Arco's ability to develop those fields has been 
curtailed sharply by its declining revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Arco earned $452 million in 1998 on revenue of $10.3 billion, a  
significant drop from 1997 when it earned $1.77 billion on revenue 
of $18.7 billion. In recent months Arco has said it will eliminate 
1,200 jobs in a $500 million, companywide cost-cutting campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to focus on oil and gas may not have been such a  
bad idea when it was conceived in the mid-1990s, analysts said. 
Other companies, including Exxon and Chevron, also shed their coal 
interests. And no one foresaw the steep decline in crude prices, 
which only reversed itself in the past few weeks after OPEC nations 
voted to make deep cuts in oil production. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the long term strategically those were good moves, it just  
when you go into storm like this ... prices did come down more and 
stayed down longer than we thought,'' said Nowak. 
</P>
<P>
	The subsequent drop in Arco's earnings ``probably increased  
their visibility and vulnerability'' to acquirers, Nowak added.

<HEADLINE> UConn Defies the Doubters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- UConn? UCan.  
</P>
<P>
	The UConn Huskies are a blue-collar team that supposedly didn't  
have a chance against a blue-chip Duke team that felt so confident 
that it didn't even practice the day before the biggest game of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	But it turned out to be a Blue Monday for the Blue Devils,  
thanks to an unruffled Connecticut team that didn't leave its 
A-game on the beach where its opponents partied Saturday night. And 
a bench that supposedly was far inferior to Duke's. 
</P>
<P>
	With coach Jim Calhoun yo-yoing players in and out of the game  
as if they were on an invisible string, the Huskies outworked, 
outplayed and outhustled a team that was being fitted for its 
championship rings weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Final score: Connecticut 77, Duke 74.  
</P>
<P>
	Sure, the stars came out for the Huskies, as Richard Hamilton  
scored 27 points, Ricky Moore transformed from defensive stopper to 
offensive sparkplug with 13 first-half points and Khalid El-Amin 
ran an offense that never wasted a single possession. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Huskies are national champions -- yes, national champions  
-- in great part because its bench players weren't content to play 
minor roles, outscoring a Duke bench loaded with four McDonald's 
All-Americans 17-8. 
</P>
<P>
	Jake Voskuhl, the 6-foot-11 center whose coifed hair never  
ruffled even amid a frantic Duke second half comeback, banged and 
clanged all night with the supposedly far superior Elton Brand, who 
worked overly hard for each of his 15 points and managed to get off 
only eight shots. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep the foul-prone Voskuhl in the game, Calhoun began  
substituting three minutes into the game, running players in and 
out so quickly that some of the Huskies' best fast breaks came in 
front of the scorer's table. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmund Saunders, more of a tight end than a power forward, came  
in to contribute valuable minutes and a physical presence that 
threw Brand off his game, and Souleymane Wane spelled Voskuhl with 
key minutes and four very-important points. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe the Blue Devils left their game on the beach where many of  
the Blue Devils were seen reveling at 3 a.m. Sunday morning after 
the semifinals, only nine hours before a practice that was never 
held because coach Mike Krzyzewski felt they already were ready. 
</P>
<P>
	They weren't ready for this.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Confirms Talks With Hornets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Michael Jordan went on record Monday that  
he's had preliminary talks about co-owning the Charlotte Hornets, 
but will his presence bring back the fans? 
</P>
<P>
	And could it even breath new life into the uphill battle to  
build a new downtown NBA arena? 
</P>
<P>
	Lofty expectations for just one man.  
</P>
<P>
	But this is Michael Jordan, after all.  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan wasn't saying very much about his plans, although he did  
confirm Monday that he has been in touch with Hornets and NBA 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``In response to reports, I can confirm that I have been  
contacted by George Shinn and (NBA commissioner) David Stern 
regarding co-ownership of the Charlotte Hornets,'' Jordan said in 
the statement issued Monday through agent David Falk's office in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan spoke with Shinn earlier this month about buying a  
50-percent share of the NBA franchise, according to officials with 
the Hornets and the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this stage, however, the discussions are very preliminary  
and I am unsure whether I will be able to make an investment on 
terms that are acceptable to me,'' Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hornets officials were not talking Monday about Jordan's  
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, who grew up in Wilmington and starred at the University  
of North Carolina, said staying involved in the NBA ``would be a 
fulfilling personal and business challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In addition, as a North Carolina native, I would welcome the  
opportunity to be involved in growing the Hornets into an elite NBA 
team,'' Jordan said. ``It would be premature to comment any 
further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan also has met with John Fennebresque, chairman of a  
committee that is trying to developing a new downtown arena, The 
Charlotte Observer reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Fennebresque did not immediately return messages left at his  
Charlotte office on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Sun-Times, quoting unidentified sources in an  
article Sunday, said Jordan and Falk were in the Bahamas, 
discussing the move from retired player to part-time owner. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this is something Michael wants to do, I'm all for it  
because he's earned the right to do whatever he wants to do,'' 
Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf told the newspaper over the weekend. 
``I also believe he would make a good owner. He is good at 
everything he does. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael is very bright and has very good insight into things  
that he focuses on. So, I'm sure he would be a plus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hornets officials said that no firm dates had been set for the  
two sides to meet again but that both parties had agreed to stay in 
touch over the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn was granted an expansion franchise for $32.5 million and  
was revered in Charlotte when the Hornets made their debut in 1988. 
Now, he's gotten the reputation for refusing to play the big money 
to keep top players -- the Hornets lost stars Alonzo Mourning and 
Larry Johnson from a team that once appeared on its way to the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dave Cowens resigned in frustration this month, and fans  
have been staying away with attendance dropping the past year. 
Jordan's presence would be a big boost immediately to the lagging 
franchise, even if it was from the board room and not the court.

<HEADLINE> MGM Gets Rights to James Bond Films </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Sony gave up its fight to make a James Bond  
film under terms of multimillion-dollar out-of-court settlements 
with longtime 007 studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Essentially, we have given up the universal rights to make a  
James Bond picture,'' Sony attorney David W. Steuber said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement resolved lawsuits by James Bond films distributor  
MGM and producer Danjaq LLC against Sony Corp., Sony Pictures 
Entertainment Inc., Columbia Pictures Industries Inc., and John 
Calley, a former MGM executive who became president of Sony 
Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	``The end of this case reaffirms that James Bond resides at one  
address -- that of MGM and Danjaq, his constant home of the last 37 
years,'' MGM Chairman and CEO Frank G. Mancuso said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	MGM has a 19th Bond installment, starring Pierce Brosnan, in the  
works for a November release. Danjaq produced 18 of the 20 Bond 
movies released since ``Dr. No'' in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement involves a $5 million payment by Sony Pictures  
Entertainment to MGM and effectively makes permanent a preliminary 
injunction issued by a court in July 1998, prohibiting the Sony 
parties from making Bond movies in the United States, MGM said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steuber said that MGM in turn paid Sony $10 million for the  
international rights to the movies and certain specific rights to 
the 1967 James Bond movie ``Casino Royale.'' The parties also 
agreed to a worldwide prohibition on Sony making Bond movies, 
Steuber said. 
</P>
<P>
	MGM filed suit in federal court in 1997 when Sony announced its  
intention to develop a Bond film. The case had been scheduled to go 
to trial next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute hinged on rights controlled by Kevin McClory, a  
writer and producer who produced the Bond films ``Thunderball'' in 
1965 and ``Never Say Never Again'' in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	McClory and his company, Spectre, were not parties to Monday's  
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	McClory contends he had a relationship with late Bond novelist  
Ian Fleming that predated MGM's deal. MGM contended that McClory's 
rights to Fleming's material and characters were restricted by the 
1963 settlement of a breach-of-copyright lawsuit McClory filed 
against Fleming over ``Thunderball.''

<HEADLINE> Computers Infected With New Virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- E-mail systems at thousands of companies and  
government agencies around the country were swamped Monday by a 
cunning virus called ``Melissa'' that disguises itself as an 
``important message'' from a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus began to show up Friday and spread rapidly on Monday  
by making computers fire off dozens of infected e-mails. Although 
the virus apparently causes no permanent damage to a computer, its 
effects were far-reaching. 
</P>
<P>
	In Portland, Ore., city government slowed to a crawl. The e-mail  
network at Lockheed Martin, the aerospace company in Bethesda, Md., 
was overloaded. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Vatis, a federal prosecutor and director of the National  
Infrastructure Protection Center based at FBI headquarters, said 
military and government computers were sabotaged, along with 
thousands of other institutions' systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important that computer crime is not just dismissed as  
kids fooling around,'' Vatis said. ``There are real consequences 
for real people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI is investigating, he said. Vatis would not comment on  
whether investigators had any leads, or on where the name Melissa 
came from. 
</P>
<P>
	To make matters worse, a similar virus, called Papa, was  
discovered Monday. Papa is programmed to send out even more 
infected e-mails than Melissa, although it has a bug that sometimes 
prevents it from working, said Srivats Sampath, general manager of 
McAfee software, an anti-virus company, 
</P>
<P>
	The Melissa virus comes in the form of an e-mail, usually  
containing the subject line ``Important Message.'' It appears to be 
from a friend or colleague. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of the e-mail message says, ``Here is that document you  
asked for ... don't show it to anyone else'' with a winking smiley 
face formed by the punctuation marks ;-). 
</P>
<P>
	Attached to the message is a document file. Once the user opens  
that file, the virus digs into the user's address book and sends 
infected documents to the first 50 addresses. E-mails from the Papa 
virus include an attached spreadsheet file, said Sampath. When the 
user opens that file, the virus sends 60 infected e-mails. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason this is spreading so rapidly is that you're getting  
it from people you know and you trust,'' said Eric Lundquist, 
editor in chief of PC Week magazine. ``You should never open 
documents or attachments from people you don't know, but this is 
the first one you need to be careful of opening documents from 
people you do know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People who get an unexpected e-mail with the ``important  
message'' subject line were advised to delete it immediately and 
not open the message. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate computer managers first noticed the Melissa virus late  
Friday, but it began spreading rapidly Monday, with the start of 
the work week. 
</P>
<P>
	Those affected include the chemical company DuPont in  
Wilmington, Del.; electronics maker Honeywell Inc. in Minneapolis; 
North Dakota state government; The Associated Press Broadcast 
Services in Washington; and Compaq Computer Corp. in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a significant nuisance for us,'' said Elaine  
Hinsdale, a spokeswoman for Lockheed Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	In Portland, computer managers had to shut down an e-mail server  
that supplied schedules for city meetings and circulated documents 
for review. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you that we've become addicted to the e-mail  
system,'' said Mayor Vera Katz. ``The phone and shouting have been 
the methods of communication. It has slowed down business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said eradicating the virus would take at least a couple of  
days, and she ordered a plan to prevent similar problems. 
</P>
<P>
	North Dakota Secretary of State Al Jaeger and Tax Commissioner  
Rick Clayburgh said they inadvertently spread the computer bug 
because the name in the message's address line was familiar and 
they assumed there was nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did think it was a little unusual, because of the wording,''  
Jaeger said. ``I opened it up, and in turn, sent it to thousands of 
others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several antivirus software makers, including McAfee, Symantec,  
Trend Micro and Sophos, posted patches on their Web sites that 
detect and reject the Melissa virus. Sampath said that while the 
Papa virus doesn't always work, its code has been published on the 
Internet, where hackers will probably fix the bug and continue its 
distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Vatis said the author of the Melissa virus would probably be  
charged with a felony computer crime carrying a prison term of five 
to 10 years and a fine of up to $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Confirms Reorganization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- After weeks of rumors, Microsoft Corp. confirmed  
plans to reorganize its business, focusing on customer groups and 
needs rather than products and technology, Chairman Bill Gates and 
President Steve Ballmer said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This new structure is part of the reinvention of Microsoft,''  
Ballmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer software giant has traditionally been organized to  
meet the needs of today ``but not those of the next decade,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone news conference, Gates and Ballmer insisted the  
move had nothing to do with the ongoing federal antitrust trial 
against Microsoft in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no relation whatsoever,'' Gates said. ``It has nothing  
to do with any lawsuits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nor does the move indicate that Microsoft would agree to break  
itself up in settlement negotations that resume this week, Ballmer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's certainly no breakup of this company into smaller  
companies that I would find acceptable, and we're certainly not in 
any way thinking of that as a possibility,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Gates said, the move is driven by competitive pressure  
and an expansion of the company's original vision of a computer on 
every desk and in every home. 
</P>
<P>
	The change will be largely invisible to computer users in the  
short run, except for ``a little extra zing in our step, a little 
extra assist, some new ideas, some new thoughts,'' Ballmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not designed to sort of address a short-term issue,''  
Gates said. ``It's really about preparing us for the long run ... 
make us more nimble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move also should have no effect on overall employment, the  
executives said. Slightly less than half of Microsoft's work force 
may be in line for some change in responsibility or job structure. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott McAdams, an analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen in Seattle,  
said the overhaul seemed to be designed to meet competition in 
operating systems for servers and non-desktop devices, especially 
in the hand-held market, than because of any antitrust 
considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	``They reorganize this thing every couple of years,'' McAdams  
said. ``They keep trying to tweak it and realign their business 
strategy with the changing technology and the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New groups within Microsoft under the reorganization are:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Business and Enterprise Division, which will focus on software  
for information technology customers. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Consumer Windows Division, which will focus on developing  
Windows for the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Business Productivity Group, which will focus on products for  
``knowledge'' workers. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Developer Group, which will focus on software developers. It  
will be led by Paul Maritz, who has overseen nearly all software 
development at the company. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Consumer and Commerce Group, which includes the Microsoft  
Network, will focus on bringing together consumers and businesses 
online. The division will be jointly headed by Brad Chase, a top 
marketing manager who masterminded the launch of Windows 95 and 
Internet Explorer, and Jon DeVaan, who has overseen development of 
Microsoft Office. 
</P>
<P>
	The divisions will manage their own internal functions, but may  
share some planning and marketing efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also created a home and retail products division to  
operate outside the core business divisions and focus on 
consumer-oriented products such as games, input devices and 
reference products. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Microsoft rose $3.31 1/4, or 4 percent, to close at  
$92.37 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Nedved Injures Ribs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Rangers center Petr Nedved left Monday  
night's game with the New York Islanders when he suffered an injury 
to his rib cage. 
</P>
<P>
	Nedved left the ice in the first period and did not return. The  
Rangers said he will be sidelined on a day-to-day basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Nedved has played in 54 games with the Rangers since his  
acquisition in a trade with the Pittsburgh Penguins, accounting for 
47 points (20 goals, 27 assists). 
</P>
<P>
	During the recent 12-game absence of first-line center Wayne  
Gretzky, Nedved took over as the No. 1 center and helped the 
Rangers to a 6-3-3 record as they battled for a playoff berth.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Tobacco Suit Dismissal Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- An appeals court on Monday upheld a federal  
judge's decision to throw out a lawsuit by seven Pennsylvania union 
health funds seeking to collect health-care costs from the tobacco 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
ruled unanimously that Judge John P. Fullam was correct in his 
April 1998 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Fullam said the welfare funds had no legal right to recover the  
millions of dollars in payments because they had not spent their 
own money on sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	The private funds, which allow union workers to maintain health  
benefits as they change companies, represent more than 7,500 
blue-collar workers and retirees. 
</P>
<P>
	In the suit, the union welfare funds argued that the tobacco  
industry intentionally targeted less educated, blue-collar workers 
with special advertising and promotional campaigns featuring images 
such as Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania is among 38 states in which union health funds have  
sued the tobacco industry. Around the country, at least nine 
similar cases have been thrown out, with some judges saying the 
unions have no legal standing unless they file separate lawsuits on 
behalf of every smoker. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court decision comes 11 days after a federal jury in  
Akron, Ohio, rejected a $2 billion class-action lawsuit filed by 
114 Ohio union trust funds accusing cigarette makers of 
deliberately trying to hook union workers.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up, Japan Stocks End Mixed / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen today amid investor  
uncertainty about the U.S.-led NATO bombing against Yugoslavia. 
Japanese stocks closed mixed, with the benchmark index posting a 
slight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.04 yen in late trading, up 1.28 yen from  
late Friday in Tokyo but below its level of 120.26 yen in New York 
on Friday. The currency traded as low as 119.90 yen and as high as 
120.60 yen in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 8.15 points,  
or 0.05 percent, ending the day at 16,008.84 points. On Friday, it 
closed up 30.95 points, or 0.19 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar was little changed from its  
level in New York on Friday, supported by the continued NATO 
bombing in Yugoslavia. The dollar is often considered a safe 
investment in times of international unrest, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also helping the U.S. currency today was active buying of the  
greenback by Japanese banks before Japan's fiscal year ends on 
March 31, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There doesn't seem to be any reason for the NATO forces to  
cease attacks (on Yugoslavia) in the near future, and this could 
lead to more safe-haven dollar buying,'' said Ryohei Muramatsu, 
foreign exchange manager at Commerzbank in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currency trading, the euro was traded at 129.44 yen, up  
from 128.78 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices remained moderately  
higher for most of the trading session on the dollar's strength and 
buying from foreign investors, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the market retreated in late trading from its levels earlier  
in the day as players took profits on concern the market had become 
top-heavy, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, domestic institutional investors were reluctant to take  
big positions in stocks ahead of Tuesday's meeting of the U.S. 
Federal Open market Committee as well as the April 1 start of the 
new fiscal year in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 0.89 points, or 0.07 percent, to 1,268.67 
points. The TOPIX closed up 11.95 points, or 0.94 percent, on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section was estimated at 379 million shares,  
down from 532.22 million shares Friday. Advancing issues 
outnumbered retreaters 657 to 525, with 126 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.820 percent from Friday's finish of 1.805 percent, 
driving its price down to 99.82 yen from 99.95 yen.

<HEADLINE>  Korean Pitcher Impresses D-Backs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Arizona Diamondbacks manager Buck Showalter got  
his first up-close look at South Korean right-hander Byung-Hyun Kim 
in action Monday and came away extremely impressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was exactly what we were told about him by our scouts,''  
Showalter said. ``He's got a great look in his eye. He's so excited 
and so are we. We're very lucky to have him. We try to keep in mind 
that he's just 20 years old, but he's an interesting guy, in more 
ways than one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Showalter did nothing to diminish speculation that Kim could  
make the big league roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously he's got a live arm. There are a lot of things to  
like about him,'' Showalter said. ``We'll sit down probably 
tomorrow and decide what the best direction is to go with him from 
here on out. I wouldn't rule out anything right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, who arrived in Arizona Sunday after a 13-hour plane ride  
from South Korea, threw 26 pitches in the bullpen after the 
Diamondbacks' game with the Milwaukee Brewers. He said he has five 
pitches, all thrown from a nasty sidearm, almost underhand, 
delivery at a high-velocity powered by stocky, muscular legs. His 
fastball, scouts say, is in the low 90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Included in his repertoire are two sliders, one that sinks and  
one that rises. The rising slider particularly raised eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a Frisbee-type slider but it's hard,'' pitching  
coach Marc Connor said. ``A lot of guys who throw from under there, 
their breaking balls are slow and soft. His is quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connor had a hard time containing his enthusiasm.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's as good as advertised,'' Conner said. ``I mean, he can't  
throw the ball straight. Everything moves. It looks like he 
rotates. He hasn't been on the mound for six days and he's right 
around the plate with everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim said through an interpreter that he was throwing ``about 80  
percent'' of his full strength. ``It was my first time throwing to 
an American catcher and there were a lot of people watching, so I 
was a little nervous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim got a $2.25 million signing bonus from Arizona, and the  
Diamondbacks are intrigued with the idea of making him a part of 
what already is a formidable pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now,'' Kim said when asked when he'd like to be with the  
big-league club. ``Mentally I am ready right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Kim pronounced himself ``a starting pitcher,'' he  
likely would be used as a set-up man out of the bullpen if he is on 
the Diamondbacks' opening-day roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Catcher Damian Miller said Kim ``has big-league stuff --  
definitely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't throw too many strikes, but his ball was moving all  
over the place,'' Miller said. ``He was probably pretty nervous.''

<HEADLINE> Sharing Time No Problem for Duke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- They have the national player of the  
year and seven high school All-Americans, all who want time on the 
court for the nation's No. 1 team. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Duke Blue Devils never argue over who plays where and  
when or worry about individual stats. Their unofficial motto: We 
love, we share -- and do whatever it takes to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach recruited great players, but along with the great  
players he has recruited great people,'' sophomore Shane Battier 
said. ``We've had the uncanny ability this year to put aside our 
petty differences and statistical differences and focus on winning 
basketball games. We all knew that if we were able to do that we 
would be a successful team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A case in point is Elton Brand, the player of the year and a key  
to Duke's quest for the national championship tonight against 
Connecticut. The sophomore center is averaging 29 minutes a game, 
third on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may have been a different story if we were a .500 team, but  
we all see that if we do our roles we're going to win ball games,'' 
Battier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Point guard William Avery leads the way with 30.9 minutes a  
game, followed by senior Trajan Langdon's 30.8. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand remembers coach Mike Krzyzewski's recruiting pitch. It  
wasn't a sales job at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``He actually told me, `I can't promise you anything, I can't  
promise you you will play a minute, but I can promise you if you 
work hard and you play to your capabilities there is a possibility 
you can play,''' Brand said. ``That's what I got. I didn't get, 
`You'll start.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Brand saw an opportunity to play for one of the game's  
best coaches and for a program that was on the verge -- once again -- 
of greatness. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key is to get talented kids where it doesn't become work,  
that's just what you do,'' Krzyzewski said. ``It's their investment 
in the game. They already come to you with a certain level of 
commitment they do every day. Then you have a chance to get them 
higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Junior Chris Carrawell said there was no jealousy the first time  
he and others on the team worked out with Brand during his 
recruiting trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Man, we've got to have this guy,''' Carrawell said.  
</P>
<P>
	The coach, for one, doesn't see a problem with playing time for  
his numerous stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think in your development, each kid takes on a different  
role,'' he said. ``It's all about learning. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have two different paths you can go on. One is the team  
path, which we have great kids so they see that path and they want 
to be a part of it. Then, there is the individual path. Both of 
them should be compatible, they shouldn't be conflicting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski said his players would agree that freshman Corey  
Maggette is the team's best athlete and probably has the most pro 
potential, yet averages only 17.9 minutes a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the guys love Corey, so they're not threatened by him,''  
Krzyzewski said. ``And Corey has been so good about not ever 
saying, `I need to play more.' All he says is, `How can I best be 
used right now?''' 
</P>
<P>
	That unselfishness could ultimately lead to the top team goal  
tonight -- Duke's third national championship of the decade.

<HEADLINE> Alabama's Sex Toy Ban Is Overturned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- A federal judge on Monday overturned  
Alabama's ban on sex toys, saying the state had no reason to 
prohibit the sale of the devices. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Lynwood Smith of Huntsville found the  
state's 1998 law is ``overly broad'' and in violation of due 
process rights because it bears no ``rational relation to a 
legitimate state interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We succeeded in kicking the government out of our bedroom,''  
said Sherri Williams, who sells sex devices at stores in Huntsville 
and Decatur and joined in a suit challenging the new law. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the statute, selling or distributing ``any obscene  
material or any device designed or marketed as useful primarily for 
the stimulation of human genital organs'' is a misdemeanor 
punishable by as much as one year in jail and a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The law hasn't been enforced pending the outcome of the suit.  
</P>
<P>
	The law was challenged by Ms. Williams and five other women who  
either sell the devices or said vibrators are necessary for sexual 
gratification they cannot get otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	The state attorney general's office, which could file an appeal,  
said the ruling is under review. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 84-page ruling, Smith wrote that ``a majority, or at  
least a significant minority, of the proscribed devices, as a 
matter of law, are not obscene under any established definition of 
obscenity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He emphasized that people who used the devices would be ``denied  
therapy for, among other things, sexual dysfunction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs claimed the ban violated privacy rights by  
indirectly prohibiting adults from engaging in legal acts in their 
own bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Smith did not support that argument. Citing Supreme  
Court precedents, he wrote that ``this court refuses to extend the 
fundamental right of privacy to protect plaintiffs' interest'' in 
using the sex toys. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Herring, an attorney representing plaintiffs, said her  
clients would not drop the privacy complaint if an appeal was filed 
by the state. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the judge took a ``conservative approach to that issue  
since the Supreme Court has only gone so far, but it doesn't mean 
we'd drop the argument. The Supreme Court could decide to extend 
the right to privacy.''

<HEADLINE> Campus Celebrates UConn Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- Students streamed from Connecticut's home  
court and dorms Monday night, dancing around a giant 
university-sponsored bonfire to celebrate the Huskies' 77-74 
victory over favored Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands had packed Gampel Pavilion to watch the championship  
game, blending into a single scream as the final buzzer sounded and 
loudspeakers blared, ``We are the Champions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My dream has finally come true. This makes up for all the  
heartache Duke has caused us so many times,'' said Ellen Truax of 
Sharon, a recent Connecticut graduate who jumped up and down with 
joy. 
</P>
<P>
	Fireworks exploded as a caravan of honking cars snaked through  
the campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Bed frames, couches, chairs and clothing fed a second, smaller  
bonfire outside the freshman dorms known as ``The Jungle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Justin Rice hugged his cousin, freshman Steve Kakowski  
</P>
<P>
	``Finally! Finally!'' Rice said. ``It was the best game I've  
seen. Ricky Moore had the game of his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. Frank Colonese of the UConn Police said there were no  
arrests before midnight, and the only injury was a twisted ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything looks fine so far,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Extra officers were brought in to work with state police. The  
lessons of last year's off-campus spring weekend, which triggered 
violence and vandalism, were still fresh in officers' minds, 
according to campus police chief Robert Hudd.

<HEADLINE> Duke, UConn Deliver The Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The game everybody wanted has been  
in the making for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke and Connecticut, inexorably linked by Christian Laettner's  
shot in 1990 and a whole season of quiet anticipation, meet tonight 
in a national championship game that can settle a lot of scores. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies (33-2) finally can give coach Jim Calhoun the prize  
he's been chasing all these years. Duke (37-1) can establish itself 
as one of the best teams in college basketball history. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in 34 years, the only two teams to be ranked  
No. 1 all season are playing for the national championship. The 
brackets and basketball gods gave us Duke, Connecticut and a lot of 
baggage for rivals who have met only five times. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the most anticipated championship game since North Carolina  
beat Michigan's Fab Five in 1993, the perfect way to culminate a 
great decade of basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's the matchup everyone's really been looking  
forward to,'' said UConn forward Jake Voskuhl, who will share the 
task of guarding player of the year Elton Brand. ``This is the 
matchup the media and the fans have wanted, because we don't play 
each other during the year. You guys wanted it, now you've got 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consider it redemption for all those NCAA tournaments that  
didn't quite give us The Game. Duke and UConn have been so dominant 
this season and so good this decade, this might just make up for 
the premature matchup between Louisville and Houston's Phi Slamma 
Jamma team in the national semifinals in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew that Connecticut was one of the teams that could  
win,'' said Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, recalling the preseason 
rankings that placed Duke and UConn 1-2 in the land. ``And we felt 
we were one of them. So we're the two who felt all year long that 
we were the guys. I think that's what will make it a great game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Duke is the essence of college basketball excellence in the  
'90s, Connecticut isn't far behind. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils are playing in their fifth championship game  
under Krzyzewski, the winningest active coach in the NCAA 
tournament with a 48-12 record. Only North Carolina's Dean Smith 
has more victories, 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke won back-to-back national titles in 1991-92, lost to  
Arkansas in 1994 and Louisville in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you talk about Final Fours, you're talking about Mike  
Krzyzewski,'' said Calhoun, going for his first national title in 
his first trip to the Final Four. ``He's the coach for our 
generation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun has transformed UConn from a regional basketball outpost  
into a national power during a 13-year reign that lacks only a 
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	UConn appeared in the regional final in 1990, '95 and '98,  
losing each time. The first of those was a 79-78 loss to Duke when 
Laettner hit a jumper on an inbounds play at the buzzer in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``It made me sick,'' said Duke forward Shane Battier, who was 11  
at the time. ``Growing up in Michigan, I was a huge Michigan fan. I 
loved the Fab Five. I couldn't stand Duke. I couldn't stand Coach 
K. I hated Christian Laettner. It wasn't until the recruiting 
process that I came to love Duke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke and Connecticut have met only five times, with the Blue  
Devils holding a 4-1 advantage. As if the Laettner game wasn't 
enough for Huskies fans to bear, Duke beat UConn 81-67 in the Sweet 
16 in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much of a great person Mike Krzyzewski is, there are some  
people in Connecticut who don't truly like him,'' Calhoun said. 
``They're never going to forgive him for Christian shooting that 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my opinion, they're the epitome after Kentucky, or probably  
with Kentucky if they're fortunate to beat us, as the best team in 
the '90s. Clearly, they've broken our hearts a couple of times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke seeks a place in history. Calhoun just wants to make peace  
with the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe, just maybe,'' he said, ``we'll have an opportunity to  
do a little heartbreak on them, too.''

<HEADLINE> Affirmative Action Rulings Differ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court won't let the Dallas Fire  
Department revive an affirmative-action program to promote more 
blacks, Hispanics and women. But the justices are letting the 
federal government give companies with disadvantaged owners extra 
help in winning highway contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The apparently contradictory actions Monday, however, seemed  
based on how the second case, from Utah, reached the nation's 
highest court -- not on the justices' views of affirmative action. 
In both cases, the court simply refused to review lower court 
rulings, action that sets no national precedent. 
</P>
<P>
	But its handling of the Dallas case betrayed little patience for  
employers' efforts to give special help to those historically 
underrepresented in their work force. Over two dissenting votes, 
the court left intact a ruling that struck down the Dallas program 
as discriminatory against white men. 
</P>
<P>
	Justices Stephen G. Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg voted to  
consider reviving the fire department's program. But the votes of 
four of the court's nine members are needed to grant such review. 
</P>
<P>
	In an opinion for the two, Breyer cited ``the many affirmative  
action plans in effect throughout the nation,'' and conflicting 
lower court rulings over when such programs are appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	The court generally has been hostile in recent years to programs  
aimed at giving special help to racial minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dallas, the city council adopted a five-year plan in 1988 for  
promoting qualified blacks, Hispanics and women ahead of white men 
who had scored higher on fire department promotion tests. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, white men filled 85 percent of all driver-engineer  
jobs within the department and 97 percent of the 103 lieutenant 
posts. Five years later, those percentages had dropped to 77 and 
82, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, the city council voted to extend the affirmative-action  
plan for another five years, but between 1991 and 1995 the Dallas 
Fire Fighters Association and individual firefighters filed four 
lawsuits challenging the promotion program. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials defended the program, saying it was a necessary  
remedy for past discrimination that had been acknowledged in a 1976 
consent decree between the city and the Justice Department. But a 
federal judge and the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 
against the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``The record is devoid of a history of egregious and pervasive  
discrimination or resistance to affirmative action that has 
warranted more serious measures in other cases,'' the appeals court 
ruled. As a result, it said, the city had failed to show the 
necessary ``compelling interest'' for such a program to promote 
blacks and Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding ``little evidence'' of racial discrimination, the  
appeals court said it had found ``even less evidence of gender 
discrimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Utah case, the court let the federal government continue  
giving companies owned by disadvantaged people extra help in 
winning highway-project contracts. The justices turned away 
arguments that said the federal program discriminates against 
companies owned by white men. 
</P>
<P>
	The action, however, cannot be read as an endorsement of the  
federal Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program, which requires 
that no less than 10 percent of all federally funded highway 
construction contracts be awarded to ``small business concerns ... 
owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged 
individuals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the federal laws encompassing the program defines ``small  
business concern'' as one with less than $16.6 million in annual 
average gross revenue for the preceding three years. The program 
also presumes that racial minorities and women who own small 
businesses are ``socially and economically disadvantaged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That presumption was challenged by Cache Valley Electrical Co.  
after it lost out on two 1995 contracts for work on federally 
funded highway projects in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Cache Valley Electrical is owned by Jack Laub, who is white, and  
it has annual gross revenues of about $41 million. A federal judge 
threw out the lawsuit, saying the company lacked the legal standing 
to sue, and a federal appeals court upheld the dismissal.

<HEADLINE> Protecting Systems From Y2K Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As the federal government approaches Wednesday's  
deadline for inoculating its ``mission-critical computers'' against 
the millennium bug, it turns out that some missions aren't so 
critical after all. 
</P>
<P>
	A study of the numbers of systems potentially vulnerable to the  
so-called Y2K bug shows that about one-third of them have simply 
dropped off the ``mission-critical'' list in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	Government agencies ``are under tremendous pressure from  
Congress to hit their numbers, to be 100 percent compliant. And in 
a practical sense, they will do so even if they have to drop some 
of their mission-critical systems,'' said Robert Alloway, who 
worked for a congressional committee on Y2K and now runs the 
National Leadership Task Force on Y2K, an independent, nonprofit 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	In part, the phenomenon of ``disappearing'' (Alloway's term) is  
simply bureaucratic. Systems once defined as critical have ceased 
to be so, but it has taken the Y2K threat to galvanize the 
government into sorting them out. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ``disappearing'' -- and the refusal of many agencies to  
spell out reasons for taking systems off the critical list -- is 
stoking suspicions among some Y2K-watchers that the government is 
hiding something. 
</P>
<P>
	As the deadline nears, ``the pressure will only increase for  
organizations to define down their systems,'' said Ed Yardeni, 
chief economist for Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once an agency compiles its mission-critical systems, I don't  
think it should be able to change what's defined as 
mission-critical as the deadline approaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K bug occurs because many computers programmed to  
recognize only the last two digits of a year won't work properly 
beginning Jan. 1, 2000, when machines might assume it is 1900. Some 
computers can be reprogrammed, but many have embedded microchips 
that must be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	The effect of the bug is largely unknown. Some, like Yardeni,  
predict chaos, huge power failures and nuclear accidents. Others 
say it will be no worse than a storm that briefly knocks out power. 
</P>
<P>
	In August 1997, the government listed 9,100 mission-critical  
systems, and its overall rating stood at 19.3 percent compliant, 
according to the General Accounting Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the government says, 3,298 systems have been fixed,  
and about 79 percent of its mission-critical systems are compliant. 
</P>
<P>
	But that figure would have been only 55.6 percent had 3,323  
systems not been dropped or redefined, the GAO figures show. 
</P>
<P>
	John Koskinen, the chairman of the President's Council on Year  
2000 Conversion, set a March 31 deadline for the federal government 
to have its mission-critical systems 100 percent compliant. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the GAO, the Department of Agriculture has dropped  
886 mission-critical computer systems since August 1997, from 1,239 
to 353. That enabled it to say it had gone from 10 percent 
compliant to 65 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar tale at Housing and Urban Development: The agency  
started with 231 systems and ended with 62. Compliance jumped from 
22 percent to 73 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Defense's numbers went from 3,695 systems to  
2,581, and compliance from 18 percent to 52 percent. It has 
classified the details, but the little information it did release 
shows that some formerly critical systems of control, early warning 
and communications were folded into others or split into smaller 
components. 
</P>
<P>
	Among systems reclassified by Housing and Urban Development are  
the Multifamily Data Warehouse, phased out in November without 
replacement, and the Funding and Contracting Tracking System, 
replaced last month by the Grants Evaluation Management System. 
</P>
<P>
	Requests to HUD seeking explanations of the system's functions  
were not answered. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Agriculture phased out systems that included  
one that controlled the cash receipts log and one that tracked 
discrepancies between bank deposits and the bookkeeping systems for 
the state and county offices of the Farm Service Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, of the 9,100 systems, 3,298 have been fixed, 3,323  
redefined, and the rest are still being worked on, the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alloway, the task force director, concedes that of the  
mission-critical systems dropped in the last 18 months, about 500 
probably were ``slop'' and needed to be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	But he worries that many reclassified systems are ``being  
dropped down to the next tier of importance, primarily so they'll 
drop off the radar of what's important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Office of Management and Budget, the watchdog agency of the  
Executive Branch, established guidelines for what constituted 
``mission-critical.'' But each agency then decided which systems 
fit the description, and how much detail to make public. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is purely bureau business and not for public  
consumption,'' said Debbie Weierman, a spokeswoman for the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation, when asked for a list of formerly 
mission-critical systems. ``It's regarding investigative techniques 
and isn't something the public would benefit from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Gribben, spokesman for the President's Y2K council,  
acknowledged that the number of mission-critical systems has 
shrunk. ``I don't think it takes away from the fact that agencies 
have been making real progress over the past several months,'' he 
said. ``It's just a matter of what's a priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The definition, in my eyes, has always been a problem,'' said  
Matt Ryan, a staff aide for the House Y2K subcommittee Alloway 
worked for. It is chaired by Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Calif., who in 
the past has voiced suspicions about redefined systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would expect some of that, but there is also a sense of  
'gaming,''' said Ryan. ``If you want to drop out 10 systems that 
are not mission-critical, you can do that. That will raise 
suspicions, though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Russell George, staff director and chief counsel for Horn's  
subcommitee, offered a cautious second opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue as to whether or not federal agencies were 'gaming  
the system' was raised some time ago and the subcommittee, working 
with the GAO, reviewed that issue and found no evidence that that 
was occurring,'' he said. ``That is not to say that the situation 
did not or does not exist, but no evidence to that effect has been 
found.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Parham, the Y2K project director for the Department of  
Agriculture, said nothing suspicious was going on at his agency. 
Instead, most of the 1,239 systems tallied in the original 
inventory were separate programs that were consolidated into one, 
he said. The Forest Service alone dropped from 423 to 17 systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Alloway is hopeful but wary. ``I think they will achieve 100  
percent mission-critical compliance,'' he said. ``But they will 
reach it through a combination of creative redefining and hard 
work.''

<HEADLINE> Purdue Students Cheer NCAA Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- Looking weary after a long flight  
home, Purdue's NCAA women's basketball champions appeared to be 
re-energized after being greeted at the airport by about 75 
screaming fans today. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the Boilermakers headed into the crowd, where they  
hugged family members, friends and fans, signed autographs and 
proudly showed off their championship rings. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue defeated Duke 62-45 at San Jose, Calif., to win the title  
Sunday night. The plane arrived about 2 1/2 hours late at the 
university's airport after being fogged in and briefly rerouted to 
Indianapolis International Airport for refueling. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Carolyn Peck described the turnout, especially under the  
circumstances, as ``awesome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to be home,'' she said. ``It was so good for  
everyone to share in this win because they're all a big part of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few players boarded a bus, but most left with relatives or  
friends as they went their separate ways. Many talked about getting 
some sleep after flying most of the night. 
</P>
<P>
	The team planned to reunite for a pep rally at Mackey Arena  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, to celebrate the victory, thousands of cheering Purdue  
students crowded the streets near campus shortly after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin Shadle, a cheerleader who couldn't make the trip to San  
Jose because of a test, didn't mind being left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I was there I wouldn't get to experience this,'' he shouted  
over the sound of car horns and screaming fans. 
</P>
<P>
	University police, Indiana State Police troopers and law  
officers from West Lafayette and Tippecanoe County stood by as 
about 2,000 people took to the streets. Officers moved in with tear 
gas about 3 a.m. to disperse a crowd that had built a bonfire in 
the middle of a major campus street, Purdue spokesman Joe Bennett 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three minor injuries but no arrests were reported, although  
several traffic lights were vandalized and a police vehicle was 
damaged, Bennett said. A Tippecanoe County sheriff's cruiser and a 
small sports utility vehicle also were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	When the game ended, fans poured out of bars and into the West  
Lafayette streets. Every car in sight blew its horn as hundreds of 
students screamed and hollered. 
</P>
<P>
	Some waved Purdue flags, others wrapped themselves in the flags  
and ran through the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it was the Boilermakers' 10th tournament appearance, it  
was the first time the team had made it to the national title game. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's team never has won a championship in 18 tournament  
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last time we were a national contender for anything was  
the mid-90s and we never did it,'' student Darryl Grant said. ``The 
women made it for the first time and they did it.''

<HEADLINE> Claims Excluded in Smokers' Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Sick Florida smokers suing tobacco companies and  
industry groups won't be allowed to make claims for 37 diseases and 
conditions after a judge's ruling in the first class-action lawsuit 
by smokers to reach trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The health problems include repeated sore throats, skin cancer,  
burned nasal passages, tumors originating in the heart, and kidney 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The diseases were excluded because the smokers' attorneys,  
Stanley and Susan Rosenblatt, didn't present evidence that smoking 
causes the illnesses, Circuit Judge Robert Kaye said in a ruling 
released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also excluded were malignant carcinoid tumors and sarcomas of  
the lung. Dr. Kasi Sridhar, professor of medicine and president of 
the medical staff at the University of Miami's Sylvester 
Comprehensive Cancer Center, explained those are rare conditions 
and no one really knows their causes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rosenblatts represent as many as half a million Florida  
smokers who blame cigarettes for their illnesses, saying they were 
never warned exactly how dangerous smoking is. They are seeking at 
least $200 billion in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaye has forbidden lawyers and parties to the case to discuss it  
with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening statements in the trial were held Oct. 19. Tobacco  
lawyers began presenting their case March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants are R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Philip Morris  
Inc., Lorillard Tobacco Co., Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., and 
Liggett Group Inc., as well as the Tobacco Institute and the 
Council for Tobacco Research.

<HEADLINE> Braves' Ligtenberg Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- Kerry Ligtenberg, who took over the  
Atlanta Braves closer's job last season when Mark Wohlers had 
control problems, said Monday he will have season-ending surgery to 
repair a torn elbow ligament. 
</P>
<P>
	Ligtenberg, 27, took over the closer's job last season when Mark  
Wohlers developed control problems. The rookie right-hander 
converted 30 of 34 save chances, going 3-2 with a 2.71 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 12, Ligtenberg was diagnosed with a partial tear of the  
medial collateral ligament. He has not thrown since and decided on 
surgery after an examination Monday by the Braves' orthopedic 
surgeon, Dr. Joe Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave me three choices -- wait three more weeks and try to  
throw, throw right now, and the third choice was to go get the 
surgery,'' Ligtenberg said. ``I figured I'd do it now. That would 
put me out 12 months and I'll be ready to go next season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ligtenberg, obtained by Atlanta from the independent Prairie  
League for six dozen baseballs and two dozen bats, is to meet next 
Monday with the surgeon, Dr. James Andrews of Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	While Ligtenberg is out, Wohlers appears to be coming back.  
</P>
<P>
	He was sent to the minors last season when he couldn't find the  
plate and his season ended early, but he has been getting better 
with each spring outing. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last three appearances, Wohlers has thrown four scoreless  
innings and lowered his ERA to 5.63. Since giving up four runs in 
his first appearance against Houston, Wohlers has allowed one run. 
Overall, in eight innings this spring, he has given up eight hits, 
walked six and struck out nine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, if we had to start the season today, I don't know  
why we wouldn't open up with him as the closer,'' manager Bobby Cox 
said. ``It's been an amazing turnaround. Who knows what the odds 
were? He certainly has beaten them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The way I feel right now, I would expect to get the ball,''  
Wohlers said Monday after his 1-2-3 outing Monday in Atlanta's 3-2 
exhibition victory over Florida. ``But John Rocker, Rudy Seanez and 
Mike Cather are also pitching well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker, a left-hander, also is expected to get some  
opportunities to finish games. Rocker hasn't allowed a run in nine 
innings this spring, striking out 11 and allowing six hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers began struggling in late May last season after hurting  
his side and going on the 15-day disabled list. He wound up with a 
10.18 ERA in 20 1-3 innings with the Braves, walking 33. At 
Triple-A Richmond, Wohlers gave up 36 walks in 12 1-3 innings with 
a 20.43 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this spring, Wohlers appears to have regained the form he  
had from 1995-97, when he had 97 saves, including a team-record 39 
in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Catholics Urge San Francisco Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A Catholic group called for a boycott  
Monday of San Francisco as a convention site because of a planned 
Easter Sunday celebration featuring drag queens in nun's habits. 
</P>
<P>
	In a half-page ad in the San Francisco Chronicle, the Catholic  
League for Religious and Civil Rights called on all Catholic 
organizations to hold conventions elsewhere unless the drag queens 
choose another day for their party. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's face it, we're not going to bring San Francisco to its  
knees,'' league President William A. Donohue said. ``In the long 
run, we hope Catholics will awaken from their slumber and realize 
it's late in the day if they want to fight for their rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence are a group of mostly gay  
men who dress in bizarre habits, elaborate make-up and wigs. The 
group says it was founded on Easter Sunday and plans to mark the 
date with a celebration as it always does. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the events planned for the street party in the Castro  
district are a ``Hunky Jesus'' contest and an Easter bonnet 
competition. The Sisters performed an ``exorcism'' during the 
pope's visit in 1987 and have held a ``Condom Savior Mass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sisters raise money for AIDS and gay rights groups, but  
Donohue said he is not impressed with their charitable work. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a group that's anti-black or anti-Jewish or anti-gay  
contributing to fighting AIDS,'' he said in a telephone interview 
from the league's New York headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	In an editorial in Friday's edition of Catholic San Francisco,  
the Archdiocese newspaper, the church called for ``calm and clear 
thinking'' to find a solution. 
</P>
<P>
	The League is also mad at the city's Board of Supervisors, which  
granted the permit for the celebration. After the local Archbishop 
protested last week, Mayor Willie Brown and two other city 
officials asked supervisors to reconsider the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Monday night, after hearing two hours of public comment  
in a packed recreation center, the supervisors upheld the permit by 
a 9-2 vote. It would have taken a unanimous vote to overturn the 
decision.

<HEADLINE> Record Sales, Earnings for Walgreen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Strong pharmacy sales pushed Walgreen Co.  
second-quarter earnings up 17 percent, as the largest U.S. 
drugstore chain met analysts expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Walgreen, which has 2,667 stores in 36 states and Puerto Rico,  
said Monday that earnings reached a record $200 million, or 20 
cents a share, for the three months ending Feb. 28, compared to 
$171 million, or 17 cents, for the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had also predicted  
earnings of 20 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 14.6 percent for the quarter to a record $4.7  
billion, with prescriptions accounting for 49 percent of the 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Walgreen, headquartered in this suburb north of Chicago, said it  
plans to exceed its goal of opening 365 stores in this fiscal year, 
pushing into markets in Southern California, Atlanta, Baltimore and 
Salt Lake City. It expects to have 6,000 stores by 2010.

<HEADLINE> Complaints Mark World Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- The World Figure Skating Championships  
were marked by complaints that top skaters are having to do too 
much and suspicions that they're doing too little. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelle Kwan might have suffered from both factors.  
</P>
<P>
	The championships also saw men doing plenty, with a record 14  
quadruple jumps by nine skaters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian contingent could hardly have done more, sweeping the  
golds in all four events: Maria Butyrskaya and Alexei Yagudin in 
the singles, Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze in pairs and 
Anjelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov in ice dancing. It was the 
first time a country won all four events; Russians took six of 12 
medals in all. 
</P>
<P>
	Butyrskaya, three months shy of turning 27, became the oldest  
women's champion in taking the title from 18-year-old Kwan, who got 
the silver. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's worlds were the first held under the new scoring  
system in which the qualification round counts toward the final 
score. In previous years, a top skater could go into the qualifying 
round confident of making the cut, but now is under pressure right 
from the start. 
</P>
<P>
	It's difficult for a skater to work up the concentration to  
perform the short program with full competitive fire twice within 
three days, and many resent it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is too stupid,'' Yagudin said after his qualifying round,  
which lacked the vigor and control he later demonstrated in winning 
the free skate to take the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan's coach, Frank Carroll, also complained. ``If you have 40  
or 50 skaters ... then some of those skaters should not be here. 
The reason for the qualification is to more or less weed them out, 
but I don't think if you're probably one of the top three, four or 
five skaters in the world that you need to be weeded out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan, a two-time world champion, shrugged it off, saying ``It  
doesn't really bother me.'' But her qualifying round, although 
solid enough to place her first, struck many as being short on her 
usually intense focus. 
</P>
<P>
	A qualifying round that counted in the final score was a  
particular burden on Kwan because it came as she was trying to 
overcome a head cold. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cold hit me harder mentally than physically,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the cause, she fell on a double axel, usually a  
trouble-free jump for her, in the short program, and ended up 
losing her title to Butyrskaya. 
</P>
<P>
	There were suggestions that what Kwan needed was more  
competition, not less. Prior to the worlds, she had entered only 
the U.S. championships and several open competitions -- pro-am 
events that use ISU rules, but are not strictly competitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether the minimal schedule banked her fires, she said,  
``That wasn't the reason why I missed the double axel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan, waiting to hear about college acceptances, hasn't decided  
what her plans are. But if she stays skating, the competitive 
regimen will be tougher. 
</P>
<P>
	The ISU has issued a directive that all skaters who finish in  
the top six in the world championships must take part in two of the 
Grand Prix series competitions, or they could be barred from next 
year's worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	The level of competition is also likely to be tougher next year,  
particularly for the men, judging by the flurry of quads at the 
world championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The jump was rare just a couple of years ago, but this year was  
common currency for the top skaters and even for some who were far 
off the medals list. 
</P>
<P>
	American Timothy Goebel finished 12th, but threw down a  
challenge to those above him by landing a quad salchow -- more 
difficult than the usual quad toe loop -- in the qualifying round, 
then combining it with a triple toe loop in the free skate. 
</P>
<P>
	China's Guo Zhengxin landed a quad in all three phases of the  
competition. American Michael Weiss took the men's bronze, landing 
his first clean quad in qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Julia Soldatova won the women's bronze and compatriot  
Yevgeny Plushenko won the men's silver. 
</P>
<P>
	In ice dancing, France's Maria Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat won  
the silver and Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor Kraatz of Canada took 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	In pairs, China's Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo were second and  
Poland's Dorota Zagorska and Mariusz Siudek won bronze. 
</P>
<P>
	The choice of the Russian pair over the Chinese was widely  
unpopular with the audience. The event's Russian and Ukrainian 
judges were suspended after television footage showed them 
appearing to converse with each other.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Gore: I'd Do It My Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Tipper Gore says she's a friend and  
admirer of Hillary Rodham Clinton, but she has her own style -- one 
sure to be scrutinized as the second lady becomes more visible 
during the 2000 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone who finds herself in the role of first lady reflects  
her individuality and who she is as a person,'' Mrs. Gore said in 
an interview with The Associated Press on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	With her husband serving as a congressman, senator and then vice  
president, Mrs. Gore has lived in Washington, D.C., for more than 
two decades, watching the pressure-cooker environment grow ever 
more intense. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been held up to tougher scrutiny than the woman and  
man she and Vice President Al Gore seek to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone's human, she said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes we forget that in the media and in journalism, and I  
say that kindly, since we came from that,'' she said, looking at a 
reporter's tape recorder. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore was a news photographer and her husband a reporter in  
Nashville, Tenn., before he was a congressman, and she lamented the 
scandal-fed machine Washington has become at a time when the news 
media is ever more fixated on celebrities and their failings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other people do, too -- they want to see you as one-dimensional  
or stereotyped people and they forget how very unique and complex 
we are as individuals,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is a key adviser in the White House; Mrs. Gore says  
she dispenses her advice to her husband when asked, most often at 
home or during walks. Would she be a fixture in the Oval Office, 
offering policy advice? 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never done it that way,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	While Mrs. Clinton has one daughter who is away at college, Mrs.  
Gore notes that she has four children, a grandchild due in June and 
two elderly parents in the Washington area. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a difference when you have four children to keep up  
with and all of their activities,'' she said. ``With four children 
and aging parents, I find that I only spend so much time on issues 
that I care about, and I spend a lot of time on keeping the family 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore's issues are slightly different from that of Mrs.  
Clinton. She is most active in mental health care and fighting 
homelessness and poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	She is reluctant to compare or contrast her style with that of  
Mrs. Clinton, noting that her husband has only opened a 
presidential exploratory committee and is not officially a 
candidate in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore appeared recently in New Hampshire and Iowa and she  
substituted for Clinton this weekend when he canceled his scheduled 
appearance at the California Democratic Party convention due to the 
U.S.-led airstrikes in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Both women are crowd-pleasers on the stump. Mrs. Gore has  
neither the polish nor the edge of Mrs. Clinton, but her disarming, 
folksy demeanor charmed delegates Saturday. When her TelePrompTer 
didn't immediately flash her speech, she cracked a joke, and by the 
time the laughter died down, the speech was ready to go. 
</P>
<P>
	She then whipped up Democratic activists with a speech in which  
she took credit on behalf of the Clinton administration for the 
economic boom of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	She warned that Republicans are bent on using the budget surplus  
for a tax cut that would require cutting federal education and 
nutrition programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other party's agenda is based on ideas from 1822,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be an all-out battle for the direction the  
country's going to go in,'' she added.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybeans Off on Warm Weather / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures retreated early today  
on the Chicago Board of Trade amid expectations mild temperatures 
across the Midwest and Plains will aid early planting. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service is calling for above-normal  
temperatures and rainfall over the next 10 days, which should allow 
some farmers to begin early fieldwork. 
</P>
<P>
	Losses were limited, however, as investors continued to square  
positions ahead of the U.S. Agriculture Department's release 
Wednesday of planting intentions and demand reports. Many market 
participants expect corn and wheat acreage to be smaller this year 
than in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 1/2 cent to $2.98 1/4 a bushel; May corn  
fell 2 3/4 cents to $2.29 1/2 a bushel; May oats fell 1 1/4 cents to $1.21 1/2 
a bushel; May soybeans fell 2 cents to $4.94 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while  
pork futures retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle rose .05 cent to 66.67 cents a pound; April  
feeder cattle rose .45 cent to 72 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
fell 1.3 cents to 42.65 cents a pound; May pork bellies fell the 
limit 3 cents to 54.20 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Jets Cut Burger, Sign Norgard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- The New York Jets cut starting guard Todd  
Burger on Monday and signed veteran free agent Erik Norgard. 
</P>
<P>
	Burger, 29, started every game for the Jets last season, but  
coach Bill Parcells never was entirely satisfied with his pass 
blocking. Burger was with the team just one season after playing 
for the Bears from 1994-97. 
</P>
<P>
	Norgard, 33, is entering his 11th NFL season. He played the  
previous 10 with the Oilers, although he appeared in just the 1998 
season opener before winding up on injured reserve with a shoulder 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old Norgard signed a three-year contract and is  
expected to challenge youngsters Doug Karczewski and Alex Bernstein 
for a starting spot. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets also are unsettled at right guard, where incumbent Matt  
O'Dwyer is a free agent and is not expected to re-sign with New 
York. The Jets probably will draft a guard next month.

<HEADLINE> Ford Gives Taurus a Major Facelift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. is betting that its 2000 Taurus,  
restyled without the oval look of its predecessor, will have 
broader appeal in the high-volume market for midside family sedans. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ford introduced its second-generation Taurus in 1995, it  
made a styling splash with an unusual oval design: There were oval 
headlights, oval windows, oval taillights, oval vents, even an oval 
radio and climate-control pod. 
</P>
<P>
	The redesigned Taurus sold well -- it remains Ford's best-selling  
car. But it wasn't as big a hit as the original '86 aero-look 
Taurus. Since it lost the title of the nation's best-selling car in 
1997, the Taurus has remained in third place well behind the more 
conservatively styled Honda Accord and Toyota Camry. 
</P>
<P>
	With that in mind, the new design, to be unveiled today at the  
New York International Auto Show, has shed most of the oval styling 
cues in favor of a cleaner, more understated look. Its Mercury 
twin, the Sable, will undergo a similar transformation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford is betting the new Taurus will have broader appeal in the  
high-volume, midsize family sedan market -- a segment where standout 
styling doesn't always translate into standout sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``It still has a Ford look to it, yet at the same time they took  
away some of the bizarreness and made it more functional,'' said 
analyst James Hall of AutoPacific Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford also is adding an array of safety and comfort features to  
the Taurus and Sable to make them more competitive with the fresher 
competition from Toyota and Honda. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Chris Cedergren of Nextrend contends the styling of the  
second-generation Taurus was not necessarily the reason its sales 
failed to keep pace. Initially, Ford priced the car too high. And 
the segment for years has steadily lost buyers to sport utility 
vehicles and other light trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they had made the car more traditional back then, would  
they have sold any more?'' Cedergren asked. ``I don't think so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford also cut back on less profitable fleet sales of the Taurus  
in 1997 after deciding the cost of maintaining the sales crown had 
become too high. Since then, sales of Taurus to rental, government 
and business fleets have declined 10 percent, spokeswoman Anne 
Doyle said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Ford had hoped the second generation's unique design would  
appeal more to import owners willing to pay a little more, it may 
have put off customers more concerned about space and comfort. One 
problem was its swoopy, ovoid contours made it look smaller than 
the original Taurus, even though it was a bit larger, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you make the customer think the car looks smaller, in some  
cases it doesn't even get considered,'' Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	With its more substantial rear end, a higher roof line and  
larger trunk, the 2000 Taurus looks its size. Rear headroom was 
increased by nearly 2 inches and the trunk holds more than a cubic 
foot more space, addressing common criticisms of the current 
Taurus. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 Taurus represents what the industry calls a ``reskin''  
as opposed to a complete redesign. The structure and basic 
mechanical parts remain largely unchanged from the '99. 
</P>
<P>
	``The face-lift addresses everything Ford could address for the  
money they wanted to spend,'' Hall said. ``Functionally, they've 
made the car better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford plans to promote the car's enhanced safety features when it  
goes on sale in the fall with the Sable. They will be the first 
Fords equipped with a new system of computer sensors that adjust 
the speed of the air bags' deployment based on the severity of the 
crash, the driver's seat position and seat-belt usage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taurus and all other 2000 Ford cars also will come with a  
standard emergency trunk-release latch designed to allow a person 
who becomes locked inside to get out. The t-shaped release handle 
glows in the dark, which Ford says will make it especially easy for 
a trapped child to find. 
</P>
<P>
	Front side-impact air bags also will be available as an option,  
as will power adjustable accelerator and brake pedals. The latter 
feature is a safety advantage for short drivers, who may otherwise 
be subjected to air bag-related injuries from sitting too close to 
the steering wheel. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices are expected to be announced by late summer.  
</P>
<P>
	The New York show opens to the public Saturday and runs through  
April 11.

<HEADLINE> Levin Named Chairman of Sunbeam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DELRAY BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Jerry W. Levin, president and chief  
executive officer of appliance maker Sunbeam Corp., was elected 
chairman Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin succeeds Peter A. Langerman, who served as interim  
chairman and recently was named chief executive officer of Franklin 
Mutual Advisers Inc., one of Sunbeam's largest shareholders with 
about 17 percent equity ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin has been president and CEO of Sunbeam since June 1998,  
when he replaced Al ``Chainsaw'' Dunlap, who was fired when the 
company's board said it lost confidence in his ruthless job-cutting 
strategies. The Delray Beach, Fla.-based company saw its stock soar 
and plummet under Dunlap, from a high of $53 to as low as $5.12 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday, Sunbeam shares slipped 6 1/4 cents to close at $5.62 1/2 on  
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin, 54, formerly served as chairman and CEO of Revlon Inc.  
and of The Coleman Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Langerman, 43, an outside director of Sunbeam since 1992, will  
remain on Sunbeam's board.

<HEADLINE> Tensions in Alabama Senate Lessen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- A political power struggle between  
Republican Lt. Gov. Steve Windom and Democratic senators improved 
to the point Monday where Windom finally felt secure enough of his 
job to take a restroom break. 
</P>
<P>
	The day before, Windom never paused while presiding over a  
marathon Senate session, fearing Democrats would strip him of power 
if he left the chamber. To endure, he had urinated into a container 
hidden under his desk. 
</P>
<P>
	But Windom finally left the presiding officer's podium Monday  
while most Democratic senators aligned with Gov. Don Siegelman were 
out of the room. 
</P>
<P>
	No one made an effort to seize the presiding officer's chair,  
and Windom received applause when he returned to the Senate chamber 
wiping his hand on a paper towel. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first sign that feuding senators are getting closer  
to settling their stalemate over operating rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're making progress,'' said Democratic Sen. Jimmy Holley.  
</P>
<P>
	Windom is the first Republican elected this century to preside

<P>
	This week was supposed to be the Legislature's spring break, but  
Siegelman called a rare special session to try to end the Senate's

	Negotiations continued Monday night, and Windom said he was  
optimistic a compromise was near.

	Democratic Sen. Wendell Mitchell said he was glad senators were  
in a more cordial mood Monday.

	``Yesterday was another low point for the Alabama Senate,''  
Mitchell said. ``I have worked here or served here since 1960 and 
I've never seen the Senate in such a denigration as yesterday.''

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame May Have New BBall Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Notre Dame finally filled its basketball  
coaching vacancy Monday, reportedly hiring Kansas assistant Matt 
Doherty as its new coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame officials scheduled a 4 p.m. EST Tuesday news  
conference to name the new coach, but declined to say Monday who it 
is. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Fox Sports Net and campus radio station WNDU reported  
Monday night that Doherty had been hired. 
</P>
<P>
	Doherty, 37, considered playing at Notre Dame but was recruited  
to play at North Carolina by then-Tar Heels assistant Roy Williams. 
The 6-foot-8 Doherty played forward on the 1982 national 
championship team with Michael Jordan and James Worthy. 
</P>
<P>
	After graduation, he worked as a government bond salesmen in New  
York City and later was a part-time analyst on the Davidson College 
basketball radio network. 
</P>
<P>
	Doherty was hired as an assistant coach at Davidson before the  
1989-90 season, serving there three years before coming to Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	During his seven seasons at Kansas, he has helped the Jayhawks  
sign eight McDonald's All-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzaga coach Dan Monson and Xavier coach Skip Prosser were  
thought to be frontrunners for the job after meeting with Notre 
Dame officials over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Delaware's Mike Brey, Siena's Paul Hewitt and Princeton's Bill  
Carmody all have interviewed with the Irish since MacLeod resigned 
under pressure March 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah coach Rick Majerus was considered the top candidate to take  
the job but dropped out last week amid reports that school 
administrators rejected his candidacy because he didn't fit the 
Notre Dame image.

	US Says Genocide Taking Place in Yugo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department said today ``there are  
indications genocide is unfolding in Kosovo'' as airstrikes against 
Yugoslavia continued into a sixth day. A State Department spokesman 
accused the Serbs of ``abhorrent and criminal action on a maximum 
scale.'' He detailed executions of ethnic Albanian school teachers, 
a negotiator, an editor and hundreds of unarmed civilians. He also 
raised the prospect of war-crimes trials and said even Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic could be held accountable and subject 
to imprisonment for life.

	Primakov Seeks End to Airstrikes  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov will fly  
to the Yugolavian capital tomorrow in an attempt to end the Kosovo 
crisis with a diplomatic solution and put an end to the NATO 
bombings. Russia has been vocal in its opposition to the attacks on 
Serb targets. Yugoslavia is Russia's closest Balkan ally. Russian 
officials unleashed a barrage of criticism against NATO, severing 
their few remaining contacts with the alliance and offering to go 
to Yugoslavia to train its army. With its economy and military in 
ruins, Russia can do little but protest the attacks.

industrial average past 10,000 today, renewing hopes that the blue 
chip index will finally close in five-digit territory. The Dow 
gained more than 180 points by mid afternoon, hitting 10,000 just

	Computers Infected With New Virus  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- E-mail systems crashed or were swamped at  
hundreds of companies of all sizes by the ``Melissa'' computer 
virus, a computer expert estimated today. A team leader for the 
Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon University in 
Pittsburgh, estimated that more than 100,000 computers and hundreds 
of companies had been infected by the virus. Security experts had 
warned computer users returning to work today that Melissa messages 
usually contain the subject line ``Important message.'' The virus 
can crash e-mail systems because it directs computers to send more 
infected documents into cyberspace in great numbers. However, the 
virus apparently causes no direct damage to a computer's memory or 
programs.

	Public Sector Strike Ends in Israel  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- A public sector and government strike that  
paralyzed Israel ended today after all-night talks yielded an 
agreement between the Israeli government and the trade federation. 
The deal grants workers a 4.8 percent wage increase, short of the 
7-percent increase they sought. Following the walkout, mounds of 
garbage accumulated on the streets, railroads were shut down, 
traffic at Ben-Gurion International Airport was disrupted and 
hospitals were reduced to emergency services.

	CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- The biological mother of a girl  
switched at birth with another newborn in 1995 has gone to court to 
protest a proposed $2 million settlement. Paula Johnson said in 
court papers that the settlement for Rebecca Chittum isn't enough 
and as the girl's biological mother, she must approve it. The two 
sets of grandparents raising the other girl, Callie Marie Conley, 
have agreed to accept $2 million from the state-operated University 
of Virginia Medical Center. The children have stayed with the

	Report: Beryllium Endangers Workers

<P>
	TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- A newspaper reports that U.S. government  
officials for years were aware that employees at weapons 
manufacturing plants were being exposed to deadly levels of a toxic 
metal dust. Following a 22-month investigation, The Blade of Toledo 
reported yesterday that since the 1940s, hundreds of workers at 
weapons plants exposed to the dust from the metal beryllium have 
contracted beryllium disease. The incurable illness, which attacks 
the lungs, is sometimes fatal. The Blade said records reveal a 
pattern of government officials favoring efficient production of 
the light metal over worker safety.

	Straw To Get More Spring Training  
</P>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry, trying to make a comeback  
from colon cancer surgery last year, will remain in extended spring 
training when the New York Yankees leave Florida this week to start 
the regular season. The 37-year-old outfielder will go to Triple-A 
Columbus after he completes his chemotherapy. Treatments are 
scheduled to continue through at least April. The Yankees, who have 
Chili Davis as the every-day designated hitter, want Strawberry to 
play left field in the minors to get in shape.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Teammates Battle in NCAA Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- They didn't share just the same high  
school, the same locker room, the same playground, the same 
friends, the same hangouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Moore and William Avery shared a vision.  
</P>
<P>
	Tonight, in the NCAA championship game, one may prevent the  
other from living it. 
</P>
<P>
	When Moore and Avery were teammates at Westside High School in  
Augusta, Ga., they talked frequently of being college stars, of 
playing in the NCAA tournament, of winning a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight, they will play that game of their lives. What they  
never envisioned was they would play it against each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Introductions won't be necessary when Moore, Connecticut's  
defensive ace, matches up against Avery, the intuitive point guard 
who directs Duke's offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the teacher and I was the student,'' Avery said. ``He  
showed me the ropes on the court and off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avery and Moore always played on the same team, even in pickup  
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took him under my wing ... I was a senior and he was a  
sophomore,'' Moore said. ``It was memorable competing against him. 
I didn't want to play against other players in practice as much as 
I did him, because I knew it would make us a better team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It did. Westside went 33-1 and won the Georgia Class AAA title  
in 1994-95 before Moore took off for UConn and Avery took off to 
play his senior season at Oak Hill (Va.) Academy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say he was my best friend because there was just a  
bunch of us that were friends,'' Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the summertime, Moore sometimes worked as a waiter at Augusta  
National, the home of the Masters. His father, Otis, caddied there 
before moving onto the PGA Tour, where he now carries Kelly 
Gibson's bag. 
</P>
<P>
	As he grew up, Ricky Moore passed on his basketball knowledge to  
Avery, who requested the same junior high number that Moore wore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he did a great job of showing me the path to take,''  
Avery said. ``I want to show him now I'm just as good if not 
better. I've never competed against Ricky in an organized game, so 
it's going to be different. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last time we played in a championship game, we were in the  
same locker room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, whose defensive skills neutralized Ohio State star  
Scoonie Penn in the semifinals, expects to defend Avery. But he 
also will be needed to help out on 6-foot-7 Trajan Langdon and, 
when he comes off the bench, 6-6 offense-ignitor Corey Maggette. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to attack them every which way. You have to  
attack them and make them stay on their heels rather than let them 
attack you,'' UConn guard Khalid El-Amin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut's most troublesome matchup is at center, where the  
foul-prone Jake Voskuhl admittedly needs help from 6-7 Kevin 
Freeman in defending player of the year Elton Brand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite frankly, Elton is the most valuable player in college  
basketball,'' Huskies coach Jim Calhoun said. ``We have to decide 
who is going to double (team), where it's going to come from, who 
it's going to come from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brand single-handedly took Michigan State out of the semifinals  
with a 13-rebound, eight-point first half that led to a 68-62 Duke 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't say you're going to stop him, you just hope he  
doesn't go off on you,'' Voskuhl said. 
</P>
<P>
	And for all that talk that Duke can't be beaten, the Huskies  
think they know a team that can do it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be an intense game,'' Freeman said. ``It's going  
to be our five guys on the floor against their five guys. They 
might have six McDonald's All-Americans, but only five can be on 
the floor at a time.''

<HEADLINE> N.J. To Reduce Food Stamp Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Food stamp recipients who spent extra money  
sent to their accounts by a state computer glitch will have their 
payments reduced for 10 months to fix the mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	The March 21 mistake sent April's food stamp allotment -- about  
$23 million -- into about 140,000 automated accounts 11 days early. 
About 50,000 recipients crowded stores to spend about $5 million of 
it before the error was corrected and the extra money taken out. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey provides $200 per month in food assistance to needy  
families. 
</P>
<P>
	April payments will not be affected. But in May, the state will  
begin deducting the amount of the windfall each family spent, 
pro-rated over 10 months, State Human Services Commissioner Michele 
K. Guhl announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacqueline Tencza, a spokeswoman for Guhl, said the department  
``felt strongly that people needed to be responsible for their 
actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``At the same time, we didn't want to hurt innocent children,''  
she said. ``This will minimize the impact on households.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials had initially said the glitch was caused by new  
software designed to protect financial records against the Y2K 
computer problem. They later said the glitch had nothing to do with 
Y2K and blamed it on a combination of computer hardware problems 
and human error.

<HEADLINE> Suspected Burglar Charged in Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- A suspected burglar has been charged with  
causing the death of his 81-year-old neighbor who lay on the floor 
of her home for more than two days while he ransacked her 
belongings. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia Mary Gress lay conscious in the same spot in a doorway  
between two rooms while James Burrell allegedly made repeated trips 
to the house last October and stole more than $1,300 to feed a 
cocaine habit. 
</P>
<P>
	She eventually died of heart failure. Burrell was arrested when  
police caught him and his cousin inside the house three days after 
her body was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Burrell, 42, was indicted by a grand jury on charges of  
second-degree murder, burglary, unlawful imprisonment and criminal 
mischief. His arraignment was set for today in Monroe County Court. 
</P>
<P>
	His cousin, Lawrence Dunham, also goes on trial this week on  
burglary charges. 
</P>
<P>
	According to police, Burrell told them he broke into the house  
through a back window on Oct. 23, fought off a dog the woman had 
set on him and stole a television that he traded that night for 
crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Returning the next day, he said he found Gress lying on the  
floor. He stole several cases of a nutritional supplement but 
couldn't trade them for cocaine and went back to the house that 
night and asked the woman for cash. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the woman offered him $15 to leave her alone. He said he  
accepted $10 and tried to help her to a couch, but she complained 
of back pain and returned to the floor. He then found envelopes in 
the couch stuffed with about $500 to $600, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Burrell told police he returned twice the next day, once with  
his cousin, to search for more money and gave Gress some water. He 
said he found another $700 to $850 in the house that day.

<HEADLINE> Gov't: Dismiss Sailboat Wreck Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Attorneys for the federal government  
asked a judge Monday to dismiss a $35 million lawsuit that faults 
the Coast Guard for failing to search for four people whose 
sailboat crashed into the windswept Charleston Harbor jetties in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal lawsuit, filed this month by the families of the  
victims of the wreck of the Morning Dew, claims the Coast Guard 
ignored a mayday call and subsequent report of voices in the water. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard says it was under no legal obligation to search.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is only when the Coast Guard volunteers to undertake a  
rescue that it, like any Good Samaritan, must perform in a 
reasonable manner under the circumstances,'' said an 11-page 
response filed Monday from Justice Department attorneys 
representing the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Cornett, 49, of Hiltons, Va.; his two sons, Michael  
Paul, 16, and Daniel, 13; and their cousin, Bobby Hurd, 14, of 
Mountain City, Tenn., died in the wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Cornett radioed a mayday the morning of the wreck. A  
petty officer tried to return the call but got no reply. 
</P>
<P>
	But Petty Officer Eric Shelley, the communications officer on  
watch at the Charleston Coast Guard Station, told a National 
Transportation Safety Board hearing last month he did not hear the 
word mayday. He said he answered the call but did not receive any 
response. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he responded to another signal a few minutes later in  
which no message could be made out. The families say the second 
call also came from the stricken vessel. 
</P>
<P>
	About four hours later, a crewman on a cargo ship heard a cry  
for help from the water. A pilot boat searched but turned up 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	National Transportation Safety Board officials have said they  
hope to issue a report on the wreck this summer.

<HEADLINE> Duke Women Crushed by Finals Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- When faced with one of those inane  
questions about how she felt now that Duke had lost the national 
championship, center Michele VanGorp's disappointment turned to 
biting sarcasm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Extremely elated,'' she deadpanned, then corrected her  
inquisitor: ``Of course we feel disappointed and crushed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke had a halftime lead but couldn't hold sustain it over the  
final 20 minutes Sunday night, and lost to top-ranked Purdue 62-45. 
Afterward, guard Georgia Schweitzer pulled her long ponytail around 
to cover her face and sobbed quietly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a great year, and I love these guys,'' she said.  
``It's really sad it had to end this way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke (29-7) made its first Final Four with a stunning upset of  
defending national champion Tennessee in the East Regional finals. 
Then the Blue Devils moved on to defeat Georgia 81-69. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Duke's men were predictably charging through  
their tournament, landing in the title game Monday night against 
Connecticut. The only other school to send both a men's and women's 
team to the Final Four was Georgia in 1983, but neither of those 
teams advanced to the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday night, it appeared as if the Duke women might just  
pull off another upset because Purdue couldn't manage to score in 
the first half. The Boilermakers hit just 8-of-26 from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams were slow and sloppy, but Duke appeared energized in  
the waning moments of the first half and went into the locker room 
with a 22-17 lead. It was the lowest point total for a half in a 
women's title game. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke coach Gail Goestenkors attributed the sluggishness to  
nerves on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``Honestly, before the game, I thought we were ready to play. I  
thought we were relaxed and focused and we had one of our best 
warmups of the year,'' she said. ``I think it hit a lot of the kids 
when they sang the national anthem and they are looking up at the 
flag, and all of the sudden they realize, `Hey, this is a big 
deal.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue woke up in the second half. Senior guard Ukari Figgs, who  
didn't score at all in the first half, had 18 points for the 
Boilermakers as Duke's game stagnated. 
</P>
<P>
	``They play good pressure defense,'' Duke's Hilary Howard said.  
``We've seen that before, but unfortunately, we just didn't adjust 
to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goestenkors, who has coached the Blue Devils for seven years,  
has led her team to five straight tournament appearances. Duke's 
women have finished on top of the Atlantic Coast Conference for the 
past two consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach G -- a nickname that mirrors Duke men's head coach Mike  
Krzyzewski's easier-to-pronounce moniker, Coach K -- has an overall 
record of 147-68 with the Blue Devils. So she tried to paint a 
positive overall picture on the program despite going home without 
a title. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, we were last in the ACC, and I don't think we were a  
very-well-respected program, overall. We've come a long way,'' she 
said. ``I told the team after the game we have had a wonderful 
journey and they have set a new standard for Duke women's 
basketball. We have raised the bar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, after Goestenkors dutifully answered all the media's  
questions, she cast her eyes downward and bit her lip. For a 
moment, she looked close to tears. 
</P>
<P>
	Then she slowly rose and walked back to the locker room, back to  
her team.

<HEADLINE> A Trump Card Almost No One Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- A day earlier, Jim Calhoun had  
called Duke's Mike Krzyzewski the best coach of his generation. 
Just this once, Krzyzewski wasn't even the best coach on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	On the biggest night of his life, that distinction belonged to  
Calhoun. And when his Connecticut Huskies had beaten the team most 
everyone said couldn't be beaten with a national championship on 
the line, the first thing Calhoun did was remember all the kids who 
bought him the time to complete his coaching education. 
</P>
<P>
	Cliff Robinson. Donyell Marshall. Ray Allen -- the names rolled  
off his tongue as fast as the beads of sweat slid from his brow. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every one of our kids,'' he paused, ``had an awful lot to do  
with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But none more than the 56-year-old Irishman who, rather than  
leave New England, made the short hop from Boston down to Storrs. 
Conn., in 1986 and proceeded to build a national power from 
scratch. On the eve of the title game, Calhoun recalled how in the 
early years of his job, he was not above pitching recruits on the 
chance they'd get their heads handed to them by the best players in 
the best conference in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would tell kids, `Would you like to play against Reggie  
Williams and Alonzo Mourning? Would you like to play in the Carrier 
Dome, just not for Syracuse?' 
</P>
<P>
	'' And if a kid said I love Georgetown an awful lot, I'd ask,  
`Have you talked to Coach Thompson? No? Good.' And,'' Calhoun said, 
``we went from there.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Pushes Toward 10,000; Up 157.90 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks surged higher today as news of possible  
corporate mergers helped traders ignore a jump in interest rates 
and uneasiness about Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The imminent end of the first quarter also prompted buying by  
institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
157.90 at 9,980.14, giving traders hope that the blue-chip index 
might close above 10,000 today. On Friday, the Dow eased 14 points 
to close at 9,822.24. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were higher as well today. The Standard  
&AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 22.14 at 1,304.94, approaching its record 
closing high of 1,316.55 set March 18. The technology-heavy Nasdaq 
composite index was up 48.88 at 2,468.05. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly 2 to 1 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 335.48 million 
shares, up from Friday's pace of 317.48 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's another merger Monday, and that's definitely put a bid  
into some sectors,'' said John Olesky, head trader at Morgan 
Stanley Dean Witter. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also benefiting from investors who want to add to  
their portfolios before the end of the first quarter on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``People seem very reluctant to sell stocks, and there is some  
money coming in as well,'' Olesky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's BP Amoco confirmed it is holding merger talks with  
Atlantic Richfield only months after completing the merger between 
British Petroleum and Amoco. The Financial Times and The Wall 
Street Journal reported BP Amoco is discussing buying Arco for 
about $25 billion. The companies said today no definitive agreement 
had been reached nor was one assured. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlantic Richfield was up 6 3/4 to 72 1/8. BP rose 3 3/8 to 103 13/16.  
</P>
<P>
	And unconfirmed talk that Glaxo Wellcome and Bristol  
Myers-Squibb were discussing a combination moved drug stocks 
higher. Glaxo Wellcome was up 2 1/8 at 63 15/16. Bristol Myers-Squibb 
rose 2 to 61 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	In the technology sector, Computer Associates agreed to buy  
Platinum Technology International for more than $3.5 billion, or 
$29.25 a share. Shares of software maker Platinum Technology closed 
Friday at 9 7/8. They were up 13 13/16 at 24 11/16, while Computer 
Associates was down 1 3/16 at 32 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger news helped U.S. equities shrug off lower prices and  
higher yields in the bond market. The 30-year Treasury bond was 
down 5/16 point and its yield, which moves opposite from its price, 
rose to 5.63 percent from 5.59 percent Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve's open market committee meets Tuesday, but  
economists do not expect the policymakers to change short-term 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.4 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index soared 2.13 percent after 
Friday's selloff. Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.66 percent, and 
France's CAC-40 was up 0.92 percent.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Gore: I'd Do It My Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Tipper Gore says she's a friend and  
admirer of Hillary Rodham Clinton, but she has her own style -- one 
sure to be scrutinized as the second lady becomes more visible 
during the 2000 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone who finds herself in the role of first lady reflects  
her individuality and who she is as a person,'' Mrs. Gore said in 
an interview with The Associated Press on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	With her husband serving as a congressman, senator and then vice  
president, Mrs. Gore has lived in Washington, D.C., for more than 
two decades, watching the pressure-cooker environment grow ever 
more intense. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been held up to tougher scrutiny than the woman and  
man she and Vice President Al Gore seek to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone's human, she said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes we forget that in the media and in journalism, and I  
say that kindly, since we came from that,'' she said, looking at a 
reporter's tape recorder. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore was a news photographer and her husband a reporter in  
Nashville, Tenn., before he was a congressman, and she lamented the 
scandal-fed machine Washington has become at a time when the news 
media is ever more fixated on celebrities and their failings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other people do, too -- they want to see you as one-dimensional  
or stereotyped people and they forget how very unique and complex 
we are as individuals,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is a key adviser in the White House; Mrs. Gore says  
she dispenses her advice to her husband when asked, most often at 
home or during walks. Would she be a fixture in the Oval Office, 
offering policy advice? 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never done it that way,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	While Mrs. Clinton has one daughter who is away at college, Mrs.  
Gore notes that she has four children, a grandchild due in June and 
two elderly parents in the Washington area. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a difference when you have four children to keep up  
with and all of their activities,'' she said. ``With four children 
and aging parents, I find that I only spend so much time on issues 
that I care about, and I spend a lot of time on keeping the family 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore's issues are slightly different from that of Mrs.  
Clinton. She is most active in mental health care and fighting 
homelessness and poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	She is reluctant to compare or contrast her style with that of  
Mrs. Clinton, noting that her husband has only opened a 
presidential exploratory committee and is not officially a 
candidate in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore appeared recently in New Hampshire and Iowa and she  
substituted for Clinton this weekend when he canceled his scheduled 
appearance at the California Democratic Party convention due to the 
U.S.-led airstrikes in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Both women are crowd-pleasers on the stump. Mrs. Gore has  
neither the polish nor the edge of Mrs. Clinton, but her disarming, 
folksy demeanor charmed delegates Saturday. When her TelePrompTer 
didn't immediately flash her speech, she cracked a joke, and by the 
time the laughter died down, the speech was ready to go. 
</P>
<P>
	She then whipped up Democratic activists with a speech in which  
she took credit on behalf of the Clinton administration for the 
economic boom of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	She warned that Republicans are bent on using the budget surplus  
for a tax cut that would require cutting federal education and 
nutrition programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other party's agenda is based on ideas from 1822,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be an all-out battle for the direction the  
country's going to go in,'' she added.

<HEADLINE> Bank One To Cut Up to 4,500 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Bank One Corp., the nation's fourth-largest bank,  
said Monday it will eliminate as many as 4,500 jobs as a result of 
the merger last year of First Chicago NBD Corp. and Banc One. 
</P>
<P>
	Revealing for the first time details about potential job cuts as  
result of the $19 billion merger completed in October, the 
Chicago-based Bank One said in a filing with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission that it is eliminating as much as 5 percent of 
the 90,560 jobs the two companies had in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank did not say in its filing how many of the cuts would  
occur through layoffs and how many through attrition, although it 
said it expects to complete the reductions by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman could not be reached for comment late Monday on how  
many jobs already had been cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank One took a pretax restructuring charge of $984 million in  
the fourth quarter of 1998 and expects to record another $526 
million in merger-related charges this year, the company said in 
its filing. Of the charges this year, $54 million will be costs to 
integrate systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said last year that it had planned to eliminate jobs  
and outsource some operations to help achieve $930 million in 
annual savings. In the past few months it has eliminated jobs in 
corporate lending and overseas trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank One, like other banks that have recently merged, hopes to  
become a center for one-stop shopping for financial services such 
as loans, credit and mutual funds, but analysts have said that will 
take time as the companies merge their cultures and operations. The 
bank this year will advise customers about the switch in names, 
removing the First Chicago NBD name from the banking landscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank One has $260 billion in assets, more than 2,000 branches  
and 9,150 automated teller machines in the Midwest, South and 
Southwest. It is the nation's second-largest credit-card issuer, 
owning the First Chicago card and First USA credit operations.

<HEADLINE> Saab Launches New Ad Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Swedish automaker Saab takes on oxygen bars,  
wrinkled suits, candy bars and nudity and comes out the winner 
every time in a new global advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign unveiled for reporters on Monday comes as the  
carmaker is enjoying a sales resurgence that lifted U.S. sales last 
year to its highest level in 12 years and is up strongly for the 
first two months this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of Saab Cars USA, the Norcross, Ga.-based U.S. arm of  
Sweden's Saab Automobile AB, said they expect to boost ad spending 
this year by about 5 percent from the estimated $50 million spent 
in the United States in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The print ads trumpet a ``Saab Vs. ....'' matchup and then  
explain in the small print how the supposed foil is not a real 
rival at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope readers will ask, 'What is this about?' when they see  
the ads in magazines or newspapers, said Kerry Feuerman, vice 
chairman of The Martin Agency which collaborated with Saab's 
European agency Lowe &AMP; Partners Worldwide, in creating the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Saab Vs. Oxygen Bars,'' the ad notes people have been  
visiting places where they can breathe pure oxygen when they could 
ride a Saab convertible into the countryside with the top down for 
the same effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saab Vs. Irish Linen'' discusses how Saab seats are built with  
ventilation systems that keep a driver comfortable and alert and 
clothes relatively unwrinkled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saab Vs. Candy Bars'' tells how its cars have a glove  
compartment that keeps candy bars cool when driving on hot days 
while ``Saab Vs. Nakedness'' addresses how the car is built to 
protect the occupants from side collisions which leave most drivers 
feeling very exposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Feuerman said the 51-year-old carmaker, which is 50 percent  
owned by General Motors Corp., wanted to create an ad format that 
could last five years, stand out in the automotive category and 
appeal to the affluent and educated Saab customer. 
</P>
<P>
	He said 30 different commercials using the ``Saab Vs. ...''  
format have been produced and 12 more are in the works. The ads are 
already running in Europe and should start next month in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Saab plans to spend its ad money more selectively this year,  
abandoning the broadcast networks in favor of about 10 cable 
networks watched most often by its best prospects. The cable 
networks include CNN, Arts &AMP; Entertainment, the History Channel and 
Discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign will also appear in a select group of newspapers  
and magazines, on outlets such as National Public Radio and on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	NPR was included in the mix in part because Saab dealers found  
that is the radio station that many Saab owners have their radios 
tuned to when they leave their car for maintenance or repairs, Saab 
sales and marketing manager John Orth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saab sold 30,757 cars in the United States last year, its  
highest total since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	It projects sales of more than 39,000 this year and is off to a  
good start with sales of 5,092 in the first two months of the year, 
nearly double its 2,648 total for the same period in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Its cars, which range from $25,500 to $44,000, compete with  
Audi, Volvo, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Lexus and Infiniti cars.

<HEADLINE> It Pays To Be Nice to Your Workers / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If you know what's good for you, you'll hold  
onto your employees, show your appreciation and maybe even coddle 
them a bit. The stakes are high; they involve your bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	This might sound like a contrarian view of things in this, the  
age of continued downsizing and diminishing loyalty. But you had 
better begin doing so right now, or things can only get worse. 
</P>
<P>
	First, losing an employee might cost more than $100,000, a  
number that falls right to the bottom line. Secondly, demographics 
suggest there'll be a diminishing number of replacements available. 
</P>
<P>
	That employee turnover can be as costly as it is comes as news  
to many human resources departments, says consultant Quinn Spitzer. 
Even companies that keep records sometimes can't come up with a 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Spitzer's company, Kepner-Tregoe of Princeton, N.J., got  
something of a surprise when it sought to measure turnover costs at 
15 companies. Only five companies could complete the questionnaire. 
</P>
<P>
	All, however, were surprised at the tabulated results, which  
included such items as exit interviews and severance pay, hiring 
costs, and lost productivity while the new hire was learning the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	A manufacturer found the loss of a salaried journeyman machinist  
cost $102,796. The termination of an automaker's human resource 
manager cost $133,803. The bill accompanying the exit of a 
fast-food chain store manager tallied $21,931. 
</P>
<P>
	These results were obtained by using a widely recognized  
quantitative measurement model devised by the Saratoga Institute, 
another human resources consultancy based in Santa Clara, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	But, says Spitzer, surprise turned to disbelief when he added in  
``soft'' costs, including the loss of intellectual capital, 
decreased morale, increased employee stress and negative 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The exercise revealed staggering bottom line losses in every  
industry,'' he says, much of which could be ill-afforded. He found 
the connection between employee loyalty and profits 
``unassailable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carrying the investigation further, Kepner-Tregoe researchers  
sought information from 11 so-called retention leaders, or 
companies renowned for their low turnover rates and employee 
loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
	From interviews with these leaders -- Allied Signal, Corning,  
Hewlett-Packard, Johnson &AMP; Johnson, Marriott International, 
Motorola, Steelcase, Xerox and an unnamed large retailer -- it 
isolated seven practices it says other companies can use: 
</P>
<P>
	1. Retention leaders manage the entire context in which people  
perform -- strategies, systems, policies, decision-making and other 
practices. They manage people, not just retaining people. 
</P>
<P>
	2. These companies have a culture of caring, balanced with a  
tradition of excellence. 
</P>
<P>
	3. All have a number of avenues for resolving conflicts.  
</P>
<P>
	4. They first take stock, then take action. That is, they know  
the danger signs of lagging employee loyalty and have measures to 
deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
	5. They keep their eyes on high performers and reward them for  
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	6. They view people management as a strategic business issue. In  
each company, employees are seen as drivers of financial 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	7. These companies are relentless in their pursuit of continuous  
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom line is this: The retention leaders have achieved  
steady growth in earnings per share and sales per employee over the 
past 10 years. Earnings of almost all exceed industry medians.

<HEADLINE> Ga. Vidalia Growers Organize / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, Ga. (AP) -- As they prepare to harvest an above-average  
crop after an excellent growing season, Georgia's Vidalia onion 
growers want to do business in a new way. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking a cue from Florida tomato farmers, they have formed an  
organization to stabilize prices and provide consumers with more 
consistent quality. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it will help save the farm,'' said grower R.T.  
Stanley, president of the newly formed Vidalia Onion Business 
Council. ``All other agricultural products are selling below the 
cost of production. If we don't make a reasonable profit on these 
onions, we're not going to be able to survive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Stafford, manager of the council, said growers will set  
minimum prices weekly on two types of jumbo onions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to work together ... more than we ever have,'' said  
Stafford, a retired U.S. Department of Agriculture fruit and 
vegetable inspector from Raiford, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	George Boyhan, an onion specialist with the University of  
Georgia Extension Service in Statesboro, said he doesn't think the 
council-set prices will have any effect on the retail price of 
Vidalias this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Onions sold for about $20 per 50-pound bag early in the season  
last year, but dropped to about $10 per 50-pound bag later on. 
</P>
<P>
	Growers considered setting an overall minimum of $12 to $14 this  
year, but dropped that in favor of the weekly plan. Stafford said 
the council has not decided where this year's prices will start. 
Onion sales are expected to begin shortly after the harvest begins 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Council membership is voluntary, but Stafford said he expects  
commitments from growers who control at least 80 percent of the 
14,789 acres that will be harvested this year in the Vidalia 
growing area. 
</P>
<P>
	The minimum, or floor price, will give growers an incentive to  
strive for higher quality, primarily by harvesting at the most 
opportune time and delivering onions that are fully mature, 
Stafford said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The price won't fluctuate as much,'' he said. ``We won't run  
it too high to scare the buyers off, and we won't let it go so low 
as to put the growers under what it costs to produce the onions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stafford said buyers like the plan because it will stabilize  
prices and reduce cutthroat competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Boyhan said the 1999 crop, which will be harvested beginning the  
second week in April, ``looks great'' and should be about the same 
size as last year's 15,000-acre crop. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weather has cooperated, disease has been light and it  
wasn't as wet as last year,'' Boyhan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley, one of Georgia's 138 registered growers, said he  
expects strong demand and good quality. He also serves as president 
of the Vidalia Onion Committee, a grower-funded promotional group 
that is barred from lobbying and setting prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Since their introduction in the 1950s, Vidalias have grown into  
a $90 million crop. Growers say they get their sweetness from the 
unique combination of soil and weather conditions found only in 
southeastern Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Tina Wheeler, manager of the onion committee, says Vidalias  
don't even cause onion breath. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can eat them and kiss without worry,'' she said. ``Just  
ask my husband.''

<HEADLINE> Test Reveals if Melanoma Has Spread </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- An experimental new cancer test for people  
undergoing surgery for melanoma can apparently reveal whether 
deadly traces of the tumor have already spread to other parts of 
the body. 
</P>
<P>
	Melanoma is highly curable if caught early, but doctors often  
cannot be sure whether it has already spread. This new test could 
be the first simple and accurate way of revealing this spread so 
that the disease can be treated aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
	Melanoma is the most dangerous form of skin cancer. The American  
Cancer society estimates that 44,200 cases will be diagnosed in the 
United States this year and 7,300 will die. 
</P>
<P>
	The new test, developed at the John Wayne Cancer Institute in  
Santa Monica, Calif., looks for certain proteins that show up 
mostly on cancer tissue. Dr. Rishab Gupta reported on preliminary 
use of the test Monday at a cancer society conference in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The protein is called tumor antigen 90, or TA-90. Doctors look  
for it using a simple blood test that checks for antibodies to 
TA-90. If the protein is present, the sample turns yellow. 
</P>
<P>
	If TA-90 shows up after the cancer has been surgically removed,  
it means the cancer probably still exists somewhere else in the 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	For these patients, doctor are likely to remove a much larger  
section of tissue around the tumor, take out lymph nodes and offer 
chemotherapy, radiation or experimental cancer vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be reassuring to have a simple test that tells us if  
the tumor has spread or we have gotten it all,'' said Dr. Charles 
McDonald, a dermatologist from Brown University. ``This would be 
the first effective test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gupta and others tried out the test on 57 such early-stage  
patients whose disease turned out to have spread. They found that 
43 had a positive TA-90 test. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years after surgical removal of melanoma, they found that  
88 percent of patients with no signs of TA-90 were still alive, 
compared with 63 percent of those who tested positive for the 
protein. 
</P>
<P>
	It's still too early to know if the test might reveal melanoma  
in people who show no outward signs of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	But because the test would be cheap and easy to perform, Gupta  
said ``it could be of enormous benefit in nationwide screening 
programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gupta said his institute is negotiating with biotechnology  
companies. that could develop the test for commercial release. 
</P>
<P>
	The test is the latest development in what some call molecular  
detection of cancer. These are tests that look for traces of 
proteins that are unique to cancer. The most widely used example is 
the PSA test for prostate cancer; it reveals abnormal levels of a 
protein produced by dividing prostate cells. 
</P>
<P>
	One such test still in development attempts to spot ovarian  
cancer early by detecting lysophosphatidic acid, or LPA. Dr. Yan Xu 
of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation said this show promise for early 
detection, but more work is necessary to reduce the chances of 
false alarms. 
</P>
<P>
	She estimated that 50 of every 10,000 women have ovarian cancer.  
Testing for LPA would find 45 of them. However, it would 
erroneously label 1,000 women as having this form of cancer.

<HEADLINE> Astros Seek Waivers on Hernandez </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP ) -- The Houston Astros made room in their  
bullpen for promising starter Scott Elarton on Monday by placing 
pitcher Xavier Hernandez on unconditional release waivers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros think so highly of Elarton that they would not  
include him in a proposed offseason trade for Roger Clemens. He 
pitched well for the Astros in the bullpen last season and had been 
competing for a spot in the starting rotation this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Astros think Elarton can adjust to the bullpen better  
than Chris Holt, coming off surgery, or Sean Bergman, who worked 
better as a starter last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is the plan, we are moving Elarton to the bullpen,''  
general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``He understands that we are 
doing this for the team's benefit, not because we don't think he 
deserves a chance to be in the rotation. Overall, he's probably our 
third best starter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shane Reynolds, Mike Hampton and Jose Lima are the other  
starters. 
</P>
<P>
	Elarton was 2-2 with a 7.50 ERA in six games this spring. He  
started three games, walked 12 and struck out 15. He had a 2-1 
record and 3.32 ERA in 28 games with the Astros last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez signed a $250,000, one-year contract with the Astros  
before spring training; instead, he gets 45 days' termination pay, 
$61,475. 
</P>
<P>
	He earlier had agreed to a $2.7 million, two-year deal with  
Baltimore, but the Orioles voided it, claiming he flunked a 
physical because of a shoulder problem. The players' association 
filed a grievance, and a hearing is scheduled for May 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez was 0-1 with a 10.80 ERA in eight spring appearances  
with the Astros, with 12 walks and seven strikeouts in 8 1-3 
innings. He had a 6-6 record and 3.57 ERA with the Texas Rangers 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez was beginning his third stint with the Astros, for  
whom he last pitched in 1996. Health was not a factor in waiving 
Hernandez, Hunsicker said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just didn't have a good spring, and the way the bullpen was  
shaping up, we felt we needed more durability out there,'' he said. 
``Having six starters and one moving to the bullpen, it was just 
that the bullpen configuration didn't work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outfielder Dave Clark also was placed on unconditional release  
waivers. Clark, who hit .200 in 18 spring games, had a contract 
worth $700,000 and gets $172,125 in termination pay.

<HEADLINE> Ten Ex-Brokers Fined $837,500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ten former brokers at Sterling Foster &AMP; Co.,  
whose president had previously pleaded guilty to cheating investors 
out of more than $100 million by manipulating stock offerings, have 
been fined a total $837,500 and ordered to repay investors $1.1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The action announced Monday by NASD Regulation, the  
self-policing arm of the National Association of Securities 
Dealers, brings the number of former Sterling Foster brokers 
disciplined by the group for alleged fraud to 31 and the amount of 
fines and restitution ordered to $4.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Several related cases are still pending, NASD Regulation said.  
</P>
<P>
	The now-defunct Sterling Foster, which specialized in  
small-company stocks, was based in Melville, N.Y. In November, the 
firm and its former president, Adam Lieberman, agreed in a 
settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to pay $11.5 
million in restitution plus proceeds from the sale of assets turned 
over to the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Lieberman and two other men involved in the scheme had  
previously pleaded guilty in a related criminal case to bilking 
investors out of more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	NASD Regulation also said Monday it had barred seven of the 10  
former brokers from the securities industry and suspended the other 
three. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulators found that the brokers used high-pressure sales  
tactics, including aggressively soliciting customers over the 
telephone and making fraudulent claims of future high stock prices, 
in sales of Advanced Voice Technologies stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The brokers allegedly urged potential investors to buy the stock  
immediately or they would miss an ``incredible opportunity to get 
rich,'' NASD Regulation said. 
</P>
<P>
	The brokers also allegedly made numerous unauthorized  
transactions in customers' accounts, buying many more shares of 
Advanced Voice Technologies than the customers had authorized. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulators said the brokers embraced Sterling Foster's  
philosophy of ``buy or die,'' meaning never take ``no'' for an 
answer when trying to sell stock to a customer. Each broker was 
expected to make hundreds of phone calls a day, but once a sale was 
made, the brokers ignored customers' calls and frequently refused 
to accept customers' orders to sell stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 former brokers are:  
</P>
<P>
	--Vincent Vaccaro, $100,000 fine, $161,624 in restitution to  
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	--Vincent Carella, $100,000 fine, $135,983 in restitution.  
</P>
<P>
	--William Scuteri, $100,000 fine, $223,200 in restitution.  
</P>
<P>
	--Robert Paulson, $100,000 fine, $82,006 in restitution.  
</P>
<P>
	--Brian Kearney, $100,000 fine, $64,410 in restitution.  
</P>
<P>
	--Timothy Matthews, $100,000 fine, $135,706 in restitution.  
</P>
<P>
	--Michael Cohn, $100,000 fine, $94,341 in restitution.  
</P>
<P>
	--Diana Coblin, $100,000 fine, $152,347 in restitution.  
</P>
<P>
	--Joseph Ferrante, $25,000 fine, $75,577 in restitution.  
</P>
<P>
	--Claudia Silver, $12,500 fine, $13,323 in restitution.  
</P>
<P>
	All the brokers agreed to settlements except for Vaccaro and  
Carella, who may appeal the penalties within 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
	All were permanently barred from the securities industry except  
for Coblin, who was suspended for two years; Ferrante, suspended 
for six months; and Silver, suspended for 30 days.

<HEADLINE> Missile Defense System Tests Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A weapon designed to knock enemy missiles out  
of the sky failed its sixth direct-hit attempt Monday, raising 
questions about the technological feasibility of a defense system 
that is now a national priority. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials in charge of the Army's Theater High-Altitude  
Area Defense missile program put a positive spin on the test, 
saying all targeting, radar and launch systems worked well together 
for the first time. And they predicted a complete success soon, 
although they couldn't say exactly what caused the miss. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything seemed to work very, very well with the exception,  
obviously, of what happened relative to the closing end game for 
the missile,'' Lt. Gen. Lester Lyles, director of the Ballistic 
Missile Defense Organization, told a Pentagon news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the program were skeptical, however, given that the  
Pentagon has spent more than $50 billion on research and limited 
testing on missile defense with few results, dating to the Reagan 
administration's ambitious space-based ``Star Wars'' system. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point you have to wonder if this is in the category of  
developing fusion power,'' said John Pike of the Federation of 
American Scientists. ``The fact is, even the smallest malfunction 
means you missed the target. It says something about how difficult 
this is to do. Everything has to work exactly right or it doesn't 
work at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The THAAD is designed to strike enemy missiles fired from ranges  
of 800 miles away or more -- just the kinds of weapons nations such 
as Iran, North Korea and Pakistan are developing, raising the 
threat to U.S. troops and allies overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyles said scientists won't know exactly what went wrong with  
the THAAD hit-to-kill part of the missile test until reviewing 
radar, infrared and visual data. The telemetry system, which tracks 
how the THAAD is performing, went down one minute into the test, 
which could hamper efforts to figure out the problem and try to 
correct it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's test was the ninth in a series of 13 flight tests for  
the THAAD program and the sixth attempt at intercepting a missile. 
The system has cost $3.8 billion so far. 
</P>
<P>
	The THAAD -- by definition a regional rather than national  
missile defense system that could protect American cities from 
attack -- has technology that is the most sophisticated military 
weaponry, and it would contribute to development of a system that 
could protect the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In mid-March, the House and Senate passed separate bills making  
the deployment of a national missile defense as soon as possible a 
U.S. government priority. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, who had threatened to veto similar  
legislation in the past, this year proposed spending $6.6 billion 
more through 2005 for missile defense work. 
</P>
<P>
	Given the technological hurdles, the administration moved its  
target date for deploying a national missile defense system -- if 
one can be built -- from 2003 to 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the THAAD missile came within 10 to 30 yards of  
hitting its target, a modified Minuteman 2 missile called a Hera, 
during an early morning test at the White Sands Missile Range, N.M. 
The THAAD self-destructed 10 seconds after the miss, which occurred 
about 300 meters above the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon charged Lockheed Martin Corp., the maker of the  
anti-missile system, a $15 million penalty for not achieving a 
body-to-body hit during Monday's test as required by its $15 
billion contract, modified last June under congressional order. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed will have to achieve two successful hit-to-kill missile  
tests by June 30 or be penalized another $20 million, according to 
the contract. In all, the company could face up to $75 million in 
penalties by the end of 1999 if there are more failures. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Pentagon could scrap the program or pump more money into  
the Navy's high-altitude missile defense system, which is still a 
year away from its first hit-to-kill test. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking at backup plans just in case,'' Lyles said.  
</P>
<P>
	The next THAAD flight test is scheduled for May.  
</P>
<P>
	Army Lt. Gen. Paul Kern, a top official in the Army's research,  
development and acquisition agency, said he was more convinced than 
ever after Monday's near-miss that Lockheed has turned around the 
troubled THAAD program, which had suffered from poor management and 
quality control. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we are not where we would like to be, I am encouraged by  
the test today that we are much closer to achieving success than we 
have been for quite some time,'' Kern said. ``I am convinced that 
American industry can do this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kern pointed to a mid-March test of a souped-up version of the  
Patriot missile interceptor as proof that hit-to-kill is possible. 
The Pac 3 test wasn't designed to hit the target missile but 
nonetheless did so during a test of radar, tracking and other 
systems.

<HEADLINE> Padres Acquire Nevin for Sheets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- San Diego acquired Phil Nevin from the Anaheim  
Angels on Monday for utility infielder Andy Sheets, giving the 
Padres catching depth after starter Carlos Hernandez went down for 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Each team also gave up a minor leaguer.  
</P>
<P>
	Nevin will back up Jim Leyritz and Greg Myers. The Padres didn't  
want to rush prospect Ben Davis, who will start out in Las Vegas. 
Hernandez tore his left Achilles' tendon on March 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great trade for me,'' Nevin said. ``Bottom line was,  
I wasn't going to play much there. Here, I feel wanted. In Anaheim, 
we had a difference of opinion on my role. I think I'm stepping 
into a great situation here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevin can also play first and third base, and left and right  
field. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looks like a good catcher who can throw,'' Padres manager  
Bruce Bochy said. ``I like his versatility. He's going to get a 
chance to play here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevin, entering his seventh pro season, is a .230 hitter with 27  
home runs and 94 RBIs in parts of four seasons at the big league 
level. He played in 75 games last year with Anaheim, batting .228 
with eight homers and 27 RBIs. He threw out 25 percent (18-of-72) 
would-be base stealers in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevin also broke up a no-hit bid by San Diego's Sterling  
Hitchcock on June 27, homering on the first pitch of the eighth 
inning. Hitchcock finished with a two-hitter in the 5-1 win. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevin was the first pick overall in the 1992 draft by Houston.  
</P>
<P>
	Sheets posted career highs in nearly every offensive category in  
his first full season in the big leagues. He hit .242 with seven 
homers and 29 RBIs in 88 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres also got minor league pitcher Keith Volkman in the  
deal, and sent the Angels minor league outfielder Gus Kennedy.

<HEADLINE> Rite-Aid's Earnings Drop 39 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Rite Aid's fourth-quarter earnings dropped  
39 percent after a store-opening spree cut into profits, the 
company said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders had awaited the report since the company, the  
nation's third-largest drugstore chain, announced March 12 that 
quarterly earnings would fall about 40 percent short of analysts' 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid shares closed at $25.68 3/4 Monday, down a quarter from  
the previous session but well off its January high of $51.12 1/2 in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid said its net income for the quarter ended Feb. 27 fell  
to $73 million, or 28 cents a share, from $119.7 million, or 44 
cents a share, for the same quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the quarter were $3.56 billion, up 11.7 percent.  
Same-store sales, reflecting the change at stores open for at least 
a year and excluding the effect of adding new stores, rose 8.9 
percent, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin L. Grass, chairman and chief executive officer, said  
while he was disappointed by the profit shortfall, ``We have 
enhanced our competitive position by expanding and modernizing our 
store base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid, based in Camp Hill, added 578 stores during the year,  
including 354 that were relocations or expansions of older, smaller 
stores. During the fourth quarter, 79 stores were opened, 127 were 
relocated or expanded and 85 were closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass said Rite Aid will slow the growth rate this year to rein  
in costs. The company expects to open about 300 stores during the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Izmirlian, an analyst with the Standard &AMP; Poor's Equity  
Group in New York, said profits still may not rebound quickly 
because it can take three years for a new store to become 
profitable, and one year for a relocated store. 
</P>
<P>
	For its fiscal year ended Feb. 27, Rite Aid said its net income  
fell to $158 million, or 60 cents a share, from $316.4 million, or 
$1.22 a share, the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the fourth-quarter earnings drop, the income  
figure reflected a $289.7 million charge during the second quarter 
for costs of closing 379 stores, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid reported sales for the fiscal year of $12.73 billion,  
up 11.9 percent, and said same-store sales increased 7.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Use of Generic Drugs Stagnates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After years of trying to nudge patients off  
their pricey brand-name prescription drugs, the generic drug 
industry finds itself suffering from the headache of stagnant sales 
-- with little relief in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry leaders who gathered here over the weekend bemoaned the  
fact that last year only 41 percent of the prescription medications 
sold in the United States were generic -- the same level as the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``The generic industry is no better off now than in 1986,'' said  
Thomas Culkin, director of regulatory and professional affairs at 
Schein Pharmaceutical, a generic drug firm. ``Generics have 
stagnated in the marketplace, and that's our problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Culkin's assessment Saturday at the annual meeting of the  
Generic Pharmaceutical Industry Association was just one of many 
remarks from industry leaders lamenting the difficulty in raising 
consumer demand for their products. 
</P>
<P>
	A main nemesis, of course, is the powerful brand-name  
prescription drug industry. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, pharmaceutical companies have sought to delay the  
loss of patents on their billion-dollar drugs, and in some cases 
have sought out Congress to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies such as Merck &AMP; Co. and Schering-Plough Corp., for  
instance, say they need longer patent protection so they can recoup 
their billions in research and development costs. 
</P>
<P>
	In other cases, brand-name companies have accused generic  
companies of illegally infringing on patents. 
</P>
<P>
	But even when generic versions are available to patients -- as is  
the case for an estimated 75 percent of existing drugs -- brand-name 
companies often develop newer drugs for the same medical condition, 
reducing demand for the generic. 
</P>
<P>
	The evolution of catchy direct-to-consumer brand-name  
advertising is among the tactics that has hurt generic drugs in the 
marketplace. Consumers used to believe that generics were as 
effective as brand-name drugs, but today they're not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers are now confused,'' said Mary Ann Wagner, vice  
president of the National Association of Chain Drug Stores. 
</P>
<P>
	More than $41 billion worth of brand-name drugs -- including  
ulcer drug Prilosec, antidepressant Prozac and allergy drug 
Claritin -- will lose their patent protection in the next decade, 
making them ripe for generic drug makers to produce cheaper copies. 
</P>
<P>
	But the patent expirations are hardly a guarantee of rosy times  
ahead for generic drug-makers, industry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has become clear during the past few years that we are  
facing and will continue to face challenges on all fronts: The 
state, federal and international levels and in legislative, 
regulatory and legal arenas'' said Michael Dey, vice chairman of 
the generic drug association.

<HEADLINE> Rezulin Will Survive Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The controversial diabetes drug Rezulin --  
implicated in more than two dozen deaths -- will survive moves by 
federal regulators to restrict its use, although sales will likely 
fall short of Wall Street's once lofty expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Many doctors will continue to prescribe the Warner-Lambert drug  
because it is one of the most powerful available to control blood 
sugar, securities analysts predicted Monday. However, diabetes 
experts said doctors remain divided on the drug because of its 
potential to cause liver damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will not relieve the uncertainty in the medical  
community,'' said Dr. Seth Braunstein, chief of the diabetes 
program at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in 
Philadelphia. ``Many doctors will still be hesitant to use the 
drug,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rezulin could also face new challenges from two competitors that  
are awaiting final government reviews later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Rezulin was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in  
January 1997 to treat the growing number of patients with 
adult-onset diabetes, the kind that develops with age and prevents 
the body from making enough insulin to control blood sugar. About 
750,000 Americans take Rezulin. 
</P>
<P>
	A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel on Friday  
recommended keeping Rezulin on the market, but said the drug should 
no longer be used alone. Rather, Rezulin should be only used in 
combination with older treatments and only after other less risky 
therapies fail, the committee said. The FDA isn't bound by its 
advisers' decisions, but usually follows them. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner-Lambert called the panel's action a reaffirmation of  
Rezulin's usefulness. 
</P>
<P>
	Rezulin recorded $748 million in sales last year, and before the  
controversy heated up, some analysts were expecting $1 billion in 
sales this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Rezulin is the fourth most prescribed diabetes pill, and the  
second highest selling drug in Warner-Lambert arsenal after 
cholesterol lowering drug Lipitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions about whether Rezulin damages the liver have plagued  
the drug since shortly after its introduction. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA found 43 patients have suffered acute liver failure  
after taking Rezulin for several months and the drug probably 
caused 38 of the cases. Twenty-eight died, seven survived only with 
liver transplants and five recovered without transplants. The FDA 
has not determined what happened to the other three. 
</P>
<P>
	Complaints about Rezulin rose sharply after it was on the market  
and was used by tens of thousands of patients. The liver problems 
were hard to detect during testing because, like most drugs, these 
tests were conducted on only a few thousand patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street analysts said Monday that the committee's  
recommended restrictions will curtail some sales of the drug 
because it will no longer be used alone. 
</P>
<P>
	The losses will be tempered because some doctors may actually  
begin prescribing the drug now that the FDA panel has offered 
additional guidance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The meeting was definitely positive for Warner Lambert and  
Rezulin,'' said Sergio Traversa, an analyst with the research firm 
Mehta Partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Jeffrey Kraws, analyst with Everen Securities: ``This  
clears the air for doctors sitting on the fence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Richard Kahn, chief scientific and medical officer of the  
American Diabetes Association, said doctors who had doubts about 
Rezulin will still have them. ``There won't be a dramatic shift in 
prescribing behavior,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors want newer weapons against diabetes. That's because  
existing medications tend to lose their effectiveness as the 
disease progresses and victims of adult-onset diabetes often suffer 
blindness or must have limbs amputated. 
</P>
<P>
	Those weapons may soon be available.  
</P>
<P>
	Next month, an FDA advisory panel will review Avandia from  
SmithKline Beecham PLC and Actos from Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. and Takeda 
Chemical Industries Ltd. Analysts say the drugs may face more 
scrutiny by the FDA because of the issues surrounding Rezulin. 
</P>
<P>
	The newer drugs will make Rezulin obsolete by later this year,  
said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen Health 
Research Group, a consumer advocacy organization. ``It's dead,'' he 
said of Rezulin. Wolfe had pushed to stop the Rezulin's sale.

<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The Duval Double is complete.  
</P>
<P>
	And what an emotional payoff.  
</P>
<P>
	On the day David Duval got the biggest victory of his career,  
his father, Bob, was on the other side of the Florida panhandle 
picking up the very first of his. 
</P>
<P>
	David's victory at The Players Championship propelled him to No.  
1 in the world rankings. Bob's win at the senior Emerald Coast 
Classic near Pensacola made the Duvals the first father-son 
combination to win on the same weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I would win the award as the most proud,'' David Duval  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Duval had his doubts about that. A few hours after his  
victory, he stood in the clubhouse at The Moors Golf Club and cried 
as his son received the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's No. 1 now, don't you?'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The venues for these victories couldn't have been more  
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	David is a native of nearby Jacksonville and grew up around the  
TPC at Sawgrass. 
</P>
<P>
	How many times did he come to this tournament, hang around the  
driving range, follow the players down No. 18 and imagine it was 
him holding that trophy high in victory? 
</P>
<P>
	``The hardest place to win is at home,'' Bob Duval said. ``Every  
time he tees it up there, he wants to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A graduate of Florida State University in Tallahassee, Bob Duval  
has always held the Emerald Coast Classic close to his heart. 
</P>
<P>
	He got an exemption to the tournament in 1997, his first season  
on the senior tour. A third-place finish there allowed him to keep 
his card and turn the tour into a career, letting go the teaching 
jobs he had for years up and down the coast of North Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not looking back,'' Duval said of his late entry into the  
touring ranks. ``I had great club jobs and everything else. I can't 
look back at that. I'm playing probably better than I did then. And 
I couldn't win on the regular tour right now because those guys are 
too good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He found out just how good last week, when he worked in a few  
rounds with his son during David's four-week break before the 
Players. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were out here all last week,'' David Duval said. ``I gave  
him a good beating, but he was still pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two stayed in contact throughout the weekend, offering  
advice, words of encouragement and chit chat about other topics, 
just to take their minds off the history at hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, ``Tomorrow while you are playing, you are going to  
think about winning, OK?'' David Duval said. ``So don't try to not 
think about what it would feel like and everything that would come 
with it. You are going to think about that tomorrow, so don't waste 
energy trying to block it out. When you think about it, embrace 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The father took the son's advice. And those trophies might look  
good sitting side by side.

<HEADLINE> Russia Volleyball Team Cancels Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- The Russian national women's volleyball team  
canceled next week's exhibition tour of the United States, citing 
the bombings in Kosovo and violence at the U.S. Embassy in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were just notified,'' Craig Barker, an official for Molten  
USA, a Reno-based athletic equipment manufacturer sponsoring the 
tour, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a fax from the Russian National Volleyball Federation  
that informed us that because of the events in Kosovo and the 
violence at the U.S. Embassy in Russia, they would not be able to 
send their team over here,'' he told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The tour matching teams competing for spots in the next Olympic  
Games was to begin in Reno on April 5, with additional games 
planned in Utah, Idaho and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentin Joukov, president of the Volleyball Federation of  
Russia, notified U.S. national volleyball team director Bob 
Gambardella of the decision earlier Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please do believe that only the unforseen circumstances and  
the present situation make it impossible for us to send our ladies' 
team to your country,'' Joukov said in a fax to U.S. Olympic 
officials in Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do understand that our decision on this matter appeared to  
be utterly unexpected to your organizers and the promoters,'' 
Joukov wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Lorene Graves of USA Volleyball in Colorado Springs, told KOH  
Radio in Reno that the cancellation appeared to have been ordered 
by the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the Russians indicated ``when they are so opposed to  
NATO and United States bombing of Yugoslavia, there wouldn't be any 
cultural or sports exchanges between the two nations allowed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Gambardella nor Graves was immediately available for  
comment Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Joukov said he was hopeful the U.S. team would still make a  
scheduled trip to Moscow on June 12-20. But Gambardella said that 
trip also was being put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are deeply saddened by the current events in the Balkans,''  
Gambardella said in a faxed response to Joukov on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regarding our trip to Russia in June, due to the current  
crisis that exists we are collaborating with the United States 
Olympic Committee on a daily basis to investigate the possibility 
of visiting Russia, therefore at this time the decision to come to 
Russia is on hold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibition matches were intended as training in preparation  
for the World Cup in Japan in November -- one of the qualifying 
sites for the next Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Molten USA, with its North American base in Reno and  
international headquarters in Japan, is ``certainly disappointed'' 
with the cancellation of the U.S. tour, Barker said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put quite a bit of effort into preparing the match for here  
in Reno,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Fans Await Venus Vs. Serena Rematch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. (AP) -- Tennis fans, tournament promoters and  
Serena Williams are ready for a rematch. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Williams wants to recover from Sunday first.  
</P>
<P>
	As the father of the finalists at the Lipton Championships,  
Williams admitted that the occasion was emotionally wrenching. He 
led the cheers at the start of the match and was in his seat at the 
finish, when Venus completed a 6-1, 4-6, 6-4 victory for her second 
consecutive Lipton title. 
</P>
<P>
	But during the match, Richard's thoughts turned to the poor  
neighborhood in Compton, Calif., where the family lived before 
moving to Florida in 1991. The memories stirred his emotions and 
sent him out the stadium tunnel for a calming cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' hands shook during a news conference the day before  
Serena played big sister Venus, and he wasn't much calmer at a news 
conference after the match. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're used to being on the corner in Compton where people are  
shouting and doing drugs,'' he said. ``This is very strange to me, 
sitting up here and you people talking to me. I actually feel like 
a fool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sibling showdown attracted attention from the international  
media. They're eager for a rematch, but they'll have to wait, 
because Serena and Venus aren't scheduled to play the same 
tournament again until the Italian Open in early May. 
</P>
<P>
	The consensus, however, is that Sunday's Williams-Williams final  
could be the first of many. 
</P>
<P>
	Venus, 18, is ranked sixth this week. Serena, 17, is a  
career-high 11th. Dad predicts they'll eventually be 1-2, and his 
opinion counts, because he said years ago that his daughters were 
destined for greatness. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time I ever took Venus to the tennis court, I walked  
home and told my wife, `Baby, we have a champion. This girl is 
rough, tough, strong and mentally sound. Those are the four 
qualities all champions have.''' 
</P>
<P>
	How old was Venus at the time?  
</P>
<P>
	``Four years, six months and one day,'' her dad said. ``At 5  
years old, I took the racket out of her hand. I wouldn't let her 
play for a year because she loved it too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serena started playing at about the same age, and she benefited  
from such practice partners as John McEnroe and Pete Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because Serena couldn't beat those guys with power, she had to  
learn to do angles and drop shots,'' Richard Williams said. ``Right 
now, I think Serena is hitting angles and drop shots better than 
anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But will she overtake Venus? Serena trails 3-0 in the sibling  
rivalry, and there's division within the family regarding how many 
tournaments she and Venus should enter together. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Williams said he once paid a psychiatrist to study the  
effects when sisters play each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``We learned that tennis is the only game that's extremely rough  
on a family,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said his daughters are old enough to decide for  
themselves which events to enter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be in a lot of the same tournaments,'' Venus said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're Jehovah's Witnesses, and we really believe that family  
comes first,'' Serena said. ``No matter how many times we play each 
other, I could never say that it would affect my relationship with 
Venus.''

<HEADLINE> Olivetti Boosts Telecom Italia Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Olivetti SpA on Monday boosted its hostile bid for  
Telecom Italia SpA by 15 percent to $75.9 billion, abruptly 
reversing course to keep alive its hopes of completing the biggest 
deal ever in European telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Olivetti might abandon its bid if Telecom Italia's  
shareholders approve a restructuring plan proposed by Telecom's 
management, chief executive Roberto Colaninno said at a news 
conference in Milan, Italy. Telecom shareholders are to vote on the 
restructuring plan April 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Reacting to mounting pressure from investors and analysts,  
Olivetti sweetened its bid to $12.39 a share from $10.77 a share. 
It increased the cash portion of the offer to $7.45 a share from 
$6.46, although it did not change the offer's ratio of cash, bonds 
and shares. 
</P>
<P>
	A Telecom Italia spokesman refused to comment on Olivetti's  
revised offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Colaninno had refused for weeks to increase the original bid,  
which many analysts said did not reflect the true value of Telecom 
-- a former state-run monopoly five times Olivetti's size. 
</P>
<P>
	Colaninno's hand was apparently forced after investors responded  
positively Monday to Telecom's offer of $22 billion in cash instead 
of stock for the remaining 40 percent of Telecom Italia Mobile SpA, 
pushing up prices for the subsidiary's shares in trading on the 
Milan stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom, which already owns 60 percent of the mobile phone unit,  
wants to buy the remaining shares in an effort to make an Olivetti 
takeover prohibitively expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom announced Saturday that it was paying cash instead of  
stock in response to investor complaints that a stock-for-stock 
offer would dilute the value of their existing shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom said it would offer holders of the mobile phone  
company's ordinary shares a premium of 18 percent above the last 
trading price Friday, and holders of its savings shares would 
receive a premium of 11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of TIM ordinary shares rose 35 cents, or 6 percent,  
Monday on the Milan stock exchange, closing at $6.63 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia ordinary shares fell one cent to $10.44 a share,  
while Olivetti shares lost two cents to close at $3.12. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom will ask shareholders to approve its cash offer for TIM  
shares at a new shareholders' meeting in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom would have to borrow the cash it needs to buy the  
remaining TIM shares, thereby adding considerably to Telecom's debt 
-- and possibly discouraging Olivetti's takeover attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders are to meet separately to vote on Telecom's overall  
restructuring plan, which includes the conversion of savings shares 
into ordinary shares, a repurchase of outstanding shares and the 
sale of non-core assets. 
</P>
<P>
	But Colaninno said Monday that Olivetti's revised offer would  
stand only if Telecom and its subsidiaries refrained from taking 
action that would alter their profitability from June 30, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti said Friday that its effort to raise a $24.2 billion  
loan for the takeover was significantly oversubscribed.

	NATO Bolsters Forces in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Ordering up more airstrikes to  
target Serb military units, NATO raced early Monday to head off 
what it called ``genocide'' against ethnic Albanians. Thousands of 
ethnic Albanian refugees, accusing Serbs of systematic brutality, 
fled into neighboring Albania and Macedonia. Officials in both 
countries pleaded for international help to prevent a humanitarian 
crisis, and Albania called for NATO ground troops to enter Kosovo -- 
something NATO says it has no plans to do. Serbian state-run 
television repeatedly showed video of a raging fire in the center 
of Kosovo's capital of Pristina that it said was set off by a NATO 
missile attack on a police building.

	Iraq Said Paid $800,000 to Primakov  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov received  
at least $800,000 from the Iraqi government and hindered U.N. 
efforts to monitor Baghdad's illegal weapons programs, The New 
Yorker magazine reported. The magazine, in an article by 
investigative reporter Seymour M. Hersh, also said the U.S. 
military attempted to assassinate Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein 
during allied airstrikes last December. The story was reported in 
the magazine's April 5 edition, which hits newsstands Monday. 
According to The New Yorker, Primakov has a close friendship with 
Saddam dating back to the 1960s, when the Russian official was a 
correspondent for Pravda in the Middle East.

	Paraguay Celebrates New President  
</P>
<P>
	ASUNCION, Paraguay -- Waving flags and singing the national  
anthem, Paraguayans threw a huge street party to celebrate the 
president's surprise resignation and, they hoped, the end of a 
violent political crisis. Some 60,000 people shot fireworks and 
honked horns late Sunday in an outpouring of joy in the same plaza 
that last week saw bloody riots between supporters and opponents of 
outgoing President Raul Cubas. ``The violence has come to an end 
and so has the fear,'' the jubilant new president, Luis Gonzalez 
Macchi, said after receiving the gold scepter and sash Sunday night 
during his inauguration at the pink-stuccoed parliament.

	India Earthquake Kills 51  
</P>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- At least 51 people are reportedly dead  
in a severe earthquake that struck India's Himalayan foothills 
early Monday. India's seismological department measured the quake 
at a magnitude of 6.8, which it described as powerful enough to be 
``severe and damaging.'' It lasted close to 40 seconds. The 
epicenter was in a remote area of the Kumaon hills in the state of 
Uttar Pradesh, about 75 miles east of the city of Dehra Dun and 185 
miles from New Delhi.

	Yeltsin Scorns NATO Actions

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Extending a simmering dispute, Russian  
President Boris Yeltsin will tell the Russian parliament Tuesday 
that NATO's ``strong-arm'' tactics in Yugoslavia are unacceptable. 
But he will also reaffirm his commitment to sharp reductions in 
nuclear weapons arsenals and to ``constructive cooperation'' with 
the United States. In a state-of-the-nation message, the Russian 
leader again blasts the bombing of Serbs as a violation of 
international law standards. The use of force in Kosovo and also in 
Iraq is ``dangerous and inadmissible,'' Yeltsin says, according to 
portions of his prepared speech.

bank was finalized in November, Wells has been reluctant to

natural attrition could take care of most of the job cuts, which

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Confirms Reorganization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- After weeks of rumors, Microsoft Corp. confirmed  
plans to reorganize its business, focusing on customer groups and 
needs rather than products and technology, Chairman Bill Gates and 
President Steve Ballmer said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This new structure is part of the reinvention of Microsoft,''  
Ballmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer software giant has been organized to meet the needs  
of today ``but not those of the next decade,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone news conference, Gates and Ballmer insisted the  
move had nothing to do with the ongoing federal antitrust trial 
against Microsoft in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no relation whatsoever,'' Gates said. ``It has nothing  
to do with any lawsuits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nor does the move indicate that Microsoft would agree to break  
itself up in settlement negotations that resume this week, Ballmer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's certainly no breakup of this company into smaller  
companies that I would find acceptable, and we're certainly not in 
any way thinking of that as a possibility,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Gates said, the move is driven by competitive pressure  
and an expansion of the company's original vision of a computer on 
every desk and in every home. 
</P>
<P>
	The change will be largely invisible to computer users in the  
short run, except for ``a little extra zing in our step, a little 
extra assist, some new ideas, some new thoughts,'' Ballmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not designed to sort of address some a short-term  
issue,'' Gates said. ``It's really about preparing us for the long 
run ... make us more nimble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move also should have no effect on overall employment, the  
executives said. Slightly less than half of Microsoft's work force 
may be in line for some change in responsibility or job structure. 
</P>
<P>
	New groups within Microsoft under the reorganization are:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Business and Enterprise Division, which will focus on software  
for information technology customers. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Consumer Windows Division, which will focus on developing  
Windows for the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Business Productivity Group, which will focus on products for  
``knowledge'' workers. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Developer Group, which will focus on software developers. It  
will be led by Paul Maritz, who has overseen nearly all software 
development at the company. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Consumer and Commerce Group, which includes the Microsoft  
Network, will focus on bringing together consumers and businesses 
online. The division will be jointly headed by Brad Chase, a top 
marketing manager who masterminded the launch of Windows 95 and 
Internet Explorer, and Jon DeVaan, who has overseen development of 
Microsoft Office. 
</P>
<P>
	The divisions will manage their own internal functions, but may  
share some planning and marketing efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also created a home and retail products division to  
operate outside the core business divisions and focus on 
consumer-oriented products such as games, input devices and 
reference products. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Microsoft rose $3, or 3 percent, to close at $92.12 1/2  
on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Lockheed Martin To Cut 1,200 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Lockheed Martin Astronautics will cut 1,200 jobs  
by the end of the year, including 30 percent of its management 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronautics, one of the operating units of Lockheed Martin's  
Space &AMP; Strategic Missiles Sector, designs and manufactures systems 
for space and defense, including space launch systems and ground 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan to cut 1,200 jobs includes 300 that already have been  
dropped through attrition and amounts to about 10 percent of the 
total work force at the Denver-based facility. 
</P>
<P>
	The management positions will be eliminated by the end of June,  
and the remaining job cuts will be phased in by the end of the 
year, the company said. Some workers are expected to take advantage 
of the company's voluntary layoff policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Other cost-cutting initiatives include property consolidation,  
asset reductions and initiatives that will streamline production, 
manufacturing and engineering processes, said Astronautics 
President Raymond S. Colladay. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has placed its headquarters building near Denver on  
the market and intends to consolidate operations at its Waterton 
facilities, southwest of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin, based in Bethesda, Md., employs more than  
165,000 people worldwide and had 1998 sales of more than $26

<HEADLINE> Four Teens Killed in Texas Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABILENE, Texas (AP) -- Four teen-age girls were shot to death and  
a man was wounded at a duplex Monday evening, and authorities were 
searching for a car seen speeding from the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	The man was found in the driveway and the other victims were  
inside, detective Jay Hatcher said. The wounded man's condition was 
not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatcher described the scene as ``very, very gruesome'' and said  
it appeared some of the women might have been trying to escape. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very, very sad fact to have happened to four people at  
such a young age,'' Hatcher said. The ages were not immediately 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had no motive and no suspects late Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Police at the scene said they were looking for a car, but had  
few other details. Residents said violence is nothing new in their 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Rhone, who lives just a few houses away from the crime  
scene, told the Abilene Reporter-News that the group of duplex 
apartments have housed problems ever since she moved to the area 13 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they would knock down those apartments, it would be a  
better area,'' she said. ``My kids can't even play in their front 
yard because I'm afraid they'll get shot.''

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Show McDougal TV Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Kenneth Starr's prosecutors sought  
Monday to challenge key testimony by Susan McDougal, showing jurors 
a 1996 TV interview in which she made no mention of allegations 
she'd been pressured to say she had an affair with Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	As Mrs. McDougal's Whitewater-related criminal contempt trial  
entered its fourth week, prosecutors rolled a videotape for a jury 
in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowhere in the several hours of out-takes from the ABC interview  
did Mrs. McDougal refer in any way to the most sensational 
testimony so far in her trial. She testified that her ex-husband, 
who has since died, asked her in 1996 around the time of the ABC 
interview to say that she had an affair with Clinton as a way of 
helping Starr's office ``get'' Clinton before the presidential 
election. James McDougal had alleged that his former wife had an 
affair with Clinton during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	After playing the videotape, prosecutor Mark Barrett got Mrs.  
McDougal to admit differences between Mrs. McDougal's 1996 
interview with ABC and what she says now. She conceded she made no 
mention in the TV interview of her ex-husband trying out various 
fabricated stories with her that he was planning to tell Starr's 
office. She also conceded that in the TV interview she didn't 
mention being pressured by her ex-husband to say she'd had an 
affair with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, she testified that McDougal had tried out various  
scenarios that implicated President Clinton in a fraudulent 
$300,000 loan. She says she never discussed the loan with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ABC interview, Mrs. McDougal referred to the possibility  
that she would be talking to prosecutors soon, even though she 
refused just five days later to answer any of their questions. In 
one out-take, she turned to an ABC producer off-camera and said 
that first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's role in a real estate 
development called Castle Grande near Little Rock was the kind of 
topic that she could talk about with prosecutors, but not on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal told ABC she had been subpoenaed by Starr's  
office, but she had not decided whether to answer the questions. 
She said she feared Starr's office would retaliate against her if 
she didn't give evidence that implicated the Clintons in 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Riddled with fraudulent transactions, Castle Grande failed at a  
cost to Jim and Susan McDougal's federally insured savings and loan 
of nearly $4 million. Mrs. Clinton prepared a real estate document 
that was used to deceive federal regulators who were looking into 
sham transactions at Castle Grande. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Bobby McDaniel, was furious over the ABC  
interview broadcast on Aug. 30, 1996, saying ABC producer Chris 
Vlasto had gone behind McDaniel's back to get it. Vlasto says Mrs. 
McDougal contacted him to say she was ready to ``tell all.'' In a 
Wall Street Journal article that has come up repeatedly in Mrs. 
McDougal's trial, Vlasto wrote that Mrs. McDougal bowed to the 
wishes of her brother, Bill Henley, and her fiance, Pat Harris, in 
refusing to answer questions about whether Clinton knew of the 
fraudulent $300,000 loan.

<HEADLINE> Rules Push Thousands Off Welfare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tens of thousands of Americans have lost  
welfare benefits, not because they are working and escaping 
poverty, but because they have broken tough new rules. 
</P>
<P>
	From state to state, the power to punish is being wielded quite  
differently. A 50-state Associated Press survey found that in some 
states it rarely is used, but in others it accounts for half the 
people who are leaving welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was never like that before,'' said Sharon Pedersen of  
Denison, Iowa, who was dropped from welfare last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the time limits expected to end government aid for  
millions of poor people have had little effect in the 13 states 
where the clock has run out. 
</P>
<P>
	Time limits and penalties, together with work requirements, were  
the pillars of the 1996 welfare overhaul. Under the old system, 
Americans got help as long as they were poor enough, and states 
severely were restricted in cutting off checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Time have changed.  
</P>
<P>
	States now are allowed -- even encouraged -- to cut assistance for  
anyone who does not follow their rules. Even if they do cooperate, 
people can get help for only five years -- less time in the 22 
states with shorter time limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1994, the number of Americans on welfare has dropped 44  
percent, due partly to the strong economy, but also to states' 
aggressive punishments. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kentucky, 58 percent of the people who leave welfare are  
pushed off because they do not follow rules. In California and 
Illinois, nearly half those leaving welfare are being punished; 
that comes to tens of thousands each month. 
</P>
<P>
	States punish people not only for failing to participate in work  
programs but also for mundane offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, 57 percent of those who left welfare last year were  
removed because they did not keep appointments or failed to 
``provide complete information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Arizona, 60 percent are taken off welfare because they do not  
appear for a welfare interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those people are just disappearing, and we don't know at this  
point if it is because they did get employment or if they're going 
to local charities,'' said Vince Wood, who runs Arizona's program. 
</P>
<P>
	Other officials argue that recipients make the choice.  
</P>
<P>
	``We do hold our participants accountable,'' said Ann Wiebers of  
Iowa, where 47 percent of people leaving welfare are being 
punished. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Pedersen, 38, found that out when Iowa cut her $364 monthly  
check after she missed two appointments to discuss her case. First, 
she said, she missed an appointment because she was sick; then, 
during a power failure, her alarm did not ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedersen was on welfare once before years earlier, and reapplied  
after losing her job last summer. She read about the new, tougher 
rules but did not think officials actually would cut her off. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been really stressful,'' she said. She hopes her former  
employer, a nursing home, will rehire her. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts believe those punished fall into two groups: people  
already working or supporting themselves who choose not to follow 
rules; and those with lives so off-balance they cannot keep it 
together and cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates for the poor worry about the second group.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a danger that they simply disappear, and the ability  
to work with them and help address problems gets lost,'' said Mark 
Greenberg of the Center for Law and Social Policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Some states punish few people: just 10 percent leaving welfare  
in Nebraska and Maryland were being punished. Also, a few states, 
including Minnesota, Maine and North Dakota, simply reduce payments 
if welfare recipients do not follow rules. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oregon, before someone is dropped, a state worker visits the  
family to ensure the parent understands the ramifications of not 
cooperating. The worker must report on the family's prospects if 
welfare is cut and take steps to safeguard the children. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 1 percent of those leaving welfare have been punished, said  
Michael Buckley, spokesman for the state welfare department. 
</P>
<P>
	``We usually are able to convince the person it makes more sense  
for them to cooperate,'' Buckley said. Still, those on welfare have 
dropped 62 percent since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, state time limits surprisingly have had a small  
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	In many cases, states are giving extensions to people who try to  
play by the rules. States also are exempting many from time limits 
altogether because they face tough problems. 
</P>
<P>
	In essence, with the number of people on welfare at a 30-year  
low, states flush with cash can afford to be flexible. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina, for instance, put just 7,800 of its nearly  
100,000 welfare families on the clock but only 312 were kicked off 
when time limits expired last July. 
</P>
<P>
	In Louisiana, where time limits began expiring in January, the  
state gave extensions to more than half of families. In Tennessee, 
5,000 families initially hit the limit, but the state exempted 
2,800 and gave extensions to 1,400 others. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, just 97 of 925 people who ran out of time were cut  
off. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been dropped in Nebraska or Oregon, although time  
limits have begun expiring. In Texas, Arizona and Indiana, families 
only lose part of their grant. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates warn it will be tougher to maintain generous policies  
when the federal, five-year limit takes effect in a few years. At 
that point, states can exempt just 20 percent of people on welfare. 
Beyond that, they cannot use federal money for anyone on more than 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	It will also be tougher if the economy turns sour.  
</P>
<P>
	Then, policies like Connecticut's -- where 64 percent either are  
exempt from time limits or have extensions -- may disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	``The program operates under the idea that everyone can work,''  
said the state's Claudette Beaulieu. But it is different if someone 
is illiterate, has no work history or has mental health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can make that judgment that this person is exempt, because  
it is very unlikely anyone would hire them.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Duke's quest for a third national  
title under Mike Krzyzewski ended for the second straight season in 
St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils blew a 17-point lead in losing to eventual  
national champion Kentucky 86-84 in the South Regional final at 
Tropicana Field a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday night's 77-74 loss to Connecticut also denied  
Krzyzewski's bid to move past North Carolina's Dean Smith into a 
second-place tie for most Final Four wins. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA's John Wooden, who won 10 NCAA championships, is the  
all-time leader with 21 victories in national semifinal and title 
games. Rupp won nine and Krzyzewski and Smith are tied with eight 
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DON'T PANIC:* Connecticut improved to 10-0 when trailing at the  
half. Duke lost for the first time after going 34-0 after leading 
at the break. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STAR WATCHING:* The crowd of 41,340 at Tropicana Field,  
equaling the largest to ever watch a basketball game in the state 
of Florida, included Wooden, Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, New York 
Yankees pitcher Roger Clemens, one-time Duke stars Christian 
Laettner and Grant Hill and former UConn star Ray Allen. The same 
attendance figure was announced for Saturday's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OOPS:* With just under seven minutes remaining and Connecticut  
leading 65-63, CBS displayed a graphic showing timeouts remaining 
for Duke and Michigan State, the Blue Devils' opponent in the 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GREAT RIDE:* Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun rode Khalid El-Amin  
all the way to the national championship. The ride wasn't always 
smooth, though. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to describe what it was like to coach the sophomore guard,  
Calhoun compared the experience to being on a giant roller coaster. 
</P>
<P>
	``The great thing is we always end up at the top,'' the coach  
said. ``Like any emotional person, and I don't know anybody like 
him that's real emotional, I relate a lot to how he is, what he 
does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin didn't take exception to the description.  
</P>
<P>
	``He meant that in a positive way. We're similar people in that  
we love to compete, love to win and that's what drives us,'' he 
said. ``That's the biggest thing, and the most important thing that 
we have in common.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LEAVING THE ACC BEHIND:* Duke is proud of being the first team  
to win all 16 of its games in the Atlantic Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Blue Devils didn't feel they were carrying a banner  
for the league in Monday night's national championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this time you can't ask a team to make a mission statement  
for anything else than what they've internalized the game for,'' 
Blue Devils coach Mike Krzyzewski said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are ultimately proud of being a member of the ACC. We think  
it's as good a conference as there is. We're going to concentrate 
on Duke. And that's the only way you win. You can only fight for 
one cause at a time.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *I'M PRETTY GOOD, TOO:* Much of the pregame hype focused on what  
Connecticut had to do stop Duke, particularly national player of 
the year Elton Brand. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Huskies' Richard Hamilton is an All-American, too, and  
Duke faced the challenge of trying to contain him. 
</P>
<P>
	If he knew of a way he could be stopped, Hamilton wasn't willing  
to share. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's no one way you can guard me,'' Hamilton said.  
</P>
<P>
	He added that his teammates make a defender's job even more  
difficult by setting screens and getting him the ball in positions 
that give him a good chance to score. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton led the Huskies with 27 points on 10-for-22 shooting.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *AM I DREAMING?:* During a break in preparation for the title  
game, Connecticut's Kevin Freeman took time to reflect on how much 
it meant to him to be playing in the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sitting in the player's lounge and remembered back in  
middle school,'' he said. ``I used to beg my mom to let me stay up 
and watch the games on TV. It's a dream we get to live out. We have 
40 minutes to live out the dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NO REAL LOSER:* Augusta, Ga., the hometown of Duke's William  
Avery and Connecticut's Ricky Moore, couldn't lose Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever happens, each guy will be happy for the other. Both  
of us have had great years and just special seasons,'' Avery said. 
``I'll be happy for him. He'll be happy for me.''

<HEADLINE>  US Affirms Need for Yugo Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton worked to maintain allied  
support for the broadening air offensive in the fight to stop 
atrocities in Kosovo, while Pentagon officials declared the loss of 
an F-117A stealth fighter would not affect the aerial campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, before another round of strikes began, Clinton met  
with his national security team, and his advisers made the rounds 
on talk shows to affirm the need for stepping up the NATO assault 
to target Yugoslav military forces. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon said more American warplanes, including four of the  
B-52 long-range bombers, were joining the nearly 200 planes already 
participating in Operation Allied Force. Six to 12 U.S. planes were 
being added, along with 12 more fighters and light bombers from 
Britain, said spokesman Ken Bacon. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen told NBC's ``Meet the Press''  
that the loss of the F-117A stealth fighter over Yugoslavia would 
not affect the assault. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll have no impact,'' he said. ``We are going to continue  
this air campaign. It'll be intensified. We are going to move into 
a wider array of targets, including not only those dealing with 
command-and-control structures, ammunition dumps, but also start to 
go after the forces in the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO airstrikes were launched Wednesday after Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic refused to sign on to a peace 
agreement with the majority ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, a province 
of Serbia, which is in turn the main republic of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen denied the NATO attacks were responsible for the increased  
killings and repression in Kosovo, which caused 6,000 ethnic 
Albanian refugees to stream into nearby Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bloodbath has been under way for some time,'' Cohen said.  
</P>
<P>
	And when Clinton, on his way to Camp David, was asked whether he  
believed the airstrikes have only made matters worse, he replied, 
``Absolutely not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The continued brutality and repression of the Serb forces  
further underscores the need for NATO to persevere,'' the president 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he had discussed the NATO mission again with  
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, French President Jacques Chirac, 
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Italian Prime Minister 
Massimo D'Alema within the previous 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of them share our determination to respond strongly to Mr.  
Milosevic's continuing campaign of inhumane violence against the 
Kosovar Albanian people,'' Clinton said. ``That is what we intend 
to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
that although D'Alema previously expressed reservations, there was 
``absolute unanimity'' that the air campaign should be intensified. 
To ensure that unity continues, Clinton told each leader he would 
``stay in close touch'' in coming days, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the Pentagon nor NATO commented officially on what  
caused the Air Force F-117A stealth fighter-bomber to crash 
Saturday 30 miles northwest of Belgrade. A senior defense official, 
speaking on condition of anonymity, said there are strong 
indications the F-117A was hit by a surface-to-air missile, 
possibly the Soviet-made SA-3 air defense missile. The Washington 
Post, citing Pentagon officials, reported today that it was indeed 
an SA-3 that struck the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	No mechanical problems were reported, but an explosion was  
heard, the official said. NATO officials, without referring to the 
F-117A, said SA-3 missiles were fired Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brig. Gen. William Lake, commander of the 49th Fighter Wing at  
Holloman Air Force Base, N.M., said he would not conclude that the 
bomber was shot down, because there are ``a vast degree and array 
of minor things that could lead to this, particularly in a combat 
arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials, he added, were not overly concerned that the  
Serbs might glean useful information from the wreckage. ``I'm not 
so sure that anybody can really do a whole lot with what they're 
going to find in a pile of rubble,'' Lake said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake declined to identify the rescued pilot, except to say he  
was in good condition at Aviano Air Base in Italy. The pilot whose 
name was visible on a piece of the wreckage, Air Force Capt. Ken 
Dwelle, did not fly the mission. Interviewed in New Mexico, Dwelle 
said he knew the rescued pilot, but he also declined to identify 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake said the pilot has talked with his wife since his rescue  
and said it will be largely up to the flier to decide when he is 
ready for combat again. 
</P>
<P>
	``You gotta get back on the horse and you gotta ride,'' Lake  
said this morning on NBC's ``Today,'' adding that he himself had to 
eject from a crippled plane 17 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Without specifically mentioning the lost plane, Clinton said he  
expected the dangers that American pilots encounter will increase 
as the mission broadens. ``From the outset I have said to the 
American people that this military operation entails real risks,'' 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Denies Losses in War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- Eritrea today dismissed Ethiopian  
claims that it had suffered massive losses during a month of 
fighting in the two Horn of Africa nations' border war. 
</P>
<P>
	An Ethiopian government spokeswoman had said Sunday that 45,000  
Eritrean troops had been killed, wounded or captured and 77 tanks 
destroyed in fighting on three different fronts between Feb. 23 and 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The official Eritrean news agency, Erina, quoted an unnamed  
senior government official today calling the claims ``a complete 
sham.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ethiopian claims could not be independently verified, like  
most of the large casualty claims made repeatedly by both sides 
since the war began in May. The two countries are fighting over 
areas of their barren 600-mile border, which was not clearly 
demarcated when Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	In her statement, Selome said that 13,700 Eritrean soldiers were  
killed, wounded or captured and two artillery pieces were captured 
in a failed offensive last week to recapture the Badme region, 
which Eritrea lost to Ethiopia last month. 
</P>
<P>
	She said that on March 19 Ethiopia had mounted an offensive on  
two fronts in the central part of the border, killing 9,000 
Eritrean troops and capturing three artillery pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	In both countries, journalists have mostly been barred from  
front lines, making verification of victory claims difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	Eritrea took journalists to the Tsorona front, along the central  
part of the border, 60 miles south of the Eritrean capital Asmara, 
after claiming to have killed 10,000 Ethiopian in a three-day 
battle that ended March 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethiopia denied Eritrea's claim as ``drama staged for the  
benefit of journalists,'' but reporters who toured a portion of the 
battlefield near Tsorona said they saw hundreds of bodies of 
Ethiopian soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	After Ethiopia captured the Badme border post in a February  
battle, Eritrea acknowledged the defeat and accepted a peace plan 
proposed by the Organization of African Unity that required 
belligerents to withdraw from areas occupied by force after May 6, 
1998. Ethiopia had already accepted the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	But since then, neither country has made a move towards  
implementing a cease-fire to put the talks in motion.

<HEADLINE>  US Affirms Need for Yugo Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton worked to maintain allied  
support for the broadening air offensive in the fight to stop 
atrocities in Kosovo, while Pentagon officials declared the loss of 
an F-117A stealth fighter would not affect the aerial campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, before another round of strikes began, Clinton met  
with his national security team, and his advisers made the rounds 
on talk shows to affirm the need for stepping up the NATO assault 
to target Yugoslav military forces. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon said more American warplanes, including four of the  
B-52 long-range bombers, were joining the nearly 200 planes already 
participating in Operation Allied Force. Six to 12 U.S. planes were 
being added, along with 12 more fighters and light bombers from 
Britain, said spokesman Ken Bacon. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen told NBC's ``Meet the Press''  
that the loss of the F-117A stealth fighter over Yugoslavia would 
not affect the assault. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll have no impact,'' he said. ``We are going to continue  
this air campaign. It'll be intensified. We are going to move into 
a wider array of targets, including not only those dealing with 
command-and-control structures, ammunition dumps, but also start to 
go after the forces in the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO airstrikes were launched Wednesday after Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic refused to sign on to a peace 
agreement with the majority ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, a province 
of Serbia, which is in turn the main republic of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen denied the NATO attacks were responsible for the increased  
killings and repression in Kosovo, which caused 6,000 ethnic 
Albanian refugees to stream into nearby Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bloodbath has been under way for some time,'' Cohen said.  
</P>
<P>
	And when Clinton, on his way to Camp David, was asked whether he  
believed the airstrikes have only made matters worse, he replied, 
``Absolutely not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The continued brutality and repression of the Serb forces  
further underscores the need for NATO to persevere,'' the president 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he had discussed the NATO mission again with  
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, French President Jacques Chirac, 
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Italian Prime Minister 
Massimo D'Alema within the previous 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of them share our determination to respond strongly to Mr.  
Milosevic's continuing campaign of inhumane violence against the 
Kosovar Albanian people,'' Clinton said. ``That is what we intend 
to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
that although D'Alema previously expressed reservations, there was 
``absolute unanimity'' that the air campaign should be intensified. 
To ensure that unity continues, Clinton told each leader he would 
``stay in close touch'' in coming days, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the Pentagon nor NATO commented officially on what  
caused the Air Force F-117A stealth fighter-bomber to crash 
Saturday 30 miles northwest of Belgrade. A senior defense official, 
speaking on condition of anonymity, said there are strong 
indications the F-117A was hit by a surface-to-air missile, 
possibly the Soviet-made SA-3 air defense missile. The Washington

<HEADLINE> EU OKs Ford Purchase of Volvo Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union antitrust authorities  
Monday announced they have cleared Ford Motor Co.'s $6.45 billion 
purchase of the passenger car division of Swedish automaker Volvo 
AB. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the European Commission said there is overlap  
between the two companies in the executive and sports car sectors. 
However it said the overlap was small and the strength of 
competitors meant the operation will not create an unfairly 
dominant position. 
</P>
<P>
	``The position of other well-established competitors such as BMW  
and General Motors remains unaffected,'' the Commission said. 
``These competitors will be able to limit the effect of the 
concentration. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said Ford-Volvo's share of the passenger car  
market within the European Economic Area will not exceed 15 
percent. The EEA comprises the 15 EU nations plus Norway, Iceland 
and Liechtenstein. 
</P>
<P>
	``The merger is not likely to increase entry barriers in the  
passenger car market or any distinct part of it,'' the Commission 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced in January combines Ford, the world's  
second-largest automaker with Volvo, ranked 22nd. Ford employs 
about 364,000 people worldwide, Volvo 80,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo shareholders approved the deal March 8 at the company's  
headquarters in Goteborg, Sweden.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Fans Delight in National Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Baseball fans here delighted in the result of  
Cuba's exhibition game with the Baltimore Orioles, saying that even 
though their beloved team lost, it proved it could play with major 
leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	They hope for more such games, and ultimately a warming of  
relations between Washington and Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great show,'' said Raul Garcia, 40, a mechanic. ``Let  
the other teams come. Let the Yankees come!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia was one of about 150 people who gathered Monday under the  
trees in Havana's Central Park, joining a traditional, ongoing 
sports debate that normally draws a dozen or two people. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in this country of 11 million people followed Sunday's game  
on TV or radio. 
</P>
<P>
	``Excellent Game, Victory for Baseball,'' the Communist Party  
workers' newspaper, Trabajadores, trumpeted in its Monday story 
about the match. 
</P>
<P>
	The goodwill game between the Orioles and selected Cuban players  
proved ``that it is possible to have exchanges to develop a 
relationship between the two countries,'' Ricardo Alarcon, 
president of parliament, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how many baseball games we will have to carry out  
until we arrive at that point,'' Alarcon said. ``But if it takes 
many games, I hope we will win more games than we lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than anything, the game proved to Cubans that their players  
can compete against the highly paid professionals in the majors. 
For the past 40 years, the Cubans always said their players were 
just as good, but often they really weren't sure. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time a major league team played in Cuba was in March  
1959, three months after the triumph of the revolution that brought 
Fidel Castro to power. The Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Cincinnati 
Reds in that exhibition match. 
</P>
<P>
	Alarcon insisted that in Sunday's game, ``both teams won''  
because they were tied 2-2 at the end of the ninth inning and Cuba 
only lost 3-2 after the game went into extra innings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles, with a projected payroll in excess of $80 million  
payroll, barely squeezed past a team of amateurs who earn an 
average of $10 a month. The Cubans outhit the Orioles, 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
	The importance of the game to Cuba was demonstrated by the  
presence of Castro, himself a former player. He watched the match 
from the first row behind home plate, sitting between commissioner 
Bud Selig and Orioles owner Peter Angelos, who first broached the 
idea of the game three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The game, said Alarcon, ``reflected the possibilities that can  
exist between two countries to have normal fruitful, peaceful 
interchanges, when based on mutual respect.''

<HEADLINE>  Saudis Keep Watch on Hajj </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINA, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Hundreds of policemen shouting ``Move  
on, pilgrim!'' directed a sea of Muslims hurling pebbles today at 
three pillars symbolizing the devil in a closing ritual of the 
Islamic hajj. 
</P>
<P>
	The security forces in light green and khaki uniforms directed  
pilgrims to a bridge that leads to the stone pillars standing in a 
row in the valley of Mina. 
</P>
<P>
	Loudspeakers strung across the area broadcast messages in  
English, Arabic and Urdu urging the white-robed pilgrims to avoid 
congestion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please perform the stoning and leave from the exit. Do not go  
back from the same way you came from,'' the announcement said as 
policemen showed the way toward an exit lane. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoning the devil, with pebbles approximately the size of  
chickpeas, symbolizes the rejection of Satan's temptations, in one 
of the final rituals of the hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca 
and Medina that all able-bodied Muslims are required to do once in 
a lifetime if they can afford it. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were taking extra efforts to keep traffic organized. Last  
year, incoming and exiting pilgrims milled in the same lane, which 
contributed to a stampede at the site that left 180 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very well prepared for this. Thankfully our  
organization ... has so far paid off. Hopefully we won't have any 
incidents,'' a Saudi security official said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 300 police stood near each pillar today to ensure that the  
pilgrims made way for the massive crush behind. Periodically, they 
shouted ``yalla, ya hajj'' in Arabic or ``move on, pilgrim!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many threw the pebbles standing in the shade under a nearby  
bridge. The crowd surged back and forth or left and right in waves 
as people tried to move closer to the pillars. 
</P>
<P>
	A few fell, mostly elderly and women, but were quickly picked up  
by their companions. Helicopters hovered overhead. 
</P>
<P>
	After the stoning, pilgrims go to the holy city of Mecca, six  
miles to the south. There they circle the large cubic stone, the 
Kaaba, and end their hajj. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd was thinner today than Sunday, when the stoning ritual  
began. Many of the 1.7 million Muslims who came from all over the 
world had left today or were packed to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	But some were still shaken by the crowds.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think I am very fortunate to get out of this alive,'' said  
Ahmed Belloumi, an Algerian, after completing the stoning ritual. 
</P>
<P>
	Belloumi said he was exhausted by the time he reached the first  
pillar. ``God gave me the strength to stone the remaining two and 
here I am heading to the final circling of Kaaba,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, 2.3 million pilgrims participated and the drop this  
year was attributed to the economic turmoil in southeast Asia and 
the financial crunch in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheer numbers have led to other tragedies in the past. In  
1997, fire tore through a tent city at Mina, killing 340 pilgrims 
and injuring 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi officials said the pilgrims made 70 million telephone  
calls this year and workers picked up 750 tons of garbage. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 45,000 personnel were mobilized to deal with the  
pilgrims, including security troops, caterers and medical teams. 
</P>
<P>
	With temperatures during much of the pilgrimage reaching 106  
degrees, heat exhaustion cases kept medical workers busy.

<HEADLINE> Webber Releaed After Flu Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Sacramento Kings forward Chris Webber  
was released from a local hospital Monday after being treated 
overnight for the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings' leading scorer was admitted to University Medical  
Center late Sunday. Tests showed he was suffering from a severe flu 
virus, and he was administered fluids intravenously. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chris is obviously very ill. Up until now, he has been able to  
play through some sickness and injuries,'' said Geoff Petrie, the 
Kings vice president for basketball operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have played a lot of games in a short period of time  
against high-quality opponents, and he has played a lot of minutes 
in those games. So it is just a matter of the flu bug catching up 
with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Webber, averaging a team-leading 20 points and a league-leading  
13 rebounds a game, did not play when the Kings' lost to Houston on 
Sunday, and his status for games Tuesday and Wednesday is 
uncertain.

<HEADLINE>  Rogers Won't Start A's Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Needing more time to rebuild his arm strength  
after a bout of elbow tendinitis, Kenny Rogers on Monday was ruled 
out as the Oakland Athletics' opening night starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Art Howe said he hasn't decided who will start against  
Roger Clemens and the defending World Series champion New York 
Yankees next Monday night. The most likely are Jimmy Haynes and Tom 
Candiotti, who like Rogers has lost pitching time this spring due 
to injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers, a former Yankee who led the A's in wins last season with  
16, has missed about half of spring training because of soreness in 
his left elbow caused by a bone spur. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors examined him and told him he could pitch once the  
inflammation subsided, but he has made only three spring outings, 
most recently Friday, when he threw three innings against the San 
Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Howe said last week he had no doubt Rogers would be able to make  
his first scheduled start, but Rogers met with Howe and pitching 
coach Rick Peterson on Sunday and said he hadn't had enough time to 
prepare. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them point blank I'm not ready to pitch,'' Rogers said.  
``I think they knew. I guess they were just waiting for me to tell 
them. You always want to throw on the hill every time you're 
supposed to, but it wouldn't help me if I went out there opening 
day, not being able to compete. It doesn't help the A's. I didn't 
feel I had a good shot to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under a revised rotation, Rogers will be pushed back to No. 4  
and will start April 9 at Seattle. He is expected to pitch about 
four innings against Anaheim on Tuesday and six innings during an 
intrasquad game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can get him out two more times before he actually  
pitches, it will only help,'' Howe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers was hesitant to commit to pitching April 9.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel OK, but when I just throw 45 pitches before my last  
start of the spring, I just don't feel that's enough,'' he said. 
``I need to be at a pitch count where if you're struggling through 
some innings, you've still got enough to get out of it. Having one 
more (spring) start may help. At least it will get me closer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Candiotti, who received a cortisone shot to relieve soreness in  
his left knee, hasn't pitched in a spring game since March 12 but 
has been throwing on the side for a week. He declined to comment on 
the possibility of starting the opener, saying the coaching staff 
hadn't approached him about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Haynes, who went 11-9 with a 5.09 ERA in his first full season  
in the majors last year, said he hasn't been approached either but 
would be ready if asked. 
</P>
<P>
	He took the possibility of facing the Cy Young Award-winning  
Clemens in stride. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, you have to face their No. 1 starter but sooner or later  
you're going to have to face a No. 1 starter anyway,'' Haynes said. 
``Things get mixed up and guys go different days during the season. 
That's why my approach is, you just have to go right after 'em. 
It's the first game of the season but you don't dwell on that.''

<HEADLINE>  Rogers Won't Start A's Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Needing more time to rebuild his arm strength  
after a bout of elbow tendinitis, Kenny Rogers on Monday was ruled 
out as the Oakland Athletics' opening night starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Art Howe said he hasn't decided who will start against  
Roger Clemens and the defending World Series champion New York 
Yankees next Monday night. The most likely are Jimmy Haynes and Tom 
Candiotti, who like Rogers has lost pitching time this spring due 
to injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers, a former Yankee who led the A's in wins last season with  
16, has missed about half of spring training because of soreness in 
his left elbow caused by a bone spur. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors examined him and told him he could pitch once the  
inflammation subsided, but he has made only three spring outings, 
most recently Friday, when he threw three innings against the San 
Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Howe said last week he had no doubt Rogers would be able to make  
his first scheduled start, but Rogers met with Howe and pitching 
coach Rick Peterson on Sunday and said he hadn't had enough time to 
prepare. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them point blank I'm not ready to pitch,'' Rogers said.  
``I think they knew. I guess they were just waiting for me to tell 
them. You always want to throw on the hill every time you're 
supposed to, but it wouldn't help me if I went out there opening 
day, not being able to compete. It doesn't help the A's. I didn't 
feel I had a good shot to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under a revised rotation, Rogers will be pushed back to No. 4  
and will start April 9 at Seattle. He is expected to pitch about 
four innings against Anaheim on Tuesday and six innings during an 
intrasquad game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can get him out two more times before he actually  
pitches, it will only help,'' Howe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers was hesitant to commit to pitching April 9.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel OK, but when I just throw 45 pitches before my last  
start of the spring, I just don't feel that's enough,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame May Have New BBall Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Notre Dame finally filled its basketball  
coaching vacancy Monday, reportedly hiring Kansas assistant Matt 
Doherty as its new coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame officials scheduled a 4 p.m. EST Tuesday news  
conference to name the new coach, but declined to say Monday who it 
is. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Fox Sports Net and television station WNDU reported Monday  
night that Doherty had been hired. 
</P>
<P>
	Doherty, 37, considered playing at Notre Dame but was recruited  
to play at North Carolina by then-Tar Heels assistant Roy Williams. 
The 6-foot-8 Doherty played forward on the 1982 national 
championship team with Michael Jordan and James Worthy. 
</P>
<P>
	After graduation, he worked as a government bond salesmen in New  
York City and later was a part-time analyst on the Davidson College 
basketball radio network. 
</P>
<P>
	Doherty was hired as an assistant coach at Davidson before the  
1989-90 season, serving there three years before coming to Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	During his seven seasons at Kansas, he has helped the Jayhawks  
sign eight McDonald's All-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzaga coach Dan Monson and Xavier coach Skip Prosser were  
thought to be frontrunners for the job after meeting with Notre 
Dame officials over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Delaware's Mike Brey, Siena's Paul Hewitt and Princeton's Bill  
Carmody all have interviewed with the Irish since MacLeod resigned 
under pressure March 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah coach Rick Majerus was considered the top candidate to take  
the job but dropped out last week amid reports that school 
administrators rejected his candidacy because he didn't fit the 
Notre Dame image.

<HEADLINE> Sund Wants Sightseer Killer To Die </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUREKA, Calif. (AP) -- Jens Sund says he feels no mercy for  
whoever killed his wife and daughter while the two visited Yosemite 
National Park with a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll personally pull the switch,'' Jens Sund told The (Santa  
Rosa) Press Democrat. ``I believe in capital punishment. And I 
believe whomever is responsible for this deserves to die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six weeks after the three women disappeared, the body of his  
15-year-old daughter, Julie, was discovered Thursday outside the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
	Sund's wife, Carole, was identified as one of two bodies found a  
week earlier in the trunk of their burned rental car, at a spot an 
hour away. The FBI says the second body likely is that of 
16-year-old family friend Silvina Pelosso, from Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been charged in the killings.  
</P>
<P>
	Breaking more than a week of silence, Sund said on Sunday that  
he finds it incomprehensible that his wife, who was dedicated to 
helping abused children avoid a life of crime, would end up a 
murder victim. 
</P>
<P>
	Sund said he was devastated when he was told that authorities  
had found the body of his wife, who he had known since they were 
high school sweethearts in Santa Rosa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though I had had weeks to expect the worst, it hit me  
very hard,'' Sund said. ``It's very difficult. Sometimes it's 
almost unbearable, but we have to go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I keep busy. There's cooking to do. Household chores to be  
done. I go to my office now and then,'' said Sund, who runs a 
commercial real estate office. ``But sometimes I feel like I'm just 
going through the motions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Julie, 15, was the eldest sister to three adopted siblings.  
</P>
<P>
	``That girl loved life from the very beginning,'' Sund said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sund discovered ``Juliana's Giant Scrapbook,'' brimming with  
teen-age memorabilia, in her room after the disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Julie was going to get somewhere,'' Sund said. ``She wanted to  
be an architect. She was a very determined young woman.''

<HEADLINE> NCAA Championship Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Whew! It's a good thing Duke lost a  
game during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	So says Blue Devils guard Trajan Langdon, who believes that the  
team's 77-75 loss to Cincinnati on Nov. 28 in the Great Alaska 
Shootout only made it stronger. 
</P>
<P>
	And anyway, the Blue Devils don't like to dwell on losing a  
chance for an undefeated season. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we had won that game, we might have lost two more during  
the year,'' Langdon said. ``We learned a great deal in losing ... 
and I think we responded great from that game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never talk about what we can't do, but what we can do.''  
</P>
<P>
	The last team that went undefeated throughout the entire season  
was Indiana (32-0) in 1976. The Hoosiers beat Michigan in the 
national final. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	GREAT RIDE:@ Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun rode Khalid El-Amin  
all the way to the national championship. The ride wasn't always 
smooth, though. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to describe what it was like to coach the sophomore guard,  
Calhoun compared the experience to being on a giant roller coaster. 
</P>
<P>
	``The great thing is we always end up at the top,'' the coach  
said. ``Like any emotional person, and I don't know anybody like 
him that's real emotional, I relate a lot to how he is, what he 
does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin didn't take exception to the description.  
</P>
<P>
	``He meant that in a positive way. We're similar people in that  
we love to compete, love to win and that's what drives us,'' he 
said. ``That's the biggest thing, and the most important thing that 
we have in common.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LEAVING THE ACC BEHIND:* Duke is proud of being the first team  
to win all 16 of its games in the Atlantic Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Blue Devils didn't feel they were carrying a banner  
for the league in Monday night's national championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this time you can't ask a team to make a mission statement  
for anything else than what they've internalized the game for,'' 
Blue Devils coach Mike Krzyzewski said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are ultimately proud of being a member of the ACC. We think  
it's as good a conference as there is. We're going to concentrate 
on Duke. And that's the only way you win. You can only fight for 
one cause at a time.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	I'M PRETTY GOOD, TOO:@ Much of the pregame hype focused on what  
Connecticut had to do stop Duke, particularly national player of 
the year Elton Brand. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Huskies' Richard Hamilton is an All-American, too, and  
Duke faced the challenge of trying to contain him. 
</P>
<P>
	If he knew of a way he could be stopped, Hamilton wasn't willing  
to share. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's no one way you can guard me,'' Hamilton said.  
</P>
<P>
	He added that his teammates make a defender's job even more  
difficult by setting screens and getting him the ball in positions 
that give him a good chance to score. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	AM I DREAMING?:@ During a break in preparation for the title  
game, Connecticut's Kevin Freeman took time to reflect on how much 
it meant to him to be playing in the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sitting in the player's lounge and remembered back in  
middle school,'' he said. ``I used to beg my mom to let me stay up 
and watch the games on TV. It's a dream we get to live out. We have 
40 minutes to live out the dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	NO REAL LOSER:@ Augusta, Ga., the hometown of Duke's William  
Avery and Connecticut's Ricky Moore, couldn't lose Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever happens, each guy will be happy for the other. Both  
of us have had great years and just special seasons,'' Avery said. 
``I'll be happy for him. He'll be happy for me.''

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Show McDougal TV Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Kenneth Starr's prosecutors today  
rolled a videotape of Susan McDougal discussing Whitewater with a 
TV network less than a week before refusing to testify to a federal 
grand jury about it. 
</P>
<P>
	With Mrs. McDougal's criminal contempt trial in federal court  
entering its fourth week, prosecutors are trying to show that she 
had no basis for refusing to answer their questions as they 
investigated President and Mrs. Clinton's actions in Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
	In the out-takes of the ABC interview on Aug. 30, 1996, Mrs.  
McDougal made clear she hated Starr's prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The devastation they have brought to people's lives is  
unbelievable,'' said Mrs. McDougal, who had been sentenced to two 
years in prison 10 days earlier for her four felony convictions 
regarding a fraudulent $300,000 loan that was used in part to 
bolster the Whitewater investment involving the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors ``have ruined lives and I so resent that,'' said  
Mrs. McDougal. ``It has made me a very bitter person toward the 
independent counsel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the TV taping, Mrs. McDougal knew she would be  
appearing before a grand jury in Starr's probe. She had been 
subpoenaed the same day she was sentenced. She declined to answer 
the grand jury's questions just five days after doing the ABC 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's lawyer at the time, Bobby McDaniel, was furious  
that she had done the TV interview, saying ABC producer Chris 
Vlasto had gone behind McDaniel's back to get it. Vlasto says it 
was Mrs. McDougal who contacted him to say she was prepared to 
``tell all.'' In a Wall Street Journal article that has come up 
repeatedly in Mrs. McDougal's trial, Vlasto wrote that Mrs. 
McDougal's brother, Bill, and her fiance, Pat Harris, stopped her 
from answering questions during the TV taping about whether Clinton 
knew of the fraudulent $300,000 loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Vlasto also quotes Mrs. McDougal as having told him ``I know  
where all the bodies are buried.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week on the witness stand, Mrs. McDougal denied that she'd  
ever said she knew where bodies were buried, but that she had seen 
her dead ex-husband, James McDougal, quoted as making such 
statements.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Takes Message to Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- U.S. software giant Microsoft is taking a  
campaign against software piracy straight to Singapore's 
schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft will try to change attitudes about software piracy by  
presenting its message to children as young as 13 in Singapore 
schools, company spokeswoman Irene Tan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll paint a very simple scenario,'' Tan said. ``It's like a  
kid's drawing is stolen by another kid, who puts his name on the 
first kid's drawing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft believes that students comprise about 30 percent of  
pirated software owners in the island republic, where the 
government aggressively promotes high technology and computer 
literacy, Television Corporation of Singapore reported. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey by A.C. Nielsen released last week showed use of  
illegally-copied software among Singapore's adult professionals was 
widespread and growing. 
</P>
<P>
	Low-price pirated CDs, video discs and CD-ROMS with computer  
software have been openly sold in street stalls and shopping 
centers in Singapore in recent years despite the country's 
reputation for strict law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Last May, the United States put Singapore on its watch list of  
32 countries where intellectual property rights are deemed 
endangered. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft calculates that it and other software developers lose  
about $32.7 million a year in the country of 3.7 million people 
because of pirated business software.

<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Trial Upsets Youk Family </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Terry Youk wanted the trial of Dr. Jack  
Kevorkian to center on the pain his brother suffered. Instead, he 
said, it focused on the definition of murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Youk said Sunday that Kevorkian's trial lost its focus because  
Circuit Judge Jessica Cooper refused to let him or Melody Youk, the 
widow of Thomas Youk, testify. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't able to give the jurors any kind of picture of who  
Tom was and what he was going through,'' Terry Youk told Time 
magazine in the issue that hits newsstands today. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian was convicted Friday of second-degree murder and  
delivery of a controlled substance in Youk's death. He is scheduled 
to be sentenced April 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian had argued during his trial that Youk's widow, Melody,  
and Youk's brother should be allowed to testify that they wanted 
Kevorkian to end Youk's suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cooper told Kevorkian, who was acting as his own lawyer,  
that he couldn't include such testimony because Michigan law 
doesn't recognize the consent of the victim as a defense to murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Youk told Time that his brother suffered from ``the kind  
of pain that medicine couldn't help.'' He said Thomas Youk told him 
that he didn't want to die, ``but I don't want to live like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Melody Youk added: ``He didn't want to become a prisoner in his  
own body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Oakland County Prosecutor John Skrzynski said  
Kevorkian had himself to blame for the conviction, saying that if 
he had ``not videotaped this, no one would have ever known it 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Youks say they continue to support Kevorkian. ``You have to  
put yourself in harm's way when you feel there's an unjust law,'' 
Terry Youk said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, prison officials say if Kevorkian goes on a hunger  
strike in prison, as he has threatened, they would use intravenous 
tubes to force feed him. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1997, Kevorkian and an associate said they would  
starve themselves to death in prison if ever convicted of assisting 
a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard said that if Kevorkian  
decides to go on a hunger strike, his health would be closely 
monitored. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't allow him to run this jail,'' Bouchard told The  
Detroit News in a story published Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Mom Accused of Killing Her 3 Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHEATON, Ill. (AP) -- A judge on Monday ordered a mental  
examination for a nurse accused of drugging and suffocating her 
three young children. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPage County Judge George J. Bakalis expressed doubts about  
Marilyn Lemak's ability to understand the murder charges against 
her. Mrs. Lemak, who has been under psychiatric care since her 
children's deaths, appears ``trance-like'' at court hearings, 
Bakalis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bakalis ordered Lemak's arraignment to be postponed  
indefinitely, and set an April 5 hearing. The actions set in motion 
a potentially lengthy process that could result in a trial to 
determine her competency. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors allege Mrs. Lemak, of Naperville, Ill., gave her  
children prescription drugs before putting them to bed March 4, 
then suffocated 7-year-old Nicholas, 6-year-old Emily and 
3-year-old Thomas Lemak with her hands as they slept. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say she slashed her right forearm during the course  
of the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lemak and her husband were in the midst of a divorce, and  
he had recently moved out of the family's home. Authorities have 
not disclosed a motive. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, she faces three counts of first-degree murder and six  
related charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lemak, 41, was gaunt Monday but appeared more alert than at  
previous hearings, where she had sat in a wheelchair with a vacant 
look in her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Jack Donahue said a defense psychiatrist has  
also expressed doubts about Mrs. Lemak's mental health and will 
submit a report to the court next week. The evaluation ordered by 
Bakalis is due within 30 days.

                           *Michael Aris    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Michael Aris, the husband of Myanmar opposition  
leader Aung San Suu Kyi, died on his 53rd birthday Saturday after 
being blocked by Myanmar's military government from visiting his 
wife in his final days. 
</P>
<P>
	Aris had prostate cancer that had spread to his spine and lungs.  
Myanmar's military government had rejected a visa request this 
month from the ailing Aris, who taught Tibetan studies at Oxford 
University's St. Anthony's College. 
</P>
<P>
	Aris had not been allowed to meet with his wife since the 1995  
Christmas season. The ban on his visits was apparently in 
retaliation for his carrying out a public statement from Suu Kyi. 
</P>
<P>
	The military government said Suu Kyi ought to leave the country  
and visit her husband in Britain, but the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize 
winner refused to leave Myanmar, also known as Burma, for fear the

nearly three decades, died March 11. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1955, Conant was hired by Photoplay magazine to shoot a cover

died Wednesday of pneumonia. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke was known for his work defending blacks and prosecuting  
those who carried out racially charged crimes. However, he was

</P>
<P>
	As an assistant solicitor for the state, Duke successfully  
convicted several members of the Ku Klux Klan for the flogging 
death of a black man. After Talmadge threatened to grant the men 
clemency, Duke waved the whips used in the crime in the governor's 
face. Talmadge relented.

<HEADLINE> Economy Helping Retirement Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The strong economy is helping Social Security  
and Medicare, possibly even postponing the day when the two 
retirement-benefit programs will run short of cash. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest indication of improvement, the programs' trustees  
were expected to predict in their annual reports a longer stretch 
of financial health than previously forecast. The reports were 
scheduled for release today. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts speculate the good news will make lawmakers  
contemplating changes to Social Security and Medicare this year 
feel less pressure to rush into any dramatic changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might give some impetus to the concept of a slower  
transition,'' said public policy researcher Marilyn Moon, one of 
two private citizens on the board of trustees for the retirement 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials, including Treasury Secretary  
Robert Rubin and Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, 
are among other trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the trustees predicted that Social Security's trust  
fund would have enough cash to assure retiring baby boomers three 
extra years of full pension benefits, postponing a potential cash 
shortfall to 2032 from 2029. 
</P>
<P>
	They attributed that improvement almost entirely to the strength  
of the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition last year, trustees postponed a similar day of  
financial reckoning for Medicare, the health insurance program for 
the elderly and disabled, to 2008 from the previously expected 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the strong economy and cost-cutting agreed to by lawmakers  
in the 1997 balanced budget act contributed to Medicare's 
improvement, the trustees said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since those optimistic reports a year ago, economic growth has  
continued robust. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment and inflation have hovered near the lowest levels  
in decades. Because more Americans are working, taxes deducted from 
workers' paychecks to support Social Security and Medicare are up. 
</P>
<P>
	Low inflation also saves both programs money because yearly  
Social Security cost-of-living raises to retirees can be smaller, 
and health care costs remain lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Social Security is the largest federal benefit program, sending  
checks to 44 million Americans. In addition to payments to 
retirees, Social Security also makes payments to disabled people 
and to the survivors of workers who die young. 
</P>
<P>
	Because most members of the huge baby boom generation -- people  
born from 1946 through 1964 -- are still working, Social Security 
now collects more payroll taxes than are needed to pay benefits to 
today's retirees. The surpluses are invested in government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The program will not need to start cashing in those investments  
until 2013, trustees say. At that time, baby boomers will have 
begun retiring, and it's projected that the taxes paid by those 
left in the work force won't cover baby boomers' benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare, which provides health coverage for 39 million elderly  
and disabled Americans, already is spending money from a dwindling 
trust fund to pay benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and Republicans in Congress have pledged to  
try to make changes aimed at strengthening both programs this year. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, however, little agreement exists about how best to do  
that. Among the options: adding more money from government 
surpluses or from tax increases, trimming benefits, raising the 
retirement age or partially privatizing the programs.

<HEADLINE> Dow Has First 10,000 Close / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average closed above  
10,000 for the first time Monday as news that several big mergers 
are in the works gave investors a surge of optimism and propelled 
the entire stock market sharply higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow shot up 184.54 to 10,006.78.  
</P>
<P>
	Monday's session marked the fifth time that the 103-year-old  
index had crossed 10,000, but it was the first time it had enough 
momentum to stay above five digits until the closing bell. Earlier 
this month, the Dow traded as high as 10,085.31, but profit-taking 
and concerns about upcoming first-quarter earnings reports brought 
the index back down. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street was buoyant Monday following news that Britain's BP  
Amoco is discussing a merger with rival oil company Atlantic 
Richfield, and that CBS is interested in King World, the producer 
of TV shows including ``Jeopardy'' and ``The Oprah Winfrey Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another report said drug makers Glaxo Wellcome and Bristol  
Myers-Squibb had discussed a deal, but called off the talks, an 
indication that Glaxo has renewed last year's search for a merger 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
	But that was just the immediate reason for today's advance. The  
Dow -- and the overall stock market -- has surged higher on eight 
years of U.S. economic growth, a boom in mutual fund investment, 
and, most recently, a boom in high technology and investor fixation 
with the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a moment to uncork the champagne and celebrate what a  
truly phenomenal bull market this has been,'' said Hugh Johnson, 
market strategist at First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's staying power was helped by an expansion of Wall  
Street's recent rally to a broader range of stocks -- it wasn't just 
the large, blue-chip companies that gained, but also smaller 
companies and lesser known names that rose today. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad market indexes also had big gains.  
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 26.87 to 1,309.67, and the  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 72.78 at 2,491.95. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,844 up, 1,141 down and 557 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 742.94 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
689.99 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 10.81 to 613.16, but the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.86 to 717.88. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Russell 2000 index, which reflects the performance of  
smaller companies, rose 5.84 to 399.76. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market certainly looks pretty strong on a broad basis,''  
said Ned Collins, a stock trader at Daiwa Securities America. ``The 
techs, the banks, insurance, brokers are all up. It's giving a 
pretty good accounting of itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks opened higher on news of potential corporate mergers that  
allowed traders to ignore a jump in interest rates and concerns 
about military action in Kosovo. The 30-year Treasury bond was down 
3/4 point, and its yield, which moves opposite the price, stood at 
5.64 percent, up from 5.59 percent Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also boosting prices were the sense that the market had seen the  
worst of first-quarter earnings confessionals, and investors' 
desire to put money to work in the stock market before the end of 
the quarter on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE>  Castro, Cubans Meet Major Leaguers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Clearly, Fidel Castro enjoyed the game, especially  
each time a Cuban player got a big hit. He also seemed to like the 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	So what exactly did the 73-year-old president and Baltimore  
Orioles owner Peter Angelos talk about for all 11 innings Sunday? 
</P>
<P>
	``He was asking questions with respect to salaries and how the  
game operates,'' Angelos said. ``He knows about some of the stars 
of the game. It was a very interesting experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, perhaps, a surprising one. The Orioles, with a payroll of  
more than $80 million, held on for a 3-2 win over a Cuban all-star 
team in which players earn about $10 per month. 
</P>
<P>
	Though several Orioles previously said this would be just  
another spring training game, it was obvious it meant far more as 
soon as Castro stepped on the field about 20 minutes before the 
first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fi-del! Fi-del!'' the 50,000 fans chanted at Estadio  
Latinoamericano at the sight of the former University of Havana 
right-hander. ``Cu-ba! Cu-ba!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albert Belle, Brady Anderson and the rest of the Orioles  
gathered around Castro to shake hands, curious to see how he looked 
up close in his olive combat fatigues. Manager Ray Miller talked to 
Castro through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me this was a good baseball town,'' Miller said. ``He  
said not to worry, that we were playing in front of the greatest 
baseball fans in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castro watched from a front-row seat behind home plate, flanked  
by Angelos and major league commissioner Bud Selig. The night 
before, Castro and Selig spoke at a reception. 
</P>
<P>
	``He talked about his career,'' Selig said. ``But in all honesty  
he didn't build himself up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Castro knew about big league stars -- Cuban defectors  
Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, Livan Hernandez and Rey Ordonez, 
among them -- he hadn't seen any big league teams for a long time 
because none had visited the Communist island since 1959. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody came down here looking to make history,'' Orioles  
outfielder B.J. Surhoff said. ``Everybody came down here looking to 
play a baseball game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Surhoff carried the U.S. flag onto the field for the  
national anthems and later gave his bat to the Hall of Fame in 
Cooperstown, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``For many years, we have been trying to have this match,'' star  
Cuban third baseman Omar Linares said through a translator. ``I 
really hope these will not be the last games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Cuban team, this one probably even stronger, will visit  
Baltimore's Camden Yards on May 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will open the door so there might be more games between  
the U.S. and Cuba,'' said Joel Valdez, 26, a scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	By local standards, this Cuban crowd was rather tame until the  
late innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Tickets were issued on an invitation-only basis -- instead of the  
10 cents they normally cost -- ensuring the stands would be packed 
with loyal Castro supporters. But that left out many of Cuba's most 
passionate ``pelota'' fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Missing were the drums, sirens, air horns, singing, dancing and  
rumba music that enveloped the ballpark from the first pitch during 
Saturday night's playoff game between the Havana Industriales and 
Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
	No cheerleaders in black spandex jumped on top of the dugouts,  
no ballgirls served coffee to the umpires during the fifth-inning 
break. No one smuggled in Havana Club rum, and no beer was offered 
inside, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the 53-year-old stadium was spruced up -- gone were the wild  
dogs that usually roam the concourse, hoping for bits of the 
pork-leg sandwiches sold at concession stands. 
</P>
<P>
	There was the traditional first ball. Former Washington Senators  
pitcher Connie Marrero, 88, threw four of them, then three more to 
Anderson when he led off the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Johnson's two-run homer off Cuban ace Jose Ibar in the  
second kept things quiet until the home team started its comeback. 
Castro grinned when Linares' RBI single in the eighth made it 
2-all. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was delighted when the game was tied,'' Angelos said.  
</P>
<P>
	The teams played beneath big outfield signs that proclaimed  
``Socialist Cuba Sports'' and ``Sports for the People.'' The 
billboards that preach ``Remember the Revolution'' and 
``Antimperialistas'' are on the road the Orioles took in from the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
	When the game ended, Castro made an ``oh, well'' gesture with  
his hands and later congratulated the Cuban players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he was a little disappointed,'' Angelos said.  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Castro, Cubans Meet Major Leaguers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Clearly, Fidel Castro enjoyed the game, especially  
each time a Cuban player got a big hit. He also seemed to like the 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	So what exactly did the 73-year-old president and Baltimore  
Orioles owner Peter Angelos talk about for all 11 innings Sunday? 
</P>
<P>
	``He was asking questions with respect to salaries and how the  
game operates,'' Angelos said. ``He knows about some of the stars 
of the game. It was a very interesting experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, perhaps, a surprising one. The Orioles, with a payroll of  
more than $80 million, held on for a 3-2 win over a Cuban all-star 
team in which players earn about $10 per month. 
</P>
<P>
	Though several Orioles previously said this would be just  
another spring training game, it was obvious it meant far more as 
soon as Castro stepped on the field about 20 minutes before the 
first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fi-del! Fi-del!'' the 50,000 fans chanted at Estadio  
Latinoamericano at the sight of the former University of Havana 
right-hander. ``Cu-ba! Cu-ba!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albert Belle, Brady Anderson and the rest of the Orioles  
gathered around Castro to shake hands, curious to see how he looked 
up close in his olive combat fatigues. Manager Ray Miller talked to 
Castro through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me this was a good baseball town,'' Miller said. ``He  
said not to worry, that we were playing in front of the greatest 
baseball fans in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castro watched from a front-row seat behind home plate, flanked  
by Angelos and major league commissioner Bud Selig. The night 
before, Castro and Selig spoke at a reception. 
</P>
<P>
	``He talked about his career,'' Selig said. ``But in all honesty  
he didn't build himself up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Castro knew about big league stars -- Cuban defectors  
Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, Livan Hernandez and Rey Ordonez, 
among them -- he hadn't seen any big league teams for a long time 
because none had visited the Communist island since 1959. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody came down here looking to make history,'' Orioles  
outfielder B.J. Surhoff said. ``Everybody came down here looking to 
play a baseball game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Surhoff carried the U.S. flag onto the field for the  
national anthems and later gave his bat to the Hall of Fame in 
Cooperstown, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``For many years, we have been trying to have this match,'' star  
Cuban third baseman Omar Linares said through a translator. ``I 
really hope these will not be the last games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Cuban team, this one probably even stronger, will visit  
Baltimore's Camden Yards on May 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will open the door so there might be more games between  
the U.S. and Cuba,'' said Joel Valdez, 26, a scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	By local standards, this Cuban crowd was rather tame until the  
late innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Tickets were issued on an invitation-only basis -- instead of the  
10 cents they normally cost -- ensuring the stands would be packed 
with loyal Castro supporters. But that left out many of Cuba's most 
passionate ``pelota'' fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Missing were the drums, sirens, air horns, singing, dancing and  
rumba music that enveloped the ballpark from the first pitch during 
Saturday night's playoff game between the Havana Industriales and 
Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
	No cheerleaders in black spandex jumped on top of the dugouts,  
no ballgirls served coffee to the umpires during the fifth-inning 
break. No one smuggled in Havana Club rum, and no beer was offered 
inside, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the 53-year-old stadium was spruced up -- gone were the wild  
dogs that usually roam the concourse, hoping for bits of the 
pork-leg sandwiches sold at concession stands. 
</P>
<P>
	There was the traditional first ball. Former Washington Senators  
pitcher Connie Marrero, 88, threw four of them, then three more to 
Anderson when he led off the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Johnson's two-run homer off Cuban ace Jose Ibar in the  
second kept things quiet until the home team started its comeback. 
Castro grinned when Linares' RBI single in the eighth made it 
2-all. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was delighted when the game was tied,'' Angelos said.  
</P>
<P>
	The teams played beneath big outfield signs that proclaimed  
``Socialist Cuba Sports'' and ``Sports for the People.'' The 
billboards that preach ``Remember the Revolution'' and 
``Antimperialistas'' are on the road the Orioles took in from the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
	When the game ended, Castro made an ``oh, well'' gesture with  
his hands and later congratulated the Cuban players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he was a little disappointed,'' Angelos said.  
</P>
<P>
	Once a Triple-A hotspot when the Havana Sugar Kings ruled, the  
Caribbean island had not seen a major league club since March 21, 
1959, right after Castro took power. On that day at the very same 
ballpark, guards strolled with machine guns while Sandy Koufax 
pitched Los Angeles past Cincinnati 2-1. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Electric Deregulation Report Issued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Electricity deregulation would cut rates for  
consumers in 26 states, but increase them in 19 other states, says 
a report made public Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department report doesn't say how much rates  
would go up, but says rural America would need a ``safety net'' 
ranging from $1 billion in 2000 to $2.4 billion in 2015 to offset 
the costs of competitive pricing. 
</P>
<P>
	The report predicts increased competition would lower rates for  
consumers in 26 states, mainly in the Southwest, Northeast and 
southern Plains, but the rates would go up in the Pacific 
Northwest, Mountain states, Mid-South and in the northern Plains, 
as well as in some Great Lakes states. The report focused on the 45 
states with rural electric cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen states have already moved toward opening their  
electricity markets. But efforts in Congress to enact deregulation 
legislation have bogged down in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration announced a deregulation plan last  
year that it said would save consumers $20 billion a year. It would 
call for open competition nationwide among electricity suppliers by 
2003 but would also let states ``opt out'' of the program if they 
believed competition would not help them. 
</P>
<P>
	While the report does not dispute the administration's view that  
it would save consumers $20 billion, it found the savings will be 
concentrated in some states, while consumers would face substantial 
costs in other states. 
</P>
<P>
	An Agriculture Department spokesman, Andrew Kauders, said the  
report was leaked before it was finished and that people should not 
draw conclusions from it. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., sent copies of the report to all  
Oregon legislators and urged them to resist a push for electricity 
deregulation. He wanted to release the report this week because an 
Oregon state Senate committee is expected to take up a bill that 
would advance deregulation, said Jeff Stier, a DeFazio aide. 
</P>
<P>
	If consumers are forced into deregulated electricity markets,  
DeFazio wrote, their electric rates will increase while their 
quality of service declines, adding: ``The ongoing failures of 
cable television and telephone deregulation are pretty good 
indicators of what we can expect from electricity deregulation.''

<HEADLINE> UConn Defies the Doubters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- UConn? UCan.  
</P>
<P>
	The UConn Huskies are a blue-collar team that supposedly didn't  
have a chance against a blue-chip Duke team that felt so confident 
it didn't even practice the day before the biggest game of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	But it turned out to be a Blue Monday for Duke, thanks to an  
unruffled Connecticut team that didn't leave its A-game on St. Pete 
Beach -- and a bench that was presumably far inferior to the Blue 
Devils'. 
</P>
<P>
	With coach Jim Calhoun yo-yoing players in and out of the game  
as if they were on an invisible string, the Huskies outworked, 
outplayed and outhustled -- outcoached, too -- a team that was being 
fitted for its championship rings weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Final score: Connecticut 77, Duke 74.  
</P>
<P>
	``The kids truly believed this was possible, even when the folks  
around us -- and I was leading the parade -- were saying how good 
Duke was,'' Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if we ever played a better game,'' Kevin Freeman  
said. ``But this is the best of the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, the stars came out for the Huskies, as Richard Hamilton  
scored 27 points, Ricky Moore transformed from defensive stopper to 
offensive sparkplug with 13 first-half points and Khalid El-Amin 
ran an offense that never wasted a single possession. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to shock the world,'' said Moore, whose tight defense  
forced Trajan Langdon to travel on Duke's final possession. 
</P>
<P>
	The world is suitably shocked.  
</P>
<P>
	But the Huskies are national champions in great part because  
their bench players weren't content to play minor roles, outscoring 
a Duke bench loaded with four McDonald's All-Americans 17-8. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies also outrebounded Duke 41-31, with Player of the  
Year Elton Brand getting 13 -- as many as he had in the first half 
Saturday against Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a team that wanted to be the best, and to do that we  
had to beat the best,'' Calhoun said. ``We knew it was possible 
because we hadn't played our best game yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jake Voskuhl, the 6-foot-11 center whose coifed hair never  
ruffled even amid a frantic Duke second half comeback, banged and 
clanged all night with Brand, who worked overly hard for each of 
his 15 points and got off only eight shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the first half, they made it really tough to give me open  
looks,'' Brand said. ``They were fighting the possession every time 
I touched it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To keep the foul-prone Voskuhl in the game, Calhoun began  
substituting three minutes into the game, running players in and 
out so quickly that some of the Huskies' best fast breaks came in 
front of the scorer's table. Nine UConn players played at least 
seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmund Saunders, more of a tight end than a power forward, came  
in to contribute valuable minutes and a physical presence that 
threw Brand off his game, and Souleymane Wane spelled Voskuhl with 
key minutes and four very-important points. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe the Blue Devils left their game in the night clubs where  
many of the Blue Devils were seen reveling at 3 a.m. Sunday after 
the semifinals, only nine hours before a practice that was never 
held because coach Mike Krzyzewski felt they already were ready. 
</P>
<P>
	They weren't ready for this.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Duke's been in a tight game like that in a long  
time. They haven't been challenged in close games all year, but we 
win in close games,'' said Freeman, who helped double-team Brand. 
``We wanted to prove we are the best team in the country and we 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke, the team that usually intimidates, finally ran into an  
opponent that didn't back down. Wane once stared down Brand as the 
two ran down the court, and Voskuhl seemed to get into Brand's mind 
-- and, once, into his shirt, almost tugging him to the ground while 
nearly tearing off his jersey as he protectively guarded the 
baseline. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great team defense,'' Voskuhl said. ``We got help from  
everyone and everywhere. ... We had a great game plan and we stuck 
to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the so-called Duke Invitational turned out to be the UConn  
Vindication. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies had never before reached the Final Four in 20  
previous trips to the NCAA tournament, and Calhoun, a Division I 
coach for 27 years, was known as one of the best coaches to never 
get to the round of four. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he's the final one.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm no better coach than I was three weeks ago,'' Calhoun  
said. ``I said I didn't need a Final Four, as badly as I wanted to 
get there. But that guy you hear yelling tonight? That will be 
me.''

<HEADLINE> Bank One To Cut Up to 4,500 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Bank One Corp. plans to eliminate as many as  
4,500 jobs as a result of the merger last year of First Chicago NBD 
Corp. and Banc One. 
</P>
<P>
	Revealing for the first time details about potential job cuts as  
result of the $19 billion merger completed in October, the nation's 
fourth-largest bank said in a filing Monday with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission that it is eliminating as much as 5 percent of 
the 90,560 jobs the two companies had in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago-based bank did not say in its filing how many of the  
cuts would occur through layoffs and how many through attrition, 
although it said it expects to complete the reductions by the end 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman could not be reached for comment late Monday on how  
many jobs already had been cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank One took a pretax restructuring charge of $984 million in  
the fourth quarter of 1998 and expects to record another $526 
million in merger-related charges this year, the company said in 
its filing. Of the charges this year, $54 million will be costs to 
integrate systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said last year that it had planned to eliminate jobs  
and outsource some operations to help achieve $930 million in 
annual savings. In the past few months it has eliminated jobs in 
corporate lending and overseas trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank One, like other banks that have recently merged, hopes to  
become a center for one-stop shopping for financial services such 
as loans, credit and mutual funds, but analysts have said that will 
take time as the companies merge their cultures and operations. The 
bank this year will advise customers about the switch in names, 
removing the First Chicago NBD name from the banking landscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank One has $260 billion in assets, more than 2,000 branches  
and 9,150 automated teller machines in the Midwest, South and 
Southwest. It is the nation's second-largest credit-card issuer, 
owning the First Chicago card and First USA credit operations.

	Dow Has First 10,000 Close  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average closed above  
10,000 for the first time as news that several big mergers are in 
the works gave investors a surge of optimism and propelled the 
entire stock market sharply higher. The Dow shot up 184.54 to 
10,006.78. Today's session was the fifth time that the 103-year-old 
index had crossed 10,000, but it was the first time it had enough 
momentum to stay above five digits until the closing bell. Earlier 
this month, the Dow traded as high as 10,085.31, but profit-taking 
and concerns about upcoming first-quarter earnings reports brought 
the index back down. Wall Street was buoyant today following news 
that Britain's BP Amoco is discussing a merger with rival oil 
company Atlantic Richfield, and that CBS is interested in King 
World, the producer of TV shows including ``Jeopardy'' and ``The 
Oprah Winfrey Show.'' Most broad market measures also were up. The 
Nasdaq composite index gained 72.78 to 2,491.95.

	Fed Said Unlikely To Change Rates  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve policy-makers are in ``the  
pleasant position of having to do nothing'' -- as one economist puts 
it -- as they contemplate short-term interest rates on Tuesday. U.S. 
economic growth continues to withstand the global economic slump, 
so the central bank need not engineer a rate cut to stave off 
recession, analysts say. And inflation remains benign, so a rate 
increase to dampen demand isn't needed, either. Economist David 
Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. said he doubted they would change 
the bias now, but they probably would at their next meeting on May 
18.

	New Home Sales Decline in February  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New home sales in the United States declined 2  
percent in February, the third consecutive drop since they hit a 
record high last fall. Buyers purchased new homes at a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 881,000 last month, a five-month low and 
down from 899,000 in January, the Commerce Department said today. 
Though down considerably from the record 985,000 pace in November, 
the February sales rate was nevertheless considered strong. Sales 
for the first two months of this year are running 1.4 percent ahead 
of the same period in 1998.

	BP Amoco May Buy Atlantic Richfield

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Only months after buying a large American oil  
company, Britain's BP Amoco is negotiating to buy Atlantic 
Richfield Co. for about $25 billion in stock, according to sources. 
The companies confirmed they were discussing a ``possible 
combination transaction,'' but that no definitive agreement had 
been reached, nor was one assured. A deal, however, could be 
announced later this week, after the boards of the two companies 
vote. Any deal would have to be approved by U.S. regulators.

	Microsoft Confirms Reorganization

	SEATTLE (AP) -- After weeks of rumors, Microsoft Corp. confirmed  
plans to reorganize its business, focusing on customer groups and 
needs rather than products and technology, Chairman Bill Gates and 
President Steve Ballmer said today. ``This new structure is part of 
the reinvention of Microsoft,'' Ballmer said. The computer software 
giant has been organized to meet the needs of today ``but not those 
of the next decade,'' he said. Gates and Ballmer insisted the move 
had nothing to do with the ongoing federal antitrust trial against 
Microsoft in Washington, D.C.

	Computers Infected With New Virus  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- E-mail systems crashed or were swamped at  
hundreds of companies of all sizes by the ``Melissa'' computer 
virus, a computer expert estimated today. Jeff Carpenter, a team 
leader for the Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon 
University in Pittsburgh, estimated that more than 100,000 
computers had been infected by the virus. Security experts had 
warned computer users returning to work today that Melissa messages 
usually contain the subject line ``Important message.'' The virus 
can crash e-mail systems because it directs computers to send more 
infected documents into cyberspace in great numbers, security 
experts said.

with industry giants like IBM. The cash offer was worth more than 
three times Platinum Technology's market value, based on Friday's 
closing price of $9.87 1/2 a share. The deal would give Computer 
Associates access to Platinum's lucrative consulting services and 
software for managing data and technology. Computer Associates 
stock was up 3 1/16 at 37. Platinum Technology stock more than 
doubled in value -- up 14 3/16 at 24 1/16.

	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Eastman Kodak Co. said today it expected  
a strong performance in the second half of this year even if 
earnings for the first quarter are expected to fall short of 
analysts' expectations. Kodak has been struggling because of a 
price war with Japan's Fuji Photo Film Co. Kodak said today it 
expects earnings per share for the first quarter to be in the range 
of 73 cents to 80 cents. Analysts surveyed by First Call had been 
looking for an average of 82 cents a share. But Kodak also said it 
still expects earnings for the full year of $4.81 to $5.24 a share, 
as it had predicted in January. Kodak ended the day up 3/8 at 65. 5/8.

Inc. and OnSale Inc. Amazon.com's move is the Seattle-based 
company's latest step toward building an online retail empire. Last 
month, it bought a 46 percent stake in drugstore.com, a new Web 
site selling pharmaceuticals and beauty aids. Over the last year, 
it has also added videos, music and some gift items to its site, as 
well as a launched a ``Shop the Web'' service that links to other 
Internet merchants. Amazon.com stock was up 10 9/16 at 149 5/8.

	Panel Backs SBC-Ameritech Plan  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Illinois Commerce Commission hearing officers  
Monday conditionally recommended approval of SBC Communications' 
takeover of rival Ameritech Corp. Despite heated arguments from 
consumer groups and rivals who contend the merger is 
anticompetitive and would result in few benefits to Ameritech's 
customers, the hearing officers said they could find no such 
grounds for rejecting the deal. But they did recommend the full 
commission approve the merger with conditions applied -- largely the 
divestitures of certain properties, which Ameritech and SBC 
officials had already said they would make. The full ICC is likely 
to accept the hearing officers' recommendations.

<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian government on Monday set a $5,000  
limit on the amount of hard currency Russian citizens can take out 
of the country legally. The Cabinet met in a brief special session 
Monday to discuss capital flight from Russia, which Prime Minister 
Yevgeny Primakov estimated at $20 billion to $25 billion annually. 
Prior to the new regulation, Russian citizens could take out 
virtually unlimited amounts of hard currency, as long as they had a 
bank declaration.

<HEADLINE> White-McCarty Ends College Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Stephanie White-McCarty hopped up four  
rungs on the ladder, her severely sprained left ankle dangling to 
the side, and smiled through the pain while becoming the first 
Purdue player to cut a net for a national title. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, with the honored piece of twine safely in her left hand,  
she jumped off the ladder -- right into the arms of two teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarty spent the final minutes of her remarkable amateur  
basketball career writhing on the bench in pain and clutching an 
assistant coach's hand as her Purdue Boilermakers won their first 
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarty, the second-leading career scorer at Purdue after  
perhaps the greatest high school career by a woman in Indiana 
history, was hurt while missing a shot with less than five minutes 
remaining in Purdue's 62-45 win over Duke on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	She squirmed on the court, spitting her mouthpiece about 10 feet  
away as play continued. When play finally stopped, she was helped 
to the bench by teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Her face etched in pain, she sat on the bench as a trainer took  
off her left sneaker. White-McCarty then went to the end of the 
bench and had her ankle heavily taped, but she limped severely when 
she tried to walk. 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarty, who had 12 points in the game to bring her Purdue  
total to 2,182, then took a seat on the bench next to assistant 
coach Kerry Cremeans, tightly gripping the coach's left hand and 
still looking agonized. 
</P>
<P>
	Missing their leading scorer, the Boilermakers blew open a close  
game in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steph and I have been through so much together and we dreamed  
about it. We talked about winning the national championship, and I 
knew that it was hurting her probably more not being on the court 
than her ankle was,'' backcourt partner and best friend Ukari Figgs 
said. ``I just wanted to go out and win it for her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the win, Figgs helped White-McCarty -- who was on crutches  
-- up to the victory stand as the Boilermakers received the 
championship trophy. Figgs then also helped White-McCarty up the 
ladder to become the first Purdue player to cut down part of the 
net at the San Jose Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what we stayed for,'' said White-McCarty, who remained  
at Purdue when many players left the team as it switched coaches 
twice during her tenure. ``The special group we have on this team 
makes it really nice and really special. It's been a lot of fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarty had X-rays on the ankle shortly after the game and  
was not available for a post-game interview session. But coach 
Carolyn Peck said her star shooting guard left the court with a 
sense of satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you she's a happy young lady,'' Peck said.

<HEADLINE> Sprewell Lawsuit Dismissed Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell's lawsuit against the NBA,  
challenging his 68-game suspension for choking his coach, was 
dismissed Monday by a federal judge who said it was so worthless 
that Sprewell must pay the league's court costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, whose original one-year suspension was cut to the  
remaining 68 games of the 1997-98 season by an arbitrator, claimed 
in his $30 million suit that the punishment still exceeded the 
arbitrator's authority and that he was a victim of racial 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that a white player, Tom Chambers, wasn't suspended for  
punching a Phoenix Suns assistant coach a few weeks before Sprewell 
attacked Golden State Warriors coach P.J. Carlesimo. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker first dismissed the suit last  
July, saying its factual claims were too vague to prove any legal 
violations. He gave Sprewell one more chance to file an amended 
suit with more specific claims, but said the player should 
seriously consider dropping the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell re-filed the suit, but Walker said the new version was  
virtually the same as the old version, and neither one had any 
legal merit. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell's ``second baseless (suit) forced unnecessary  
expenditures by defendants (the NBA and the Warriors) and a 
wasteful diversion of this court's resources,'' Walker said in a 
ruling made public Monday. He invited the league and the team to 
submit statements of their attorneys' fees and expenses for the 
dismissal motion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell will appeal the dismissal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court  
of Appeals, said attorney Robert Thompson Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	``Latrell made the decision to appeal because he believes  
strongly in his case,'' Thompson said by telephone from Atlanta. 
``We're very confident about the results on appeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Rothman, a lawyer for the NBA, said Walker was right to  
penalize Sprewell for a frivolous suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Sprewell had his full hearing in arbitration,'' Rothman  
said. ``He wanted a second shot at it and the law doesn't give you 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	``For choking the head coach the way he did, he should have been  
charged with a crime. I think he got off very light.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, a former all-star guard, argued with Carlesimo during  
a practice in December 1997, then grabbed him around the neck and 
threatened to kill him, according to witnesses at his arbitration 
hearing. After they were separated and Sprewell left the floor to 
shower and change, he returned and, according to witnesses, punched 
Carlesimo and threatened him again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Warriors initially suspended him for 10 games, then  
terminated the last three years and $24 million of his contract. 
The league increased the suspension to a year. But arbitrator John 
Feerick, after a lengthy hearing, ruled the punishment excessive 
and ordered Sprewell reinstated last July 1. He was later traded to 
the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell said the 68-game suspension cost him $6.4 million in  
salary. His suit sought the return of $5.4 million as well as 
additional damages. 
</P>
<P>
	He argued that the arbitrator had exceeded his authority by  
allowing both the league and the Warriors to impose separate 
punishments. He also accused NBA investigators of destroying 
interview notes and doctoring evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit claimed racial discrimination on several grounds: that  
whites like Chambers were treated more leniently, that the Warriors 
had insisted on broader rights to terminate Sprewell's contract 
than they demanded in white players' contracts, and that most of 
the team's and league's upper management is white. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker said the arbitrator had reasonably concluded that  
Sprewell's punishment was authorized by the NBA's union contract, 
and had considered and rejected his complaints about the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Feerick also examined the Chambers incident and others cited by  
Sprewell and found that differing punishments were based on the 
seriousness of the offense, not the race of the player, the judge 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell's factual claims, even if proven, would not show that  
the Warriors or the league were motivated by racism, Walker said. 
And even if racial bias were shown, the judge said, Sprewell failed 
to demonstrate ``a public policy that specifically militates 
against suspension of an employee who violently attacks his 
employer.''

<HEADLINE> States Use of Welfare Punishments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The number of people on welfare is at a 30-year low nationwide,  
falling from just over 5 million families in 1994 to about 2.9 
million families last September. 
</P>
<P>
	That decline has been powered by a strong economy, which created  
1.9 million jobs last year alone. But a 50-state Associated Press 
survey found that states' punishments for failing to cooperate are 
a major reason many are leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government is attempting to track why people are  
leaving, but officials acknowledge their statistics do not contain 
specific information, and aren't consistent across states. 
</P>
<P>
	Examples from the AP survey of states:  
</P>
<P>
	--In Florida, more than 15,000 families left welfare during a  
typical month last year. About 3,600 reported finding work but 
nearly 4,200 left because they were punished. The state does not 
know what happened to almost 7,500 others. 
</P>
<P>
	--In Iowa, 47 percent of those who left welfare left because they  
did not comply with requirements such as going to job interviews or 
providing paperwork. Thirty percent left because they earned too 
much money to qualify, and 12 percent left ``by their own 
initiative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--In Kentucky, 26,803 families left rolls in the year ended last  
June. Thirty-two percent left because they failed to show up for a 
mandatory appointment with welfare officials. Another 26 percent 
``failed to cooperate.'' About 29 percent asked to be taken off for 
various reasons, including marriage and increased income. Nine 
percent left the state. 
</P>
<P>
	--In Nebraska, about 1,000 cases were closed each month,  
including about 100 who did not participate in work requirements. 
But 850 people found employment, and 50 moved out of state. 
</P>
<P>
	--In New Hampshire, two-thirds of the caseload drop went  
unexplained. About 28 percent of people found work, 4 percent got 
married and 2 percent made too much money or failed to meet 
requirements.

<P>
	In the oil industry, BP-Amoco and Arco have confirmed they're in

</P>
<P>
	For one thing, the Fed holds an interest rate meeting tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> New Trial Sought in Dragging Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- A man sentenced to die for the dragging  
death of a black man contended Monday his chances for a fair trial 
were jeopardized because his attorneys failed to investigate his 
version of where he was the night of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	In a motion for a new trial, 24-year-old John William King  
claims his alibi never was investigated properly by his trial 
attorneys, said David Schulman, King's appeals attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	King, condemned last month for the June 7 dragging death of  
James Byrd Jr., has claimed he was dropped off at his home while 
the 49-year-old black man was still alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs, King's court-appointed trial attorney,  
said all witnesses provided to him by King were questioned. 
</P>
<P>
	King also claims his right to a fair trial was compromised  
because his mail to co-defendant Lawrence Russell Brewer, 32, 
improperly was intercepted by jail employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Joe Bob Golden has until May 11 to rule on the motion.  
</P>
<P>
	Brewer's trial is set to start May 17. He is the second of three  
men to be tried for Byrd's gruesome slaying. The unemployed Jasper 
resident's body was found in two pieces after he was dragged for 
nearly three miles, chained to the back of a pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
	No trial date has been set for Shawn Berry, the third man  
charged with Byrd's killing.

<HEADLINE> Kiwi Gets Three-Day Reprieve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A bankruptcy judge on Monday gave grounded  
Kiwi International Air Lines three more days to show it could fly 
again before she considers whether to close Kiwi or appoint an 
overseer to run what is left of the carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi also surrendered the last of its leased jets to its leasing  
company, so it is now an airline with neither a jet nor permission 
to fly. 
</P>
<P>
	It had four jets when it entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy  
protection last week, down from 15 in the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, Peter R. Sarasohn, a lawyer for Kiwi's would-be  
rescuer, told the judge that Pan Am Airways remains interested in 
buying the airline, but only if federal regulators restore Kiwi's 
permit to fly. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Pan Am's cold feet, Kiwi president Eugene J. Gillespie  
Jr. said Monday that another white knight may be in the wings to 
save the company's 500 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are other people that have expressed interest,'' he  
said, but declined to say whether those entities would also require 
a flight certificate. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi lawyer John Drexel, who had obtained a six-day stay of  
execution last week, argued Monday for three more days, saying they 
still will not spend more than the $130,000 allowed last week by 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rosemary Gambardella. 
</P>
<P>
	By Thursday, he said, Kiwi hopes to persuade a federal official  
to tell the judge that Kiwi's right to fly would be restored. If 
not, Kiwi will consent to a court-appointed overseer, Drexel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The overseer or liquidation was requested by a lawyer for the  
U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee Patricia A. Staiano, the public's watchdog 
on bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
	The company filed for bankruptcy protection on March 29,  
offering a rescue plan based on a $3 million sale to Pan Am, a 
former commercial airliner that now has seven jets and flies 
charters out of Portsmouth, N.H. Kiwi declared $30.3 million in 
assets and $41.1 million in liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, however, the Federal Aviation Administration  
stunned Kiwi by revoking its flight certificate, asserting the 
carrier was unable to fly its six-city schedule safely. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi failed twice last week to convince the FAA to let it fly  
again, even with a limited schedule under close scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi has struggled for much of its life, and before Wednesday,  
served just Newark; Miami, Orlando and Palm Beach, Fla.; and San 
Juan and Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. It recently relinquished longtime 
routes to Atlanta and Chicago.

<HEADLINE> `Forces of Nature' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The romantic tale ``Forces of Nature'' and  
the comedy ``Analyze This'' held on to the top two box office 
slots, fighting off a challenge from the opening of ``EDtv,'' final 
figures showed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Mod Squad'' debuted at No. 4 amid scathing reviews, and  
the low-budget animated film ``Doug's 1st Movie'' followed in 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forces of Nature,'' with Ben Affleck as a groom-to-be who  
falls in love with the free-spirited Sandra Bullock on the way to 
his wedding, brought in $9.4 million in a weekend that saw a 20 
percent drop from last year's earnings for the same weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Analyze This'' with Robert De Niro as a neurotic mobster  
collected $8.7 million for second, with ``EDtv'' trailing in third 
with $8.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ron Howard-directed comedy featured Matthew McConaughey as a  
goofy video store clerk who agrees to have every minute of his life 
captured by television. The film and the other two new releases of 
the weekend were all based on TV projects or TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Mod Squad,'' an updated version of the 1960s TV show about  
three youths who become undercover cops to stay out of jail, opened 
with $6.1 million for fourth place. ``Doug's 1st Movie'' followed 
with $4.5 million.

<HEADLINE> Power Cooperative Must Pay $47M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- A Bismarck power cooperative must pay the  
federal government $47.4 million for overcharging it for 
electricity, a federal judge ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Patrick Conmy said Basin Electric Power  
Cooperative twice breached its contract with the Western Area Power 
Administration and once deliberately overcharged the federal 
agency, constituting fraud. The ruling was made public Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1986 to 1990, Basin was contracted to supply electricity to  
the agency, which sells hydropower from federal dams. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawsuit brought by the government and former Basin auditor  
Robert Norbeck contended that Basin billed the agency for costs 
that were either falsified or not allowed under contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers dropped their fraud claims in November. But  
Norbeck pursued them under a law that allows citizens to continue 
claims on behalf of the government, then keep up to 30 percent of 
any judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	Conmy ruled Basin charged the government higher rates by using  
incorrect accounting practices. He ruled Basin committed fraud when 
it used money from the sale of a power unit to pay off unrelated 
debts. The government was being charged for the unit's debt burden. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount set by Conmy includes reparations for the overcharges  
and $26.1 million in penalties.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Show McDougal TV Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Kenneth Starr's prosecutors sought  
Monday to challenge key testimony by Susan McDougal, showing jurors 
a 1996 TV interview in which she made no mention of allegations 
she'd been pressured to say she had an affair with Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	As Mrs. McDougal's Whitewater-related criminal contempt trial  
entered its fourth week, prosecutors rolled a videotape for a jury 
in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowhere in the several hours of out-takes from the ABC interview  
did Mrs. McDougal refer in any way to the most sensational 
testimony so far in her trial. She testified that her ex-husband, 
who has since died, asked her in 1996 around the time of the ABC 
interview to say that she had an affair with Clinton as a way of 
helping Starr's office ``get'' Clinton before the presidential 
election. James McDougal had alleged that his former wife had an 
affair with Clinton during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	After playing the videotape, prosecutor Mark Barrett got Mrs.  
McDougal to admit differences between Mrs. McDougal's 1996 
interview with ABC and what she says now. She conceded she made no 
mention in the TV interview of her ex-husband trying out various 
fabricated stories with her that he was planning to tell Starr's 
office. She also conceded that in the TV interview she didn't 
mention being pressured by her ex-husband to say she'd had an 
affair with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, she testified that McDougal had tried out various  
scenarios that implicated President Clinton in a fraudulent 
$300,000 loan. She says she never discussed the loan with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ABC interview, Mrs. McDougal referred to the possibility  
that she would be talking to prosecutors soon, even though she 
refused just five days later to answer any of their questions. In 
one out-take, she turned to an ABC producer off-camera and said 
that first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's role in a real estate 
development called Castle Grande near Little Rock was the kind of 
topic that she could talk about with prosecutors, but not on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal told ABC she had been subpoenaed by Starr's  
office, but she had not decided whether to answer the questions. 
She said she feared Starr's office would retaliate against her if 
she didn't give evidence that implicated the Clintons in 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Riddled with fraudulent transactions, Castle Grande failed at a  
cost to Jim and Susan McDougal's federally insured savings and loan 
of nearly $4 million. Mrs. Clinton prepared a real estate document 
that was used to deceive federal regulators who were looking into 
sham transactions at Castle Grande. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Bobby McDaniel, was furious over the ABC  
interview broadcast on Aug. 30, 1996, saying ABC producer Chris 
Vlasto had gone behind McDaniel's back to get it. Vlasto says Mrs. 
McDougal contacted him to say she was ready to ``tell all.'' In a 
Wall Street Journal article that has come up repeatedly in Mrs. 
McDougal's trial, Vlasto wrote that Mrs. McDougal bowed to the 
wishes of her brother, Bill Henley, and her fiance, Pat Harris, in 
refusing to answer questions about whether Clinton knew of the 
fraudulent $300,000 loan.

<HEADLINE> Russian Premier To Visit Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov will  
travel to Yugoslavia on Tuesday seeking ``an immediate halt'' to 
NATO airstrikes against the Balkan nation, the government said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has been a harsh critic of the airstrikes, but its  
response has so far been limited to mostly symbolic actions, such 
as suspending contact with NATO. And although Russia is an ally of 
Yugoslavia, it's not clear how much sway it will have with Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia was part of the six-nation Contact Group that mediated  
between Yugoslavia and Kosovo's ethnic Albanians. Russia encouraged 
Yugoslavia to sign a political agreement that would give Kosovo 
autonomy. But both Russia and Yugoslavia are opposed to stationing 
NATO troops in Kosovo to implement the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has also said that it will provide humanitarian aid to  
Yugoslavia, and some Russian officials have suggested that Moscow 
break the international arms embargo against the Balkan nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Primakov will go to the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade on Tuesday  
``with the purpose of (bringing) an immediate halt to NATO's 
bombing of Yugoslavia,'' said government spokesman Igor 
Shchyogolev. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian premier is expected to meet with Milosevic, though  
his schedule was not formally announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Primakov will be accompanied by Russia's Defense Minister Igor  
Sergeyev, and the two men may head to Germany -- presumably to meet 
with Western leaders -- after going to Yugoslavia, Russian media 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergeyev claimed today that NATO airstrikes in Yugoslavia have  
killed 1,000 civilians, though the Yugoslav government has given 
lower figures. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thousand persons of the civilian population, ten times  
more than the military,'' have died in the bombing raids, Sergeyev 
was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergeyev did not provide the source of his information.  
Yugoslavia's government has not been providing detailed figures on 
civilian casualties, though the country's U.N. envoy, Vladislav 
Jovanovic, said Friday that ``hundreds of civilians'' had been 
killed. Neither of the claims could be independently confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has said that it has carefully chosen its targets in an  
attempt to limit the number of civilian casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Russian President Boris Yeltsin planned to again  
denounce the air strikes on Tuesday, according to portions of his 
prepared state-of-the-nation speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``The use of force and, the more so, the violation of the  
international law standards is dangerous and inadmissible,'' 
Yeltsin says in the prepared remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Excerpts from the speech were obtained by The Associated Press  
from RIA Novosti, the Russian information agency. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, he plans to say ``defrosting'' of the icy  
relationship ``depends on how soon the alliance will realize the 
peril of the military option towards Yugoslavia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its strong opposition to the airstrikes, Russia has said  
it wants to maintain a good working relationship with the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Russian police searched today for gunmen who fired on the  
U.S. Embassy in Moscow a day earlier, an attack apparently linked 
to Russian protests against NATO airstrikes. No one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	No one claimed responsibility for the attack, though the country  
has numerous extremist groups that regard the United States as an 
enemy of Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Embassy, which was open for business today, has asked  
Russian authorities to increase security outside the building, 
which is on one of the busiest streets in the capital. The large 
Russian police presence today far outnumbered the demonstrators who 
have gathered outside the embassy every day since the NATO bombings 
began last week.

<HEADLINE> Freudian Slip by Hamlet? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ooops!  
</P>
<P>
	Although Hamlet is supposed to have lived some 300 years before  
Freud, it seems he made a Freudian slip nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
	And the slip, says a leading psychoanalyst, sheds light on the  
darkest corner of his mind, and also shows Shakespeare's genius in 
depicting a person's inner life. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Eugene J. Mahon, training analyst at Columbia College of  
Physicians and Surgeons, discusses his discovery in the annual 
journal Psychoanalytical Study of the Child, a publication that 
showcases the latest psychoanalytic thoughts and theories on a 
variety of subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamlet, one of the most popular of Shakespearean heroes, makes  
the slip in his first soliloquy. Lamenting his mother's hasty 
remarriage to his uncle only one month after his father's death, 
the Prince of Denmark mumbles: ``But two months dead! -- nay, not so 
much, not two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Why does he say two, instead of one, and immediately correct  
himself? That's because Hamlet, in his unconscious Oedipal fantasy, 
killed his father a month before his uncle actually did, Mahon 
argues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children want exclusive possession of one parent and want to  
get rid of the other one,'' the analyst explained in an interview. 
``Usually for a boy, that would be, he wants complete possession of 
his mother and wants to get rid of his father. But he feels guilty 
about it because he loves his father, too. It is a conflict, and 
it's almost impossible for the child to make sense out of it. So, 
at about age 6, he represses it. When adolescence comes, however, 
his Oedipus complex is rehashed, making it possible for a new 
resolution to be achieved in adulthood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oedipus is a hero of Greek legend who unknowingly slays his  
father and marries his mother. Sigmund Freud, who conceptualized 
this psychological process, also believed that Hamlet must have had 
his own unconscious wish to kill his father, Mahon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The founder of psychoanalysis theorized that his uncle's  
carrying out the very deed Hamlet himself was pondering might have 
retarded Hamlet's ability to bring him to swift justice. 
</P>
<P>
	In his paper, Mahon offers his own version of what Hamlet might  
have been unconsciously thinking when he made the slip: 
</P>
<P>
	``But two months dead! -- nay, not so much, not two. I mean to  
say one, one, one, one. I am the one now, the only one in her (my 
mother's) life. But she betrayed me for another twice. First with 
him (my father), now with Claudius (my uncle). But two into one 
won't go, the awful impossible mathematics of love. But two months 
dead. I killed him a month before Claudius did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slips of the tongue occur when one's unconscious thoughts break  
into consciousness, Mahon explained. It is part of a phenomenon 
Freud called ``fehlleistung,'' or faulty function. Translated into 
English as parapraxis, it includes such everyday mistakes as slips 
of the tongue, faulty memories and misplaced objects. 
</P>
<P>
	Intrigued by Hamlet's slip, which he caught while watching  
Kenneth Branagh's movie, ``Hamlet,'' Mahon proceeded to check the 
other 37 of Shakespeare's plays and spotted as many as 20 
parapraxes. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Julius Caesar,'' for example, he found a case of faulty  
memory occurring as Brutus and Cassius squabble after they 
assassinated Caesar. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cassius is angry with Brutus and says something like, `I'm  
older than you. How dare you talk to me like this.' Later, Brutus 
accuses him of having said, `You're better than me.' If indeed 
Brutus has misheard him, what's Shakespeare's aesthetic methodology 
here? What Shakespeare is really saying is that Brutus has killed 
an older, better man, namely Caesar. Maybe all smaller, younger 
people, namely children, kill older, better people in their own 
Oedipal fantasies of childhood,'' Mahon said. 
</P>
<P>
	``So the subtext of this battle about older-better is the notion  
that Brutus is guilty of killing an older, better man, Caesar or 
father perhaps, and it is his unconscious guilt about this that 
triggers the squabble with Cassius leading to the parapraxis of the 
faulty memory. I think you can see how the parapraxis, which is 
seemingly trivial, has multiple, deeper meanings if one is able to 
ferret them out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Freudian parapraxes weren't discovered until 100  
years ago, Shakespeare was clearly very aware of their 
psychological significance 400 years ago, Mahon observed. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's even more amazing to me is that he then began to use  
them cleverly, aesthetically in his own depiction of characters,'' 
Mahon concluded. ``Characters are made even more complex by virtue 
of these slips of the tongue that they have. When the characters 
make a slip, they realize it, and that deepens the audience's sense 
that they are thinking unconsciously.''

<HEADLINE>  Braves' Ligtenberg Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- Kerry Ligtenberg, who took over the  
Atlanta Braves closer's job last season when Mark Wohlers had 
control problems, said Monday he will have season-ending surgery to 
repair a torn elbow ligament. 
</P>
<P>
	Ligtenberg, 27, took over the closer's job last season when Mark  
Wohlers developed control problems. The rookie right-hander 
converted 30 of 34 save chances, going 3-2 with a 2.71 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 12, Ligtenberg was diagnosed with a partial tear of the  
medial collateral ligament. He has not thrown since and decided on 
surgery after an examination Monday by the Braves' orthopedic 
surgeon, Dr. Joe Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave me three choices -- wait three more weeks and try to  
throw, throw right now, and the third choice was to go get the 
surgery,'' Ligtenberg said. ``I figured I'd do it now. That would 
put me out 12 months and I'll be ready to go next season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ligtenberg, obtained by Atlanta from the independent Prairie  
League for six dozen baseballs and two dozen bats, is to meet next 
Monday with the surgeon, Dr. James Andrews of Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	While Ligtenberg is out, Wohlers appears to be coming back.  
</P>
<P>
	He was sent to the minors last season when he couldn't find the  
plate and his season ended early, but he has been getting better 
with each spring outing. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last three appearances, Wohlers has thrown four scoreless  
innings and lowered his ERA to 5.63. Since giving up four runs in 
his first appearance against Houston, Wohlers has allowed one run. 
Overall, in eight innings this spring, he has given up eight hits, 
walked six and struck out nine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, if we had to start the season today, I don't know  
why we wouldn't open up with him as the closer,'' manager Bobby Cox 
said. ``It's been an amazing turnaround. Who knows what the odds 
were? He certainly has beaten them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The way I feel right now, I would expect to get the ball,''  
Wohlers said Monday after his 1-2-3 outing Monday in Atlanta's 3-2 
exhibition victory over Florida. ``But John Rocker, Rudy Seanez and 
Mike Cather are also pitching well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker, a left-hander, also is expected to get some  
opportunities to finish games. Rocker hasn't allowed a run in nine 
innings this spring, striking out 11 and allowing six hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers began struggling in late May last season after hurting  
his side and going on the 15-day disabled list. He wound up with a 
10.18 ERA in 20 1-3 innings with the Braves, walking 33. At 
Triple-A Richmond, Wohlers gave up 36 walks in 12 1-3 innings with 
a 20.43 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this spring, Wohlers appears to have regained the form he  
had from 1995-97, when he had 97 saves, including a team-record 39 
in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Fed Said Unlikely To Change Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wall Street is celebrating the first  
five-digit close of the Dow Jones average with exuberant confidence 
that the Federal Reserve will resist, for now, the temptation to 
ruin the party. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's policy-making panel -- the Federal Open Market  
Committee -- was convening today for the second time this year and 
economists were virtually unanimous in their expectation that it 
would vote to leave interest rates unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Because U.S. economic growth continues to withstand the global  
economic slump, the central bank need not engineer a rate cut to 
stave off recession. And with consumer prices advancing at a benign 
1.6 percent annual rate in January and February, a rate increase to 
dampen demand isn't needed, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as the economy is growing at a fast rate, without  
inflation, there is no reason to apply the brakes or hit the gas,'' 
said economist Norman Robertson of Smithfield Trust Co. in 
Pittsburgh. ``For now, the Fed is in the pleasant position of 
having to do nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed has done just that since last Nov. 17, the day it cut  
its benchmark rate on overnight loans between banks for the third 
time in seven weeks. Those moves, which reduced the federal funds 
rate from 5.5 percent to 4.75 percent, were taken after Russia's 
economic crisis sent Wall Street reeling and threatened to induce a 
U.S. credit crunch. 
</P>
<P>
	But the worst fears about the impact of foreign turmoil never  
materialized. Economists believe the economy expanded at better 
than a 3 percent annual rate during the first three months of this 
year, not much worse than the 4 percent rate that prevailed, on 
average, through the previous two years. 
</P>
<P>
	And the stock market has more than recovered. The Dow Jones  
Industrial Average soared 185 points to 10,007 on Monday -- 33 
percent higher than its 7,539 close on Aug. 31 in the midst of the 
Russian financial scare. 
</P>
<P>
	The questions are, ``How much longer can the Fed remain on  
hold?'' and, when it does move, ``Which way will it go?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson said a long-awaited economic slowdown should arrive  
during the second half of this year and that might induce the Fed 
to trim rates again, sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Recessions abroad continue to depress U.S. export sales,  
business investment spending is slackening and housing construction 
decelerating from record levels, he said, leaving consumer spending 
as the principal engine of economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	However, many other economists see signs of an Asian recovery.  
And as demand there perks up, one of the principal brakes on 
commodity price inflation will lessen. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that point, there's a greater probability of tightening  
rather than easing,'' said economist Mark Zandi of Regional 
Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Before policy-makers do that, they could signal their intentions  
by publicly announcing a change in their thinking about the likely 
direction of interest rates in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	This policy bias has been at neutral -- seeing an equal  
possibility of either higher or lower rates -- since the last rate 
cut in November. It's been the Fed's practice to reveal changes in 
the bias with a lag of about six weeks, but in December 
policy-makers decided in some cases to reveal changes immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. in New York  
said he doubted they would change the bias on Tuesday but at their 
next meeting on May 18 they probably would. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they'll have to conclude that the balance of risks is  
tilting,'' he said. ``The domestic economy is still remarkably 
strong and we're starting to get the first hints of an upturn in 
Asia.''

<HEADLINE> Justices Reject Public Prayer Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today rejected the appeal of  
a Utah man whose request to give the opening prayer at a city 
council meeting was turned down because of its unusual content. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, refused to hear Tom Snyder's  
argument that the city council in Murray City, Utah, unlawfully 
favored one religion over another by rejecting his proposed prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court ruled for the city, saying Snyder's  
planned prayer was more of a ``political harangue'' that fell 
outside this nation's ``long-accepted genre of legislative 
prayer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder's proposed prayer was addressed to ``our mother, who art  
in heaven (if, indeed there is a heaven and if there is a god that 
takes a woman's form).'' It asked ``that you deliver us from the 
evil of forced religious worship'' and questioned ``if in fact you 
had a son that visited Earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The city council in Salt Lake City dropped its practice of  
opening meetings with an invocation rather than allow Snyder to 
offer his prayer. Later, in March 1994, he asked officials in 
Murray City to let him say the prayer to open a city council 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The city attorney told him the prayer ``is not a time to express  
political views (or) attack city policies or practices.'' City 
officials refused to let Snyder offer an invocation but said he 
could give the prayer during the council meeting's public comment 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder sued, saying the council's action violated the  
Constitution's First Amendment ban on government establishment of 
religion. A federal judge ruled against him, as did the 10th U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said traditional ``legislative prayer''  
involves ``nonsectarian requests for wisdom and solemnity, as well 
as calls for divine blessing on the work of the legislative body.'' 
Prayers that promote a particular religious creed or disparage 
another creed can be rejected without violating the Constitution, 
the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, Snyder's lawyers said the city  
cannot discriminate between religious ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Snyder vs. Murray City, 98-1193.

<HEADLINE> How a Fuel Cell Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A fuel cell is a mechanism that can convert chemical fuels into  
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike a battery, a storage device that eventually is used up,  
fuel cells can produce electricity as long as fuel is supplied. 
</P>
<P>
	The fuel cell has two electrodes separated by an electrolyte.  
One of the electrodes -- called an anode -- is supplied with 
hydrogen. The second electrode -- the cathode -- is supplied by 
oxygen from air. The electrolyte acts as a conductor of ions before 
they react at the anode, producing a flow of direct-current 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	The reaction produces water and heat as byproducts.  
</P>
<P>
	There are five types of fuel cells, which are categorized by the  
type of electrolyte they use: proton exchange membrane; phosphoric 
acid; alkaline; molten carbonate, and solid oxide. 
</P>
<P>
	Each technology has its own operating characteristics, such as  
size and operating temperature, that make it attractive for 
specific applications ranging from large utility power plants to 
transportation to low-wattage remote sites.

<HEADLINE> US Thinks Iraq Is Helping Yugoslavs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Yugoslav defense specialists, expecting a war  
over Kosovo, met last month in Baghdad with Iraqi counterparts in 
what the Pentagon suspects was a collaboration between two U.S. 
enemies to prepare Yugoslavia to shoot down American war planes, 
government officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. intelligence agencies kept track of the Yugoslavs going to  
the meeting but could not get firsthand information about what went 
on, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Pentagon officials said the meeting's timing and  
personnel, a similarity in Iraqi and Yugoslav air defense tactics 
since NATO airstrikes began and separate intelligence about 
possible arms deals between the two countries all suggest 
Yugoslavia sought information on U.S. fighter jets and combat 
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baghdad meeting was described to The Associated Press by  
senior Clinton administration officials, Pentagon officials 
familiar with intelligence matters and congressional officials 
briefed on the matter. They spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Monday he could not  
comment on intelligence matters but said such contacts would not be 
surprising. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are two countries both subject to attack by forces  
within NATO, they both have primarily Soviet-built or purchased air 
defense systems, and they are both subject to international 
embargoes,'' Bacon said. ``So they might obviously look for ways to 
work together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collaboration between Iraq and Yugoslavia predates the Kosovo  
crisis. Baghdad purchased some Soviet-made air defense equipment 
from Yugoslavia late in the Cold War. In addition, much of Iraq's 
military infrastructure was constructed by Yugoslav companies 
during the 1980s, including airfields and aircraft shelters, vast 
underground command centers and industrial plants used for defense 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	But February's two-day visit of a four-member Yugoslav air  
defense team to the Iraqi military headquarters in Baghdad drew the 
immediate attention of U.S. intelligence. President Clinton and key 
congressional leaders were quickly notified, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Yugoslavia and Iraq are under international arms embargoes,  
and U.S. officials said they have intelligence indicating 
Yugoslavia was offering to trade military spare parts in exchange 
for Iraqi intelligence on U.S. air operations. Yugoslavia may also 
be seeking parts from Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each country has supplies or parts it would like to get from  
the other country,'' a senior Pentagon official said, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	An official ``at a fairly high level'' in the Yugoslav military,  
and accompanying officers ``stayed a couple of days and met with a 
whole variety of people'' in Baghdad, including air defense 
specialists, the Pentagon official said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Belgrade was resisting a diplomatic solution to the  
Kosovo crisis and bracing for threatened NATO airstrikes, and Iraq 
was challenging U.S. planes patrolling deny-flight zones over Iraq 
and coming under frequent retaliatory attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials said they suspect Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's  
desire to help another U.S. adversary outweighed any concerns about 
Serb attacks in Kosovo against ethnic Albanians, who are mostly 
Muslim. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq has had little success defending against U.S. and British  
airstrikes during the skirmishes since the end of the Gulf War. But 
Pentagon officials say Baghdad is in a position to share detailed 
information about the tactics, flight patterns and capabilities of 
U.S. warplanes, including: 
</P>
<P>
	--How high do U.S. warplanes fly during attack missions and what  
predictable patterns do they follow? 
</P>
<P>
	--How long does it take a U.S. fighter to react with a  
radar-seeking missile after an air defense battery directs its 
radar at the plane? 
</P>
<P>
	--How can military equipment be hidden from view?  
</P>
<P>
	--How can radar systems be tuned to detect, even fleetingly, an  
F-117 stealth fighter? 
</P>
<P>
	In the opening days of the NATO campaign over Yugoslavia, Serb  
forces largely held off firing from their scores of surface-to-air 
missile batteries, then gradually intensified their air defense 
fire, the same basic tactic seen recently in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav fighter tactics, however, have been more aggressive.  
NATO shot down five highly capable Russian-made MiG-29s in recent 
days. But there have been signs the Serb warplanes are also trying 
to draw NATO combat aircraft into SAM traps, much as Iraqi fighter 
planes tried in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials say Yugoslavia's air defense system is more  
capable and better manned than Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Serbs have been tutored by the Russians. Their air defense  
system has been upgraded more recently than the Iraqis. They have 
huge numbers of mobile missile launchers, and better terrain and 
weather for hiding. And we think their people are better trained,'' 
one Pentagon official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The downing of an F-117A stealth fighter Saturday has defense  
officials concerned that U.S. adversaries' knowledge of American 
air combat methods is improving, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the concern hasn't stopped the strikes on Yugoslavia. More  
F-117As took off Monday from Aviano Air Base, Italy.

<HEADLINE> $120.5M Aetna Verdict Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) -- A judge on Monday let stand a  
jury's $120.5 million judgment against Aetna U.S. Healthcare for 
its refusal to pay for a stomach cancer patient's medical care 
recommended by the HMO's own doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``While this court views the award of damages for wrongful death  
as being high, the court cannot say that the award is excessive,'' 
San Bernardino County Superior Court Judge Christopher J. Warner 
wrote in his ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, a jury awarded Teresa Goodrich a record $120.5  
million and found Aetna committed ``malice, oppression and fraud'' 
and contributed to the shortening of the life of her husband, David 
Goodrich. He died in 1995 from a rare form of stomach cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury awarded $116 million in punitive damages and $4.5  
million in medical expenses and loss of companionship. Goodrich was 
a county prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are gratified that the court has allowed the jury's message  
to be sent to Aetna,'' said Mrs. Goodrich's attorney, Michael J. 
Bidart. ``Our hope is that this message will lead to desperately 
needed HMO reform so that all Americans may have equal rights under 
the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A message left for Aetna lead attorney Hugh Helm after business  
hours Monday was not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Bidart argued during the two-month trial that Aetna had for 2 1/2  
years delayed and denied approval for treatment of Goodrich's 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	He said even Goodrich's doctors agreed he needed to be treated  
outside the Aetna network, but Aetna balked. When Goodrich finally 
did receive treatment, Aetna refused to pay for it, Bidart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna attorneys claimed Goodrich sought treatment outside the  
Aetna plan without first getting the HMO's approval. They said 
network doctors could have treated him, but conceded they were 
``inexperienced'' with Goodrich's rare cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna also had said Goodrich was ``never an appropriate  
candidate'' for the experimental treatments because his cancer had 
progressed too far.

<HEADLINE> Families Mourn Slain Sightseers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOCCASIN, Calif. (AP) -- A man whose wife and daughter were  
killed near Yosemite National Park said who ever killed them and a 
family friend from Argentina deserves to die. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll personally pull the switch,'' Jens Sund told The (Santa  
Rosa) Press Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	As Sund came out of seclusion Monday at his Eureka home, other  
relatives gathered on a grassy hill here where searchers discovered 
the body of 15-year-old Julie Sund. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm dealing with emotions that I've been told to expect, yet  
when they happen to me they're completely unexpected,'' Sund said 
at an afternoon news conference in Eureka. ``Reaching for the phone 
to call my wife is one of them. It's bizarre. It's unusual, yet 
it's been happening frequently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, later Monday, Francis and Carole Carrington, Raquel  
Pelosso and her daughter Paula, 20, along with the FBI agent 
leading the investigation, James Maddock, and an FBI chaplain, Mark 
O'Sullivan, walked down a narrow dirt trail in Moccasin to the site 
where Julie Sund's body was found. 
</P>
<P>
	On the steep hillside, they planted tulips, daisies, roses and  
Easter lilies and left a white teddy bear with a red heart. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't understand very much,'' said O'Sullivan. ``Give us  
peace. These things before us are confusing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Julie's body was the last of the three to be discovered.  
</P>
<P>
	About a week earlier, Sund's wife, Carole, was identified as one  
of the bodies burnt beyond recognition in the trunk of the women's 
torched rental car. The FBI says the second body likely is that of 
Silvina Pelosso, 16, of Cordoba, Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	The three women were last seen alive Feb. 15 at a lodge in El  
Portal, after spending the day at Yosemite National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been charged in the killings.

<HEADLINE> Korean Pitcher Impresses D-Backs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Arizona Diamondbacks manager Buck Showalter got  
his first up-close look at South Korean right-hander Byung-Hyun Kim 
in action Monday and came away extremely impressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was exactly what we were told about him by our scouts,''  
Showalter said. ``He's got a great look in his eye. He's so excited 
and so are we. We're very lucky to have him. We try to keep in mind 
that he's just 20 years old, but he's an interesting guy, in more 
ways than one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Showalter did nothing to diminish speculation that Kim could  
make the big league roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously he's got a live arm. There are a lot of things to  
like about him,'' Showalter said. ``We'll sit down probably 
tomorrow and decide what the best direction is to go with him from 
here on out. I wouldn't rule out anything right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, who arrived in Arizona Sunday after a 13-hour plane ride  
from South Korea, threw 26 pitches in the bullpen after the 
Diamondbacks' game with the Milwaukee Brewers. He said he has five 
pitches, all thrown from a nasty sidearm, almost underhand, 
delivery at a high-velocity powered by stocky, muscular legs. His 
fastball, scouts say, is in the low 90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Included in his repertoire are two sliders, one that sinks and  
one that rises. The rising slider particularly raised eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a Frisbee-type slider but it's hard,'' pitching  
coach Marc Connor said. ``A lot of guys who throw from under there, 
their breaking balls are slow and soft. His is quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connor had a hard time containing his enthusiasm.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's as good as advertised,'' Conner said. ``I mean, he can't  
throw the ball straight. Everything moves. It looks like he 
rotates. He hasn't been on the mound for six days and he's right 
around the plate with everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim said through an interpreter that he was throwing ``about 80  
percent'' of his full strength. ``It was my first time throwing to 
an American catcher and there were a lot of people watching, so I 
was a little nervous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim got a $2.25 million signing bonus from Arizona, and the  
Diamondbacks are intrigued with the idea of making him a part of 
what already is a formidable pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now,'' Kim said when asked when he'd like to be with the  
big-league club. ``Mentally I am ready right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Kim pronounced himself ``a starting pitcher,'' he  
likely would be used as a set-up man out of the bullpen if he is on 
the Diamondbacks' opening-day roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Catcher Damian Miller said Kim ``has big-league stuff --  
definitely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't throw too many strikes, but his ball was moving all  
over the place,'' Miller said. ``He was probably pretty nervous.''

<HEADLINE> Exclusionary Rule Challenge Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today rejected a Florida  
woman's appeal to decide whether a judge-made rule that keeps 
illegally seized evidence out of criminal trials applies when a 
convicted criminal is sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, without comment, turned away an opportunity to  
clarify the reach of the so-called exclusionary rule, which the 
Supreme Court created in 1914 to deter misconduct by law 
enforcement officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule bars evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth  
Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. 
</P>
<P>
	In a series of recent rulings, the court has narrowed the  
circumstances in which the rule can be invoked. As a result, 
prosecutors now can use evidence illegally seized by police in all 
deportation cases, grand jury and civil tax hearings and in some 
other legal proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices never have ruled that the exclusionary rule does  
not apply to sentencing, but the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
did so in upholding Alishia Pryor's prison sentence for her crack 
cocaine conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Pryor pleaded guilty in 1997 to possessing and intending to  
distribute the 22.4 grams of crack cocaine police found in her car 
while arresting her. 
</P>
<P>
	Police that same day also searched Pryor's home, where they  
found another 391.3 grams of the illegal drug. But authorities 
concede that the court warrant police used to enter her home was 
defective. 
</P>
<P>
	Court records do not disclose Pryor's hometown, but her federal  
prosecution took place in the district court based in Tallahassee. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a plea bargain, prosecutors agreed not to use as  
evidence any of the cocaine taken from Pryor's home. But that 
evidence was used when Pryor was sentenced to 11 years and four 
months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Her self-authored appeal said federal sentencing guidelines  
would have yielded a prison term about half that long if her 
sentence had been based only the cocaine found in her car. 
</P>
<P>
	``Evidence obtained illegally ... should not be included in the  
information at sentencing,'' Pryor's Supreme Court appeal 
contended. The 11th Circuit court rejected that argument. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by the justices to respond to Pryor's appeal, Justice  
Department lawyers said the appeals court was right. 
</P>
<P>
	``In declining to extend the exclusionary rule to sentencing  
proceedings, the court of appeals ... correctly balanced the 
competing interests,'' the government lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Extension of the exclusionary rule to sentencing would not  
likely provide a significant deterrent to illegal searches and 
seizures,'' they said. ``Police officers already are deterred ... 
by the knowledge that the direct and indirect fruits of such 
violations will be excluded at the criminal trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Pryor vs. U.S., 98-7046.

<HEADLINE> Rogers Won't Start A's Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Needing more time to rebuild his arm strength  
after a bout of elbow tendinitis, Kenny Rogers on Monday was ruled 
out as the Oakland Athletics' opening night starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Art Howe said he hasn't decided who will start against  
Roger Clemens and the defending World Series champion New York 
Yankees next Monday night. The most likely are Jimmy Haynes and Tom 
Candiotti, who like Rogers has lost pitching time this spring due 
to injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers, a former Yankee who led the A's in wins last season with  
16, has missed about half of spring training because of soreness in 
his left elbow caused by a bone spur. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors examined him and told him he could pitch once the  
inflammation subsided, but he has made only three spring outings, 
most recently Friday, when he threw three innings against the San 
Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Howe said last week he had no doubt Rogers would be able to make  
his first scheduled start, but Rogers met with Howe and pitching 
coach Rick Peterson on Sunday and said he hadn't had enough time to 
prepare. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them point blank I'm not ready to pitch,'' Rogers said.  
``I think they knew. I guess they were just waiting for me to tell 
them. You always want to throw on the hill every time you're 
supposed to, but it wouldn't help me if I went out there opening 
day, not being able to compete. It doesn't help the A's. I didn't 
feel I had a good shot to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under a revised rotation, Rogers will be pushed back to No. 4  
and will start April 9 at Seattle. He is expected to pitch about 
four innings against Anaheim on Tuesday and six innings during an 
intrasquad game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can get him out two more times before he actually  
pitches, it will only help,'' Howe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers was hesitant to commit to pitching April 9.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel OK, but when I just throw 45 pitches before my last  
start of the spring, I just don't feel that's enough,'' he said. 
``I need to be at a pitch count where if you're struggling through 
some innings, you've still got enough to get out of it. Having one 
more (spring) start may help. At least it will get me closer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Candiotti, who received a cortisone shot to relieve soreness in  
his left knee, hasn't pitched in a spring game since March 12 but 
has been throwing on the side for a week. He declined to comment on 
the possibility of starting the opener, saying the coaching staff 
hadn't approached him about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Haynes, who went 11-9 with a 5.09 ERA in his first full season  
in the majors last year, said he hasn't been approached either but 
would be ready if asked. 
</P>
<P>
	He took the possibility of facing the Cy Young Award-winning  
Clemens in stride. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, you have to face their No. 1 starter but sooner or later  
you're going to have to face a No. 1 starter anyway,'' Haynes said. 
``Things get mixed up and guys go different days during the season. 
That's why my approach is, you just have to go right after 'em. 
It's the first game of the season but you don't dwell on that.''

<HEADLINE> Krayzelburg Sets Backstroke Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST MEADOW, N.Y. (AP) -- Lenny Krayzelburg broke the American  
record in the 200-meter backstroke with the second-fastest 
performance in history Monday night at the Phillips 66 National 
Swimming Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Krayzelburg swam the distance in 1 minute, 56.95 seconds, just  
.38 seconds off Martin Zubero's 1991 world record. Krayzelburg now 
owns five of the top 11 performances in history. His former record 
of 1:57.38 was set at the 1998 summer nationals. 
</P>
<P>
	Krayzelburg, who won the 100-meter and 200 backstrokes at the  
1998 World Championships, spent three weeks this January resting 
his strained lower back, so breaking the record was a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shock to me,'' Krayzelburg said. ``I've been feeling  
really good in workouts, so I felt like I should be able to go 
pretty fast. I was thinking 1:58 low or 1:57 high. I feel like I'm 
getting really close to the world record. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a big confidence boost. I just rested for four days  
for this meet. It gives me great confidence for the summer season 
coming up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krayzelburg, 23, who resides in Studio City, Calif., is  
originally from Odessa, Russia, and represents the Trojan Swim 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same championship final, Aaron Piersol, 15, of Irvine,  
Calif., finished third in 1:59.88 to become the youngest American 
to break two minutes in the event. 
</P>
<P>
	The meet continues through Thursday.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Given that proximity to power is the ultimate  
symbol of hip in this town, five-term Illinois Republican Rep. Tom 
Ewing couldn't get much cooler. 
</P>
<P>
	The close friendship between the plain-speaking, farmer-by-trade  
Ewing and fellow Illinois GOP Rep. Dennis Hastert became known as 
soon as it was clear that Hastert would be the next House speaker. 
Now, Ewing's role as trusted confidant of the man third in line for 
the presidency has been broadcast for all: Hastert gave his pal an 
office in the speaker's suite in the Capitol building. 
</P>
<P>
	Hideaway offices in the Capitol are a coveted perk for a select  
few House members. For those who get them -- mostly members of 
leadership and committee heads -- the spaces are an impressive, 
handy alternative to official congressional offices. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hastert spokesman John Feehery said he was not aware of  
another instance in which a speaker has given an office in his 
Capitol quarters to a fellow member. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing already had a hideaway. As part of House Majority Whip Tom  
DeLay's vaunted vote-counting team, Ewing occupied a modest, 
closet-sized space in the Texas Republican's suite. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ewing recently moved up -- in real estate as well as  
influence. 
</P>
<P>
	The only thing lacking in the well-appointed third-floor office  
-- complete with built-in bookshelves, a chandelier, new furniture 
and a fresh coat of paint -- is a window. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the only sign Ewing's star has risen with Hastert's.  
</P>
<P>
	Hastert appointed Ewing to the House Administration Committee,  
the panel overseeing all congressional operations on which speakers 
need an emissary. At a St. Patrick's Day lunch Hastert held in the 
Capitol for visiting politicians involved in the Northern Ireland 
peace process, Ewing joined the head table along with President 
Clinton, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern and the speaker. And he 
joined Hastert for a four-day trade mission to Europe this week. 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't taken long for lobbyists and fellow colleagues to  
notice. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing said his office has seen a jump in the number of people  
requesting meetings with him and his staff, thinking he is now the 
go-to guy to get something whispered in Hastert's ear. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is something that people know,'' Ewing said by telephone  
from his new digs. ``Whether they say so or not, it can't hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert and Ewing have much in common, as no-frills Midwestern  
conservatives from rural districts who are known more as 
behind-the-scenes operators than as party firebrands. 
</P>
<P>
	They also have a nearly two-decade history together. They served  
together in the Illinois House, and when Hastert left for Congress 
in 1987, Ewing followed four years later. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's someone that the speaker can constantly trust in terms of  
finding out about what's going on in the conference,'' Feehery 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing says it is tempting to use his newfound influence. But  
though he's not afraid to do it when he thinks he should, he knows 
better than to wear out his welcome on the speaker's mat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't asked for things from the speaker. Generally, things  
happen anyway,'' Ewing said. ``And you want to be sure that you 
continue to earn that friendship and trust.''

<HEADLINE> Fatal Shooting Rocks NY Police Dept </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After weeks of demonstrations that led to some  
1,000 arrests and a siege-like atmosphere at Police Headquarters, 
the protests over the fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man 
may be ending. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Al Sharpton said Sunday the daily protests would end  
today, perhaps taking some heat off a department buffeted by a 
series of embarrassing incidents that has thrown the nation's 
largest police force into its worst crisis in years. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sharpton said the behind-the-scenes pressure on the New York  
Police Department over its tactics and relations with minorities in 
the city will persist long after the protesters have gone. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's troubles come just two years after it was  
riding high on news that the city's crime rate was dropping, with 
murders under 1,000 annually for the first time in 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
	What's created the most anger is the case of Amadou Diallo, an  
unarmed West African immigrant shot to death by police in a Bronx 
apartment vestibule. The police, apparently believing Diallo was 
reaching for a gun, fired 41 bullets at him. He was hit by 19 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
	In daily protests outside Police Headquarters since March 9,  
charges have been hurled against police of prejudice against the 
black man and protesters have demanded the four white police 
officers be jailed. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a source close to the case, a Bronx grand jury  
indicted four New York Police officers last Friday on second-degree 
murder charges in the Diallo case. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some have hinted that protests will continue elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
	And the protesters have other cases to cite in their charge of  
police misconduct: 
</P>
<P>
	-- In Brooklyn, jury selection was to begin today for the trial  
of four other officers accused of brutalizing a Haitian immigrant, 
Abner Louima, in 1997. The trial -- centering on allegations 
officers sodomized the victim with a stick in a precinct 
stationhouse -- could stretch into summer. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Despite the Diallo controversy, Police Commissioner Howard  
Safir jetted off on an Academy Awards junket. He returned last week 
to find himself under fire for being insensitive to the anger in 
the Diallo case and possibly violating city conflict-of-interest 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	-- As many as 20 Manhattan cops may soon be indicted in what the  
tabloids have dubbed the ``sex-for-protection scandal.'' The 
officers have already been stripped of their guns and badges based 
on allegations they were getting free sex in a 60-woman brothel in 
exchange for shielding it from raids. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The federal Civil Rights Commission, U.S. Attorney's offices  
for both the Southern and Eastern districts of New York and State 
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer all have started investigations into 
the NYPD and how it disciplines its own. The commission will hold 
hearings in May on whether its ``stop-and-frisk'' tactics -- 
especially in minority neighborhoods -- violate the public's rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the more than 1,000 people arrested in the daily protests  
have been prominent whites, Latinos and Asians, as well as blacks. 
And high-ranking politicians have criticized city leaders for not 
paying more attention to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Minorities are humiliated and angered by the indignity of  
being treated all too often as presumptive criminals,'' said Sen. 
Charles Schumer in a speech calling on the department to close the 
racial rift. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's trouble have also sullied Mayor Rudolph  
Giuliani. In Sunday's editions, a Daily News poll found the mayor's 
popularity at an all-time low, with a 40 percent approval rating, 
down from 60 percent in November and 65 percent a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, Safir and the powerful Patrolmen's Benevolent  
Association have defended the 40,000-officer force, reminding New 
Yorkers that crime rates are at their lowest level in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent days, off-duty cops staged a counter-protest  
supporting the officers in the Diallo case. And Giuliani scoffed at 
reports that U.S. Attorney Zachary Carter may be preparing to order 
federal monitoring the department. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before you can start talking about federal micro-managing of  
this police department, there are about 200 police departments you 
have to put ahead of it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani had a similar response when a task force created after  
the Louima incident suggested a special monitor oversee brutality 
cases. The mayor said the panel's plans were ``unrealistic and make 
very little sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Task force member Norman Siegel, executive director of the New  
York Civil Liberties Union, said Giuliani has been proven wrong. 
``Maybe if he'd listened to us then, he wouldn't have this 
problem,'' Siegel said.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Supreme Court took the following actions Monday:  
</P>
<P>
	--Refused to revive an affirmative-action program once used by  
the Dallas Fire Department to promote more blacks, Hispanics and 
women. Over two dissenting votes, the justices let stand a ruling 
that struck down the program as discriminatory against white men. 
</P>
<P>
	--Let the federal government continue giving companies owned by  
poorer people extra help in winning contracts on federal highway 
projects. The court turned away arguments in a Utah case that the 
affirmative-action program adopted by Congress unlawfully 
discriminates against companies owned by white men. 
</P>
<P>
	--Agreed to study the case of a Pennsylvania man whose conviction  
in a hazardous waste case was upheld even though his co-defendant's 
conviction was thrown out. The justices are being urged to rule 
that it is unlawful to keep him in prison after the state's highest 
court ruled that his co-defendant was prosecuted under the wrong 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	--Turned away a Florida woman's appeal asking the court to decide  
whether a judge-made rule that keeps illegally seized evidence out 
of criminal trials applies when a convicted criminal is sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rejected the appeal of a Utah man whose request to give the  
opening prayer at a city council meeting was turned down because of 
its unusual content. The court, without comment, rebuffed arguments 
that the city council in Murray City, Utah, unlawfully favored one 
religion over another by rejecting the proposed prayer, called a 
political harangue by a lower court.

<HEADLINE> Mars Probe Deploys Antenna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The Mars Global Surveyor has  
successfully unfolded its high-gain antenna that had been retracted 
against the spacecraft's body since it was launched in November 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``The antenna is deployed and we just got telemetry,'' Mary  
Hardin, a spokeswoman for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said 
Sunday evening. ``Everything looks like it's working perfectly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the deployed position, the dish-shaped antenna can move on  
gimbals to transmit data to Earth and receive commands while the 
spacecraft's instruments continuously map the planet. 
</P>
<P>
	The antenna had been kept folded after Mars Global Surveyor  
began mapping the red planet earlier this month because of the 
possibility that a mechanism to dampen the force of the boom's 
deployment would not work. 
</P>
<P>
	Mission managers decided to get about three weeks of mapping  
data during a so-called contingency mission before deploying the 
6.6-foot boom with its all-important communications antenna. 
</P>
<P>
	That required stopping mapping operations of Mars at intervals  
and turning the entire spacecraft so the antenna would point toward 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Mars Global Surveyor has a camera to make wide- and narrow-angle  
images of Mars, and a laser altimeter to measure height and depth 
of surface features by bouncing pulses of light off the planet. 
</P>
<P>
	It also carries a thermal emission spectrometer to scan for heat  
being transferred from the planet to the atmosphere and to map 
mineral composition, and a magnetometer to gather data that can be 
used to understand the interior of Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	Mars Global Surveyor was to have begun mapping in mid-March 1998  
but a problem with one of its two solar panels forced mission 
officials to ease the craft into the right orbit much more slowly 
than planned.

<HEADLINE> Border Patrol Interviews Survivors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Border Patrol officials are interviewing  
survivors of a deadly crash, trying to learn why an agent drove off 
a 1,200-foot embankment, killing him and three of the seven men he 
apparently had arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven men were suspected of attempting to enter the United  
States illegally, Border Patrol spokeswoman Gloria Chavez said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Stephen M. Sullivan, 27, and three of his passengers were  
killed Saturday morning when his Ford Bronco plunged down the 
embankment in a remote area that is dangerous both for its 
treacherous terrain and for the thieves who prowl the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the most rural and rugged areas we have in San  
Diego County,'' Border Patrol spokesman Mario Villareal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the survivors were released from a hospital and taken  
into custody by the Border Patrol. The other two survivors were 
expected to be taken into custody soon, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The same conditions that make the area treacherous also make it  
attractive for border crossers, who in recent years have been 
crossing in more remote areas in the wake of Operation Gatekeeper, 
a federal program that has increased the Border Patrol's presence 
in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities believe Sullivan took the seven men into custody  
after they crossed the border illegally in the mountains about 40 
miles east of San Diego. Then, he may have failed to negotiate a 
turn in the morning fog about a half mile north of the border. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it wasn't immediately known exactly where Sullivan  
picked up his passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the injured men approached an agent driving nearby  
about 7 a.m. Saturday and told him about the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of a Border Patrol internal investigation into the  
incident are not likely to be made public, Villareal said, adding: 
``This was a tragedy, but I don't think at this point we will 
change our operation.''

<HEADLINE> Moore's Stop Key in NCAA Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Ricky Moore made sure the names  
Langdon and Laettner didn't become synonymous. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, the most famous defensive specialist in America, forced  
Trajan Langdon to travel with seconds ticking down and Duke 
trailing by one in the NCAA championship game Monday night. Langdon 
lost the ball again, and Connecticut celebrated its first national 
title with a 77-74 victory over Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	When it was over, Moore raised his arms to the crowd and walked  
off the court, a rare player who lifted his team to championship 
heights just because he could guard anybody. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Laettner, who was sitting in the stands, beat UConn  
with an incredible buzzer-beater on an inbounds play in the 1990 
regional final. This time, Moore made certain that Langdon didn't 
even get to attempt the game-winning shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been privileged to play two of the greatest basketball  
games,'' UConn coach Jim Calhoun said. ``In the other one, in 1990, 
Christian Laettner made that shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laettner didn't have Moore guarding him.  
</P>
<P>
	After UConn point guard Khalid El-Amin lofted an airball on a  
tough running jumper, Langdon got the ball with UConn leading 
75-74. Duke didn't call a timeout. 
</P>
<P>
	Dribbling between his legs before spinning and driving on Moore,  
Langdon got his feet tangled and traveled with 5.4 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin hit two free throws, and UConn did what few thought was  
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard Coach K tell Trajan to go get the ball,'' Moore said.  
``I felt if he got it, he wasn't going to do anything with it. It 
was crunch time. It was me against him. They tried to clear it out, 
but I stayed solid, I stayed down. I didn't go for any pump-fakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fortunately, he traveled.''  
</P>
<P>
	Moore sent Duke reeling for the first time in the Blue Devils'  
dominant season with seven points during a 15-4 run in the first 
half. But his biggest play, one that kids in his native Augusta, 
Ga., will be talking about on the playgrounds for years, came as 
Langdon was poised to shoot down UConn's quest for an upset. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had Ricky Moore,'' teammate Kevin Freeman said. ``No one  
could stop him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On offense, or defense.  
</P>
<P>
	Moore, who had all of his 13 points in the first half with a  
rare offensive outburst, made quite a name for himself in this 
tournament with a talent that usually goes unheralded. He held Ohio 
State's Scoonie Penn to 11 points and 3-for-13 shooting in the 
national semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
	This came after stellar defensive performances earlier this  
season against Michigan State's Mateen Cleaves (2-for-15) and 
Stanford's Arthur Lee (4-for-13). 
</P>
<P>
	Guarding his boyhood friend William Avery for some of the game,  
he started paying more attention to Langdon in the second half. And 
when Langdon got the ball in the closing seconds, the Ricky Radar 
was locked in. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore got in position as Langdon leaned forward and glided  
confidently downcourt, looking a little like Grant Hill. After a 
fearless display of between-the-legs dribbling, Langdon tried to 
spin on Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	Big mistake. The whistle blew, and Duke had blown it.  
</P>
<P>
	After El-Amin's free throws, Langdon tried to redeem himself  
with a drive down the sideline through heavy traffic, but lost the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Moore's defensive clinic -- and UConn's long wait for a  
national title -- was over.

<HEADLINE> Jobs Key Issue in Coming Auto Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- United Auto Workers President Stephen Yokich is  
giving no indication that his union's troubled relations with 
General Motors Corp. have improved since last year's costly strikes 
virtually shut down the No. 1 automaker's North American 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have our problems,'' Yokich told about 2,000 union  
leaders Sunday as they gathered to set an agenda for this year's 
national contract talks with GM, Ford Motor Co. and the Chrysler 
unit of DaimlerChrysler AG. 
</P>
<P>
	Yokich said job security again would be the UAW's priority when  
it begins the triennial contract talks in June on behalf of about 
396,000 U.S. workers. And he leveled his most pointed attack yet on 
GM's plans to reduce labor costs at its small-car plants through 
``modular'' assembly methods. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer's strikes at two parts plants in Flint lasted  
several weeks and cost GM about $2 billion while they idled nearly 
200,000 GM workers and thousands of employees at independent 
suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute was largely over job security and ``outsourcing,''  
the practice of contracting in-house work to outside suppliers who 
generally pay less and typically are nonunion. GM, which once made 
most of its parts, is moving toward becoming largely a designer and 
assembler of vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the strikes, GM has announced plans to convert its aging  
U.S. small-car plants to modular assembly, in which outside 
suppliers perform much of subassembly work now done on the assembly 
plant floor. 
</P>
<P>
	In a modular plant, preassembled parts clusters, such as an  
entire dashboard, are delivered to the assembly plant by outside 
suppliers and installed on the chassis. Far fewer UAW workers would 
be needed to assemble each car, significantly reducing 
manufacturing costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing new about modular assembly,'' Yokich said.  
``It's just another word for ... outsourcing. It's just another way 
to destroy good-paying jobs and benefits, that we intend to deal 
with in this round of negotiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW argues that modular assembly will give the automaker  
less control over design and quality, increase logistical 
complexity and potentially add to warranty costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Yokich bristled at suggestions that GM loses money on its small  
cars because of its labor costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They claim they lose $1,000 on every small car they build  
themselves. It's funny, their competitors -- Ford and Chrysler -- 
never lose anything on their small cars. So is it our fault or 
their fault in how they run their plants? It certainly isn't our 
fault.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yokich also chastised GM for failing to consult with the UAW  
before it decided to spin off its big parts unit. GM had an initial 
public offering of nearly 18 percent of Delphi Automotive Systems 
stock earlier this year and plans to spin off the rest of the 
company to GM shareholders by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	The move has scared Delphi workers and retirees, said Yokich,  
who implied that the spinoff was being conducted with little, if 
any, consultation with UAW leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	GM spokesman Pat Morrissey said the company would have no  
comment on Yokich's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Yokich also attacked the high salaries paid to the industry's  
top executives, and singled out the multimillion-dollar stock 
options that former Chrysler Corp. executives will reap as a result 
of the deal that created DaimlerChrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was good enough for them to get all that money because  
they sold off to Daimler, it should be good enough for us,'' Yokich 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yokich said Mercedes-Benz, the German luxury car unit of  
DaimlerChrysler that operates a nonunion assembly plant in Alabama, 
should be under the UAW contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The veteran union leader had no criticism of Ford, which has the  
best relationship with the UAW among the three automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Yokich said the union will begin bargaining with the company  
that presents the best initial proposal. In 1996, the UAW 
negotiated first with Ford and used that deal as a pattern for 
pacts with Chrysler and GM. The current three-year contracts expire 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW gained more workers than it lost in 1998, the first time  
that has happened since 1989, Yokich said. Much of the gain, 
however, has come in businesses outside the auto industry, such as 
health care and government.

<HEADLINE> Electric Deregulation Report Issued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Electricity deregulation would cut rates for  
consumers in 26 states, but increase them in 19 other states, says 
a report made public Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department report doesn't say how much rates  
would go up, but says rural America would need a ``safety net'' 
ranging from $1 billion in 2000 to $2.4 billion in 2015 to offset 
the costs of competitive pricing. 
</P>
<P>
	The report predicts increased competition would lower rates for  
consumers in 26 states, mainly in the Southwest, Northeast and 
southern Plains, but the rates would go up in the Pacific 
Northwest, Mountain states, Mid-South and in the northern Plains, 
as well as in some Great Lakes states. The report focused on the 45 
states with rural electric cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen states have already moved toward opening their  
electricity markets. But efforts in Congress to enact deregulation 
legislation have bogged down in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration announced a deregulation plan last  
year that it said would save consumers $20 billion a year. It would 
call for open competition nationwide among electricity suppliers by 
2003 but would also let states ``opt out'' of the program if they 
believed competition would not help them. 
</P>
<P>
	While the report does not dispute the administration's view that  
it would save consumers $20 billion, it found the savings will be 
concentrated in some states, while consumers would face substantial 
costs in other states. 
</P>
<P>
	An Agriculture Department spokesman, Andrew Kauders, said the  
report was leaked before it was finished and that people should not 
draw conclusions from it. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., sent copies of the report to all  
Oregon legislators and urged them to resist a push for electricity 
deregulation. He wanted to release the report this week because an 
Oregon state Senate committee is expected to take up a bill that 
would advance deregulation, said Jeff Stier, a DeFazio aide. 
</P>
<P>
	If consumers are forced into deregulated electricity markets,  
DeFazio wrote, their electric rates will increase while their 
quality of service declines, adding: ``The ongoing failures of 
cable television and telephone deregulation are pretty good

<HEADLINE> How Garth Brooks Fared on Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- How it went for Garth Brooks on Monday at  
spring training for the San Diego Padres: 
</P>
<P>
	 *COUNTRY CAMPER:* Brooks went in as a defensive replacement for  
Reggie Sanders in the seventh inning of San Diego's 9-0 loss to 
Anaheim. He went 0-for-1, striking out against right-hander Mike 
Fyhrie. 
</P>
<P>
	 *LOW NOTE:* Brooks struck out on three pitches. He took a pretty  
good cut at the first pitch and hit a foul ball down the 
right-field line. He then swung and missed at two nasty sliders. 
</P>
<P>
	 *ON THE RECORD:* ``He hit the foul ball pretty good,'' manager  
Bruce Bochy said. ``Then the guy dropped the hammer on him twice.''

<HEADLINE> Reverse-Discrimination Suit Refused </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to revive a  
reverse-discrimination challenge to a program that gives companies 
owned by disadvantaged people extra help in winning contracts for 
federal highway projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, without comment, turned away arguments that the  
affirmative action program adopted by Congress unlawfully 
discriminates against companies owned by white men. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's action in a case from Utah was not a decision and cannot  
be read as a court endorsement of the federal program. The justices 
merely refused to review the dispute and thereby left intact a 
lower court's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program requires that no  
less than 10 percent of all federally funded highway construction 
contracts be awarded to ``small business concerns ... owned and 
controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged 
individuals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the federal laws encompassing the program defines ``small  
business concern'' as one with less than $16.6 million in annual 
average gross revenue for the preceding three years. The program 
also presumes that racial minorities and women who own small 
businesses are ``socially and economically disadvantaged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That presumption was challenged by Cache Valley Electrical Co.  
after it lost out on two 1995 contracts for work on federally 
funded highway projects in Utah. Both times the company submitted 
the lowest bids but contractors awarded electrical subcontracts to 
disadvantaged business enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
	Cache Valley Electrical is owned by Jack Laub, who is white. His  
company sued the Utah Department of Transportation, which was 
supervising the projects. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge David Winder threw out the lawsuit after  
ruling that Cache Valley Electrical lacked the legal standing to 
sue because it could not prove that the program's challenged 
presumptions in favor of women and racial minorities had hurt it. 
</P>
<P>
	Laub's company is not a ``small'' business because its annual  
gross revenues are about $41 million, the judge noted, so it could 
not have participated in the program even if the challenged 
presumptions were struck down. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge discounted as ``too speculative'' Laub's contention  
that striking down the presumptions would mean many fewer 
businesses could qualify as disadvantaged and would force more 
waivers from the federal 10 percent set-aside requirement. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lawsuit's  
dismissal last July. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, Cache Valley Electrical was  
represented by William Perry Pendley of Denver, the winning lawyer 
in a 1995 Supreme Court decision that endangered many federal 
affirmative action programs by curtailing the special help offered 
to racial minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	In that ruling, the justices said courts must hold Congress and  
the president to the same strict standards as state and local 
governments when determining whether they have discriminated 
against whites. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyers urged the court to reject Cache  
Valley Electrical's appeal, saying those who mounted the challenge 
leading to the 1995 decision could prove they had been hurt by a 
federal set-aside program. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Cache Valley Electrical Co. vs. Utah Department of  
Transportation, 98-579.

<HEADLINE> Duke, UConn Final Was Predictable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- How fitting.  
</P>
<P>
	Way back in November the seers of college basketball put Duke  
and Connecticut atop the preseason poll. On Monday night, those 
teams will decide the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	No other schools held the No. 1 ranking this season, and it's  
been 34 years since two teams in that position played for the 
title, with UCLA beating Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have the two of us playing for the national championship is  
terrific,'' Blue Devils coach Mike Krzyzewski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke (37-1) has won 32 straight games, and another win would  
give it the NCAA record for victories in a season and its third 
championship of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski has taken the Blue Devils to the Final Four eight  
times since 1986, and on Monday he could become just the fourth 
coach with three or more championships. 
</P>
<P>
	His 48-12 tournament record also makes him the winningest active  
coach. Former North Carolina coach Dean Smith has the only better 
total, 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun, making his first Final Four  
appearance, is well aware of Krzyzewski's impressive credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you talk about Final Fours, you're talking about Mike  
Krzyzewski,'' said Calhoun, who's in his 27th season as a head 
coach, the last 13 with the Huskies. ``He's the coach for our 
generation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Third-ranked Connecticut (33-2) hasn't exactly been a slouch in  
the '90s, either. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies have made seven regional semifinal appearances --  
tied for the most in that span -- and three in regional championship 
games. The first of those was a 79-78 loss to Duke when Christian 
Laettner hit a jumper on an inbounds play at the buzzer in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, for us, excellence hasn't been enough in the  
'90s,'' Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since the brackets were announced two weeks ago,  
Connecticut has been looking ahead to the game most people saw as 
the tournament's best all along. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've played this game in our minds and now we get to a chance  
to do it,'' Huskies center Jake Voskuhl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke comes in off a 68-62 victory over second-ranked Michigan  
State in the semifinals, a tough game in which the Blue Devils 
scored their fewest points this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came out of that game in good health and it certainly was a  
very physical game,'' said Krzyzewski, who decided not to have the 
team practice Sunday. Instead, the team just went over some 
scouting material. 
</P>
<P>
	Win or lose, the Blue Devils will end their season on the same  
floor they did last year. 
</P>
<P>
	They lost to eventual national champion Kentucky in the South  
Regional final at Tropicana Field after leading by 17 points in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke's Trajan Langdon said that loss has provided some  
motivation, but he added that not a whole is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``In UConn being the only other team ranked number one in the  
nation and a lot of people saying that's the best team, it's a 
great way to finish the year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke won't end the year with an unprecedented double  
championship. The Blue Devils lost 62-45 Sunday night to Purdue in 
the women's championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Duke men, who lead the nation in scoring at 92.3 per game,  
are also No. 1 in margin of victory (25.4), just off their NCAA 
tournament average of 25.2 
</P>
<P>
	``Duke's not a difficult team to prepare for,'' Calhoun said,  
``they're a difficult team to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that Duke is the heavy favorite doesn't seem to matter  
to Connecticut, which beat Ohio State 64-58 in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``At 33-2, we've been a pretty good team ourselves. We have been  
brilliant at times. We have been pragmatic at times. We have 
survived at times,'' Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very few teams have been afforded the opportunity to have the  
kind of season Duke has had,'' he said. ``Be that as it may, the 
game comes down to 40 minutes Monday night, not what some folks 
think it should be, would be, could be. It comes down to two teams 
that won 70 basketball games this season.''

<HEADLINE> Bure Out for Season With Torn ACL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Pavel Bure's first season with the Florida Panthers  
is over after just 11 games, lost to the second reconstructive 
surgery on his right knee in less than four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-scoring Russian underwent surgery Monday in Birmingham,  
Ala., to replace the anterior cruciate ligament in the knee. Dr. 
James Andrews performed the operation, using a portion of Bure's 
patellar tendon as a substitute. 
</P>
<P>
	Bure faces at least six months of rehabilitation, meaning he  
might not be ready when training camp rolls around next September. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be a hard summer for him,'' Panthers general manager  
Bryan Murray said in a conference call late Monday night. Murray 
engineered the seven-player deal that brought Bure from Vancouver 
two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Bure, who sat out the season's first three months while  
demanding the Canucks trade him, also missed three weeks in 
February when the same knee was strained. He finishes the year with 
13 goals and three assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came to the conclusion to just get the operation done  
now,'' Murray said. ``We'll sacrifice him for the balance of year 
to have him for the balance of his career, which we hope will be a 
long one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Within four weeks of the trade, the Panthers had Bure locked up  
for the long term with a contract extension which will pay him 
$47.5 million over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bure had not seen action since March 3, a 7-5 loss to the  
Colorado Avalanche in which he was bent backward by an open-ice 
check from Adam Foote in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
	Bure continued to play and scored three goals in the first two  
periods as Florida jumped to a 5-0 lead. But he sat out the third 
as the Avalanche roared back with seven goals. 
</P>
<P>
	He underwent surgery to repair torn cartilage, which also  
revealed the ligament damage. Bure hoped to put off another 
operation until after the season, but rehabilitation and a brace 
did not make the knee strong enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``A number of players have came back and played without the  
ACL,'' Murray said, mentioning Pittsburgh's Darius Kasparaitis as 
an example. ``But he worked out and did therapy, the knee was 
loose. He didn't feel he could function the way he wanted to. 
Stopping and starting and things he needs to be really successful 
weren't coming to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The knee is the same one on which Bure had reconstructive  
surgery in late 1995. He played only 15 games before suffering the 
injury Nov. 9 against Chicago, but came back to score 23 goals in 
1996-97. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors told Bure they expect the knee to come back 100 percent  
once again, Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
	The news is a huge blow to the Panthers, who are struggling to  
stay alive in the Eastern Conference playoff chase. Florida trails 
Boston by five points for the final playoff berth and also is five 
behind Carolina for the Southeast Division lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials did not plan to address Bure's surgery until  
practice on Tuesday, Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They knew he was hurting,'' he said. ``They've taken it upon  
themselves to try as hard as they possibly can to stay competitive 
in this race.''

<HEADLINE> New Home Sales Decline in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New home sales declined 2 percent in February,  
the third consecutive drop since they hit a record high last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans purchased new homes at a seasonally adjusted annual  
rate of 881,000 last month, a five-month low and down from 899,000 
in January, the Commerce Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Though down considerably from the record 985,000 pace in  
November, the February sales rate was nevertheless considered 
strong. Sales for the first two months of this year are running 1.4 
percent ahead of the same period in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Low unemployment, strong inflation-adjusted income gains, high  
stock prices and low mortgage rates are supporting sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``Demand remains strong from both first-time homebuyers and in  
the move-up segment,'' said economist Lynn Reaser of Bank of 
America Private Bank in Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Existing home sales, tracked by the National Association of  
Realtors, also slipped in February. They were down 0.4 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.02 million, compared with a 
record 5.04 million pace in January. 
</P>
<P>
	While analysts expect continued strong sales for both new and  
used homes, they believe a small increase in mortgage rates -- from 
around 6.75 percent early in the year to about 7 percent currently 
-- along with an expected moderation in the overall economic growth 
rate, will contribute to a modest sales slowdown from last year's 
torrid pace. 
</P>
<P>
	By region, sales of new homes fell 8.7 percent in the West to a  
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 231,000. They declined 7.4 
percent to a rate of 386,000 in the South. They were unchanged at a 
rate of 86,000 in the Northeast and rose 22.9 percent, to a rate of 
177,000 in the Midwest, after a weather-related slump in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, the median price of a new home -- meaning half sold  
for more and half for less -- was $158,000 in February, up 1.3 
percent from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The supply of unsold homes at the end of February totaled  
301,000, the most in two years.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Tournament TV Ratings Tumble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- This weekend's Final Four games provided more of  
the same for CBS: Lackluster contests and tumbling ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday night's semifinals each dropped 10 percent from last  
year's overnight ratings. Even though both games were somewhat 
close at times, neither offered the suspense that CBS wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament to date, with a 6.3 rating and 14 share, is down  
5 percent from last season and even with the 1996 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that anyone who watched the second game between  
Duke and Michigan State really believed that the game was in 
doubt,'' said CBS Sports president Sean McManus. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been fewer buzzer-beaters and more blowouts than in  
the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's Connecticut-Ohio State early game posted a 9.4 and a  
20 share. In 1998, Kentucky's victory over Stanford gained a 
10.5/22. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke's win against Michigan State had a 10.7/18, compared with  
the 11.9/21 for the Utah-North Carolina game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year Kentucky played in an overtime game and our second  
game was very competitive,'' McManus added. ``Also, we had the West 
Coast represented last season with Stanford and Utah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of TV households in the nation  
tuned to a program, and each point represents 994,000 homes. The 
share is the percentage tuned to a program among those televisions 
on at the time.

<HEADLINE> Irabu's Rotation Spot in Question </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- With Hideki Irabu struggling, the Yankees  
said Monday they want to see significant improvement before they 
decide to keep him in their starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed,'' New York manager Joe Torre said two days  
after Irabu was hit hard by Philadelphia. ``He's got to pitch 
better. We expect him to pitch better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu was tagged for six runs and 13 hits in five innings by  
Philadelphia, failed to cover first base on an infield grounder and 
allowed three runners to steal second unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
	He has given up 14 runs -- 13 earned -- and 24 hits in 15 2-3  
innings this spring. Irabu is to make his final spring start 
Thursday against Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's very important on how I perform on Thursday,''  
Irabu said through interpreter George Rose. ``I'm going to go out 
there to do my best and bring my level of pitching up like it's a 
regular season game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees interim manager Don Zimmer, running the dugout while  
Torre recovers from prostate cancer surgery, formally announced 
Monday that Roger Clemens will start the regular season opener 
April 5 at Oakland and David Cone will pitch the home opener April 
9. 
</P>
<P>
	While Orlando Hernandez will start the Yankees second game on  
April 6, Zimmer has not named the starter for the what should be 
Irabu's turn April 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll make the decision when the time comes,'' Zimmer said.  
``I don't think anybody was satisfied with his last outing. We'll 
see what happens his next outing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Irabu continues to falter, the Yankees will turn to Ramiro  
Mendoza, who went 10-2 last season in 41 games -- including 14 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still his spot to lose,'' said pitching coach Mel  
Stottlemyre of Irabu. ``I think he understands he needs to pitch 
well. I'd like to see things happen where he has struggled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Should Irabu be dropped from the starting rotation, he would be  
moved into the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Pettitte, coming back from a strained muscle in his  
throwing elbow, will likely make his second minor-league appearance 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Pettitte was healthy, it would be real easy,'' Zimmer said.  
``Pettitte has made some real good progress. I think it won't be 
long until he's back in the rotation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre said ``it's very questionable'' Pettitte will have  
thrown enough innings to be ready by opening day.

<HEADLINE> Louima Jury Selection Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With tensions running high between police and  
the black community, jury selection began Monday in the trial of 
four white officers accused of torturing a Haitian immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil-rights activists -- who had warned of protests -- and the  
defendants were absent as prospective jurors were ushered into 
federal court in Brooklyn to fill out a long questionnaire on what 
they know about the beating of Abner Louima. 
</P>
<P>
	The atmosphere surrounding the case has been made even more  
volatile by the Feb. 4 killing of another black man, Amadou Diallo, 
an unarmed street vendor from West Africa who died in a hail of 41 
bullets fired by four white officers looking for a rape suspect. 
The officers said they thought Diallo was reaching for a gun in 
front of his home in the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
	Both cases have led to daily demonstrations in front of police  
headquarters in Manhattan. Several prominent figures, including 
former Mayor David Dinkins, actress Susan Sarandon and NAACP leader 
Kweisi Mfume, have been arrested for blocking the entrance. On 
Monday morning, 166 people were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys in the Louima case unsuccessfully tried to  
have the trial moved because of intense publicity and the links 
community leaders have made between his case and that of Diallo. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvyn Kornberg, who is representing Officer Justin Volpe, said  
he would ask the judge to discharge hundreds of potential jurors 
because some were interviewed by television reporters outside the 
courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson concluded that  
``the overall nature of the publicity cannot be characterized as 
inflammatory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The questionnaire represents the first stage of a screening  
process expected to take several days, if not weeks. Nickerson has 
indicated he hopes to have a jury picked for opening arguments on 
April 20. The questionnaire was not made public. 
</P>
<P>
	The four officers are accused of violating Louima's civil rights  
by abusing him after his arrest in a street melee on the night of 
Aug. 9, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The most explosive allegation is that Officer Charles Schwarz  
held down a handcuffed Louima while Volpe, believing the Haitian 
immigrant had punched him, rammed a stick into his rectum and mouth 
in the stationhouse bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Volpe, 26, Schwarz, 33, and two other officers,  
Thomas Bruder, 32, and Thomas Wiese, 35, are charged with beating 
Louima in a patrol car on the way to the stationhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	A fifth defendant, Sgt. Michael Bellomo, 36, is charged with  
covering up both attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Rev. Al Sharpton said protesters would be a  
presence at the Louima trial ``from start to finish.'' But the 
scene outside the courthouse was calm Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Bronx District Attorney Robert T. Johnson said an  
indictment would be unsealed Wednesday in the Diallo case. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Thursday, a source close to the case told The Associated  
Press that all four officers were charged with second-degree murder 
in the sealed indictment.

<HEADLINE> EU, U.S. To Discuss Aircraft Noise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union today delayed for a  
month the adoption of a law on aircraft noise that has led to fears 
of a trade dispute with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States opposes the planned EU noise reduction rules  
for jetliner engines, saying they are discriminatory and would cost 
U.S. industry $1 billion. The U.S. Congress has threatened a flight 
ban on the Franco-British Concorde jetliner in retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	EU transport ministers agreed to delay the law, to give more  
time for consultations with the United States and said amendments 
could be introduced later if a transatlantic compromise was found. 
</P>
<P>
	``The European Union and the United States will work together in  
the coming month to set global standards'' on noise pollution, said 
EU Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock. He said the EU would take a 
flexible approach during the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would ban planes using hush kits and instead force  
airlines to fit new quieter engines. It would only apply to new 
aircraft, forcing EU airlines to no longer add planes with hush 
kits to their active fleets. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States says hush kits reduce engine noise  
sufficiently, but the EU says they are not effective. 
</P>
<P>
	German Transport Minster Franz Muntefering said all 15 member  
states agreed they would introduce legislation to ban the hush kits 
at the end of April instead sticking to the planned April 1, 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposals, aircraft from non-EU countries would be  
banned in the 15-nation zone from April 1, 2002, unless they are 
fitted with engines that meet EU requirements. Planes operating in 
the EU before April 1 this year would receive an exemption.

<HEADLINE> SLOC Panel Refines Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A Salt Lake Organizing Committee panel is  
close to proposing a new conflict-of-interest and ethics code to 
clean up its scandal-tainted image. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad hoc panel also plans to propose new open meetings, open  
records and attendance policies at an April 8 meeting of the SLOC 
Board of Trustees Management Committee. Drafts are going out this 
week for trustees' review. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel was given its charge at a Feb. 11 reorganization of  
the SLOC in the wake of allegations that the bid committee spent 
$1.2 million currying favor with International Olympic Committee 
members who chose Salt Lake as the site of the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Three trustees with conflicts of interest, which were previously  
tolerated as long as they were disclosed, resigned in the wake of 
promises of higher ethics. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the draft ethics code discussed Monday, no key employee,  
officer or board trustee could do business with the SLOC if the 
contract is worth $1 million or more and the person has an interest 
of 5 percent or more in the company that wants SLOC business. 
</P>
<P>
	The employee or trustee would either have to quit the SLOC,  
divest the business interest or drop the idea of doing business 
with the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Those with smaller conflicts could do business with the SLOC if  
the conflicts are disclosed and approved. A new ethics officer 
would review potential conflicts amounting to $100,000 or less and 
the independent ethics panel would have to sign off on potential 
conflicts on contracts worth $100,000 to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea, said Nolan Karras, the chairman of the ad hoc panel,  
is that the SLOC will try to avoid doing business with companies in 
which trustees or employees have a stake. The ethics officer and 
panel will demand to know if other businesses could do the work as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, trustees have voluntarily disclosed potential  
conflicts of interest and employees have been required to fill out 
disclosure forms. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy reaches deeper, requiring disclosure about jobs  
and business interests of not only spouses and children, but 
siblings, parents, grandparents and in-laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy spells out that the organizing committee must  
keep all money, except for petty cash, in bank accounts in the name 
of the committee and authorized by the Management Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly Flint, an attorney for the SLOC, said the change was  
prompted by allegations that bid committee executives gave cash 
payments to IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy prohibits SLOC employees from seeking any gifts  
or entertainment, but allows them to keep gifts valued at $100 or 
less without reporting them. Anything of greater value would have 
to be turned over to the organizing committee, which could possibly 
give those away in a lottery to employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Meals are exempt from the $100 limit because business lunches  
and dinners can frequently exceed that amount, the attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad hoc panel also is proposing an archive that will records  
available for review by anyone. Copies will cost 10 cents a page, 
and anyone seeking more obscure documents will have to pay $25 per 
hour for an employee to search for and delete confidential 
information from such records. 
</P>
<P>
	The attendance policy requires all trustees to show up or send  
an alternate to 75 percent of regularly scheduled meetings. Those 
who fail to attend will be asked to resign.

<HEADLINE> Peck's Purdue Resume Is Impressive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Carolyn Peck's coaching resume at Purdue  
shows two Big Ten tournament championships, one regular-season 
title and now, a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Not bad for two years' work.  
</P>
<P>
	And two years is all it will be because Peck is leaving the  
nation's No. 1-ranked team to become coach and general manager of a 
WNBA expansion team, the Orlando Miracle. Purdue's 62-45 victory 
over Duke in Sunday night's NCAA championship game was her last 
appearance with the Boilermakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Peck was named to the Orlando job last summer, but wanted to  
stay at Purdue in part because the team's two stars, Stephanie 
White-McCarty and Ukari Figgs, already had played for three 
different coaches in three years. She wasn't about to have them 
play for a fourth as seniors. 
</P>
<P>
	They paid her back by putting her into an elite group. Peck,  
still full of youthful exuberance at 33, is just the 11th different 
coach -- and the first black -- to win an NCAA women's championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an accomplishment, but there are several other  
African-American women that have allowed the opportunity for me, a 
lot of women in general,'' Peck said. ``I didn't win a national 
championship because of the color of my skin. We won a national 
championship because of the 15 young women that are on our team and 
how hard they play together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That comment was typical of Peck, who always deflected the  
attention to her players. As the spotlight on the team increased 
during its tournament run, Peck steadfastly refused to talk about 
her new job and kept the focus on Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	When a reporter at the Midwest Regional asked her about it, Peck  
shot back, ``We got that out of the way in July.'' End of 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Now she has to start paying attention to Orlando because the  
WNBA's expansion draft is April 6. She's definitely going into it 
on a high. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been great,'' Peck said. ``I was very fortunate to start  
my college career with this team. They are awesome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That they were.  
</P>
<P>
	Purdue, which finished 34-1 with 32 straight victories, gave an  
indication of the kind of season this might be when it beat 
Tennessee, which had won the last three national championships, in 
its very first game. The Boilermakers won at Arizona the next time 
out, lost by a point at Stanford three days later and then never 
lost again. 
</P>
<P>
	But for Peck, it actually began with an offseason trip to Europe  
for some exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we first planned the trip, every coach that I talked to  
about doing it said it's the best thing for bonding when ... you 
feel like you've got the team to make a run,'' Peck said. ``So 
that's what the trip to Europe was about. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got together for 10 days. We worked on things because we  
had everybody back. So we took what we had done last year, we 
fine-tuned it and we were able to add a few new things for this 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With White-McCarty and Figgs leading the way, and sophomore  
Katie Douglas developing into a big scorer as well, the 
Boilermakers made that run under the calm guidance of a coach who 
could have coasted through the season but never did. 
</P>
<P>
	Peck yelled only when necessary. Mostly she clapped, smiled and  
offered a word or two or encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was always positive toward the team no matter what we were  
doing,'' Douglas said. ``When we look over and we see her get fired 
up, we just want to please her and go out and play hard and get 
fired up with her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The title game was the first since 1993 without either Louisiana  
Tech or Tennessee. It was just the second Final Four appearance for 
Purdue and the first for Duke, which had gotten there by beating 
Tennessee in the East Regional finals. Purdue eliminated Louisiana 
Tech in the national semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	So maybe that will be Peck's brief legacy as a college coach,  
showing that a team doesn't have to be part of the old guard to win 
the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a battle all year long for other teams to be  
noticed outside of Tennessee and Connecticut,'' Peck said. ``They 
have gotten a lot of media coverage that has been very well 
deserved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to take anything away from those two programs,  
but the nation has come to learn that there are other good teams 
that are playing.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Teammates Battle in NCAA Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- They didn't share just the same high  
school, the same locker room, the same playground, the same 
friends, the same hangouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Moore and William Avery shared a vision.  
</P>
<P>
	Tonight, in the NCAA championship game, one may prevent the  
other from living it. 
</P>
<P>
	When Moore and Avery were teammates at Westside High School in  
Augusta, Ga., they talked frequently of being college stars, of 
playing in the NCAA tournament, of winning a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight, they will play that game of their lives. What they  
never envisioned was they would play it against each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Introductions won't be necessary when Moore, Connecticut's  
defensive ace, matches up against Avery, the intuitive point guard 
who directs Duke's offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the teacher and I was the student,'' Avery said. ``He  
showed me the ropes on the court and off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avery and Moore always played on the same team, even in pickup  
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took him under my wing ... I was a senior and he was a  
sophomore,'' Moore said. ``It was memorable competing against him. 
I didn't want to play against other players in practice as much as 
I did him, because I knew it would make us a better team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It did. Westside went 33-1 and won the Georgia Class AAA title  
in 1994-95 before Moore took off for UConn and Avery took off to 
play his senior season at Oak Hill (Va.) Academy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say he was my best friend because there was just a  
bunch of us that were friends,'' Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the summertime, Moore sometimes worked as a waiter at Augusta  
National, the home of the Masters. His father, Otis, caddied there 
before moving onto the PGA Tour, where he now carries Kelly 
Gibson's bag. 
</P>
<P>
	As he grew up, Ricky Moore passed on his basketball knowledge to  
Avery, who requested the same junior high number that Moore wore.

	``I thought he did a great job of showing me the path to take,''  
Avery said. ``I want to show him now I'm just as good if not 
better. I've never competed against Ricky in an organized game, so 
it's going to be different. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last time we played in a championship game, we were in the  
same locker room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, whose defensive skills neutralized Ohio State star  
Scoonie Penn in the semifinals, expects to defend Avery. But he 
also will be needed to help out on 6-foot-7 Trajan Langdon and, 
when he comes off the bench, 6-6 offense-ignitor Corey Maggette. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to attack them every which way. You have to  
attack them and make them stay on their heels rather than let them 
attack you,'' UConn guard Khalid El-Amin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut's most troublesome matchup is at center, where the  
foul-prone Jake Voskuhl admittedly needs help from 6-7 Kevin 
Freeman in defending player of the year Elton Brand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite frankly, Elton is the most valuable player in college  
basketball,'' Huskies coach Jim Calhoun said. ``We have to decide 
who is going to double (team), where it's going to come from, who 
it's going to come from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brand single-handedly took Michigan State out of the semifinals  
with a 13-rebound, eight-point first half that led to a 68-62 Duke 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't say you're going to stop him, you just hope he  
doesn't go off on you,'' Voskuhl said. 
</P>
<P>
	And for all that talk that Duke can't be beaten, the Huskies  
think they know a team that can do it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be an intense game,'' Freeman said. ``It's going  
to be our five guys on the floor against their five guys. They 
might have six McDonald's All-Americans, but only five can be on 
the floor at a time.''

<HEADLINE> Politicians Use Web To Raise Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some presidential candidates hoping to use  
their Internet sites to raise money want to change the rules that 
bar them from using donations made by credit card to qualify for 
federal matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Most campaign Web sites have pages that allow visitors to donate  
to the host candidate, usually by credit card. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Election Commission, which regulates federal  
campaign spending, allows donors to make donations by credit card. 
But for 16 years it has prohibited such donations from counting 
toward a presidential candidate's taxpayer assistance because of 
concerns about fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``A credit card is only a promise of payment, not the actual  
payment,'' said Sharon Snyder of the FEC. ``There's not the 
required documentation like you get with a check.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since Watergate, the FEC has provided federal assistance to  
qualified primary candidates -- who can get dollar for dollar 
matching for the first $250 of each private donation they receive 
provided they agree to spending limits. The money comes from the 
checkoff on taxpayers' returns. 
</P>
<P>
	A Republican fund raiser said the FEC's argument that credit  
card transactions are not secure enough is flawed, especially in an 
era when consumers can buy everything from books to cars over the 
Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``So much commerce is done on the Internet and it's considered  
secure, it's considered reliable,'' said Tom Hockaday, a Republican 
political strategist who specializes in fund raising on the Web. 
``It's just as easy and secure as a signature on a check.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. Bill Bradley, who is seeking the Democratic  
presidential nomination, last week called for the FEC to change its 
policy. His campaign sent a request asking the six-member 
commission to ``reinterpret'' its regulations and allow credit card 
donations for matching funds in time for the 2000 race. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet is clearly a much more significant part of life  
than it has been in previous election cycles,'' said Eric Hauser, 
spokesman for Bradley. ``It's really an opportunity for more people 
to get involved in the matching process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican campaigns also say the FEC policy is flawed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly as the Internet and campaign Web sites play a bigger  
part in the 2000 campaign, and beyond, the rules need to be changed 
to reflect current times,'' said Steve Schmidt, spokesman for Lamar 
Alexander's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Former FEC chairman Trevor Potter went before the commission  
last Wednesday on behalf of America Online to urge them to change 
the rules. They are supporting Bradley's request. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commission has not caught up with technology,'' Potter  
said. The FEC rules date back to 1975, he said, and nothing at all 
has been done about credit cards since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here you have a perfect mechanism for small donors to give,  
and they can't get matching funds'' Potter said, citing the very 
reason why the system of financing campaigns was overhauled in the 
1970s -- to prevent large donors from corrupting the electoral 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	FEC representatives say there is still too much danger of fraud  
to allow matching funds to be given for credit card donations. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision from the Federal Election Commission is required  
within 60 days of Bradley's request.

<HEADLINE> Lost Boyz Rapper Freakie Tah Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rapper Freaky Tah, a member of the hip-hop group  
the Lost Boyz, was killed by a ski-masked gunman who came up behind 
him and fired a single gunshot into his head. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman fled. Police do not believe robbery was the motive,  
said Lt. Dennis Cirillo, a police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses at the scene said the shooter walked up behind the  
27-year-old rapper, whose real name was Raymond Rodgers, as he left 
a party at a Queens hotel near his home around 4 a.m. Sunday. The 
gunman fired once without saying a word. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodgers was rushed to Jamaica Hospital, where he died about half  
an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
	Other members of the four-man group were reportedly at the party  
but police were unable to locate them Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lost Boyz, made up of boyhood friends who admitted being  
former small-time drug dealers, had a best-selling album in 1996 
called ``Legal Drug Money.'' The title was a reference to going 
straight after seeing a fellow drug dealer shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Among there other hits are the singles ``Me and My Crazy  
World,'' ``Music Makes Me High'' and ``Get Up'' and the album 
``Love, Peace &AMP; Nappiness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They began rapping between classes in school and honed their act  
at block parties. Despite their success, the rappers held annual 
barbecues and video arcade outings for local youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodgers is not the first rap star to be shot.  
</P>
<P>
	Rapper and actor Tupac Shakur, who had multimillion-seller  
albums like ``2Pacalypse Now'' and ``All Eyez on Me,'' was wounded 
in a November 1994 shooting in New York and then fatally shot in 
September 1996 as he sat in a car in Las Vegas. He was 25. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1997, 24-year-old rapper Christopher Wallace, known as  
Notorious B.I.G. or Biggie Smalls, was shot to death in a drive-by 
shooting in Los Angeles. Among his hits was ``Ready to Die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, rapper ODB, founder of the million-selling rap group  
the Wu-Tang Clan, was wounded during a robbery in his Brooklyn 
apartment. The rapper, whose real name is Russell Jones, told 
authorities armed intruders came in through an unlocked door and 
took jewelry, then one fired a pistol.

<HEADLINE> Ford Gives Taurus a Major Facelift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When Ford introduced its second-generation  
Taurus family sedan in 1995, it made a styling splash with an 
unusual ovoid design: There were oval headlights, oval windows, 
oval taillights, oval vents, even an oval radio and climate-control 
pod. 
</P>
<P>
	The redesigned Taurus sold well -- it remains Ford's best-selling  
car. But it wasn't as big a hit as the original '86 aero-look 
Taurus. Since it lost the title of the nation's best-selling car in 
1997, the Taurus has remained in third place well behind the more 
conservatively styled Honda Accord and Toyota Camry. 
</P>
<P>
	So, bye-bye ovals.  
</P>
<P>
	The Taurus is getting a major facelift for the 2000 model year.  
The new design, to be unveiled Tuesday at the New York 
International Auto Show, has shed most of the oval styling cues in 
favor of a cleaner, more understated look. Its Mercury twin, the 
Sable, will undergo a similar transformation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's betting the new Taurus will have broader appeal in the  
high-volume, midsize family sedan market -- a segment where standout 
styling doesn't always translate into standout sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``It still has a Ford look to it, yet at the same time they took  
away some of the bizarreness and made it more functional,'' said 
analyst James Hall of AutoPacific Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford also is adding an array of safety and comfort features to  
the Taurus and Sable to make them more competitive with the fresher 
competition from Toyota and Honda. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Chris Cedergren of Nextrend contends the styling of the  
second-generation Taurus was not necessarily the reason its sales 
failed to keep pace. Initially, Ford priced the car too high. And 
the segment for years has steadily lost buyers to sport utility 
vehicles and other light trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they had made the car more traditional back then, would  
they have sold any more?'' Cedergren asked. ``I don't think so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford also cut back on less profitable fleet sales of the Taurus  
in 1997 after deciding the cost of maintaining the sales crown had 
become too high. Since then, sales of Taurus to rental, government 
and business fleets have declined 10 percent, spokeswoman Anne 
Doyle said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Ford had hoped the second generation's unique design would  
appeal more to import owners willing to pay a little more, it may 
have put off customers more concerned about space and comfort. One 
problem was its swoopy, ovoid contours made it look smaller than 
the original Taurus, even though it was a bit larger, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you make the customer think the car looks smaller, in some  
cases it doesn't even get considered,'' Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	With its more substantial rear end, a higher roof line and  
larger trunk, the 2000 Taurus looks its size. Rear headroom was 
increased by nearly 2 inches and the trunk holds more than a cubic 
foot more space, addressing common criticisms of the current 
Taurus. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 Taurus represents what the industry calls a ``reskin''  
as opposed to a complete redesign. The structure and basic 
mechanical parts remain largely unchanged from the '99. 
</P>
<P>
	``The facelift addresses everything Ford could address for the  
money they wanted to spend,'' Hall said. ``Functionally, they've 
made the car better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford plans to promote the car's enhanced safety features when it  
goes on sale in the fall with the Sable. They will be the first 
Fords equipped with a new system of computer sensors that adjust 
the speed of the air bags' deployment based on the severity of the 
crash, the driver's seat position and seat-belt usage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taurus and all other 2000 Ford cars also will come with a  
standard emergency trunk-release latch designed to allow a person 
who becomes locked inside to get out. The t-shaped release handle 
glows in the dark, which Ford says will make it especially easy for 
a trapped child to find. 
</P>
<P>
	Front side-impact air bags also will be available as an option,  
as will power adjustable accelerator and brake pedals. The latter 
feature is a safety advantage for short drivers, who may otherwise 
be subjected to air bag-related injuries from sitting too close to 
the steering wheel. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices are expected to be announced by late summer.  
</P>
<P>
	The New York show opens to the public Saturday and runs through  
April 11.

<HEADLINE> What's Next for Cuban Baseball? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Baseball people of all sorts were buzzing Monday  
in the waiting area at Jose Marti International Airport. The No. 1 
topic? Trying to set up more games between major league teams and 
the Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
	League presidents, owners, general managers, scouts and union  
executives all seemed to agree, for once: The Baltimore Orioles' 
weekend trip to Havana worked so well that more clubs should 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will start talking soon about doing it again next year,''  
said former infielder Tony Bernazard, now at the players' union. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban sports officials also seemed satisfied with the first  
visit by a major league team in 40 years. They appear willing to 
make this an annual event and no doubt would love to have the New 
York Yankees, a popular team among fans on the Communist island. 
</P>
<P>
	``To come down here and experience it, just to get to see and  
understand the mystique of Cuba, it was worth it,'' Montreal GM Jim 
Beattie said. ``Having done it once, the next time you won't have 
that fear or awe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost all 30 major league teams sent a representative or two to  
see the Orioles beat a Cuban all-star team 3-2 in 11 innings 
Sunday. Tampa Bay Devil Rays owner Vince Naimoli hopes the trip 
helps him understand more about star pitcher Rolando Arrojo, a 
Cuban defector. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll have a conversation with him,'' Naimoli said. ``I'm a  
great student of learning by walking around, and I'll talk about 
the things I saw.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AL president Gene Budig and NL president Len Coleman liked what  
they saw. So did Toronto Blue Jays scout Bob Engle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think any time you get to see guys who don't have a lot of  
exposure, it's good,'' Engle said. ``You got to see a lot of 
pitching. It gives you a good measure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With several rival scouts sitting near him waiting for a charter  
flight to Miami, Engle was hesitant to identify the Cubans he 
liked. But asked whether he thought some of them had big league 
potential, he firmly said yes. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Contreras pitched eight scoreless innings, allowed only two  
hits and struck out 10. Third baseman Omar Linares, considered the 
island's best player at 32, hit a tying single in the eighth inning 
that made Cuban President Fidel Castro grin from a front-row seat 
behind the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Several top Cubans did not face Baltimore because they are  
playing in the current series between the Havana Industriales and 
Santiago for the country's league championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Industriales shortstop German Mesa, whose talent kept Rey  
Ordonez on the bench before the future Gold Glover defected and 
joined the New York Mets, may play when the Cubans visit 
Baltimore's Camden Yards on May 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles owner Peter Angelos, who spent several years trying to  
arrange this series, was most pleased. 
</P>
<P>
	``It met and exceeded my expectations,'' he said. ``It was a  
perfect game, because we won and the Cuban team showed that they 
are capable of competing with a major league team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos and most of the major league personnel who made the trip  
got to meet Castro. Engle and some others even got an autograph 
from the 73-year-old leader, who wore a suit rather than his usual 
combat fatigues during Sunday night's reception at the national 
palace. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't like he was just shaking hands real quickly with  
everyone,'' Beattie said. ``He spoke to everyone and had something 
to talk to them about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With commissioner Bud Selig, Castro remembered his days of  
pitching while at the University of Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	``He talked about his career,'' Selig said. ``But in all honesty  
he didn't build himself up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Told that Budig was a former chancellor at Kansas, Castro was  
ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me of his interest in college basketball and was very  
much aware of the University of Kansas and its basketball 
tradition,'' Budig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon meeting Coleman, Castro talked about NL teams that once  
trained in Havana, such as the Brooklyn Dodgers and Pittsburgh. 
With Blue Jays chairman Sam Pollock, he spoke about their shared 
interest in quail hunting. 
</P>
<P>
	And what did he say to Beattie?  
</P>
<P>
	``He joked that he thought this was a baseball trip,'' the  
6-foot-5 Beattie said, ``and asked what the basketball players were 
doing here.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Beryllium Endangers Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- Concerned more about Cold War weapons  
production than worker safety, U.S. government officials for years 
stood by as employees at manufacturing plants were exposed to 
deadly levels of a toxic metal dust, a newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a 22-month investigation, The Blade of Toledo reported  
Sunday that since the 1940s, hundreds of workers at weapons plants 
exposed to the dust from the metal beryllium have contracted 
beryllium disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The incurable illness, which attacks the lungs, is sometimes  
fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	For its six-part series, The Blade relied on tens of thousands  
of court, industry, and recently declassified government documents. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the paper, the records reveal a decades-long  
pattern of government officials favoring efficient production of 
beryllium -- a light, durable metal vital to the operation of 
missiles, jet fighters and nuclear weapons -- over worker safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (government) cannot stand for a cessation of production,''  
one federal official, Martin Powers, told colleagues in 1960 in 
response to health concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents also show that some workers, at privately operated  
weapons plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania, were exposed to levels of 
beryllium dust 100 times higher than safety limits. Government 
officials knew of the high exposure levels, but failed to halt 
production at the facilities, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Powers, a former Atomic Energy Commission official in charge of  
obtaining beryllium for the government, said the government 
couldn't afford to stop making weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is the greater risk? To possibly expose people to health  
injury in the plant or shut down the national defense?'' Powers 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of the government's inaction have been deadly, the  
paper said. At the nation's largest beryllium plant, owned by 
Cleveland-based Brush Wellman, Inc. and located just outside 
Toledo, at least 39 workers have contracted the disease, the paper 
said. Six workers have died. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they had told me I'd end up hooked up to an oxygen tank my  
whole life I would have run away from the damn place,'' said Butch 
Lemke, who told The Blade he was overexposed at the plant. He has 
been hooked to the oxygen tank for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brush Wellman plant never has complied consistently with  
federal safety limits in all parts of the factory, the newspaper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brush Wellman officials say they always have posted air test  
results on plant bulletin boards and have discussed the high 
exposures with employees. But they acknowledged that by the time 
high dust counts are reported, the workers already have been 
exposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugh Hanes, the company's vice president for government affairs,  
told The Associated Press on Sunday that the company and the 
government were not attempting to hide any information from 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea that there has been a conspiracy is wrong,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hanes said the company has invested greatly in protecting its  
workers and constantly monitors beryllium levels so it can operate 
within federal safety limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are getting closer and closer to that goal,'' Hanes said  
</P>
<P>
	Company records show dust counts have improved at the plant over  
the years. But a study published in 1997 found that one in 11 
workers at the 646-employee plant either had the disease or an 
abnormal blood test -- a sign they may develop the illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, it's not clear how many people have contracted the  
disease. Researchers cite an estimated 1,200 cases and hundreds of 
deaths nationwide, but say many other cases are misdiagnosed or 
undetected. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Peter Infante, director of standards review for the U.S.  
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, said the government 
has failed to protect workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are all deaths and disease that could have been  
prevented,'' Infante said. ``That's the sad thing about it.''

<HEADLINE> Computer Associates Buys Rival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Fast-growing software firm Platinum Technology  
International was snapped up Monday in a $3.5 billion cash deal by 
larger rival Computer Associates as part of an effort to compete 
with industry giants like IBM. 
</P>
<P>
	The cash offer was worth more than three times Platinum  
Technology's market value, based on Friday's closing price of 
$9.87 1/2 a share. But it would give Islandia, N.Y.-based Computer 
Associates access to Platinum's lucrative consulting services and 
software for managing data and technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Platinum shot up 144 percent after the merger was  
announced, rising $14.18 3/4 to $24.06 1/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
Shares of Computer Associates rose $3.06 1/4, or 9 percent, to $37 on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``This transaction provides tremendous synergies in products,  
markets and services with very little overlap, creating exciting 
growth opportunities for (Computer Associates) in many new and 
emerging markets,'' said Sanjay Kumar, Computer Associates' 
president and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer Associates has been buying up businesses that set up  
and run companies' computer systems as demand slows down for its 
core software and as corporate customers seek one-stop service. 
Computer Sciences Corp. last year rejected a $8.4 billion takeover 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer Associates said it expects the acquisition to add 25  
cents a share to its earnings, before charges, within a year after 
closing. 
</P>
<P>
	Platinum Technology, based in Oakbrook Terrace, Ill., provides  
software products and consulting services that help companies 
manage and improve systems and database management, e-commerce, 
data warehousing and Year 2000 reengineering. The 12-year-old 
company has more than 120 offices across six continents. 
</P>
<P>
	After acquiring more than 60 small firms since 1994, Platinum  
chief executive Andrew Filipowski said it was in the company's 
interests to be acquired by someone else. Platinum's stock had 
fallen sharply as sales slumped because of the Asian economic 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we approach the new millennium, it is increasingly apparent  
that consolidations in our industry make it evident that this 
change is critical to Platinum's future,'' Filipowski said. His 
future, and that of other management at Platinum, will remain 
unclear for the next few weeks, the two sides said.

	Platinum had 1998 revenues of $968 million and 4,330 employees.  
Company officials said some layoffs were expected, although they 
did not have an exact number and said it would be mitigated by a 
worldwide hiring freeze Computer Associates implemented Monday.

<HEADLINE> Rules Push Thousands Off Welfare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sharon Pedersen found out the hard way just  
how much welfare has changed in America. 
</P>
<P>
	She missed two appointments with her state caseworker -- once,  
she says, because she was sick and once because her alarm didn't go 
off. Iowa cut off her $364 monthly check, and now she is hoping the 
nursing home where she used to work will rehire her. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was never like that before,'' said Ms. Pedersen, of  
Denison, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the country, the number of people on welfare continues to  
drop dramatically -- partly because states are aggressively using 
their new power to punish those who don't follow tough new rules, 
according to a 50-state survey by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The power to punish is being used quite differently from state  
to state: In some, such punishments are rare; in others, half of 
the people leaving welfare were dropped for failing to follow 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the time limits expected to end government aid for  
millions of poor people have had little effect in the 13 states 
where the clock has run out. 
</P>
<P>
	Time limits and penalties, together with work requirements, were  
the pillars of the 1996 welfare overhaul. Under the old system, 
Americans got help as long as they were poor enough, and states 
were severely restricted in cutting off checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Things have changed. States now are allowed -- even encouraged --  
to cut assistance for anyone who does not follow their rules. Even 
if they do cooperate, people can get help for only five years -- 
less time in the 22 states with shorter time limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1994, the number of Americans on welfare has dropped a  
dramatic 44 percent, due partly to the strong economy, but also to 
states' aggressive punishments. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kentucky, 58 percent of the people who leave welfare are  
pushed off because they do not follow rules. In California and 
Illinois, nearly half those leaving welfare are doing so as a 
punishment; that comes to tens of thousands each month. 
</P>
<P>
	States punish people not only for failing to participate in work  
programs but also for mundane offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, 57 percent of those who left welfare last year were  
removed because they did not keep appointments or failed to 
``provide complete information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Arizona, 60 percent are taken off welfare because they do not  
appear for a welfare interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those people are just disappearing, and we don't know at this  
point if it is because they did get employment or if they're going 
to local charities,'' said Vince Wood, who runs Arizona's program. 
</P>
<P>
	Other officials argue that recipients make the choice.  
</P>
<P>
	``We do hold our participants accountable,'' said Ann Wiebers of  
Iowa, where 47 percent of people leaving welfare are being 
punished. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts believe those punished fall into two groups: people  
already working or supporting themselves who choose not to follow 
rules; and those with lives so off-balance they cannot keep it 
together and cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates for the poor worry about the second group.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a danger that they simply disappear, and the ability  
to work with them and help address problems gets lost,'' said Mark 
Greenberg of the Center for Law and Social Policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Some states punish few people: just 10 percent leaving welfare  
in Nebraska and Maryland were being punished. Also, a few states, 
including Minnesota, Maine and North Dakota, simply reduce payments 
if welfare recipients do not follow rules. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oregon, before someone is dropped, a state worker visits the  
family to ensure the parent understands the ramifications of not 
cooperating. The worker must report on the family's prospects if 
welfare is cut and take steps to safeguard the children. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 1 percent of those leaving welfare have been punished, said  
Michael Buckley, spokesman for the state welfare department. 
</P>
<P>
	``We usually are able to convince the person it makes more sense  
for them to cooperate,'' Buckley said. Still, those on welfare have 
dropped 62 percent since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, state time limits surprisingly have had a small  
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	In many cases, states are giving extensions to people who try to  
play by the rules. States also are exempting many from time limits 
altogether because they face tough problems. 
</P>
<P>
	In essence, with the number of people on welfare at a 30-year  
low, states flush with cash can afford to be flexible. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina, for instance, put just 7,800 of its nearly  
100,000 welfare families on the clock but only 312 were kicked off 
when time limits expired last July. 
</P>
<P>
	In Louisiana, where time limits began expiring in January, the  
state gave extensions to more than half of families. In Tennessee, 
5,000 families initially hit the limit, but the state exempted 
2,800 and gave extensions to 1,400 others. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, just 97 of 925 people who ran out of time were cut  
off. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been dropped in Nebraska or Oregon, although time  
limits have begun expiring. In Texas, Arizona and Indiana, families 
only lose part of their grant. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates warn it will be tougher to maintain generous policies  
when the federal, five-year limit takes effect in a few years. At 
that point, states can exempt just 20 percent of people on welfare. 
Beyond that, they cannot use federal money for anyone on more than 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	It will also be tougher if the economy turns sour.  
</P>
<P>
	Then, policies like Connecticut's -- where 64 percent either are  
exempt from time limits or have extensions -- may disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	``The program operates under the idea that everyone can work,''  
said the state's Claudette Beaulieu. But it is different if someone 
is illiterate, has no work history or has mental health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can make that judgment that this person is exempt, because  
it is very unlikely anyone would hire them.''

<HEADLINE> Japan's Jobless Rate Hits Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A shrinking economy and spreading layoffs drove  
Japan's jobless rate to a record 4.6 percent in February, the 
government said Tuesday, sapping hopes the country would soon 
emerge from its darkest recession since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The unemployment rate jumped sharply from the previous month's  
4.4 percent -- a record for three straight months -- and swelled the 
ranks of jobless to a historical 3.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to admit that the situation in February was harsher  
than expected,'' Taiichi Sakaiya, chief of the Economic Planning 
Agency, was quoted as saying by Kyodo News agency. ``The strength 
of the recovery is very weak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sour figures come as Japan is battling its deepest economic  
slowdown in 50 years. The government has pumped billions of dollars 
into the economy in an all-out campaign to prod consumers to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	The rising jobless rate also hits Japan weeks after the  
government announced the economy shrank for the fifth straight 
quarter in the final three months of last year -- putting the 
economy on track to contract for the second straight fiscal year 
for the first time since the war. The fiscal year ends Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The grim statistics Tuesday were already putting pressure on the  
government to do more to bolster growth. Finance Minister Kiichi 
Miyazawa said he was ready to spend more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm worried about the unemployment situation,'' he said.  
``Although we've taken steps necessary to ease the jobless problem, 
we're ready to increase budget spending for jobs if necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A major factor behind spreading joblessness is corporate  
restructuring. Many topflight Japanese companies fighting to regain 
competitiveness are trimming staffs, selling off subsidiaries and 
closing offices. 
</P>
<P>
	The total number of people without jobs rose by 670,000 from a  
year earlier to 3.13 million -- the most since the Management and 
Coordination Agency began recording the data in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
	The total number of jobholders shrank by 770,000 from a year  
earlier to 63.34 million, the agency said. It was the largest-ever 
decrease in the number of jobholders and marked the 13th 
consecutive month of declines. 
</P>
<P>
	The statistics were not much of a surprise to some.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly consistent with the weakness we're seeing in  
the Japanese economy, particularly in private demand,'' said 
Cameron Umetsu, senior strategist for Warburg Dillon Read Japan 
Ltd. ``It promises to get even worse as underlying conditions 
deteriorate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new jobless rate cements the reversal of fortunes between  
Japan and its top economic competitor, the United States. In the 
1980s, it seemed Japan was on track to supplant the United States 
as the world's supreme economic power. Now Japan is suffering from 
an unemployment rate that is pulling further ahead of the current 
U.S. rate of 4.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers of Tuesday were the latest in a long string of dour  
economic announcements in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said earlier this month that gross domestic  
product shrank 0.8 percent in the last three months of 1998, 
putting the economy on track to shrink 3.2 percent in the 1998-99 
fiscal year if the pace continues. Most analysts expect the economy 
to shrink as well in the next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	To fight the recession, the government has earmarked a mammoth  
$682.5 billion dollars in the 1999-2000 budget for public works 
spending, tax cuts and other stimulus measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials are also spending $62.5 billion to bail out the  
country's troubled banks, which are saddled with loads of bad debt 
from the collapse of the a speculative bubble in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the disheartening numbers, many in Japan are saying the  
economy has hit bottom and should be on the mend over the next 
couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Keizai newspaper published a survey of 112 company  
presidents on Tuesday, showing that nearly 90 percent believe a 
turnaround should come before the end of 1999. The newspaper gave 
no margin of error.
