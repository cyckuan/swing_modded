<HEADLINE> New Home Sales in U.S. Up Quickly in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The sales of new homes in
the U.S. surged up by 8.3 percent in August to the highest level
in more than 10 years as high mortgage rates failed to curb the
demand, U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
Sales of single-family homes totaled 832,000 at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate and it was the highest since 857,000 in April
1986, the department said.
</P>
<P>
It was beyond expectations of many analysts who had expected
the sales would drop by 4 percent in the month.
</P>
<P>
The department also revised upward the July increase to an 8.3
percent rate from 7.9 percent. It was the first time they have
remained above the 700,000 pace for eight straight months since a
similar string from November 1985 through June 1986.
</P>
<P>
In August, sales jumped 28.9 percent in the U.S. Midwest, the
steepest increase since they shot up 59.7 percent in December
1993. They were up by 2.6 percent in the South, the highest since
July 1995. But they fell by 13.9 percent in the Northeast and 2.7
percent in the West.
</P>
<P>
During the first eight months of the year, sales were 15
percent above those of the same period of 1995. They totaled just
667,000 in all of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts have predicted for months that new home sales
would level off as mortgage rates are becoming higher. But it
seems that high mortgage rates failed to slow the demand.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 8 percent in August,
the third consecutive month they were at that level or higher. The
rates averaged just 7.03 percent last January.
</P>
<P>
At the end of August, the seasonally adjusted estimates of new
homes for sale was 355,000, representing a supply of 5.3 months at
the current sales rate. It was the smallest inventory since a
5.1-month supply last February.
</P>
<P>
The housing report showed the median price of a new home was
135,000 dollars in August, down from 143,000 in July but up
slightly from 134,000 a year earlier.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
has approved the proposed control of the German credit insurance
company Hermes Kreditversicherungs-AG, Hamburg, by Allianz AG
Holding, Munchen.
</P>
<P>
The local press said today that Allianz intended to increase
its holding to a majority stake in Hermes, one of the leading
European credit insurance companies and the major German supplier
in this field.
</P>
<P>
In Germany, where Hermes had most activities, the proposed
acquisition of the majority of Hermes shares by Allianz was not
likely to strengthen the existing market position of Hermes, the
EC said.

<HEADLINE> China Having Buyer's Market (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- China is now entering an era
of a buyer's market, with more supplies of commodities such as TV
sets, fridges and microwave ovens.
</P>
<P>
In China, there was once a time when almost everything was in
short supply, from bicycles and soaps in a distant past to color
televisions and refrigerators a decade ago. "The emperor's
daughter was never worried about a lack of suitors," people often
said about the limited supply of goods facing too many buyers. It
was a sellers' market there competition was not existent.
</P>
<P>
Today the situation has reversed.
</P>
<P>
To make customers willingly open their wallets, manufacturers
and retailers have to compete fiercely in product quality, prices
and services.
</P>
<P>
In a TV commercial blitz, the Changhong Electronics Co.,
China's biggest television maker based in the city of Mianyang,
southwest China's Sichuan Province, announced price cuts of 10-20
percent for its color TV models. Sales of Changhong TV sets
immediately went up, forcing most of its domestic rivals to follow
suit.
</P>
<P>
The fact is that TV ownership is close to saturation: about 85
percent of Chinese families own a set today. The domestic
television industry produces about 28 million TV sets a year, of
which 19 million have color tubes. With imports counted in,
supply far exceeds demand.
</P>
<P>
Most big department stores and special consumer electronics
stores devote large spaces to the display of television models,
big and small, home-made and imported.
</P>
<P>
It is more or less the same story for other consumer durables
such as home refrigerators, washing machines, microwave ovens and
air conditioners.
</P>
<P>
National production of air conditioners stands at about 10
million units a year. A market forecast puts sales for 1996 at
six million, up 25 percent over last year but not enough to ease
competition among manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers are generally confident of sales prospects amid
tense competition, setting their eyes on national household
savings of almost 3,000 billion yuan (357 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"As long as product quality and after-sale services are
ensured, anything sells," said Li Hong, a saleswoman with the
Electrical Appliances Department of the Xidan Shopping Center in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Sales statistics show that, nationwide, annual "replacement"
buying alone amounts to three million televisions, two million
home fridges and three million electric fans.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Personal Spending And Income Up In August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Consumer spending in the
U.S. rose by 0.6 percent in August, the fastest pace in three
months, U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that personal spending totaled 5.17
trillion U.S. dollars at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, up
from 5.14 trillion in July.
</P>
<P>
The increase was the largest since an 0.8 percent gain in May.
Consumer spending in the country fell by 0.5 percent in June and
rebounded by 0.2 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the U.S.
economic activity, rose at a 3.5 percent annual rate during the
second quarter and helped drive the U.S. economy at a rate of 4.7
percent, the fastest in two years.
</P>
<P>
In August, spending on durable goods rose by 3.1 percent, the
largest since a 5.6 percent advance last February. Spending on
nondurable goods was unchanged after it inched up by 0.2 percent
in July. Spending on services rose by 0.3 percent following July's
0.5 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
But many U.S. analysts contend spending and economic growth are
slowing down during the second half of the year because many
consumers are burdened with heavy debt that forces them to curb
their spending.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that personal incomes in the country
totaled at annual rate of 6.5 trillion dollars, up from 6.47
trillion in July. The incomes rose only by 0.1 percent in July and
had surged 0.9 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
Private wages and salaries, the most closely watched component
of income, jumped by 29.7 billion dollars to 3.67 trillion after
falling 6.1 billion in July. Employment, average weekly hours and
average hourly earnings all increased.
</P>
<P>
Disposable income--income after taxes--rose by 0.5 percent
after increasing a barely perceptible 0.1 percent a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
The combination of incomes and spending meant that Americans'
saving rate--savings as a percentage of disposable income--was 5.2
percent, down slightly from 5.3 percent in both June and July.
</P>
<P>
The income and spending figures were not adjusted for
inflation. When adjusted, disposable income and spending both were
up 0.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Visit France After Washington Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
will come to Paris on Friday to meet President Jacques Chirac
after the summit meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in Washington.
</P>
<P>
France was apparently unhappy with the United States when
Washington announced the Middle East summit meeting on Sunday
without inviting France or any other European countries.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the Paris visit by Arafat, French Foreign Minister
Herve de Charette said: "Europe is interested in this region
because it is vital to it, and because it thinks that it can be of
use since it has a very old knowledge of this part of the world."
</P>
<P>
After the violent clashes between the Palestinians and Israeli
troops in West Bank and Gaza Strip, Washington invited Arafat,
Netanyahu, King Hussein of Jordan and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak to discuss measures to save the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, Mubarak declined the invitation to join in the summit.
</P>
<P>
Arafat on Monday evening made a stopover in Luxembourg on his
way to Washington and met with foreign ministers of the 15
European Union states.
</P>
<P>
A French Foreign Ministry spokesman today called on
Palestinians and Israelis to "take emergency measures" to avoid
the resumption of confrontations.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Rummelhardt also called for "strict application" of the
agreements between Israel and the Palestinians, including those
involving the final status of Palestinian territories and the
withdrawal of Israeli troops from Hebron.

<HEADLINE> Germany Cancels Missile Project With France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Germany has decided to cancel its
joint project to build "Apache" cruise missiles with France,
Agence France Presse quoted the Frankfurt-based LFK company, which
participated in the project, as saying today.
</P>
<P>
"The German authorities have changed their priorities in the
programs of missiles equipment. They don't want to continue the
Apache missile program," said Wolfran Lautner, a spokesman of LFK,
an affiliate of the Daimler-Benz Aerospace group.
</P>
<P>
The German defense ministry has made no comment on the
declaration by LFK, but has promised to give an official statement
today.
</P>
<P>
Lautner said Germany was now more interested in developing the
KEPD-350 missile with the Swedish company Bofors.
</P>
<P>
This kind of missile can destroy highly fortified targets such
as a bunker, while Apache, which is designed by the French group
Matra, is specialized in destroying targets of a broad surface
such as a landing runway.
</P>
<P>
Britain decided to develop "Storm Shadow" missiles based on the
Apache.

<HEADLINE> New Airport in Guilin Starts Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today cut
the ribbon at a grand ceremony to mark the opening of China's
newest airport, Liangjiang International Airport, in the scenic
city of Guilin in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The newly-built airport will handle all aircraft take-offs and
arrivals in Guilin from tomorrow, local officials told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Located near Liangjiang Township, Lingui County under the
jurisdiction of Guilin City, the new airport is 25.6 kilometers
away from the city center. It won the approval from the State
Council, the country's top governing body, and has been listed as
one of the major national construction projects for the Eighth
Five-Year-Plan Period (1991-95).
</P>
<P>
Work on the airport, covering an area of 4.06 square
kilometers, started in September 1993, and was finished in
August. It has cost 1.85 billion yuan (222 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
It has been built strictly in accordance with international
standards, and is constructed with aprons capable of receiving 20
planes simultaneously, and a terminal capable of handling five
million passengers a year.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 domestic air routes, and a number of international
air routes, will link Guilin with other cities in interior areas
of China and with Hong Kong region, Singapore, Japan and other
foreign cities.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say that the operation of the new airport is of
great significance for improving the investment environment in the
southwest region, promoting Guangxi's exchanges with the outside
world, as well as for enhancing Guilin's economic and trade
cooperation and tourism.
</P>
<P>
As a world-known tourist city, Guilin is visited by more
than half a million overseas tourists and eight million domestic
tourists annually.
</P>
<P>
Before the new airport was built, most of the tourists landed
at, or took off from Guilin at a military airport nearby.
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, Premier Li Peng attended a local evening
party, celebrating the 47th anniversary of the founding of the
People's Republic of China.

<P>
BRUSSELS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) Agriculture
and Rural Development Commissioner Franz Fischler today called for
continued efforts to develop EU agricultural policy, saying the
1992 agricultural reforms should be "completed and deepened."
</P>
<P>
Fischler was speaking at the Center for European Policy Studies
meeting on "The Common Agricultural Policy -- Future Developments
and Questions on Enlargement" held here today.
</P>
<P>
"The reforms must be completed where they have not yet been
introduced; they must be simplified where they have become too
complex; and they must be reinforced where they did not go far
enough in 1992," the Commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
"We will have to rely on the price support mechanism even less
in the future than we do today, for it cannot give farmers the
guaranteed income they hope for in the long term," Fischler said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that in markets where competitiveness would become
even more important in the future, "a route involving artificially
high prices will quickly lead to a dead-end."

<HEADLINE> China's Express Train Raises Speed Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- China's fastest train began
operating today between east China's Shanghai and Nanjing cities,
reaching a maximum speed of 160 kilometers per hour at times.
</P>
<P>
The double-deck train, with more than 1,000 passengers aboard,
left Nanjing, capital city of Jiangsu Province, at 8:29
A.M. today, and arrived in Shanghai at 11:09 A.M.
</P>
<P>
The journey time between the two cities, a distance of 303 km,
was shortened by eight minutes compared with the journey time of
the train when it was brought into use this April, running at 140
km per hour.
</P>
<P>
The number of trains bound for Shanghai, China's economic
center, starting from Nanjing, can be increased to 44 every
day.
</P>
<P>
Before the introduction of the fast-speed "Pioneer" train, the
journey time between the two cities was five hours.
</P>
<P>
Some transport observers say that railways, which have
traditionally played a dominant role in China's passenger and
cargo transportation, are being threatened by highway and air
transport sectors, which have been greatly improved in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
The country's Ministry of Railways has vowed to raise the
maximum speed of trains to between 140-160 km per hour on three
main lines: Beijing-Harbin, Beijing-Shanghai and Beijing-Guangzhou
in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Another express passenger train, with a speed of 140 km per
hour, went into operation between Beijing and Qinghuangdao, a port
city in north China's Hebei Province, in July, reducing the travel
time from three hours and 38 minutes to two and a half hours.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Legislators Condemn Japan's Claim to Tokto Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 1 (Xinhua) -- National Assembly members from
South Korea's ruling and opposition parties joined forces today to
denounce Japan for claiming sovereignty over a group of tiny
islands also claimed by Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), in its platform
for the general elections to be held on October 20, has laid claim
to Tokto, called Takeshima in Japanese, along with the four
Northern Islands and China's Diaoyu Islands.
</P>
<P>
Tokto Island, a rocky outcrop in the East Sea (Sea of Japan),
about midway between South Korea and Japan, covers an area of only
0.186 square kilometers. The waters around it are rich in fishery
resources and possibly seabed minerals.
</P>
<P>
During a parliamentary inspection by the Foreign Ministry here,
lawmaker Kim Do-eun of the ruling New Korea Party (NKP) noted that
the LDP's claim was made when the same absurd remarks by other
Japanese politicians still lingered in the minds of South Korean
people.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the two countries' territorial dispute
last February when Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihito Ikeda said
Tokto was part of Japan's territory, triggering an angry response
from South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda's remarks followed South Korea's announcement that it
would build a wharf on Tokto Island.
</P>
<P>
Lee Kun-kae, lawmaker of South Korea's second largest
opposition party, the United Liberal Democrats (ULD), said: "We
cannot but say that Japan's claim over Tokto is a remark made by
the insane, however hard we try to understand that the remark was
apparently aimed at getting more votes during the forthcoming
general elections."
</P>
<P>
The attitude of Japan's LDP hurt the national sentiments of
South Koreans who wanted reconciliation with their neighbors, Lee
added.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry statement issued last night also made clear
that Seoul would not tolerate Tokyo's claim to Tokto which was
historically part of Korean territory.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the LDP was also vowing to promote the official
payment of tributes to the Yasukuni Shrine where World War II
criminals are enshrined, the statement said the move represented
Japan's attempt to justify its aggressive part in the Second World
War.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government would continue to deal firmly with
any Japanese claim to Tokto Island and its move to make formal
tributes at the Yasukuni Shrine, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910 until
its World War II defeat in 1945.

<HEADLINE> New Malaysian-Thai Border Agreement Unnecessary: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 1 (Xinhua) -- There is no pressing need
for a structural agreement to arbitrate border problems between
Malaysia and Thailand as the existing agreements are adequate,
Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN) Deputy Chief Abu Bakar Abdul Jamal said
today.
</P>
<P>
The existing agreements have been enhanced to cover aspects
such as surveillance along the waters in the region as well as
regional demarcation, he said while commenting on a recent
incident where a Thai fishing boat was shot at for an alleged
encroachment into the Malaysian waters.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the end of a joint naval exercise involving the
Malaysian and Thai navies in Pulau Pinang today, Abu Bakar
regarded the shooting incident as an "isolated case".
</P>
<P>
The close cooperation and understanding between the authorities
of the two nations had helped improve the situation, he was quoted
by Malaysia's official news agency Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chief of Staff of the Royal Thai Fleet Rear Admiral Kiat
Korpsook was also quoted as saying he believed that the
encroachment was "unintentional".
</P>
<P>
He said the incident could have been due to the "wrong
positioning" of the fishing boat which resulted in the
encroachment.
</P>
<P>
On incidents of piracy, Abu Bakar said that while there were
one or two cases in the past involving theft at sea, the RMN
believed that it was not the work of pirates but the fishermen
themselves.
</P>
<P>
On the 11th naval exercise between the two countries which
began on September 23, he said both parties were satisfied with
its outcome as it had not only promoted friendship among those
involved but had also helped deepen mutual understanding of each
other's duties and responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
He said the RMN hoped to send more ships and staff to the next
naval exercise to be hosted by the Royal Thai Navy in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The exercise involved 50 officers and 800 men. The ships that
took part included the RMN's corvette, patrol vessel, and Fast
Attack Craft Missile (FACM) and the RTN's corvette and FACM.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Newspaper Lashes Out at Israel's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Syrian newspaper Teshreen
today accused in its editorial Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of exercising expansionism and rendering the Palestinian
people homeless to continue occupation.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that countering Netanyahu's plans is
primarily an Arab responsibility, but it is also an international
one, for peace in the Middle East is an international need as
well as a regional need," the editorial noted.
</P>
<P>
The editorial comes on the eve of the four-way summit due to be
held today in Washington among King Hussein of Jordan, Netanyahu,
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill
Clinton with the aim of reviving the stalled Palestinian-Israeli
peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu doesn't want peace. That is the essence of the whole
problem. Those who do not want peace will necessarily opt for war,
violence and occupation," the editorial said
</P>
<P>
"It is no coincidence that leaders of the world have held
Israel responsible for the bloody incidents (in the occupied
Palestinian territories), calling on it to stick to the
foundations of the peace process. Nor is it a coincidence at all
that the world press has severely attacked Netanyahu, seeing him
as a danger to peace in the region and the entire world,"
said the editorial.

<P>
HANOI, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is expected to achieve its
1996 economic development targets set at the beginning of this
year, a senior government official said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet minister Le Xuan Trinh, also head of the government
office, said that this year's gross domestic product was estimated
to increase by 9.5 percent, and the annual inflation rate was
calculated at between 6 and 7 percent, compared with the double
digit rate of about 14 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Food output for the whole year was estimated at over 28.2
million tons, about 0.7 million tons more than last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output was expected to rise 14 percent from a year
earlier, and the import and export value would increase 32
percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
But the minister pointed out that the financial sector should
work harder to improve its domestic revenue.
</P>
<P>
He noted that unabated corruption and smuggling remained a
headache for the government.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Ministers Plea for Flood Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's co-Prime Ministers
have appealed for emergency assistance for flooding victims, while
a Phnom Penh municipal leader warns that the capital city could be
submerged within a week.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers, Norodom Ranariddh and Hun sen, were in the
central Kompong Cham province on Monday to inspect flooding.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh said the flooding, which had claimed 11 lives, was
the worst in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Rising waters in major rivers have engulfed thousands of
hectares of paddy fields and about 3 million people are affected.
</P>
<P>
In response to the appeal of the prime ministers, the World
Food Program, the United Nations Development Program, the Red
Cross and the United Nations Children's Fund held an emergency
meeting with the National Committee for Disaster Management (NCDM)
Monday afternoon to assess how much relief is needed.
</P>
<P>
Nhim Vanda, head of the NCDM, said 8,000 tons of rice would be
required over the next month to feed the most stricken victims.
</P>
<P>
Aid agencies have provided emergency funds and 2,300 tons of
rice for the victims.
</P>
<P>
Man Chhoern, chief of the Phnom Penh municipal cabinet, said
river levels in the capital had reached 10.84 meters and were
still rising.
</P>
<P>
Water could overflow into the streets of the capital within a
week, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Official flood levels in the city were pegged at 11.20 meters.
</P>
<P>
The municipal authorities were gearing up the placement of
100,000 sandbags to stem rising water, he said.

<HEADLINE> Can Beijing Residents Get Enough to Drink in the Coming Century? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Beijing was described today as
one of the world's most thirsty cities after a report revealed
that water supplies to each resident is just four percent of the
global average.
</P>
<P>
Families in the Chinese capital are even worse off than people
in water starved Isreal. Beijing people have 20 percent less water
supplied to them than the average Israeli, according to an
analysis in Beijing Daily.
</P>
<P>
Now commentators are pondering how the Chinese capital will
avert a water crisis in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Suggestions have included piping water thousands of kilometers
from the Yangtze River in southern China, to making every
Beijinger save every drop of rain to eke out diminishing supplies.
</P>
<P>
Though heavy rainfalls this summer have greatly relieved the
drought that hit the city since last winter, Beijing is still
deeply haunted by water shortage, and could face harsher reality
in the coming century, Beijing Daily warned.
</P>
<P>
Currently, people in the city each have an annual average
water availability of 300 cubic meters, which has dropped from 400
cubic meters. It represents only one seventh of the national
average, and four percent of the global average.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that by the year 2000, Beijing will suffer a
200-million-cubic-meter water shortage, which could surge to one
billion cubic meters in 2010.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the water shortage in Beijing, the paper
said, is the lack of usable water resources.
</P>
<P>
The water resources in Beijing area consist mainly of two
parts: rivers in adjacent areas, and precipitation in the
region. Each year the overall amount of usable water resources
totals 4.3 billion cubic meters, which can only narrowly meet the
yearly water consumption of Beijing. If the dry season lasts
longer, the city will suffer a greater water shortage.
</P>
<P>
Then how can Beijing finally solve its water problem? The paper
ruled out two possibilities, building more reservoirs on the upper
reaches of the rivers, or increasing the extraction of groundwater.
</P>
<P>
Because of droughts and economic development of cities around
the upper reaches, the water supply from the Yongding River has
decreased from 1.9 billion cubic meters in the 1950s to 200
million cubic meters in recent years. And the three main
reservoirs in Beijing suburbs now mainly rely on rainfall for
their water reserves, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
As for groundwater resources, there is already the problem of
over exploitation. From 1961 to 1989, the groundwater reserves in
Beijing suffered a huge loss of 4.27 billion cubic meters, which
caused a sharp drop in groundwater levels, and deterioration of
groundwater quality.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, two possible solutions for the water shortage of
Beijing: one is to try to draw water from the Yangtze River in
South China, which will undoubtedly be very costly; the other is
to urge people to save every drop of water, and to improve the
techniques of water recycling and rain water usage, the paper
said.

<HEADLINE> Redoubled Efforts Called for Poverty Elimination (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's fight against poverty has now entered the final, but
critical stage -- to solve the problem of food and clothing for
all the poverty-stricken population finally, the article says.
</P>
<P>
As the remaining poor people live in "absolute poverty", the
speed of reduction of poverty population will slowdown in the
coming years, the article predicts. But there is still hope, it
says.
</P>
<P>
The hope lies in the correct leadership of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese
government, in the initiatives of leading officials and masses of
people in poor areas, and in the experience China has accumulated
in the past years, it says.
</P>
<P>
Thank to the effort China has made over the past ten years, the
basic social and economic conditions have been much improved, it
says. And more funds are able to be concentrated on tackling key
projects.
</P>
<P>
However, the average annual net income of the remaining poor
population is below 530 yuan per person a year. About half of them
are living in an absolute poverty, with an average annual net
income of less than 300 yuan, and 9.9 million of them have an
income of less than 200 yuan yearly, the article says.
</P>
<P>
What is the most difficult is that all these people live in the
remote, mountainous areas in Northwest and Southwest China, with
little transport facilities, scarce natural resources and bad
ecological environments.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are 23 million people in the country's rural
areas who have an annual per capita net income between 530 yuan
and 600 yuan, and are likely to rejoin the poor at times of
natural disasters and fluctuations in the economy.
</P>
<P>
But, the article says, China's plan to help poor areas by
tackling key projects have already won great support from broad
masses of people in the poverty-stricken areas, and attracted
great interest from outside China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has included the main contents of the
poverty relief program in its ninth Five-Year Plan as a major task
and a goal to reach before the year 2000, it says.

<P>
To achieve the goal of poverty Elimination, the Party and
government leading officials at all levels, have been called upon
to put on the top of their agendas the work of caring for the
needy, and those who are in difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials in poor areas should shoulder the major
responsibility of helping local people to shake off poverty, the
article says. The number of the poor should be reduced at an
annual rate of 20 percent in those areas.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should focus on the very poor villages and townships,
to help poor families to get enough food and clothing, it says.
</P>
<P>
Poverty-relief funds should be used to help those extremely
poor people, instead of being spread everywhere, it says.
</P>
<P>
Emphasis should be put on the development of projects that are
directly related to caring for the needy, and those in difficulty.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to stick to the principle of aiding the poor
through joint efforts in education and science. Efforts should be
made to improve the quality of the labor force and officials, it
says.
</P>
<P>
Full play should be given to the political role of the local
Party committees and governments in mobilizing the whole society
to help and support poor areas to tackle development projects.
</P>
<P>
Developed coastal provinces and cities should be organized to
help the poor areas in the western part of China, while the poor
provinces should carry out the spirit of hard work and
independence, to enhance the construction of rural grass-roots
units and support the development of a collective economy, the
article says.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be redoubled to develop closer ties with
international organizations, to intensify exchange and
cooperation, and to make full use of international aid in helping
the poor.

WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Middle Eastern leaders began to converge on Washington this
evening for an emergency meeting called by President Bill Clinton,
with indications that Israel was prepared to negotiate on some of
the issues of greatest concern to the Palestinians, including the
long-delayed Israeli withdrawal of troops from the West Bank city
of Hebron and the lifting of travel restrictions on Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The 104th Congress completed its major work last night when
the Senate sent President Clinton a massive spending bill that
averted the possibility of another government shutdown and
reflects more of Clinton's domestic priorities than those of the
Republican-controlled Congress. Clinton signed the bill several
hours later.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- New U.S. forces are being assigned to monitor elections in
Bosnia and prepare for longer stay. The American plan to beef up
the Bosnian military raises the prospect that U.S. troops next
year will confront Bosnian soldiers bearing arms provided by the
United States.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Under Domestic Pressure to Render </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly come under strong domestic
pressure to ensure success of the summit in Washington.
</P>
<P>
President Ezer Weizman today expressed hope that the
government would be wise enough to advance peace process which
has run aground.
</P>
<P>
The president, who has no binding power in accordance with
the country's basic laws, said that if Israel does not take the
path of peace it will become bogged down in war.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure for the Washington summit Monday
afternoon, Netanyahu went to the Presidential Office to brief
the president on the critical situation as a result of four days
of bloody clashes last week. Weizman wished him good luck and
coming back with real results.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai again criticized
Netanyahu for his personal decision to open the controversial
tunnel, which is close to the Islamic holy site of Temple Mount
in the Old City of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In an Israel Television interview Monday night Mordechai said
that he was only given five minutes warning before the opening
of the tunnel. The defense minister added that he immediately
alerted the chief of General Staff, Lieutenant General Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak, so that measures could be taken to deal with
possible trouble.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai and Shahak were not invited to attend the
discussions on the opening of the tunnel presided over by
Netanyahu. Shahak reportedly wrote a resignation letter in anger
at Netanyahu's handling of last week's crisis.
</P>
<P>
Shahak actually opposed opening the tunnel and also faulted
Netanyahu for not heeding his warnings that Palestinian anger
was rising.
</P>
<P>
According to a poll published this morning in a leading
newspaper Marriv, Netanyahu is also under a public opinion
pressure. As high as 79.5 percent of Jews say in the poll that
they want the Oslo peace process to go on while only 20 percent
say the opposite.
</P>
<P>
On his performance in the crisis over the last week only 43
percent expressed their approval while 57 percent said
no.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Warns Italy Against Excessive Devaluation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today warned Italy against excessive devaluation of the lire
which, he said, is causing big losses for France's textile
industry.
</P>
<P>
Chirac claimed that it appeared the "evolution" of the Italian
lire was not compatible with other currencies even though a small
adjustment had been arranged with the European common market. He
was attending a round-table meeting on employment in Arras,
northern France.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who is due to meet Italian President Francesco Cossiga
in Naples on Friday, said that France was "extremely vigilant
against competitive devaluation" among European countries.
</P>
<P>
"We have suffered more, especially in the textile sector, from
the devaluation of the lire, and possibly from the pound and
peseta, than from the exports of Southeast Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
While describing the building of a European monetary union as
the only way to maintain Europe's economic stability, Chirac said
that some countries, including Italy, needed more time than others
to qualify for the union.

<HEADLINE> France Wants to Join in Reconnaissance Over Southern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- France has asked the United States
to let it participate in reconnaissance missions over the
exclusion zone in southern Iraq, according to reports reaching
here today.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Western diplomatic sources in the Saudi capital Riyadh,
the Agence France Presse said today that Washington has not yet
responded to the French request.
</P>
<P>
Six French Mirage 2000 combat aircraft, based in Saudi Arabia
for "Southern Watch" operation of the allies, have been
participating in escort missions for American and British aircraft
which patrol over the exclusion zone on reconnaissance missions.
</P>
<P>
To take part in reconnaissance missions in southern Iraq,
France will have to send reinforcements, including Mirage F1-CR or
Jaguar combat aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The French request was presented last month after Washington
accused Iraq of trying to rebuild its military facilities
destroyed by U.S. missiles in the "Desert Strike" operation, said
the same sources in Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
France, however, has been participating in allied
reconnaissance missions in northern Iraq, which are conducted
under the "Provide Comfort" operation launched jointly by the
United States, Britain and France after the 1991 Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Ulster Peace Process Threatened by New Loyalist Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Northern Ireland peace
process was dealt a fresh blow and appeared on the brink of
collapse Tuesday after prisoners from the Ulster Defense
Association (UDA) withdrew their support for the truce.
</P>
<P>
In the most serious threat to the loyalist ceasefire,
Protestant paramilitary prisoners affiliated to the UDA held in
the Maze prison outside Belfast announced Monday that they were
withdrawing support for the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The announcement followed meetings between prisoners'
representatives and leaders of the Ulster Democratic Party (UDP),
the political wing of the UDA.
</P>
<P>
They complained of a lack of progress, saying their ceasefire
was under strain because of the IRA's resumption of bomb attacks
in mainland Britain.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting the inmates, John White, the UDP
spokesman, said that the prisoners no longer believed talks could
achieve a political settlement in Ulster because the IRA was using
the peace process to step up its terrorist campaign.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he was concerned about a situation which could
develop into crisis and warned of "dire consequence" for the
loyalist ceasefire, which has held since October 1994.
</P>
<P>
A leading UDA prisoner said that inmates were frustrated that
the government had failed to reward them for maintaining their
support for the loyalist ceasefire in the face of renewed IRA
violence.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners also expressed frustration that British and Irish
governments were still going out of their way to allow Sinn Fein
to join the multi-party talks despite the end of the IRA ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) Monday hardened its
own terms for continued participation in the talks, warning that
it would not enter substantive negotiations with Sinn Fein, even
with an IRA ceasefire, until some IRA arms had been
decommissioned.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Ministers Plea for Flood Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's co-Prime Ministers
have appealed for emergency assistance for flooding victims, while
a Phnom Penh municipal leader warns that the capital city could be
submerged within a week.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers, Norodom Ranariddh and Hun sen, were in the
central Kompong Cham province on Monday to inspect flooding.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh said the flooding, which had claimed 11 lives, was
the worst in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Rising waters in major rivers have engulfed thousands of
hectares of paddy fields and about 3 million people are affected.
</P>
<P>
In response to the appeal of the prime ministers, the World
Food Program, the United Nations Development Program, the Red
Cross and the United Nations Children's Fund held an emergency
meeting with the National Committee for Disaster Management (NCDM)
Monday afternoon to assess how much relief is needed.
</P>
<P>
Nhim Vanda, head of the NCDM, said 8,000 tons of rice would be
required over the next month to feed the most stricken victims.
</P>
<P>
Aid agencies have provided emergency funds and 2,300 tons of
rice for the victims.
</P>
<P>
Man Chhoern, chief of the Phnom Penh municipal cabinet, said
river levels in the capital had reached 10.84 meters and were
still rising.
</P>
<P>
Water could overflow into the streets of the capital within a
week, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Official flood levels in the city were pegged at 11.20 meters.

<HEADLINE> Redoubled Efforts Called for Poverty Elimination (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official has
urged the redoubling of efforts to carry out development programs
to eliminate poverty across the nation.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty is not socialism, nor are a handful of rich people,"
State Councillor Chen Junsheng said in an article which is carried
on the October edition of the Magazine "Seeking Truth", the organ
of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
It is a magnificent but hard historical task, he said in the
six-page article, referring to China's poverty elimination drive
as it enters a critical period in the coming years in which hope
and difficulty co-exist.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the achievements China has made in poverty relief,
the article says the number of poor population in rural areas has
been reduced to 65 million in 1995, from 250 million in 1978.
</P>
<P>
China's poverty aid project has been carried out in three
different stages, the article says. The poverty-hit population
reduced by a big margin in the period from 1978 to 1985,
decreasing by half, from 250 million to 125 million, thanks to
implementation of reform policies in rural economies.
</P>
<P>
In the period from 1986 to 1993, China has seen a further
decrease of poor population, a reduction of about 6.4 million
annually, it says.
</P>
<P>
The State Council started a new aid-the-poor program in 1994,
aimed at eliminating poverty among the remaining 80 million poor
people in a seven-year period from 1994 to 2000, the article
says. It added that in the first two years the number of poor
population went down by 15 million, with an annual decrease rate
of five million.
</P>
<P>
Over the past ten years, China has reduced the number of people
living in poverty by 60 million, built drinking water projects for
at least 39.6 million people and 42.29 million head of domestic
animals, the article says.
</P>
<P>
In the same period the nation has built 258,000 kilometers of
new highways, 274,000 kilometers of power supply lines, more than
one million fruit farms and 50,000 township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank and other international
organizations, the Chinese government has made greater efforts,
and succeeded in helping backward rural areas to shake off poverty
more than many other developing country, it says.

<HEADLINE> EC Urges Agentina to Remove Trade Barriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
has urged Argentina to take urgent action to remove trade barriers
which are "severely restricting" access to Argentina's market for
European Union (EU) textiles.
</P>
<P>
European Union exporters have identified Argentina as a market
with great potential demand for high quality European exports.
</P>
<P>
However, during 1996 Argentina introduced a range of measures
which "seriously limited" the export possibilities for EU
manufacturers of textiles, clothing and footwear products, the
Commission said.
</P>
<P>
It said Argentina introduced duty rates exceeding the rates
stipulated by the World Trade Organization, as well as restrictive
legislation on labeling and certificates of origin also contrary
to WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
The EU has suggested to Argentinian authorities that an urgent
meeting be held in the next few days to negotiate a deal.
</P>
<P>
The EU warned that it would seek formal WTO consultation should
these negotiations fail.
</P>
<P>
Sir Leon Brittan, the EU Commissioner responsible for external
trade, indicated that it would be the first instance the EU
launched a WTO case on textiles.
</P>
<P>
"If European industry is to compete globally, it is essential
that it too has fair access to markets in third countries," he
said.

HANGZHOU, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Zhejiang Province, east China,
has become one of the biggest users of mobile phones in the
country, signing up 400,000 users. The province has expanded its
switching capacity to one million sets.
</P>
<P>
Catalyzed by the galloping development of the national economy,
and the soaring market demand, Zhejiang's mobile
telecommunications business experienced a rapid take-off since the
first walkie-talkie went live in May, 1992.
</P>
<P>
So far the province's number of subscribers and switching
capacity stands in second place in the country, only next to south
China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The technical benchmark has also quickly improved over the past
four years. The province's analog mobile phone network has been
linked to the rest of China, and boasts an automatic roaming
function. And the digital mobile phone network is also connected
with 300 cities in 24 provinces, and will soon be accessible to
the roaming service in Hong Kong, Singapore, Macao and Germany.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the switching capacity of Zhejiang's mobile
telecommunications is expected to exceed two million, and the
number of subscribers will hit 1.8 million.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Accuses U.S. of Meddling in Internal Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's Foreign Ministry
criticized Washington today in response to a suggestion made by a
United States diplomat over the National League of Democracy (NLD).
</P>
<P>
The ministry official told a new briefing that Washington was
interfering in Myanmar's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the NLD was purely Myanmar's internal affair and
no foreign diplomat was entitled to tell Yangon what to do or what
not to do, U Khin Maung Win, director-general of the political
division of the Foreign Ministry, said.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to U.S. Charge d'Affaires Marilyn Meyer, who
passed a request to him last Tuesday that Yangon did not suppress
the planned NLD congress.
</P>
<P>
The NLD congress is banned by the Myanmar authorities.
</P>
<P>
The act of the U.S. diplomat went beyond diplomatic norms of
international relations, U Khin Maung Win said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister U Nyunt Swe said there were, so far, no
measures taken against Washington on the issue.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Yangon could take appropriate measures in
accordance with the Vienna Diplomacy Convention if Washington went
too far.
</P>
<P>
In view of the friendly relations between the two countries,
the Myanmar government was restrained, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Greek PM Sees Cyprus as Top Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis left here today for Cyprus after his ruling Panhellenic
Socialist Movement (PASOK) won a snap general election a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Simitis said earlier that he chose Cyprus as the first country
to visit after the elections to stress the importance his
administration attached to the east Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
"The Cyprus struggle is a struggle of our nation as a
whole. For our government, Cyprus is the top foreign policy
issue," Simitis said.
</P>
<P>
He was accompanied by Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos,
government spokesman Dimitris Reppas, PASOK General Secretary
Costas Skandalides and other senior officials.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister's visit is taking place within the
framework of making the Cyprus problem the highest national
priority," Reppas declared Monday.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit, Simitis will talk with Cyprus
President Glafcos Clerides and Archbishop Chrysostomos and will
attend the island's all-party national council. He was also to
attend today's military parade in Nicosia commemorating Cyprus'
independence from British rule in 1960.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, whose population is 80 percent ethnic Greek, has been
divided into Greek Cypriot south and the Turkish Cypriot north
since 1974 when Turkey sent troops to take control of one third of
the island.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the Turkish Cypriot side declared a breakaway state
called "the Turkish republic of northern Cyprus," which is
recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Tension on the island has risen over the past two months
following the killing in August of two Greek-Cypriots who entered
the U.N.-patrolled buffer zone separating the
government-controlled area from the Turkish-held area.

</P>
<P>
Among the crowd were 200 lamas from the Sera Monastery, one of

</P>
<P>
"Today is the national day. We were excited to see the national

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 1,000 celebrities and
representatives of all walks of life in Macao gathered today to
celebrate the 47th anniversary of founding of the People's
Republic of China, which is observed today.
</P>
<P>
Ma Man Kei, chairman of the presidium of the preparatory
committee of the Macao Compatriots National Day Celebration
Committee, highly praised the achievements China made over the
past 18 years after China adopted the policy of reform and opening
to the outside world, and attributed the success to Deng
Xiaoping's theory.
</P>
<P>
"The rapid growth of China's national economy has proved that
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics totally tallies with the actual situation in
China, and has a great vitality," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So long as we march forward along the way, our motherland will
become a modernized strong nation among the countries in the world
in half a century," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Ma, also chairman of the Macao Chamber of Commerce and
vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), condemns those who
wanted to split Taiwan from China, and stressed that the Diaoyu
Islands are part of Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
"The Diaoyu Islands are indisputably part of Chinese
territory," he stressed. "The Chinese people, including the Macao
compatriots, firmly support the solemn and just stand of the
Chinese Government. We also firmly support the Government in
taking all necessary and effective measures against the Japanese
Government to defend state sovereignty and territorial integrity."
</P>
<P>
In addition, he urged Macao compatriots to make greater
contribution to the stable transition and smooth handover of power
in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The chairman attributed the progress in transitional affairs to
the joint efforts of both China and Portugal, and said that more
efforts should be made as only a little more than three years time
is left before the handover of power in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The time is urgent but the task is arduous," he said. "All
compatriots of Macao and people of all walks of life should be
united,... and make greater contribution for the realization
of 'one country, two systems', 'Macao people governing Macao', and
for the prosperity and stability of Macao."

<HEADLINE> Number of Taiwan Tourists to Macao Rises Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The number of Taiwan travelers to
Macao increased sharply during the first seven months of the year,
up 134.2 percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures released by the Macao Census and Statistics
Department show that among the 4.66 million visitors to Macao from
January to July, the number of Taiwan visitors rose by the largest
margin.
</P>
<P>
Although no detailed figures are available, the increase in the
number of Taiwan visitors is believed to be the result of the
opening of the Macao International Airport, which has air routes to
two destinations in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Air Macao now has quasi-direct flight across the Taiwan Straits,
operating air routes between Taipei, Kaohsiung and Beijing, Shanghai
or Xiamen via stopover in Macao. The service was most attractive to
many investors in the mainland, and brought about an increase of
Taiwan travelers.
</P>
<P>
The number of visitors from the Republic of Korea, Japan,
China's mainland, Thailand, the United States and Britain also
increased during the first seven months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of passengers holding Hong Kong
credentials has declined by 8.7 percent, indicating that many come
directly to Macao rather than via Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Inaugurates 22nd Trade Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today inaugurated the 22nd Tehran International Trade
Fair, saying that his country is trying to promote international
cooperation and exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,500 foreign companies from 53 countries are
participating in the fair despite the latest tough sanctions by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said that 2,500 Iranian firms along with the
foreign companies are participating in the trade fair, which
occupies an area of about 200,000 square meters at the permanent
grounds for trade fairs in uptown Tehran.
</P>
<P>
"We don't just want to facilitate trade by hosting the trade
fair. We want the fair to provide a forum for cultural and
scientific exchanges," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said "We hope a lot of information would be exchanged
between the South and the North and the South and the South
here. Our other goal is to contribute to world peace and
understanding."
</P>
<P>
Iran is now a secure place for work and a good intersection
for cooperation between the East and the West and the South and
the North, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Silk Road in the Iranian part is very active
in every way as far as road, communications, energy ... are
concerned.
</P>
<P>
From the point of domestic view, he added, it is a good
example of the developments and independence.
</P>
<P>
The foreign companies taking part in the exhibition are from
countries including Jordan, China, Indonesia, Ukraine, Singapore,
 Syria, Qatar and Maldives.
</P>
<P>
Today's English-language daily Tehran Times carried an
editorial, noting "the above fact conveys a clear message to
U.S. President Bill Clinton and his administration that their
hostile attempts to isolate Iran in the international scene have
practically failed and the U.S. economic sanctions against Iran
have yielded nothing except disgrace on the white house."
</P>
<P>
In fact, the daily added, the U.S. economic sanctions against
Iran have not only failed to isolate Iran, but have prompted
those countries opposing the U.S. hegemonic policies to
strengthen their links with Iran.
</P>
<P>
"The enormous participation of the foreign companies in the
trade fair is also a token of Iran's rapid growth in the area of
economy and industry and the deep trust of other nations in Iran
as a reliable friend and partner in various ventures as well as
economic and industrial enterprises," it said.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Pledges Continuous Talks with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 1 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of today's summit
in the U.S. capital of Washington, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to hold "continuous talks" with the
Palestinians until an agreement is reached.
</P>
<P>
The local daily Jerusalem Post today quoted Netanyahu as
saying, on his plane en route to Washington, that both he and
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat would closely
monitor the progress of the talks to maintain their momentum.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on the plane, Netanyahu outlined his
two goals in the upcoming summit, initiated by U.S. President
Bill Clinton, "a cessation of violence and a speedy resumption
of negotiations and their conclusion."
</P>
<P>
Clinton has invited Netanyahu and Arafat, as well as
Jordanian and Egyptian leaders, to the summit, in an attempt to
resuscitate the peace process following last week's violent
confrontation between Israel and the Palestinians in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The confrontation, which was triggered by the opening of an
ancient tunnel, known as the Hasmonean Tunnel which passes from
the Jewish area to the Moslem quarter, by Israel in Jerusalem's
Old City, was the most serious in the last few years, and has
left some 70 dead and hundreds of others wounded.
</P>
<P>
"I am proposing that the two sides meet right after the
meeting in Washington, in a locale to be determined, to engage
in continuing negotiations until an agreement is reached," said
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"The subjects that should be negotiated," he told reporters,
include "(the redeployment in) Hebron, the question of the
closure (on the West Bank and Gaza Strip) and question of
security."
</P>
<P>
He added that once the agreement is reached on these issues,
"implementation can be immediate."
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli premier seemed to dismiss the issue of
Israel making gestures to the Palestinians during the talks in
Washington, saying that the Hasmonean Tunnel would not be on the
agenda of the summit.
</P>
<P>
A top Netanyahu aide said that Israel would be seeking a
reaffirmation from the summit that violence could not be used by
any side as lever to attain political results.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that he hopes his meeting with Arafat in
Washington will lead to a rebuilding of trust between the
Israelis and Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Prices Shoot Up Again in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government has
increased fuel prices for the third time this year by between six
and eight percent, with effect from midnight on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Leaded petrol went up by six percent from 0.39 U.S. Dollar to
0.42 U.S. Dollar per liter, while diesel rose from 0.31 U.S.
Dollar to 0.33 U.S. Dollar per liter, an increase of seven
percent.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the increases in a statement, Transport and Energy
Minister Simon Moyo said these had been necessitated by recent
political events in the major oil producing countries of the
Middle East which resulted in rising operational costs.
</P>
<P>
Moyo said his ministry had made efforts to keep the increases
to the barest minimum.
</P>
<P>
Fuel prices have the effect of increasing the cost of
production across the board in both the public and private
sectors. This in turn fuels inflation which is currently pegged
at 17.7 percent.

Seed houses and fertiliser companies have reported good
business so far with farmers stocking up on inputs ready for the
planting season, officially expected to begin by the middle of
this month.
</P>
<P>
Commercial farmers have already made huge purchases of inputs
while most smallholder farmers are still planning on the
quantities they require. Smallholder farmers said while some of
them had planned early, the Grain Marketing Board (GMB) had
frustrated their plans as it was delaying in paying for maize
from the last harvest that had been delivered.
</P>
<P>
However, most farmers are in a much better financial position
this year largely as a result of the past agricultural season
which saw them reducing their debt burden and making plans for
further expansion, the Daily Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's agriculture now offers farmers wider choices and
more opportunities as the marketing of crops has been
decontrolled. The export markets, except for maize, have been
opened to them and some are saying this year will see them
venturing on the regional export markets.
</P>
<P>
The farming organizations are advising farmers to plan
carefully and grow crops with better rewards and bright prospects
for the future. Farmers now not only have to be good at farming
but at marketing as well to be successful.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe Farmers' Union President Gary Magadzire said, ''Our
agricultural production increased by about 150 percent this year
because of the good season we experienced. Estimated value of
total production exceed 600 million U.S.Dollars, which is about
sixfold from last year.''

<HEADLINE> Security Officials Warn of Resumption of Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli security officials
have cautioned that violence will resume in the Palestinian
territories if the Washington summit fails, reported Israel Radio
today.
</P>
<P>
The officials believe that Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat has come to conclusion from last week's events
that he can use violence to advance peace process and influence
public opinion in Israel and elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security officials hold similar view, according to
 a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in east
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian officials said that a new round of battles
with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) will break out if the crisis
summit in Washington does not produce dramatic results that will
satisfy Palestinian demands.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that tension is high among Palestinians,
and pointed to Israeli reinforcements, including tanks, armored
personnel carriers and helicopters, as increasing Palestinian
fears of an imminent IDF attack.
</P>
<P>
They said they do not know whether they can count on
maintaining discipline within the ranks of the police and other
security forces without Arafat's presence. "Until anything, we
have to be prepared for any thing," one official said.
</P>
<P>
The Washington summit is due to conclude Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of Israel's Hebrew daily Ha'aretz
today, IDF soldiers have received an order to shoot at any
Palestinians who approach Israeli army positions in the occupied
Palestinian territories. The paper did not give its source of
information.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has invited Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, Palestinian leader Arafat, Jordan's King Hussein
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the Washington
summit in an effort to restart Arab-Israeli peace talks following
an outbreak of violence in the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
However, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa has said Egypt
will not attend the summit.

<HEADLINE> Drug Growing Problem in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Drug (mbanje) trafficking
continues to be a major problem along zimbabwe's eastern border
areas as trade in the illicit drug proves lucrative, a senior
police officer said.
</P>
<P>
Officer commanding police in Mutare district in eastern
Zimbabwe Chief Superintendent Davies Chifamba said between
January and August this year the police intercepted 1,022 kgs of
drug with a street value of 510,000 U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
During the same period last year, 311 kgs of drug with a
street value of 160,000 Dollars were recovered by the police
along the eastern border areas.
</P>
<P>
He said the police were doing everything possible to curb drug
trafficking and of late the Mozambican police have been working
hand in hand with their Zimbabwean counterparts to smash illegal
trade in mbanje along the border.
</P>
<P>
Most of the mbanje intercepted by police, Chifamba said, came
from Mozambique where some Zimbabweans bought it at a very cheap
price with the intention of taking it to more lucrative markets
in the cities of Harare and Bulawayo, the country's second
largest city.
</P>
<P>
Other illegal mbanje dealers were taking the drug to Botswana
and South Africa where the drug fetched even higher prices.

PHNOM PENH, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Co-Prime Ministers
Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen briefed more than 200 senior

The prime ministers told the officers that the talks between
the government negotiation team and the Khmer Rouge group, in
Battambang Province last Friday, had achieved positive results.

The government team was headed by Ke Kimyan, Chief of General
Staff, and Khmer Rouge split faction leader Ieng Sary's
representatives were Sok Pheap, Commander of 450 Division, and Ith
Cheung, Commander of 415 Divisions.
</P>
<P>
Ieng Sary's representatives agreed to integrating their troops
into the RCAF and wearing RCAF uniforms.
</P>
<P>
General Tom Sambol, a military adviser to Prince Ranariddh,
said it was very important that generals understood the ideas of
the prime ministers.

<HEADLINE> Fast Growth Projected for Shanghai's NC Machine Tools Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The sales volume of
Shanghai-made industrial numerical controlled (NC) machine tools
will reach three billion yuan by the year 2000, making up more
than half of the machine tool industry output in the city.
</P>
<P>
Over 500 million yuan will be invested to improve equipment in
the machine tools industry in the next five years, especially NC
machine tools, which will take up 25 percent of China's domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
China has become the second largest market of machine tools,
with a total consumption of four billion U.S. dollars, next only
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, in 1995 Shanghai's machine tool industry generated
about 1.5 billion yuan of sales volume, and only nine percent was
attained by NC machine tools.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years the total output value of engineering
industries will register an average increase of 13 percent every
year, thus greatly raising the demand of NC control machine tools.
</P>
<P>
Now the city has 36 machine tool enterprises, and 11 of them
are Sino-overseas joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Another 20 Sino-overseas joint ventures in the industry will be
set up between now and the year 2000.

<P>
YANGON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar high official Colonel
Ngwe Soe Tun in a press briefing here today said that Myanmar is
doing its utmost in the fight against drug abuse with its own
resources.
</P>
<P>
Ngwe Soe Tun, secretary of Myanmar Central Committee for Drug
Abuse Control (CCDAC), denied that Myanmar did not co-operate
fully in the implementation of the objectives of the 1988 UN
convention as announced by US President Clinton last March,
because of which it was not eligible for aid from the US.
</P>
<P>
He said that the one-sided pronouncement by the US blindly
ignored Myanmar's anti-narcotic efforts, saying that it was not a
balanced approach nor was it a fair one.
</P>
<P>
He suspected that the US itself is not doing its best to
decrease the demand even though it is rich in resources.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Myanmar takes the fight against drug abuse
as a national duty.
</P>
<P>
He added that Myanmar would like to cooperate with its
neighbors, the region, the United Nations and the international
community as a whole in the fight against drug abuses.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Firms Take Lead in Registered Capital Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The growth of registered
capital in foreign-funded companies hit 29.07 per cent during the
first seven months of this year, topping other sectors in
Shanghai, the industrial and financial center of China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the registered capital of private
businesses increased by 23.36 per cent, while a capital reduction
was recorded for the first time in the state-owned sector.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the quick growth in foreign capital was due
to the increasing profitability of the Shanghai market, while
growing enthusiasm of local residents in investment resulted
in the expanding capital of private firms.
</P>
<P>
The city's tightening of capital auditing measures and the
increase in bankruptcies are considered two major causes of the
decline in registered capital in the state-owned sector.
</P>
<P>
The analysts say that the decline will continue for a time, but
will not produce any negative effect on the city's economy.
</P>
<P>
During the first seven months this year, the city's industrial
output grew by 15.5 per cent, and the state-owned sector generated
an increase of 11.8 per cent, equaling that of last year.

HARARE, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Over 1,400 women were reported
to have been raped countrywide in first half of this year,
Zimbabwe daily Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
Police said deterrent sentences being imposed on violent
crimes were failing to check them.
</P>
<P>
Of the reported cases, only 366 had been solved. Zimbabwean
courts imposed a mandatory seven-year sentence on convicted
rapists.
</P>
<P>
However, some pressure groups feel harsher sentences need to
be imposed as victims now run the risk of being infected with
HIV.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a total of 3,148 women were raped and only 727
people were convicted of the offence.
</P>
<P>
Police said late reporting of crimes made it difficult for
police to make arrests in time. A number of cases went unreported
because of the stigma associated with being raped.

So far the province has eight operational state-owned coal
mining zones, and the construction of four more new state-owned
coal mines is being carried out swiftly.
</P>
<P>
Locally-run coal mines in operation now total 465, while 147
similar coal mines are being built.
</P>
<P>
Last year the province produced 80 million tons of coal, of
which the state-owned coal mines accounted for 50 million tons.
All the products were sold, and the province has earned profits
for three years running.
</P>
<P>
The officials also disclosed that state-owned coal mining
administrations in the province plan to invest 14 billion yuan
(1.687 billion U.S. dollars) in infrastructure over the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
Vast potentials exist in developing the local coal industry, as
29.11 billion tons of verified coal reserves have been reported.
</P>
<P>
According to one plan, the province will be able to produce 100
million tons of coal by the year of 2010.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Launches Fresh Street program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- the opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist party (BNP) has announced a fortnight-long action
program in the country's 6 divisional headquarters to press its
demand for the end to the government's "repressive" measures
against BNP leaders and workers.
</P>
<P>
According to BNP sources here today, the program includes
massive demonstration, procession and rally. The party gave the
government until October 15 to meet the demands with a note of
warning that they would be forced to go for tougher action if the
demands were not met, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
This is BNP's second ultimatum to the present 100-day-old
government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on the demands
including release of the arrested BNP leaders and workers and
withdrawal of "false" cases against them. The first ultimatum
given on September 10 went unheeded.
</P>
<P>
The BNP has alleged that over 100 leaders and workers of the
party had been killed within 100 days of the rule of the new
government while thousands of others were arrested and charged in
various false cases.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the BNP has also strongly criticized the "massive
riggings" of the ruling Awami League (AL) during the September 5
by-elections in 15 constituencies and demanded immediate
resignation of the chief election commissioner Abu Hena for his
"partisan" role in conducting polls.
</P>
<P>
On Monday afternoon, the BNP held a huge rally in the capital
Dhaka to further press home their demands.

<HEADLINE> Japan's First Digital Satellite Begins Broadcast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Japan's first digital satellite
starts broadcast today, marking a new era of multichannel
commercial broadcast in the country.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the number of channels of PerfecTV will expand to
more than 170 channels from its initial total of 60 including
radio broadcast, PerfecTV Corporation said.
</P>
<P>
Digital broadcasting via satellite has attracted keen interest,
not only from existing media but from wider industrial sectors,
since the image-compressing technology under the digital format
can boost the number of channels about six times of the level
currently available under analog satellite broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
PerfecTV has so far sold 35,000 receivers for its service.
Subscribers are expected to reach 300,000 by the end of this year
and some one million within the next three years, said Hiroto
Kasahara, president of PerfecTV.
</P>
<P>
With Japan Sky Broadcast and other competitors set to enter the
market, Kasahara said competition is likely to intensify.
"PerfecTV as the front-runner will go where the competition cannot
reach," he said.
</P>
<P>
PerfecTV programs are beamed via the JCSAT-3 communications
satellite operated by the Japan Satellite Systems Incorporation.
</P>
<P>
Competitors are expected to enter the market soon, industry
analysts say.

<P>
TOKYO, September 30, (Xinhua) -- Japan's first digital
satellite broadcasting service operator, PerfecTV, has doubled its
capital to 10 billion yen (91 million U.S. dollars) ahead of its
start of service on Tuesday, the company said today.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo-based company said it has issued 50 billion yen (455
million dollars) of new shares for third-party allotment to 28
companies, comprising five existing shareholders and 23 new
investors like Toyota Motor, Sony and Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone Corp.
</P>
<P>
Other new investors included entertainment firm Yoshimoto Kogyo
and movie producer Shochiku Co., which are expected to supply
programs for the new service.
</P>
<P>
The company's president, Hiroto Kasahara, said PerfecTV is
looking forward to increasing its present 57 channels to 70
channels by the end of December and to 100 by next spring.
</P>
<P>
"We will meet the needs of the audience by boosting capital
investment and technological development," Kasahara said.
</P>
<P>
PerfecTV said it will increase its capital by an additional 5
billion yen (46 million dollars) by the fall of next year in
response to the need.

NEW DELHI, October 1 (Xinhua) -- 40,000 people are dying due to
air pollution every year in six Indian cities, 7,500 of them in
new Delhi, capital of India, said a local report.
</P>
<P>
Every year Indians are paying 340 billion rupees ( 10.2 billion
us dollars) due to the effects of massive environmental
degradation which will eventually threaten the future generations.
Water and air pollution alone impose a health cost of 245 billion
rupees ( 7.36 billion US dollars ) every year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Indian cities are choking with industrial and vehicular
pollution. Clean drinking water in most cases is still a dream and
premature deaths and debilitating disease are common.
</P>
<P>
Ozone, a dangerous air pollutant, is not even measured in
Indian cities. And carbon monoxide emissions in many cities are 50
times higher than the standards of the World Health Organization
(WHO), the report further said.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Not to Tolerate Japan's Claim to Tokto Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 1 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will not tolerate
Japan's claim to Tokto (known as Takeshima in Japan) Island, a
foreign ministry spokesman said late on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that it is an irresponsible act for the
Japanese ruling party to unprecedentedly include a claim to the
island in its campaign pledges.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Tokyo said that Japan's Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP), in its campaign platform for the general elections to be
held on October 20, laid claim to Tokto along with the Four
Northern Islands and China's Diaoyu Island.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the LDP is also vowing to increase the official
payment of tributes to the Yasukuni Shrine where World War II
criminals are enshrined, the spokesman said that the move
represents an attempt to justify Japan's aggressions during the
war.
</P>
<P>
Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula from 1910 until its World War
II defeat in 1945.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government will continue to deal firmly with
any Japanese claim to Tokto and their move to make formal tributes
to the Yasukuni Shrine, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The South Korea-Japan territorial dispute erupted on February 9
this year when Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihito Ikeda said that
Tokto is part of Japan's territory, triggering angry responses
from South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda's remarks followed South Korea's announcement that it
would build a wharf on the island, an outcropping rock in the East
Sea (Sea of Japan) about midway between South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The rocky islet has an area of 0.186 square kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Swift Action Urged for HIPC Debt Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A world organization today
called for swift action to help the heavily indebted poor
countries (HIPC).
</P>
<P>
The Development Committee of the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund (IMF) made this call in a communique issued after
the 53rd meeting of the committee held here under the chairmanship
of Mohamed Kabbaj, minister of finance and foreign investment of
Morocco.
</P>
<P>
Kabbaj told a press conference after the meeting that the
participant ministers had "very positive and constructive"
consultations over the HIPC initiative, which is expected to start
in the next few months on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that ministers welcome the commitment of
the IMF, reflected in the statement of the interim committee on
September 29, to participate in the enhanced assistance to be
provided under the HIPC initiative through the economic structural
adjustment facilities operations, including long maturity loans or
grants.
</P>
<P>
The committee supported the World Bank's proposed 500
million-U.S.-dollar initial contribution, and possible additional
contributions. Ministers also welcomed the Paris Club members'
indication that they were ready to go beyond Naples terms to
provide debt reduction of up to 80 percent for countries
qualifying for additional relief within the HIPC initiative, and
that their decisions would be made on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
Ministers also welcomed the readiness to participate in the
initiative program indicated by several multilateral agencies, and
urged other multilaterals to define their participation as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The committee agreed that the proposed multilateral HIPC Trust
Fund, to be administered by the International Development
Association, the concessionary lending arm of the World Bank,
would make an effective contribution to the success of the
initiative, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Ministers requested the IMF and World Bank to begin
implementation of the initiative for the first potentially
eligible countries before the end of 1996 and to report back to
the committee at its next meeting on progress.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that among those likely to be first listed are
Uganda, Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), Ethiopia and Guyana. Other
possible beneficiaries include Bolivia, Mali and Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also requested the World Bank and IMF to assist
those countries not yet members of the World Trade Organization to
join the organization, and to assist all members, particularly the
poorest, to become more fully integrated into the multilateral
trading system.
</P>
<P>
The six-day joint meeting of the World Bank and IMF, which
closed today, drew representatives from the G-7 industrialized
countries, the G-10 finance countries, the G-24 developing
countries, the IMF Interim Committee and the joint ministerial
Development Committee of the bank and IMF.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Signs Spending Bill for Fiscal 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton today signed a spending bill which provides 389 billion
U.S. dollars for federal agencies and some government programs in
the 1997 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The bill was signed about two hours before the start of the new
fiscal year, ensuring there would be no repeat of last year's
partial government shutdown when agencies' spending authority
lapsed.
</P>
<P>
In a signed statement, Clinton called the spending bill "good
for America" because it ensures substantial amounts of money for
education and training, environmental protection and law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
"It moves us further toward our goal of a balanced budget while
protecting our values and priorities," he said.
</P>
<P>
The bill was approved by the U.S. Senate earlier today by 84
votes to 15 and by the House of Representatives on Saturday night
by 370 votes to 37.
</P>
<P>
The bill includes 244 billion dollars for the military and 145
billion dollars for health, education, commerce, trade, foreign
aid and other programs.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Congress had previously approved seven of the 13 spending
bills before today, leaving six wrapped in today's package. The
total spending in fiscal year 1997, excluding automatically paid
benefits like Social Security, is 504 billion dollars, up from the
498 billion dollars in fiscal 1996.
</P>
<P>
The passage of budget bills in the U.S. Congress this year
contrasts sharply with last year, when the battle between the two
parties resulted in two partial government shutdowns totaling 27
days.
</P>
<P>
Both the Senate and House members are eager to finish the work
and go home for their re-election races.

<HEADLINE> Macao Residents Mark China's National Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 1,000 celebrities and
representatives of all walks of life in Macao gathered here today
to celebrate the 47th anniversary of founding of the People's
Republic of China, which is observed today.
</P>
<P>
Ma Man Kei, chairman of the Presidium of the Preparatory
Committee of the Macao Compatriots National Day Celebration
Committee, highly praised the achievements China had made since
China adopted the policy of reform and opening to the outside
world 18 years ago, and attributed the success to Deng Xiaoping's
theory.
</P>
<P>
"The rapid growth of China's national economy has proved that
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics totally tallies with the actual situation in
China, and has a great vitality," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So long as we march forward along the way, our motherland will
become a modernized strong nation among the countries in the world
in half a century," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Also chairman of the Macao Chamber of Commerce and
vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), Ma condemns those who
wanted to split Taiwan from China, and stressed that the Diaoyu
Islands are part of Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
"The Diaoyu Islands are indisputably part of Chinese
territory," he stressed. "The Chinese people, including the Macao
compatriots, firmly support the solemn and just stand of the
Chinese Government. We also firmly support the Government in
taking all necessary and effective measures against the Japanese
Government to defend state sovereignty and territorial integrity."
</P>
<P>
In addition, he urged the Macao compatriots to make greater
contribution to the smooth transition and handover of power in
Macao.
</P>
<P>
The chairman attributed the progress in transitional affairs to
the joint efforts of both China and Portugal, and said that more
efforts should be made as only a little more than three years time
is left before the handover of power in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The time is urgent but the task is arduous," he said. "All
compatriots of Macao and people of all walks of life should be
united,... and make greater contribution for the realization of
"one country, two systems"', "Macao people governing Macao", and
for the prosperity and stability of Macao."

<HEADLINE> Argentina Expects Development in Agriculture, Livestock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A world grain and
livestock market, affected by increasing prices and madcow disease
threat, is offering Argentina the opportunity to become the
granary of the world.
</P>
<P>
The country, already known as the granary of South America, is
vying with the United States, Canada and Australia by exporting 15
million tons of grains and 500,000 tons of beef each year.
</P>
<P>
The grain and livestock exports, which account for 20 percent
of the country's gross domestic product and 55 percent of its
total exports, are produced by only 4 percent of the country's
population on less than one tenth of its farmland, according to
official figures.
</P>
<P>
With advanced technologies coupled with fresh interest to
invest, Argentina is in a position to rise to meet the increasing
demand for grains and beef early next century.
</P>
<P>
A drastic rise of wheat prices in the past 12 months is luring
more Argentineans to expand production plans and extend farming
areas.
</P>
<P>
The South American country will get another boost as the United
States and European Union nations will be forced by the new global
trade system to reduce their subsidies to agriculture and
livestock sectors.
</P>
<P>
With years of efforts, agriculture and livestock have become
key sectors of Argentina's economy and the concentration of land
ownership facilitates the mechanization of the farming process,
from sowing, irrigating, fertilizing to harvesting.
</P>
<P>
Argentina can also enjoy a global service network which offers
machinery maintenance, seeds, transportation, warehousing,
pesticides and fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
The National Institute of Agriculture and Livestock Technology
is disseminating the latest information concerning climate, pest
and stock market and advanced technologies as well as encouraging
the application of the information and technologies in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The last but not least thing Argentina needs to do to kick off
its further development of agriculture and livestock is attracting
more money in that the current Argentine peso-U.S. dollar exchange
rate has considerably increased the prices of raw materials and
production costs in the country.
</P>
<P>
Some grain farmers and cattle raisers have to remain indebted
for some time before getting paid after selling their products.

MEXICO CITY, September 30 (Xinhua) -- More than 20 million
tourists will visit Mexico this year, 13 percent more than 1995,
Mexican Tourism Minister Silvia Hernandez forecast today.
</P>
<P>
The increase should also mean a 19 percent rise in tourism
income, which was 6.6 billion U.S. dollars in 1995, said the
minister while inaugurating the Global Conference 96 of Resorts
Condominiums International in Cancun, a tourist resort in the
eastern state of Quintana Roo.
</P>
<P>
Mexico is the world's eighth most popular tourist destinations,
said Hernandez.

<HEADLINE> China a Positive Force for Stability in 21st Century (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hu expected the momentum of development to continue in the next
century. A number of overseas research institutes have predicted
that in the first 20 years of the next century, China's gross
domestic product (the value of goods and services produced) will
be among the largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Even if this prediction proves to be true, however, China will
remain a developing country in per-capital terms," Hu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
While China's self-defense capability will improve, it will
still be far behind the military powers in the world.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping, chief architect of China's reform program,
forecast that China would meet the standard of
moderately-developed countries in the mid-21st century. Chinese
statesmen and economists generally agree that this objective will
be realized.
</P>
<P>
"By then, China will become a big, prosperous country in the
world," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
As to the question whether a powerful and prosperous China will
serve as a stable and positive factor in the world, Hu said that
the socialist system China practices, along with various policies
implemented in line with the system, guarantees that China will
continue to do so in the next century.

"In the next century, China will continue practicing the
reformed socialist system suited to national conditions," he said,
adding that this system requires the establishment of a socialist
market economy.
</P>
<P>
The system also asks for further economic growth, along with
improved socialist democracy and co-operation with the outside
world in economy, trade and technology.
</P>
<P>
Such a system requires a peaceful international environment
boosted by a foreign policy of peace, he noted. "The various
foreign policies China is currently pursuing are compatible with
the nature of the socialist system we practice."
</P>
<P>
For instance China, not seeking hegemony itself, opposes any
kind of hegemony and power politics.
</P>
<P>
"In the course of modernization drive, we must stick to and
constantly improve those policies with regard to foreign
relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu said he believes that future generations, by learning from
China's and other countries' experience in socialist construction
in the 20th century, will understand that if China failed to be a
stable and positive factor in the world on the road to prosperity,
it would face the danger of self-destruction.

HAIKOU, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The city government in Haikou,
capital of the island Hainan Province, has announced a series of
measures and preferential policies to accelerate house building in
urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the city government explained that the measures
and preferential policies have been worked out in accordance with
the spirit of a recent national working forum on urban housing
construction.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, real estate has been developing quickly in
the city. However in the process of developing the sector,
problems have occurred, including excessive supply and a
irrational structure.
</P>
<P>
Too many luxury flats and villas have been built, with few
practical and economical apartments offered for the common folks.
</P>
<P>
The latest move by the city government is aimed at cultivating
new economic growth outlets and adjusting the economic structure,
by orienting real estates to economical apartments for ordinary
people, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
The newly adopted measures include the issue of housing
purchase loans with longer repayment terms, and tax cuts for land
developers who invest in housing in line with the new
policy.

<HEADLINE> Aid Agency to Move Food Supplies Into Kabul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations' food aid
agency is sending as much food as possible into the Afghan capital
Kabul in case of emergency.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program (WFP) said it was taking advantage of
the fact that all main roads into the capital were open for the
first time in three years to stock up on supplies.
</P>
<P>
The WFP's warehouses in Kabul already hold 4,650 tons of food -
enough to feed 220,000 hungry people in the city for two months.
</P>
<P>
The food includes wheat, wheat flour, edible oil, sugar, pulses
and high-protein biscuits.
</P>
<P>
But the U.N. aid agency now plans to move in a further 10,500
tons - enough for four months' supply - over the next three months
to tide the people over the harsh winter months if needed.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time in three years that all the main roads
into Kabul are open," said a WFP official for Afghanistan. "We're
pre-positioning food into our warehouses there so that we will be
prepared in the event of an emergency."
</P>
<P>
With the opening of the roads, WFP expects food to be available
through commercial sources. But the purchasing power of the urban
poor is so low that they cannot afford to buy food at market
prices.
</P>
<P>
The WFP program, which currently feeds some 220,000 people, is
scheduled to expand its distribution to 300,000 people -- or one
quarter of the country's population -- by the end of this year.
The program provides food through WFP bakeries, which bake bread
for almost 140,000 people, food for work projects and meals to
hospital patients and malnourished children.

BANGKOK, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Caretaker Prime
Minister and Nam Thai (Thai Leadership) Party (NTP) leader Amnuay
Virawan Monday reversed his decision to quit politics, assuring
that his party would not be dissolved, a local newspaper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The change came after a number of NTP members criticized his
decision to quit and demanded that he lead them into the election,
the Bangkok Post said.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay had earlier informed his party members of his decision
to quit and the financial support was the main reason behind his
consideration, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Some former members of parliament promised to spend less in the
campaign in light of Amnuay's concerns about funding.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also said that the NTP's Secretary-General
Sornchai Montriwat tried to convince members to dissolve the party
and join the New Aspiration party led by Chavalit Yongchaiyudh.
</P>
<P>
The NTP had 18 seats in the parliament which was dismissed by
Banharn Silpa-Archa last weekend. The new general election was

</P>
<P>
He said China is confident that after 1997, Hong Kong will
continue to be prosperous and stable, and retain its position as a

SAN JOSE, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A code of ethics for Costa
Rican diplomats and local embassy staff came into force today
aimed at preventing a recurrence of scandals which have plagued
the country's foreign service.
</P>
<P>
The code says diplomats must behave beyond reproach both in
private and in public, should not abuse privileges and immunities,
not conduct any profitable activity in the country where they are
stationed and must not accept gifts.
</P>
<P>
They are also prevented from acquiring debts of more than their
monthly salary without the authorization of the foreign service
directorate.
</P>
<P>
The code of ethics is part of a series of measures recommended
by a special commission appointed by the government to investigate
the situation of the Costa Rican foreign service.
</P>
<P>
A case in point was that of Luigi Ardino, an Italian employee
in the Costa Rican embassy in Belgium between 1990 and 1993. He
was arrested here last year after it was discovered he was wanted
by the Italian police on charges of economic crime.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Approves First Two State Welfare Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
today approved the welfare plans for Wisconsin and Michigan, the
first two states to submit plans under the terms of the nation's
new welfare reform law.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, U.S. President Bill Clinton praised the plans
developed under the leadership of the Republican governors of the
two states as innovative efforts to move welfare recipients into
the workplace.
</P>
<P>
The Wisconsin plan in particular became a focal point of the
debate leading up to enactment of the federal plan, when Clinton
praised it as an example of the type of statewide reform he could
support as a nationwide model.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said in his statement that "Wisconsin's plan to replace
the broken AFDC (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) system
with a system based on work is one of the boldest, most
revolutionary welfare reform plans in the country".
</P>
<P>
Referring to Michigan and Wisconsin, the president said, "I
congratulate both states for recognizing what all Americans agree
on: welfare reform is first and foremost about work."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, after two vetoes of previous versions and months of
debate among White House aides and Democrats in general, signed a
reform bill in August written by the Republican-led Congress that
would cut federal spending on welfare by some 55 billion
U.S. dollars over six years.
</P>
<P>
The bill also ended the federal guarantee of welfare benefits
and gave primary control to individual state governments, limited
lifetime welfare assistance to five years, required able-bodied
adults to work after two years, allowed states to impose even
tighter time limits and prohibited key benefits for most legal
immigrants who have not become citizens.

<HEADLINE> Senate Democrats, Republicans Agree on Immigration Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Legislation to curb
immigration passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on the
weekend was voted through by the Senate and included in the budget
for the 1997 fiscal year which starts on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Senate Democrats and Republicans agreed on a plan that would
increase penalties for alien smuggling and for producing the phony
documents many illegal immigrants use to get jobs in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The measure also would nearly double the size of border patrols
by increasing the number of officers by 1,000 a year for the next
five years. Local police and other law enforcement officers would
have the authority to arrest illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Illegal aliens would face more severe penalties and faster
deportation. Welfare workers would be allowed to check
immigrants' legal status before giving them welfare checks.
</P>
<P>
Before the changes, some Democrats had complained that the
measures did little to punish businesses that hired illegal
immigrants and was too harsh on legal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
After talks, Republicans agreed to soften a measure requiring
legal U.S. residents to earn up to 200 percent of the poverty
level before they can sponsor foreign relatives to enter the
country as immigrants. Minimum income levels were set instead at
125 percent of the poverty level, up from the 100 percent required
under the current law.
</P>
<P>
Also dropped was a provision that would have put legal
immigrants in danger of deportation if they received 12 months of
public benefits within their first seven years in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Measures that would have barred immigrants from using Medicaid
to pay for treatment of AIDS or HIV infection was left out at the
insistence of the White House.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Reject New Issues at WHO Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will reject issues
harming its interest which are to come up outside of the agreed
agenda of the first ministerial meeting of the World Trade
Organization (WHO) in Singapore in December this year, a senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
"We must be careful on new issues to be put forward by the
industrialized countries," Industry and Trade Minister Tunky
Ariwibowo said here on Monday after meeting President Soeharto,
official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The new issues will include multilateral agreement on
investment, labor wage standard, government spending and
competition.
</P>
<P>
"Investment regulations should be based on each country's
policies and Indonesia already has its own investment
regulations," the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Ariwibowo said Indonesia should keep an eye on every proposal
on multilateral investments apart from those on labor
standardization and other issues.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia hopes that the WHO meeting would only discuss
trade agreements reached in Marrakesh, Morocco in 1994.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Moving to Seek Talks With Taliban in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
moving toward establishing contact with the Taliban Islamic
Militia who took control of Afghanistan's capital Kabul last week
and formed a committee to run the country.
</P>
<P>
"We will be sending an emissary to Kabul this week from our
embassy in Pakistan," said a senior official. "We are leaving all
our options open regarding relations with the Taliban."
</P>
<P>
The Taliban guerrillas overran the Afghan capital last week,
solidifying their hold on all but the northern parts of the
country. Reports say it is not clear whether the Taliban have yet
formed a working government.
</P>
<P>
Forces of the former government of President Najibullah who was
executed last week are still operating in the northern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The rebels began heading northward today for an apparent
showdown with the forces of Abdul Rashid Dostum. Both sides said
fighting could break out at any time.
</P>
<P>
The United States began a series of meetings with the Taliban
when it became apparent several months ago that they were likely
to seize power in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The meetings were held either in Pakistan or in Washington
between leaders of the Taliban guerrilla group and Assistant
Secretary of State Robin Raphel, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
"It's in our interest to continue talking to Taliban," State
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said. "We'd like to have some
diplomats travel there and make contact with them."
</P>
<P>
"We will have to decide at some point in the future when to
re-establish an embassy," he added. The U.S. has not had an
ambassador in Afghanistan since 1989.
</P>
<P>
Fighting among rival groups has devastated Afghanistan since
the collapse of the Moscow-backed government of President
Najibullah in April 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban guerrilla movement emerged in 1994 and swept across
southern Afghanistan in late 1994 and 1995, gaining control of
three fourths of the country.

<HEADLINE> Jury Rules in Favor of Former Tyson Trainer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) - A jury awarded $4.1
million Monday to Kevin Rooney, former trainer of heavyweight
boxing champion Mike Tyson, in a contract dispute with the
fighter, according to a report from Reuter.
</P>
<P>
The federal court jury in Albany decided that Tyson did not
prove just cause to fire Rooney in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Tyson, who was sued for $49 million by Rooney, described
the verdict as "ridiculous" and said, "if Kevin would have
asked me for four million dollars I would have given it to
him".
</P>
<P>
Reuter said Rooney had accused the boxer in the lawsuit of
failing to honour a verbal contract made to him by Tyson's late
mentor, Cus D'Amato, promising him a lifetime job with a
guaranteed 10 percent cut of the boxer's winnings. Tyson's
attorney had countered that the boxer knew nothing about such a
contract.
</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied," Rooney told reporters at the courthouse.
"I never expected 49 million but you can't take blood from a
stone. They came in with what they feel is a just verdict and
I'm not going to argue with it."

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Urges Lukashenko and Parliament to Reconcile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin today appealed to Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko to resolve his differences with the country's
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that reconciliation between the Belarussian
president and the parliament was very important, according to the
Interfax news service.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the two sides to sort out their differences and
urged Lukashenko to work patiently and painstakingly to reach a
compromise and avoid deterioration of the situation.
</P>
<P>
The Russian news service today reported that Yeltsin made the
remarks in a letter to Lukashenko referring to the Russia-Belarus
Community of Sovereign Republics, a treaty proposing closer ties
between the two countries which was signed by the two leaders in
Moscow last April.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also praised the positive work Russia and Belarus have
done in implementing the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president said the task facing the two countries
was to build a single economic region and an effective common
market.

<HEADLINE> China a Positive Force for Stability in 21st Century (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- China will constitute a positive
force of stability in Asia and the world at large in the next
century, according to a noted Chinese scholar.
</P>
<P>
In a signed article in the National Day issue of Qiushi
(Seeking Truth), a fortnightly theoretical journal of the Chinese
Communist Party central committee, Hu Sheng, president of the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that the People's
Republic of China has acquired the ability to defend and develop
itself since its founding in 1949.
</P>
<P>
He said that experience in the 20th century demonstrates that
if China, a country on the Euroasian continent with a vast
territory and a huge population, were divided, poor, weak and
unable to be self-sufficient, it would bring sufferings to the
entire population and even become a burden to and an unstable
factor in the world.
</P>
<P>
According to Hu, for China to play an increasingly positive
role in the world, namely the role of advancing world peace and
development, the 1.2 billion Chinese people must enjoy a
relatively comfortable life, with enough to eat in the first
place, while the nation must have the necessary self-defense
capabilities, making it impossible for any forces in the world to
attempt aggression.
</P>
<P>
In the last 20 years of the 20th century, China has
concentrated on the socialist modernization drive, pursuing a
reform and open policy, with the national economy growing at an
average annual rate of nine percent, he noted.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Approves Spending Bill for 1997 Fiscal Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate approved a
huge spending bill for the 1997 fiscal year today, just hours
before it was due to begin, and sent it to President Bill Clinton
for signature.
</P>
<P>
Unlike last year when the two parties fought fiercely on
spending bills, both Democrats and Republicans are determined to
wrap up their work for the passage of the 1997 budget in the
election year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives approved the 3,000-page
package by 370 votes to 37 on Saturday night. And almost all
House members immediately left for home to concentrate on their
election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The Senate passed the bill by 84 votes to 15 on Monday. The
budget package provides funds of 389 billion U.S. dollars for
defense and other domestic programs in fiscal 1997 which begins
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The measures include 244 billion dollars for the military and
145 billion for health, education, commerce, trade, foreign aid
and natural resources programs.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress has already completed seven of the 13 annual
spending bills before today, leaving six that were included in
this package. The total spending in fiscal 1997, excluding
automatically paid benefits like Social Security, is 504 billion
dollars, up from the 498 billion dollars in fiscal 1996.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton has promised to sign the spending bill into
law.
</P>
<P>
The speedy passage of the 1997 budget bills in the
U.S. Congress this year contrasts sharply with the 1996 bills,
when confrontation between the two parties resulted in two partial
government shutdowns totaling 27 days in December 1995 and January
1996.
</P>
<P>
The budget fight for fiscal 1996 between two U.S. parties was
seen by many people as pre-performance of this year's elections
with the Democrats having an upper hand in the battle.

<HEADLINE> Perry Orders Probe of Report on Nerve Agents in Gulf War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry has ordered an investigation into a report that
U.S. commanders in the anti-Iraq war in 1991 asked troops to
ignore reports of nerve agents on the battlefield while they
themselves were protected by air filters in their headquarters.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very distressed that some people seem willing to believe
the worst about the military and the Pentagon. I'm very concerned
about that," Perry said during a photo session in his office.
</P>
<P>
The Birmingham News, in a report Sunday, cited log reports
compiled for General Norman Schwarzkopf at his headquarters in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to assess the threat of chemical weapons in
the war against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The report said U.S. commanders, who had sealed their
headquarters with airlocks and used chemical warfare filters for
ventilation, told troops to ignore reports of low-level nerve
agents.
</P>
<P>
Jim Brown, who heads the advocacy group Gulfwatch, acquired the
logs last year under the Freedom of Information Act and provided
copies to the Birmingham News.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon acknowledged earlier this month that U.S. troops
involved in the destruction of an Iraqi depot of weapons in
southern Iraq may have been exposed to sarin nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon announced on September 18 that at least 5,000 Gulf
War veterans may have been exposed to nerve agents at that time.
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 veterans returned home suffering from ailments
such as aching joints, fatigue and memory loss, Brown said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's KISDI Condemns Israel Over Aqsa Tunnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Condemning Israel for opening a
tunnel in the complex of Al-Aqsa mosque, Jerusalem, chairman of
KISDI (Indonesian Committee for Islamic World Solidarity)
Sumargono said Indonesia should never think of establishing
diplomatic ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly condemn the opening up of the tunnel and violation
of human rights which Israel committed by shooting Palestinian
protesters," Sumargono said here Monday, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
He said the opening of the tunnel will gradually destroy the
Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam's third holiest shrine, after Masjidil Haram
and Nabawi mosque in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the Arab countries will seriously unite
themselves to pressure Israel. Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
needs the Arab countries' support in demanding that Israel close
the tunnel, he added.
</P>
<P>
"If Israel refuses to close the tunnel, the Arab countries
should help Arafat by launching an economic embargo on Israel and
those who have established ties with Israel should review the
relations," said Sumargono.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Foreign Ministry last Friday issued a statement
which strongly condemned the opening of the tunnel by Israel and
the shooting of protesting Palestinians by Israeli soldiers.

<HEADLINE> World Steel Consumption Edges Ahead in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The world's consumption of
iron and steel will rise by one percent this year, the
International Iron and Steel Institute (IISI) forecast today.
</P>
<P>
Total consumption is expected to reach 657.1 million tons this
year, compared to 652.2 million tons of 1995, and is expected to
grow to 714 million tons by the year 2000, the IISI report said.
</P>
<P>
Some 350 executives of the world's major iron and steel
companies across the world attended today's IISI annual meeting in
Helsinki, at which IISI Secretary General, Lenhard Holschuh, noted
that the rapid growth in developing countries' demand for iron and
steel has led to an increase in steel consumption worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Asian countries have seen the most rapid growth, especially
China, which is expected to become the world's largest iron and
steel consumer by 2000, Holschuh said.
</P>
<P>
But against this rosy forecast, he highlighted growing concerns
about the sluggish iron and steel consumption of industrialized
countries in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Poor Farmers to Be Relocated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 160 poverty-stricken
farm households in southwest China's Guizhou Province will be
relocated and start new lives next year through a poverty-relief
plan, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Details of the plan were announced over the weekend by the
Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Hong Kong-based China Start Light
Charity Fund Association and the Guizhou civil affairs authorities
at a signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
This is the first co-sponsored resettlement operation for poor
rural people in China's poverty-alleviation campaign which is
expected to solve the problem of providing food and clothing for
the country's 65 million poor farmers by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
The programme will help 801 people, in the remote southwestern
mountainous areas of Guizhou Province, leave the poverty caused by
barren land.
</P>
<P>
As part of the plan, the Ministry of Civil Affairs and local
authorities have granted 1.68 million yuan (about 202,400 US
dollars) for the construction of houses and other infrastructure
facilities for the resettlement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Hong Kong charity association has pledged to
provide another one million yuan (about 120,000 US dollars) as
start-up funds for the poor to develop some economic projects
through an invest-develop-invest model.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Military Base Reverts to Panama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government will
officially hand over the Fuerte Amador Naval Base to the
Panamanian authorities on Tuesday in accordance with the
Torrijos-Carter Canal treaties signed in 1977.
</P>
<P>
The 176-hectare base, valued at 129.4 million U.S. dollars, is
on the east bank of the Panama Canal Pacific entrance.
</P>
<P>
The assets reverting to Panama include an office complex, a
post office, a 500-seat theater, a community club, 185 family
houses, a 1,800-square-meter warehouse, a golf course and a motel.
</P>
<P>
This is the third U.S. military base to revert to Panamanian
sovereignty since September 1994, when the governing Revolutionary
Democratic Party assumed power.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Army Southern Command vacated the David and Espinar
bases in September 1995, both located on the banks of the Atlantic
sector of the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
Fuerte Amador is to be developed into a major tourist zone and
some 400 million U.S. dollars have been earmarked for investment
in the area.
</P>
<P>
The project includes a golf course, a yacht club, a marina,
hotels, tourist villas and a street-car public transport system.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian authorities have signed a contract and four letters
of intent with national and foreign investors who will develop the
site.
</P>
<P>
The handing over of the U.S. bases is part of the terms of the
1977 treaty under which the U.S. will hand over the Canal and its
management to Panama and end its military presence in the country
by December 31, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Moslems Call for End of Afghan Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Moslems in Indonesia are calling
on all fighting parties in Afghanistan to immediately settle their
armed conflict in the spirit of Islamic brotherhood, a spokesman
said here.
</P>
<P>
Lukman Harun, chairman of the Committee for Islamic Solidarity,
said on Monday that efforts should be initiated soon to prevent
further bloodshed in Afghanistan where fighting between rival
groups had already taken numerous lives.
</P>
<P>
Harun made the statement as Taliban militia were consolidating
their position after gaining control over Kabul, the capital of
the central Asian country, and forcing the Afghan government of
Burhanudin Rabbani and Gulbudin Hekmatyar to flee.
</P>
<P>
"There are actually no fundamental differences between the
conflicting parties in Afghanistan as all of them want an Islamic
government in the country," Harun said, adding that the only thing
dividing them was their different ethnic origins.

<HEADLINE> Misuari Proposes "Constitutional Amendments" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Moro National Liberation Front
chief Nur Misuari proposed "constitutional amendments" to pave the
way for the election of senators by region, Philippine local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
speaking on Monday at his inauguration as the governor of the
autonomous region in Muslim Mindanao, he asked President Ramos and
Congress to give Mindanao an "equitable representation" in the
"vital organs of the government", including the senate, even if it
would mean amending the charger.
</P>
<P>
"We seize this historic opportunity to inform (President Ramos)
and our leaders of influence of our intention to seek immediate
redress, immediate change or immediate amendments to some laws and
even to the constitution", Misuari said.
</P>
<P>
With the election of senators by region, the number of senators
will increase from the present 24 to 72. Misuari wants 24 of them
will come from Mindanao and vowed to turn Mindanao, where a war
was fought for 24 years and 120,000 lives were claimed, into a
zone of economic development.
</P>
<P>
But before the inauguration, he also said that his soldiers who
are not to be integrated into the military and police services
will not turn over their weapons and will continue to station in
their posts in mountains.

<HEADLINE> Leading Magazine Applauds China's Achievements (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A commentary in China's leading
magazine Qiushi (Seeking Truth) applauds the year 1996 as a good
start for the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and the long-term
development program for the coming 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The commentary, entitled "Maintaining Good Momentum, Scoring
Greater Achievements", is published in the latest issue of the
magazine today, the country's National Day.
</P>
<P>
According to the article, in the first half of this year
China's GDP increased by 9.8 percent over the same 1995 period,
with commodity retail prices rising by 7.1 percent and the
consumer price by 9.2 percent, an increase much lower than last
year.
</P>
<P>
The commentary notes that grain production this summer reached
a record 3.5 billion kilograms, and the added value for the
industries continued to grow, 13.2 percent more than that of the
same 1995 period.
</P>
<P>
At a time when the country's overall economy cherished a
healthy development, progress has been made with various
undertakings in a wide spectrum of social sectors, says the
article in Qiushi, a fortnightly theoretical journal of the
Chinese Communist Party central committee.
</P>
<P>
with the deepening of fight against corruption and intensified
crackdown upon crimes, social order has been improved, the article
notes.
</P>
<P>
It states that the Communist Party of China has paid greater
attention to Party building, and praised a number of models and
heroes who have inspired the whole nation in the course of
building up a better socialist society.
</P>
<P>
In general, the commentary says, 1996, the first year of the
Ninth Five-Year Plan and the long-term plan for the 15 years, has
served as a good start in the country's overall progress.
</P>
<P>
The commentary attributes the economic and social achievements
to the Party's correct leadership and people's arduous
efforts.

<P>
In building up the socialist market economic system, an
entirely new and complicated work, there may emerge new problems
and contradictions to be dealt with, the article explains, calling
on the whole nation to stay in high spirits in overcoming various
possible difficulties in the course of advancement.
</P>
<P>
The commentary urges accelerated pace of economic
restructuring, improvement of the macro management system, focus
on reform of the state-owned enterprises with a view to
establishing the modern enterprise system at an early date.
</P>
<P>
Also, it asks for further strengthening of agriculture, which
represents the basis of national economy, pointing to losses
suffered in natural disasters in wide-ranging areas, despite a
record bumper harvest in the summer.
</P>
<P>
Effective steps must be taken to ensure a good harvest in the
autumn, with losses of floods and drought reduced to the minimum,
the commentary adds.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the article calls for more efforts to develop
socialist culture and ideology, urging strengthening of Party
building, tightening of the fight against corruption, greater
efforts to advocate socialist ethics, and promotion of science and
education.
</P>
<P>
The commentary expresses the conviction that under the
leadership of the Party Central Committee, with Jiang Zemin at the
core, the Chinese people will overcome all possible difficulties
to achieve economic prosperity together with ethical and cultural
advancement.

Hanson could damage Australia's economic interests and export
prospects, the Deputy Prime Minister Fischer said yesterday.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Urges Assistance to Africa to End Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Namibian Foreign
Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab today called on the international
community to assist the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to end
violent conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the general debate of the current session of the
U.N. General Assembly, he said, "Africa is bleeding as much as the
souls of the African people are burning in misery and mayhem.
Their precious humanity and lives have been denuded of dignity and
worth."
</P>
<P>
"How long must this carnage and dehumanization be allowed to
continue in Somalia, Burundi and other tormented places in
Africa?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the glimmer of hope in Liberia engendered by the
recently-concluded peace accord must not be snatched away again by
unscrupulous power-grabbers and political opportunists.
</P>
<P>
The longstanding OAU/UN partnership and cooperation should be
brought in the emerging favorable situation in Liberia with a view
to stabilizing the transition and preventing any military
reversals, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Just as peacekeeping cannot be successful without
international involvement, so also does regional post-conflict
peace-building and reconstruction depend on international support
to be successful," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is here where preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and
peacekeeping come together to do good for all, he said.
</P>
<P>
OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim is anxious to apply all
those conflict situations to the mechanism for conflict mangement,
prevention and resolution, but he is short of resources, the
Namibian foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the international community to render generous
assistance to the OAU for this purpose.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Declines to Attend Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak has formally declined U.S. President Bill Clinton's
invitation to attend a summit in Washington on the Middle East
peace process and the recent violence in the region.
</P>
<P>
The summit is designed to rejuvenate the Middle East peace
process and end the violence that rocked the region during the
past week, U.S. administration officials said today.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa will come to Washington
for the summit but will not take a direct part in the talks, the
State Department said.
</P>
<P>
But State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said Moussa "will
be available for discussion" with all parties outside of the
summit.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has said that he saw no clear goal of the summit, and
it was not enough only for a photo opportunity and "handshaking
meeting" at the summit.
</P>
<P>
He said that even if calm is restored between the Israeli
government and the Palestinians after the Washington summit, "no
one can ensure the calm will continue. The situation can explode
again, as long as the agreements and treaties are not
implemented."
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton will meet with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat separately, and then both together. But it remained
unclear whether the two antagonists would sit down together
without any intermediaries, he added.
</P>
<P>
"They will meet separately bilaterally with the president. They
will then have a working session. Beyond that I don't want to
speculate on what might occur," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
McCurry admitted there is not a formal agenda for the summit,
only saying it was "foremost on the president's mind that all
these leaders do everything they can to see that the violence in
the region subsides."
</P>
<P>
"We attached no preconditions to the discussions but we asked
only that the leaders arrive in a frame of mind to address the
fundamental questions that will be before them over the next two
days," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both Netanyahu and Arafat are heading for Washington for the
summit, reports said.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein is to arrive in Washington early this evening and
possibly meet with Clinton before the formal start of the summit
talks.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called the summit Sunday as the four-day clashes
between the Palestinians and the Israeli authorities have costed
more than 70 lives and hundreds wounded, throwing the Middle East
peace process on the verge of collapse, and thus threatening his
profile as the initiator of the peace process in the region at the
critical moment of his election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The clashes erupted after the Israelis under Netanyahu's
authority opened a controversial ancient tunnel near Jerusalem's
al-Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam's holiest shrines.
</P>
<P>
Outraged Palestinians staged demonstrations in the West Bank
and the Gaza strip and were suppressed by Israeli police, which
soon evolved into riots.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Mubarak said Israel must close the tunnel and adhere
to peace agreements it signed with the Palestinians in 1993 and
1995.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu refused to put the issue of the tunnel on the
summit agenda, only saying he just requires Arafat to end violence
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Warren Christopher has said that people
should not expect any "miracle" from the summit and he might
foresee the fate of the Washington summit.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Presidency Holds First Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The three members of
Bosnia's presidency today agreed on an agenda of the new
government's endeavor at their first meeting since their election.
</P>
<P>
Alija Izetbegovic, a Muslim and chairman of the presidency,
Momcilo Krajsinik, a Serb, and Kresimir Zubak, a Croat, met for
four and half hours in a small room of the Saraj Motel on the
suburbs of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued afterwards said that the inaugural
meetings of both the presidency and the new parliament would be
held this Saturday and the presidency would select a council of
ministers by the end of the months.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to restore telephone lines across Bosnia's two
entities and release all remaining prisoners of war, except those
charged with war crimes.
</P>
<P>
The international community's High Representative Carl Bildt,
who attended the beginning and the end of the meeting, told
reporters it was "a business-like session" and held in "a
business-like atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
"Of course, there is a long way to go, but they started and
that's good," he said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time since the end of the war that leaders of
three ethnic groups have met to discuss the establishment of joint
institutions of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"They are assuming authority over the country and the fact that
they are doing this within 24 hours of certification of election
results -- I think this is a good sign," Bildt said. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Australia recommended
today that the nuclear weapon states take "six immediate steps" to
eliminate their nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The six immediate steps, which are contained in a report

from delivery vehicles; ending the deployment of non-strategic
nuclear weapons; ending nuclear testing; initiating negotiations
to further reduce U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals; and an
agreement amongst the nuclear weapon states on reciprocal no first
use undertakings, and of a non-use undertaking by them in relation
to the non-nuclear weapon states.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered at the 51st General Assembly session,
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said the proposal was
made out of the desire to keep up the positive momentum generated
by the adoption of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and to
develop imaginative new ways of guiding the world into the next
century.
</P>
<P>
Believing that the report will make a major contribution to
international thinking and discussion on nuclear disarmament,
Downer said he would present the report to the U.N.
secretary-general Tuesday and introduce it to the Conference on
Disarmament in January.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Expects Faster Economic Growth by Year End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia expects an
intensive economic activity and a rise in production and exports
in the last quarter of 1996 due to the lifting of sanctions,
Mihailo Milojevic, president of the Yugoslav Chamber of Commerce,
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, which were imposed by the United Nations in May
1992, are expected to be totally lifted in the coming days in
accordance with the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
Talking about business with foreign countries, Milojevic said
imports should be dominated by raw materials and
semi-manufactures, while exports should be linked with industrial
cooperation with Yugoslav firms, foreign investments and exports.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about economic cooperation with the former Yugoslav
republics, he said a balance between imports and exports must be
maintained. At present, "there is an impermissible discrepancy in
their favor," he added.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has normalized relations with two of the four former
Yugoslav republics -- Macedonia and Croatia. The Belgrade
government has said it will establish diplomatic relations with
Bosnia-Herzegovina after the elected central governing
institutions start to function, which is expected in the next few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The first Bosnian presidency held a joint meeting today in
Sarajevo, which was attended by the three members of the
presidency, the first of its kind in more than five years.
</P>
<P>
At the economic session in the Yugoslav Chamber of Commerce
today, Yuglslavia's Assistant Minister of Trade Tomislav
Milenkovic said the country's foreign trade deficit of more than 1
billion U.S. dollars over the past eight months of 1996 should not
be regarded as a negative result.
</P>
<P>
The raw materials and semi-manufactures account for 80 percent
of the foreign trade deficit, and they have all been brought into
the country under barter arrangements, he said.
</P>
<P>
Contracts already exist with domestic firms for their payment,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Milenkovic also noted that the intense economic activity
expected in the last quarter would reduce the foreign trade
deficit to the planned 500 million U.S. dollars by the end of the
year.

<HEADLINE> Muslims Must Leave Bosnian Serb Village: IFOR Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A commander of the NATO-led
multinational peace Implementation Force in Bosnia (IFOR) said
today the Muslims who unlawfully entered the Serb village of
Jusici on September 20 must return to the Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to the Public Security Center in the Serb town
of Zvornik in eastern Bosnia, IFOR second U.S. Brigade Commander
Col. John Batista said the incursion of the Muslims into Serb land
was a violation of the Dayton peace accords.
</P>
<P>
He added that negotiations were under way with authorities of
the Muslim-Croat federation to make the Muslims, who were armed,
leave Jusici, a Serb town near Zvornik.
</P>
<P>
A group of Muslims entered the Serb town of Jusici 10 days ago,
with some of them taking arms with them. The IFOR confiscated
their pistols and semi-automatic rifles and urged those Muslims
who claimed to rebuild their old houses in Jusici to retreat in
order to avoid new clashes with local Serbs.
</P>
<P>
The talks about Jusici will be followed by talks about the
villages of Dugi Do and Mahala, also in the Serb territories, that
Muslims had entered earlier.
</P>
<P>
Batista recommended that Muslim refugees apply for return to
Republika Srpska through proper channels, submit documents to
prove they had lived there before the war and sign statements
showing they wish to live there again and undertaking to obey its
laws.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Criticizes Helms-Burton Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Foreign Minister
Roberto Robaina Gonzalez said here today that the U.S.
Helms-Burton Act, aimed at everyone's sovereignty, was conceived
as an additional effort to compel Cuban people to surrender
through hunger and poverty.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the general debate of the 51st session of the U.N.
General Assembly, he said that the law was an example to impose
"imperial designs to sovereign and independent countries on the
management of their own trade and international relations."
</P>
<P>
"Ignoring the General Assembly resolutions on this issue, this
law is intended to further strengthen the blockade against our
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another instance of the attempt to dictate the conduct of
sovereign states was the law known as D'Amato-Kennedy which had
also received a universal rejection, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"A state could not be allowed to arrogate upon itself the
individual right to accuse, condemn and sanction other nations,
and to impose by force an illegitimate crusade which covers many
times the real terrorists," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized some U.S. politicians who hold such a view:
there were states which deserved more privileges than others. "By
doing so, they intend to transform into dead letter the principle
of sovereign equality of states, cornerstone of the Charter
approved over 50 years ago in San Francisco," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the most powerful country's attempt to cut U.N. programs
assisting the developing countries, he said it was a new and gross
attempt to impose on the community of nations the will of a single
state in the management of multilateral concertedness.

<HEADLINE> Preparation for Return of Hong Kong Well Under Way: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Every preparation for the
return of Hong Kong to the motherland is well under way, Chinese
Ambassador to the United Kingdom Jiang Enzhu said here this
evening.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark at a reception he gave at the embassy in
celebration of the 47th anniversary of the founding of the
People's Republic of China. The reception was attended by more
than 600 representatives of overseas Chinese and Chinese students
in Britain.
</P>
<P>
There are 273 days to go before China resumes the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong, and this is a matter of great concern
by all the Chinese people, and by overseas Chinese as well, the
ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
After the return of Hong Kong to the motherland, Jiang said,
China will firmly implement the principles of "one country, two
systems" and "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong." Hong Kong's
existing social and economic systems and way of life will remain
unchanged, its laws will remain basically unchanged and Hong
Kong's status as an international trade, financial and aviation
center will be maintained, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the Chinese government and people are confident
about and capable of accomplishing the stable transition and
smooth transfer of the power of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the 6 million Hong Kong people,
with a powerful backing of the motherland, will create a more
prosperous Hong Kong by displaying their intelligence and wisdom.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said, "The return of Hong Kong is closely linked
with the revitalization of the Chinese nationality. It means that
a century of national disgrace will be finally washed away. It
also marks an important step forward to the reunification of the
motherland."
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong will certainly have a positive and
profound bearing on the settlement of the Taiwan question, in
accordance with the principle of peaceful reunification and "one
country, two systems," Jiang added.

<HEADLINE> China Having Buyer's Market  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When China is now blessed with abundant supply of consumer
durables, more than a decade of economic reform has also brought
about an abundance of foodstuffs across the country.
</P>
<P>
Any foodstore is nowadays overflowing with foodstuffs.
Different brands of cooking oil, which used to be rationed,
compete for customer attention. The average store may sell dozens
of breads and cookies.
</P>
<P>
Foodstores, usually state-owned, face tough competitions from
so-called free markets where farmers sell their produce to urban
residents, as the government is now adopting market-oriented
policies to encourage surplus farmers to do business in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
There are now some 83,000 free markets throughout the country,
of which about 5,600 handle wholesale business. In 1995 their
business volume reached 1,159 billion yuan, according to an
official with the State Administration of Industry and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the existence of free markets, large quantities of
fresh fruits from south China such as pineapples, litchis and mangos
are sold in northern Chinese cities. In Beijing, watermelons from
Hainan Island are readily available even in winter.
</P>
<P>
As the country becomes more prosperous, stores in big cities
are going upscale. Beijing, for example, is home to scores of
plush shopping centers each stocked with some 100,000 kinds of
goods.
</P>
<P>
Most big stores have extended their business hours to 10 pm
today from 6 pm in the past. Going shopping has become part of
people's night life in cities.
</P>
<P>
"On weekends, our turnover can reach five million yuan," said
Jian Chao, a sales director of Beijing Modern Plaza, a shopping
center that opened to business last year.
</P>
<P>
Amid the market boom, however, are problems that make consumers
unhappy. The most serious is perhaps a big "abundance" of
counterfeited goods, despite repeated government crackdowns on
counterfeiting.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey by consumer associations, complaints
cover a wide range of products such as shoes, cigarettes, wines,
consumer electronics, fertilizers, crop seeds and even medicines,
</P>
<P>
Another problem is inflation which stood at 14.8 percent in
1995. The government has vowed to keep inflation below 10 percent
this year.

<P>
HARARE, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A five-day technical
conference of the Commonwealth association of tax administrators
started here today, seeking ways of fostering cooperation in
taxation.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the meeting will especially discuss the use of
computers in tax administration and ways of enhancing the
effectiveness and efficiency of the tax departments.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Zimbabwe's Finance Minister Herbert
Murerwa said the Zimbabwe government would change the structure
of its tax administration departments to enhance the
effectiveness of its revenue generation activities.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is working on the possibility of
introducing value added taxation in place of the existing sales
tax as it is believed this international trend could help improve
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
''I have no doubt that this conference will help our tax
administrators to update themselves on the international
developments in tax administration and thus help them to improve
our tax administration for the benefit of the nation,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has
approved a package of ECU 1.42 million (1.79 million U.S. dollars)
worth of humanitarian aid for Tadjikistan and Kyrgyzstan, two of
the poorest countries in the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The aid, channelled via the European Community Humanitarian
Office (ECHO), will enable Red Cross and non-governmental
organizations to carry out coordinated programmes over the next
six months.
</P>
<P>
In Tadjikistan, about 85 percent of the total population is
living below the poverty line and most people in Kyrgyzstan have
had no improvement in their living standards.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have to import all their medical supplies,
though they can hardly afford it. A typhoid epidemic was declared
in Tadjikistan recently.
</P>
<P>
In the package, ECHO has earmarked ECU 1.1 million(1.38 million
dollars) to Tadjikistan and ECU 320,000 (403,200 dollars) to
Kyrgyzstan.

HARARE, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government is

ignore existing procedures of retrenchment and opt for liquidation.
</P>

Speaking at the opening of a two-day national seminar on

procedures.
</P>
<P>
"What worries the government at the moment is the apparent
circumvention and by-passing of normal labor practice of
following the prescribed and clear labor shedding procedures of
retrenchment in preference for liquidation," said Chitauro.
</P>
<P>
She said some "unscrupulous and unprincipled" companies,
especially in the clothing and textile industries, are laying
off workers without awarding them their deserved and rightful
payment.

<HEADLINE> Deng Yaping Wins 1st Women's Table Tennis World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 30 (Xinhua) -- China's world champion and
Olympic gold medalist Deng Yaping added another major trophy to
her already shining collection of honors as she won the inaugural
FILA World Cup Women's Table Tennis Tournament here Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Deng, 23, who entering the final by beating Sweden's Marie
Svensson three games to null in an earlier semi-final, won the
final over her younger teammate Yang Ying 21-18, 21-18, 21-17,
thus taking away 22,000 U.S. dollars as top prize money.
</P>
<P>
Yang, 18, gained her final spot with a straight-set win over
another Chinese, Wang Chen from Beijing, in the other semi-final
this evening.
</P>
<P>
Wang took third place by a 23-21, 21-15 win over Svensson in
the play-off prior to the final.
</P>
<P>
The final match between the two Chinese was a game of
will. Both looking exhausted after three days' tough competition,
Yang tried to find her game as she did in the earlier
contests. Her serve-and-smash play helped her hold top-ranked Deng
to three tough games featuring many ties, especially in the second
and third games.
</P>
<P>
But experienced Deng managed to consolidate her defense by
cross shots and long, loop drives, which forced Yang to run from
corner to corner for saves.
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough match for me tonight," admitted Deng after the
victory.
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy to see younger players of our team having grown up
so fast and I think from now on, it is up to them to win major
competitions," she said.
</P>
<P>
Already enrolled in the Beijing-based Qinghua University to
major in business management in the Department of Economics, she
said she might have less time for training in the future.
</P>
<P>
"I have to coordinate these two (studies and training)," she
said.
</P>
<P>
She confirmed her participation in the world championships next
summer in Manchester, Britain, but she will skip the professional
Tour of Europe later this year.
</P>
<P>
She declined, however, to say whether she would be at the 1998
Asian Games in Bangkok. "It's still a long time away, isn't it?"
she asked.

<HEADLINE> Conference to Discuss Role, Prestige of Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Government ministers and
education experts from about 150 countries are to gather here to
discuss ways to strengthen the role of teachers, and how to boost
their prestige..
</P>
<P>
At the 45th International Conference on Education, from
September 30 to October 5, participants are expected to define
ways to improve teachers' recruitment, training, and career
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The conference comes at a time when the profession's weakening
prestige has become a worldwide phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The largest event of its kind, the biennial meeting is
organized by the Geneva-based International Bureau of Education
(IBE), a private organization founded in 1925 and integrated with
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) in 1969.
</P>
<P>
During the plenary session beginning on October 2, Jacques
Delors, head of the UNESCO Commission on Education for the 21st
Century, will chair two major debates on teachers in search of new
perspectives and the role of teachers in building a culture of
peace.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also feature four round table discussions on
teachers, including one on the impact of new information
technologies.
</P>
<P>
The conference will end with the celebration of the third
International Teachers' Day, a UNESCO initiative to enhance and
honor the profession, and the adoption of a declaration and
recommendations on the role of teachers.
</P>
<P>
A recent IBE survey revealed a marked decline in both the
living standards and the social status of teachers in the majority
of countries surveyed. It also showed that teachers were
shouldering bigger workloads and responsibilities while receiving
less training and teaching materials.
</P>
<P>
The IBE said such trends threatened to derail promising gains
in basic education made since the start of this decade.
</P>
<P>
According to the IBE, about 50 million more pupils aged six to
11 years old attended schools in developing countries now than
five years ago. The world' total primary school enrollment rate
was at a historic high of 80 percent, about a 10 percent increase
since 1990.
</P>
<P>
UNESCO projections say that about nine million more qualified
teachers would be needed by the year 2000 in order to achieve
universal primary education. It urged all governments to allocate
at least six percent of their country's gross domestic product to
education.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Washington summit on
the Middle East east peace process was thrown into question today
by reports that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has proposed a
postponement until its success can be assured.
</P>
<P>
The United States, however, moved ahead with summit plans,
saying it expected Arafat to come to Washington this week.
</P>
<P>
"If we are going to break the cycle of violence, we need a
re-engagement of the parties at the highest level, and a delay is
not going to produce that," a White House official said.
</P>
<P>
Dennis Ross, chief Mideast aide to Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, said Arafat's "hesitation" reflected "a decline in
the degree of trust".
</P>
<P>
But he told NBC: "Chairman Arafat has said he would come. We
expect him to be here. We expect to have meetings Tuesday and
Wednesday."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has left for
Washington as planned. King Hussein of Jordan was also reported to
have left for the United States.
</P>
<P>
But Arafat flew to Egypt and met with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak at the port of Alexandria to discuss matters. Later, he
was to fly to Luxembourg to meet European foreign ministers.

LONDON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Irish police have seized a
100-kilo of cocaine, the largest ever haul in the history of the
country, over the weekend, according to press reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
The seized cocaine, which is considered worth 130 million U.S.
dollars, were found in a converted Norwegian trawler docked in
Cork harbor, southern Ireland, Irish police announced earlier
today.
</P>
<P>
Heavy gales had forced the ship, the Sea Mist, to deviate from
its original route between Venezuela and northern Europe and seek
shelter in the Irish dock.
</P>
<P>
Irish police said that four people, including two British
citizens, have been arrested under the new legislation which
allows suspected drug-traffickers to be detained for up to seven
days without charge.
</P>
<P>
It was very much possible that the haul was on its way to
Britain, Irish police added.

"It will be necessary to resolve rather difficult tasks and

<HEADLINE> U.S. Presses Ahead with Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- the United States on
Monday ignored the Palestinian leader's suggestion of a
postponement, and pressed ahead with plans to hold an summit in
Washington in an attempt to quell the flames of riots in the
Middle East that has left more than 70 people killed and hundreds
wounded.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters that the
Washington summit to be attended by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and King Hussein
of Jordan will be held as has been scheduled by President Bill
Clinton in his announcement on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat flew to Egypt early on Monday to meet with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak for consultations over the summit. Arab
diplomats in Cairo said they wanted assurances that the summit
would bring firm guarantees of Israeli gestures toward the
Palestinians during their two-hour meeting in the northwest
Egyptian town of Burg al-Arab.
</P>
<P>
But the United States turned down Arafat's request and said any
delay of the summit was out of the question.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian official said Arafat agreed upon the U.S.
schedule and would go to Washington after he meets European
ministers in Luxembourg on Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and King Hussein have already left for Washington,
but Mubarak's participation remained in doubt, a U.S. official
said.
</P>
<P>
McCurry, in answering a question whether the Washington summit
would produce substantive results, replied: "These talks are
occurring without preconditions, but based on the president's
conversations yesterday. He hopes and expects the leaders to
arrive in a frame of mind to make progress on the issues that
divide them."
</P>
<P>
He said the summit would be a success if Netanyahu and Arafat
agree "to do everything within their power to end the violence
</P>
<P>
... (and) show a renewed commitment to address their
differences in the negotiations."

<HEADLINE> Labor Is Preparing for Government: Shadow Chancellor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BLACKPOOL, ENGLAND, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Gordon Brown,
shadow chancellor of the exchequer said here today that "Labor is
preparing for government".
</P>
<P>
Opening the debate on the economy at the Labor Party Annual
Conference this afternoon, Brown said Labor has emerged stronger
for power with policies that "combine the need for discipline" and
prudence with its "burning passion for social justice".
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor's astonishing
remarks on tax reduction in Washington Sunday, Brown said no one
in Britain believes that "pre-election Tory tax cut can last".
</P>
<P>
In his frank remarks, Kenneth Clarke said people would remember
that the Tories promised tax reductions at the last election.
</P>
<P>
"Frothy tax cuts won't win a vote. It is not the case that my
Budget requires tax cuts in order to win the election," he told
GMTV's Sunday program.
</P>
<P>
"The public will be deeply suspicious of any tax cuts because
they remember we promised tax cuts last time and unfortunately
weren't able to deliver them, so they will look sideways at tax
cuts from this Government."
</P>
<P>
The shadow chancellor said in his aggressive speech that
"Kenneth Clarke now accepts the truth of what we have been saying
for four years", "not even Kenneth Clarke trusts the Tories on
tax".
</P>
<P>
Brown noted that Labor was promising only what it could deliver
and Kenneth Clarke has said "people are deeply suspicious of the
Conservatives because they broke their promises."
</P>
<P>
"People are suspicious because they made promises they knew
they could not keep," he added.

<P>
MAPUTO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Not a single bus was seen in
streets of Mozambique's capital Maputo today as the transport
workers, who demand higher pay, have gone on strike.
</P>
<P>
The strike began this morning, according to the official Radio
Mozambique. But the trade union of the state-run Maputo Public
Transport Company said they were surprised at the news.
</P>
<P>
Drivers of the taxis and mini-buses are very busy, benefiting
from the strike.
</P>
<P>
The Maputo Transport, the only state-run public transport
company which owns 40 buses to cover 60 routes, is at present in
an administrative chaos and lack of fund, according to Joao Jose,
manager of the company.
</P>
<P>
A ticket for the company bus costs merely 4 cents, while the
lowest fare for a mini-bus is 12 cents. And for a taxi, over 3
U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Jose said his company had been pressing the government to
raise the transport fares for the state-run buses, a demand which
was rejected by the government.

<HEADLINE> South Should Have More Seats in UN Council, Alatas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas said on Monday the developing countries, which
comprise the overwhelming majority in the organization, should
have more seats in a reformed Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"It is an anachronism and a gross anomaly that Europe is
overrepresented, Asia under-represented and Africa and Latin
America not represented at all on the Counncil's roster of
permanent members," said Ali Alatas at the 51st session of the
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
On the question of choosing new permanent members of the
Security Council, he said that it should be done on the basis of
two principles.
</P>
<P>
The first principle, he said, is equitable geographic
representation.
</P>
<P>
The second is that the reform should follow such criteria as
political, economic and demographic weight, their capability and
proven track record of contributing to the promotion of peace,
security and development both regionally and globally and their
commitment to assume responsibilities inherent to permanent
membership.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is one of the regional powers which has been
seeking a permanent seat in the Security Council.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.N.
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali calls for greater efforts
to eradicate poverty, which he said has brought a lot of suffering
to children in the world.
</P>
<P>
Children are the first victims of poverty in the world, said
Ghali, while addressing a meeting for a Mid-Decade Review of
Progress toward Achievement of the Goals for Children. He said
that every minute of every day, about 50 babies are born into
absolute poverty. He noted that more than 1.3 billion people still
live in absolute poverty -- 300 million more than in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Cutbacks in basic social services, crushing debt burdens,
proliferating armed conflicts and reductions in development
assistance all deepen the problems confronting children and their
families in many countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We must redouble our efforts to eradicate poverty," said the
secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
He said the world should establish an environment in which the
positive momentum for children can continue and grow.
</P>
<P>
The efforts also require further integration of global
commitments, he noted, adding that "we must expand and strengthen
partnerships between governments, non-governmental organizations,
the private sector and the United Nations agencies."

<HEADLINE> PA Plans 7 Solar Energy Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Authority
(PA) will go ahead with seven solar energy projects following the
recent Harare Conference on Solar Energy, according to
Palestinian newspaper The Jerusalem Times today.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Malek Jaber, Director of the Palestinian Energy
Resources Center, told reporters that the PA will build a solar
power station and carry out the "Eldorado Project" which will
use solar energy to pump water.
</P>
<P>
At the Harare conference, held earlier this month, 1.2 million
U.S. dollars was assigned for the power station that will generate
electricity for remote locations, including schools, clinics and
private homes.
</P>
<P>
The "Eldorado Project" will provide water for populated areas
where there are no existing pipelines.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, the Energy Resources Center has chosen 200
springs and will complete a feasibility study for a further
15 projects, including the establishment of a training and
research center in the West Bank city of Nablus and some water
desalination projects.
</P>
<P>
PA President Yasser Arafat led a Palestinian delegation to
the Harare conference and he was elected as one of 16 members of
the International Committee for Solar Energy.
</P>

JERUSALEM, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Tension remains today in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip despite a prevalence of quietness,
as the Israeli tanks are posted at entrances of the
Palestinian-controlled cities.
</P>
<P>
There were reportedly incidents of stone-throwing in Hebron,
when the Israeli army lifted the curfew on the city to allow its
residents to buy food and other necessities.
</P>
<P>
Quietness was restored in the disputed West Bank town, after
four hours of rioting, as the curfew went back into effect.
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, Arab members of the Knesset (Israel's
parliament) today paid a solidarity visit to the Islamic Waqf
headquarters in the Old City.
</P>
<P>
They held talks with the Islamic Higher Committee on the
current situation in Jerusalem and the Palestinian autonomous
areas, and PLO official in Jerusalem Faisal Husseini also
attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
They were briefed on deteriorate conditions in Jerusalem and
other parts of the West Bank after Israel's opening of the Western
Wall tunnel, which triggered last week's violent confrontations
between Israel and the Palestinians. More than 60 people were
killed and hundreds of others wounded in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli army barred Israeli journalists from
entering the Palestinian-controlled territories in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, citing security reasons.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Journalist Union has denounced the order banning
them from covering events in those areas, while Palestinian

autonomous areas."

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkish State Minister
Abdullah Gul said that Israel must immediately close the tunnel
near the al-Aqsa mosque in East Jerusalem, the semi-official
Anatolia News Agency reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Gul, a close aide to Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan, as saying that the decision by Israel on opening the
tunnel was provocative and that the country was playing with
fire.
</P>
<P>
The controversial tunnel is located very close to al-Aqsa
mosque, the world's third holist site to Moslems.
</P>
<P>
The move by Israel to open the tunnel was seen as a blatant
violation of the Palestinian territory and caused violence in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Gul said: "We will continue our efforts toward the closing of
the tunnel. Al-Aqsa is not only a problem for Palestinians, but
also is the concern of all Moslems. If Israel wants long term
peace in the region, it has to give up this kind of provocation."

<HEADLINE> Labor Pledges to End Cancer Surgery Waiting Lists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BLACKPOOL, ENGLAND, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Chris Smith,
shadow health secretary, speaking in the Health and Community Care
debate at the Labor Party Conference, pledged today that a Labor
government would end all waiting lists for surgery to tackle
cancer.
</P>
<P>
This commitment is a specific focusing of part of the 100
million pounds (150 million U.S. dollars) with which Labor
promised in the Road to the Manifesto to reduce waiting lists.
</P>
<P>
The specific pledge is in response to advice from the medical
profession that ending waiting lists for cancer surgery would make
the greatest difference to patients' psychological well-being
following a cancer diagnosis, and to their chances of better
prognosis.
</P>
<P>
The Tory government does not routinely collect waiting list
data broken down by diagnosis and it has therefore proved
impossible to obtain the exact number of patients waiting for
cancer surgery in Britain.
</P>
<P>
However, based on the extrapolation of figures from the West
Midlands Health Authority, where there are currently 18,000
patients waiting for cancer operations, Labor estimates that the
figure for England is around 137,000.
</P>
<P>
The shadow health secretary said the cost of this pledge has
been estimated by the West Midlands Authority as being between
63.27 million pounds (95 million dollars) at its highest, and 20
million pounds (30 million dollars) at its lowest.

JOHANNESBURG, September 30 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP) would this week rejoin the Constitutional
Assembly sub-committees redrafting the country's final
constitution.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here today by IFP's senior negotiator
Walter Felgate who said it is senseless for his party to continue
to boycott the finalizing process of the constitution.
</P>
<P>
"It would be irresponsible of the parties not to do what was
possible to substantially improve the constitution," he said.
</P>
<P>
The IFP decision was immediately welcomed by the African
National Congress (ANC) and the National Party (NP), the two
major parties of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The IFP withdrew from the Constitution Assembly early last
year in protest against the alleged failure by the ANC to honor
an agreement on international mediation on some major
constitutional issues.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's final constitution, adopted by the assembly on
May 8 this year, was rejected by the Constitutional Court which
demanded the assembly make amendments on some touching issues.

UNITED NATIONS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League
reiterated at a ministerial meeting here today its support for the
Middle East peace process and rejected recent Israeli measures in
violation of agreements reached so far.
</P>
<P>
The opening of an archeological tunnel by Israel alongside Al
Aqsa Mosque kindled Palestinian-Israeli clashes last week. Dozens

Benjamin Netanyahu and possibly Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat.

The meeting of the Arab League apparently was split on the
question of whether Arafat should attend the Washington summit.
While some supported the mission, others said Arafat should not go
unless some guarantees are made that the summit will achieve how
to implement what has been agreed upon.

<HEADLINE> US to Support Lifting Sanctions on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
today that it would support a United Nations resolution to lift
sanctions against Yugoslavia as the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) had certified the September 14
Bosnian elections.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters
that the U.N. Security Council would "very quickly" consider
resolution 1022 on lifting sanctions suspended after last year's
Dayton accords in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"It will be formally lifted I think just in a matter of days.
The United States will support this because it meets the criteria
that we helped to negotiate at Dayton," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Sanctions against Yugoslavia were suspended by the Security
Council last November following the U.S.-initiated Balkan
peace accord which was signed in Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
The council's resolution stipulated the sanctions would be
lifted entirely 10 days after the September 14 Bosnian elections.
But Washington said that the 10-day countdown should begin after
the OSCE had certified the elections in writing.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE certified the results of the elections Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Burns said the certification, coupled with the first meeting of
Muslim, Serb and Croat members of the Bosnian presidency, meant
the Bosnia peace process was moving forward.
</P>
<P>
The three-man presidency held their first post-election meeting
in Sarajevo. Burns called it "a very positive development."

<HEADLINE> French Court Tries Cult Members for Cheating, Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A court in the central French
city of Lyon today began to try 23 members of a cult group called
Church of Scientology, who were accused of cheating and being
responsible for the death of one of its followers in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Today's hearing was restricted to checking the identity of the
23 cult members and questioning them about their role in the
group, said local media reports.
</P>
<P>
Most of the members appeared in court today were accused of
cheating, attempt to cheat, and being accomplice in cheating,
while Jean-Jacques Mazier, the 53-year-old president of the cult
in Lyon, was accused of involuntary attack on a cult member named
Patrice Vic.
</P>
<P>
Patrice Vic died after jumping from a window on March 24, 1988,
in his home in Lyon, after having frequented a local center of the
cult, said his wife.
</P>
<P>
The center, called Center of Dianetique of Lyon, was founded in
1954 by the cult's leader Lafayette Ron Hubbard, and was
officially listed as one of numerous illegal cults in France by a
French parliamentary report late last year.
</P>
<P>
The cult was accused of cheating money from its followers
through opening classes on "relaunching a life of disciple in
phase" and giving treatment of "purification" on its followers.
</P>

The cult, which required its followers to cut their hair short
and wear necktie and jacket, also recruited sports and cultural
stars to promote its publicity, including enlisting tennis star
Arnaud Boetsch.

However, Arnaud Boetsch today denied that the cult has stolen
his money by teaching him religious courses, which he described as
"having very well succeeded."

<HEADLINE> Egypt Not to Attend Washington Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today that Egypt will not attend a five-way summit due
to be held in Washington, denying reports that he might attend the
get-together on behalf of President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA) in New York
that he is making necessary contacts to meet Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, who left Cairo for Luxembourg this afternoon after
meeting with Mubarak in Egypt's port city of Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton invited Mubarak, Arafat, Jordan's
King Hussein and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the
summit in an effort to restart Arab-Israeli peace talks following
an outbreak of violence in the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein and Netanyahu left for Washington today for the
summit scheduled for Tuesday. But there have been reports that the
summit will be put back one day.
</P>
<P>
Arafat had called for postponing the summit until
Sunday. Reports from Washington said that the U.S. has turned down
his request.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources said that Arafat would go on to Washington
following his talks with European Union officials in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
But Arafat himself refused to make clear his plans just before he
departed for Luxembourg.

<HEADLINE> Angola's UNITA Starts Talks With Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of Angola's
former rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) arrived in capital Luanda today for talks with the
government.
</P>
<P>
The talks would mainly focus on the military issues including
the camping assembly of the UNITA soldiers and the formation of
the future unified national army, said delegation leader Abel
Chivukuvuku who is also the special political advisor to
UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA has sent over 60,000 fighters to the assembly camps
out of which only 6,530 have been chosen to join the national
army. The government complains that the pace is too slow as the
target should be 26,300.
</P>
<P>
Chivukuvuku said the military talks would pave the way for
resuming political negotiations between the UNITA and the
government.
</P>
<P>
The envoy also confirmed reports that Savimbi will not attend
the forthcoming summit meeting of the Southern African
Development Community, scheduled to be held in Luanda next
Wednesday.
