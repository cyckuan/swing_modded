Over 100 inmates staged prison breaks in Thailand during 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ More than 100 inmates escaped
Thailand's overcrowded prisons in 1998, a record year for
jailbreaks, the Department of Corrections said Wednesday.
	   Only 10 of the 102 prisoners who escaped, however, remain at
large, department statistics showed. The rest have been captured.
	   Interior Ministry officials said earlier this year that
Thailand's prison population was surging as more people turned to
crime because of the country's economic crisis.
	   At the same time, the crisis has forced budgets for government
agencies, including the Department of Corrections, to be slashed.
	   Thailand is in the midst of its worst economic downturn in
modern times and is receiving a dlrs 17.2 billion bailout from the
International Monetary Fund.
	   Four of the prisoners still at large escaped during the past
week.
	   Two convicted killers who escaped from the maximum security Bang
Kwan prison on the outskirts of Bangkok on Tuesday were still on
the run, as were two prisoners who escaped from a northeastern jail
over the weekend.

	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ President Alvaro Arzu has appealed for
reconciliation and asked Guatemalans to forgive the state for the
hardships and thousands of deaths they suffered in almost four
decades of civil war.
	   ``In the name of the state, I ask forgiveness for the historic
responsibility it has for the pain and death suffered by dozens of
thousands of Guatemalans en 36 years of armed conflict,'' Arzu said
Tuesday.
	   ``I ask all Guatemalans to forgive one another, and families
still estranged do so with one another, and together join the
pilgrimage towards the goal of national reconciliation,'' he added.
	   Arzu spoke at a ceremony in Santa Cruz, the capital of
northwestern Quiche province, marking the second anniversary of the
signing of a U.N. brokered peace pact Dec. 29, 1996, that ended 36
years of civil war.
	   More than 170,000 people were killed in fighting between leftist
guerrillas seeking power and social change against a succession of
rightist military-dominated governments. Another 30,000 have been
missing.
	   Arzu spoke to a crowd in the town's municipal stadium, and his
words were broadcast nationwide. Quiche province, about 50 miles
(75 kms) from Guatemala City was one of the regions hardest hit by
the conflict.

Mexican president urges legislators to approve new budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISAAC A. LEVI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ With time running out, President Ernesto
Zedillo is urging the Congress to stop squabbling and redouble
efforts to pass the 1999 budget package before the end of this
year.
	   ``As president, I am confident that a sense of responsibility
among legislators will prevail,'' Zedillo told a meeting Tuesday of
his ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, which lost its
majority in the House of Deputies in mid-term elections last year.
	   Zedillo indicated his administration is in a bind.
	   While the 1999 budget, he said, is the most modest in Mexico's
modern history and the deficit foreseen is small, the government
still needs money to finance basic spending such as health,
education, welfare, key public works and security.
	   Public finances continue to be buffeted by low crude oil prices
_ from which his administration had derived some 36 percent of its
revenue _ and uncertainty on world markets.
	   No one knows what will happen if the Dec. 31 deadline lapses _
Mexican constitutional law makes no provisions for it.
	   So it cannot cut further its expenditures as opposition groups
demand, Zedillo said.
	   The PRI with its plurality of more than half-plus-one in the
house regularly rubber-stamped the administration budget since the
party was founded and gained power in 1929.
	   The government needs to raise 15 billion pesos, equivalent to
dlrs 1.5 billion, to make up for the lower oil prices and other
shortfalls.
	   The Congress ended its ordinary session Dec. 15. It is now in
special session and the squabbling continues daily late into the
night in back rooms and caucuses.

	   MIAMI (AP) _ Look out, college football. The Miami Hurricanes
are blowing through opponents again.
	   Edgerrin James and James Jackson each ran for two touchdowns as
the 24th-ranked Hurricanes routed North Carolina State 46-23
Tuesday night in the Micron PC Bowl.
	   Scott Covington threw for 320 yards and two touchdowns,
including an 80-yarder to Santana Moss, as Miami (9-3) rolled up
594 yards of offense to cap its comeback from three years of NCAA
sanctions.
	   James, expected to declare early eligibility for the NFL draft,
rushed for 156 yards on 20 carries, his seventh consecutive
100-yard outing. His two TDs gave him 19 for the season, 15 in that
seven-game span.
	   Miami's defense also limited All-America wide receiver Torry
Holt, who had eight 100-yard receiving games this year, to just 52
yards on seven catches.
	   N.C. State (7-5) did manage 498 yards of offense, including 201
yards passing by Jamie Barnette. But two potential scoring drives
were thwarted deep in Miami territory, one on Danny Deskevich's
first missed kick of the season and another on an interception of a
pass that bounced off an official's head.
	   The Hurricanes came up with five interceptions, including two in
a span of four plays.
	   Barnette ran one yard for a first-half TD and hit Chris Coleman
with a 7-yard scoring pass in the fourth quarter. Rahshon Spikes
led the Wolfpack with 176 yards rushing, including a 30-yard TD.
Coleman picked up some of the receiving slack with six catches for
98 yards.
	   The 69 points were a record for the 9-year-old bowl, previously
played under the Blockbuster and Carquest monickers. Miami's 46
points tied a school bowl record.
	   The Hurricanes, who won four national titles between 1983 and
1991, were penalized more than 30 scholarships in 1995 for the
misuse of Pell Grant funds in the early 1990s.
	   Things bottomed out last year when Miami went 5-6, its first
losing season since 1979. The Hurricanes bounced back this year to
finish second in the Big East and upset previously unbeaten UCLA
49-45 in the regular-season finale.
	   The Hurricanes picked up Tuesday night where they left off
against UCLA, piling up 342 yards in grabbing a 27-10 halftime
lead. N.C. State had 249 yards in the half.
	   James put the Hurricanes in front for good with his first TD, a
5-yard run for a 14-7 lead with 3:15 left in the first quarter.
	   The Wolfpack drove to the Miami 10 after the ensuing kickoff,
but came away empty when Deskevich was wide right on a 30-yard
field goal. The walk-on had made all 12 of his field-goal attempts
and 29 extra points during the regular season.
	   Miami took advantage on the next play. Covington found Moss
streaking down the right sideline and hit him in full stride for an
80-yard TD and a 20-7 lead.
	   N.C. State lost another scoring opportunity with seven seconds
left in the half. Barnette's pass from the Miami 20 hit umpire Jim
Ina in the head, caromed straight up and was intercepted by Matt
Sweeney.

	   In his statement, Sihanouk was clearly chafing at the amnesty he
was pressured to give Ieng Sary, another major Khmer Rouge leader,
in 1996 in exchange for getting him to lead thousands of guerrillas
out of a stalemated civil war.
	   The deal broke the back of a conflict that had festered after
the Khmer Rouge were toppled by a Vietnamese invasion in 1979.
Since, more fighters made peace and the movement has become nearly
extinct.
	   The de facto surrender of Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea has no
bearing on the military situation. Just one leader, the brutal
general Ta Mok, remains at large with no more than 100 troops. They
pose no threat to national stability.
	   Sihanouk, who was held prisoner by the Khmer Rouge in his palace
and lost a score of family members under their rule, noted he had
been pressured in 1996 to pardon Ieng Sary by his two prime
ministers _ Hun Sen and his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh _ at the
time.
	   ``From now on, I leave all the responsibility to Hun Sen of
handling this unfortunate and dramatic affair of pardons accorded
to the Khmer Rouge,'' Sihanouk said. ``I will sign no more decrees
concerning the Khmer Rouge.''
	   That leaves Hun Sen, who defeated the prince in disputed
elections in July and is now sole premier, alone in facing intense
international pressure.
	   With peace-seeking no longer seen as a reason to grudgingly
swallow pardons for men with so much blood on their hands, demands
have been building for someone to be held accountable.
	   However, Hun Sen is by far Cambodia's most powerful man and his
will amounts to law. He controls the judiciary and security
services and could simply accord the pair a de facto pardon,
possibly through the pliant court system.
	   The king's refusal to approve an amnesty makes such a pardon
less legitimate in the eyes of the world and many Cambodians. But
Sihanouk is largely a figurehead and has no real way to enforce his
will.
	   The premier has said he had Sihanouk's approval in negotiating
the defections of the pair, who have been on the run for months as
Khmer Rouge territory came under government control.

Saints lineman accused in heroin transaction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   METAIRIE, Louisiana (AP) _ New Orleans Saints offensive lineman
Keno Hills has been charged with heroin and weapon charges after
police said he was seen dealing drugs.
	   Hills, 25, was charged Tuesday with possession of heroin with
the intent to distribute and possession of a firearm during a drug
transaction. If convicted on the charges, he could face life in
jail.
	   Col. Bob Garner of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office said
Hills and another man were arrested as the result of routine
surveillance of a suburban New Orleans area known for drug traffic.
	   ``It appears though that a hand-to-hand buy was going down. And
they were in possession of narcotics and the firearm,'' Garner
said.
	   The firearm was a 9 mm pistol equiped with a laser, he said.
	   Hills and his accomplice, 27-year-old James Davis of Metairie,
were in a car registered to Saints Pro Bowl offensive lineman
William Roaf. Hills said he recently bought the 1997 Lexus from
Roaf, Garner said.
	   Hills was released on dlrs 425,000 bond after five hours in the
Jefferson Parish East Bank lockup. He was unavailable for comment.
	   Saints officials would say little about how the arrest would
affect Hills' future with the team. His contract ran through the
end of this year with no option.
	   ``It's difficult to make comments now without all of the
facts,'' Bill Kuharich, the team's president and general manager,
said in a statement. ``Due process will now be pursued.
	   ``We were certainly disappointed in the news. We'll withhold
further comment until all the facts are known,''
	   Hills started the final game of the season against the Buffalo
Bills. He started six games in 1997.
	   Coach Mike Ditka said several times late in the season he wanted
to get Hills into the line up more. On Monday, he said he was
counting on Hills to be a big part of next season's team.
	   It was Hills' second brush with the law this year, although
police wound up apologizing for his earlier arrest in Morgan City,
La., in May. That arrest came after police got a tip that Hills and
another man were in a parking lot and that drugs might have changed
hands.
	   Investigating officers found no drugs, but filed disturbing the
peace charges against Hills and resisting arrest charges against
the other man. Hills subsequently entered a ``no-contest'' plea in
city court to that charge and paid a small fine.
	   The plea stands despite police later apologizing and saying
there was no cause for the arrest.
	   Hills is just the latest of several Saints players to run into
trouble with the law.
	   Other notable arrests include quarterback Kerry Collins' being
accused of drunken driving in a November case that is still
pending.
	   Wide receiver Keith Poole was recently sentenced to two years of
probation for striking a man with a golf club during an altercation
last August while the Saints were at training camp in LaCrosse,
Wisconsin.

Drug companies battle to stop, reverse diabetic nerve damage
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PHIL GALEWITZ &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The pain started as a cramp in Joe Oliva's toes
and ankles. Within six months, he could no longer walk. The
slightest pressure on his feet caused severe pain. He had to quit
his job as a limousine driver.
	   ``If I tried to sleep with a blanket, it felt like a lit
cigarette on my toes,'' said Oliva, 36, of Deer Park, New York.
	   His ailment: Diabetic neuropathy, a nerve disorder that is one
of the most common and troublesome complications of diabetes. Now,
three major pharmaceutical companies are finalizing development of
the first drugs to halt its progression.
	   Between one-third and one-half of the 16 million Americans with
diabetes suffer from neuropathy. Millions of these patients are
undiagnosed.
	   There's no cure. Neuropathy often causes prolonged numbness in
the feet and hands, which gradually worsens, sometimes leading to
foot ulcers, gangrene and amputation.
	   The three companies out front on neuropathy are Genentech,
Pfizer and Warner Lambert. They are in final stages of human
testing for drugs to stop diabetic neuropathy from moving to its
most severe stages. They may reverse damage already done.
	   The increase in diabetes research among large drug companies
parallels a slow rise in public awareness of the sixth leading
cause of death.
	   Like others, these three companies are attracted to the
economics of treating diabetes.
	   With the aging population and increasing awareness, the number
of diabetics seeking help is expected to steadily rise. Like other
drugs for chronic diseases, patients would likely have to take a
neuropathy medication for life.
	   In addition to diabetes, neuropathy is also caused by rheumatoid
arthritis, cancer, leukemia, kidney disease, shingles and can be
induced by certain drugs. As a result, the market for a neuropathy
drug could be huge.
	   Even if only 10 percent of people with diabetic neuropathy took
the drug, analysts say a company could reach dlrs 1 billion in
annual sales.
	   ``If they are successful, it has blockbuster potential,'' said
Charles Engelberg, an analyst with AmeriCal Securities.
	   Pfizer and Warner Lambert have other diabetes drugs in
development or on the market. Pfizer is working on an inhaled form
of insulin, replacing injections. Warner Lambert last year
introduced Rezulin, a pill which is now one of the biggest selling
diabetes drugs.
	   The neuropathy drugs offer hope for treating one of the more
vexing complications of the disease, said Dr. Gerald Bernstein,
director of the diabetes management program at Beth Israel Health
System in New York and president of the American Diabetes
Association.
	   ``If we can regrow nerves that will make an extraordinary
difference,'' Bernstein said.
	   Neuropathy involves the steady degeneration of the wiring around
nerves that are essential for the brain to communicate with
muscles, skin and organs.
	   In diabetics, the lack of insulin leads to production of an
enzyme called aldose reductase, which creates a sugar that does the
damage.
	   Up until now, doctors gave patients narcotics to mask the pain
and anti-depression medications. Or they told patients to learn to
live with it.
	   Previous research attempts failed because the drugs wouldn't
absorb into tissues, or caused liver problems.
	   ``It's been a tortuous process,'' said Tom Beyer, a research
executive at Pfizer. ``The body does not like drugs that get into
the nervous system and there are barriers that are very difficult
to cross,'' Beyer said.
	   Pfizer's drug, Alond, and Warner-Lambert's Zenarestat, are pills
and attack neuropathy by inhibiting aldose reductase production.
American Home Products has a similar drug in an earlier stage of
development.
	   Genentech's drug, Neuleze, is considered farthest along and
company officials are hoping positive test results in 1999 will
lead them to quickly seek Food and Drug Administration approval.
	   Neuleze, which is given by injection, uses a genetically
engineered hormone that attempts to stimulate nerve growth.
	   Published studies show 75 percent of the 250 patients receiving
three injections a week for six months reported fewer symptoms,
compared to 49 percent of patients given a dummy drug. The only
significant side effect is tenderness at the injection site.
	   Oliva was among those participating in tests of the drug. He
said it restored reflexes in his ankles, which helped him walk
again.
	   ``I could function as a human being and not have to worry about
pain from shoes or socks,'' he said.
	   Ultimately, researchers say a combination of drugs, including
painkillers, will likely be used to treat neuropathy.

	   The Khmer Rouge won a civil war in 1975 and emptied Cambodia's
cities in a Maoist-inspired plan to turn the country into a huge
labor camp. About one person in five died of overwork, starvation,
disease and systematic executions.
	   Sihanouk denounced Cambodia's western neighbor, Thailand, for
helping keep the Khmer Rouge alive over the past two decades, part
of a Thai strategy to contain regional rival Vietnam. The Thais
were supported by China and the United States.
	   Vietnam ended military occupation of Cambodia in 1989, but
Thailand kept up a lucrative log-and-gem trade with Khmer Rouge
guerrillas along the border.
	   Thai officials consistently state that no Khmer Rouge leaders
are on their territory, though sightings are frequently reported.
	   Local officials in a former Khmer Rouge stronghold in western
Cambodia, Pailin, said they met Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea at a
border crossing Saturday and brought them across.
	   ``No one is ignorant of the way our Thai neighbors have favored
the Khmer Rouge for decades,'' Sihanouk said.
	   ``They have no lesson on anti-Khmer Rougisim to give me or my
family who, with our people, so suffered from the Khmer Rouge's
cruelty and injustices,'' the king said.
	   Sihanouk was Cambodia's ruler before being toppled in a
U.S.-backed military coup in 1970 for being perceived as siding
with communist North Vietnam in the Vietnam War.
	   Knowing little about the Khmer Rouge, then a tiny movement,
Sihanouk lent them his considerable personal prestige to fight the
new government. The Khmer Rouge discarded him after they seized
power.

Jailed Chinese exile asks family to find lawyer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A long exiled democracy campaigner who slipped
back into China only to be caught by police has asked his family to
hire a lawyer, a sign his trial is drawing near, a human rights
group reported Wednesday.
	   Wang Ce has been charged with endangering state security, a
rubric for a host of subversive and seditious offenses that Chinese
authorities have used to sentence four dissidents to lengthy prison
terms in the past ten days.
	   The harsh punishments against the four and the sentencing
without trial to labor camps of at least three others are part of
the broadest crackdown against dissidents in three years. It aims
to halt a surge in activism as dissidents tried to organize a
political party and independent labor groups.
	   Wang Ce sneaked back into China through the Portuguese colony of
Macau in October amid the ferment. A U.S.-trained political
scientist, Wang lived in Spain and was a leading member of an
alliance of democratic parties set up in exile. He hoped to help
Chinese dissidents trying to organize the China Democracy Party.
	   Police arrested Wang Ce after he met with Wang Youcai, a
principal organizer of the China Democracy Party, in the eastern
city of Hangzhou on Nov. 2.
	   A student leader in the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy
demonstrations, Wang Youcai was sentenced last week to 11 years in
prison for trying to set up the party. Two other influential
organizers, Xu Wenli and Qin Yongmin, were sentenced to 13 and 12
years.
	   Held in the Zhejiang province detention center in Hangzhou, Wang
Ce wrote to his family Sunday seeking their ``urgent'' help in
finding a lawyer, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement reported.
	   Wang has been charged with illegally entering China and
``financially assisting criminal acts that endanger state
security,'' the group said. He faces up to life imprisonment if
convicted, a virtual certainty in dissident trials.
	   In addition to the three China Democracy Party leaders, another
member of the group, Xu Wangping, was sentenced by police to three
years in a labor camp. Two other exiles, Zhang Lin and Wei Quanbao,
were arrested last month after sneaking back into China and have
also been sentenced to three years forced labor.
	   A court in southern Hunan province sentenced labor rights
campaigner Zhang Shanguang to 10 years in prison Sunday for telling
U.S. government-funded Radio Free Asia about farmers protests.
	   The sentencings have provoked protests by dissidents within
China and abroad. Wang Xizhe, a prominent member of the dissident
community before his escape from China last year, was in the fourth
day of a hunger strike outside the United Nations in New York.
	   In a letter scrawled in a child's handwriting, the 8-year-old
daughter of imprisoned Wuhan dissident Qin Yongming, Qin Ranke,
appealed to ``goodhearted people who care'' to help bring her
father back home.
	   ``Beloved father, I miss you every day. Where have you gone? Why
don't you return home?'' she wrote, according to a copy of the
letter sent to the Hong Kong-based group Information Center of
Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China.
	   ``Grandfather says you must spend 12 years in jail. Is that
true? You never seemed to go out. How could you have done anything
wrong?'' she asked in the letter, dated Tuesday.
	   According to the Information Center, 40 dissidents based in
Hunan also issued a petition Wednesday demanding the release of
Zhang Shanguang.

DNA expert matches Anwar DNA to semen stains on mattress
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The prosecution in the sex and
corruption trial of ousted Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim
dealt him a setback Wednesday when a state DNA expert positively
identified his semen on a mattress.
	   Prosecutors are trying to prove Anwar had sex with the wife of
his former secretary, sodomized his family driver and abused his
powers to try to cover up sexual trysts.
	   The mattress was seized by police in July from an apartment in a
Kuala Lumpur suburb that Anwar is accused of using for secret
meetings with sex partners.
	   Prosecution witness and DNA expert Lim Kong Boon, told the court
that the DNA taken from 10 of the 13 stains on the mattress matched
that of Anwar's DNA. He said that several of the mattress stains
containing DNA from Anwar, referred to as Male One, was also mixed
with DNA from Shamsidar Taharin, the wife of Anwar's former
personal secretary.
	   He said one stain matched DNA from Anwar, Shamsidar and an
unidentified man; another stain contained DNA from Anwar and an
unidentified woman and man.
	   ``My reference to Male One, based on the DNA results I obtained,
is Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim,'' Lim said, using Anwar's formal Malay
title.
	   This set off chaos in the courtroom, with the defense and
prosecution shouting at the same time. Anwar bowed his head and his
wife, Azizah Ismail, focused on court documents.
	   Lim, who donned white latex gloves and inspected the 13 plastic
bags containing swatches from the mattress, said he knew the blood
samples given to him were from Anwar because police had told him
so.
	   ``I was informed by police, they forwarded this information,''
he said.
	   Anwar's relatives started clapping and laughing at this
statement because it implied that the police had already told the
scientist that the blood belonged to Anwar even before he conducted
the test, giving him a bias.
	   ``Why are you laughing? This is not a theater,'' scolded High
Court Judge Augustine Paul.
	   Doctors have testified that they took blood samples from Anwar
on Sept. 28, eight days after his arrest, and that he agreed to be
tested for sexually transmitted diseases.
	   ``No consent was obtained from Anwar for the blood to be given
to police,'' defense attorney Gurbachan Singh said Wednesday. He
said doctors had advised police that they should not use the blood
for DNA analysis because Anwar had not been informed.
	   The defense team on Monday implied that hair and semen samples
may have been taken from Anwar while he was unconscious after his
beating in police custody.
	   Anwar was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 2,
after Mahathir deemed him morally unfit to lead the country. He was
arrested on Sept. 20 and badly beaten while in police custody.
	   He is on trial for abuse of power and will be tried separately
on charges of engaging in illegal sex acts, including sodomy.
	   Anwar has denied all the accusations against him, saying they
were trumped up to eliminate his challenge to Mahathir's 17-year
rule.

South Korea to abolish import ban on Japanese goods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea will abolish its
20-year-old import ban on an assortment of Japanese cars and other
industrial goods by June next year, government officials said
Wednesday.
	   South Korea currently bans the import of 48 Japanese products,
including many types of cars, as part of its effort to protect
domestic industries and fight a chronic trade imbalance with Japan.
	   South Korea will begin Thursday by first lifting the ban on 32
products, including station wagons with 1- to 1.5-liter engine
capacity, jeeps with over 1.5-liter gasoline engines, as well as
camcorders, copy machines and audio components.
	   The remaining 16 items _ such as sedans, color televisions, cell
phones and station wagons with less than 3-liter engine capacity _
will be freed from the import ban on June 30 next year, said the
Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy.
	   ``In the long run, the decision will likely increase our trade
deficit with Japan,'' said Choi Chul-woo, a ministry official. ``It
will most likely affect domestic car, electronic home appliances
and machine tool industries.''
	   But with the country's imports remaining sluggish amid an
economic crisis, the Japanese products newly exempt from the ban
will pose little immediate competition to domestic manufacturers,
Choi said.
	   South Korea imposed the ban in 1978 to control a chronic trade
deficit with Japan, which had provided up to 40 percent of all
South Korean imports in the 1970s.
	   The ban helped South Korea to reduce its dependence on its
neighbor for imports to around 24 percent in the 1990s. But its
trade deficit with Japan has kept increasing _ from dlrs 2.8
billion in 1980 to dlrs 13 billion last year.
	   Tokyo has complained that the restrictions are an unfair trade
practice, and Seoul has been gradually lifting the ban, reducing
the number of goods prohibited.
	   South Korea imported dlrs 27.8 billion from Japan last year and
exported dlrs 14.8 billion, resulting in a dlrs 13 billion deficit,
bigger than South Korea's total trade deficit of dlrs 8.5 billion.
	   In the first 11 months of this year, the shortfall with Japan
dropped to dlrs 4 billion as the economic crisis forced South Korea
to reduce Japanese imports to dlrs 15 billion while keeping exports
at dlrs 11 billion.

Flyers best Flames 4-3
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) _ Valeri Zelepukin scored 1:57 into
overtime as the Philadelphia Flyers, despite a second-period injury
to Eric Lindros, battled back from a two-goal deficit to beat the
Calgary Flames 4-3 Tuesday night.
	   Zelepukin took the puck over the Calgary blue line, cut to his
left and beat Andrei Trefilov high on the blocker side from the top
of the faceoff circle.
	   Lindros was hit twice on the same shift along the side boards
with six minutes left in the second and did not return. His status
was not immediately known.
	   Trailing 3-1 entering the third period, the Flyers tied the game
on goals by Danius Zubrus and Dan McGillis. Colin Forbes also
scored for the Flyers, who extend their unbeaten streak to nine
games (5-0-4).
	   Clarke Wilm, Theoren Fleury and Todd Simpson had goals for the
Flames, who have lost five in a row at home.
 &UR; Lightning 3, Islanders 0 &QC; 
	   In Tampa, Florida, Vincent Lecavalier had a spectacular
second-period goal and Bill Ranford stopped 35 shots as Tampa Bay
snapped a nine-game home losing streak.
	   Lecavalier spilt the defense near the blue line and then put a
shot between goalie Marcel Cousineau's pads while being pulled down
from behind by New York defenseman Zdeno Chara at 6:43 of the
second.
	   Ranford preserved his 15th career shutout by stopping Robert
Reichel's breakaway attempt midway through the third period.
 &UR; Canadiens 5 Oilers 2 &QC; 
	   In Edmonton, Alberta, Mark Recchi ended a career-worst 18-game
goalless drought without taking a shot and added a second goal in
Montreal's win.
	   On a delayed tripping penalty against Recchi, Oilers defenseman
Janne Niinimaa banked a pass off the boards that slid the length of
the ice and into the unoccupied Edmonton net with goaltender
Mikhail Shtalenkov on the bench for an extra attacker. Recchi was
given credit for the goal at 5:56 of the first period because he
was the last Montreal player to touch the puck.
	   Brett Clark and Sergei Zholtok also scored for the Canadiens,
who had ended an 11-game winless streak with a 2-1 victory last
Saturday in Toronto.
	   Rem Murray and Josef Beranek scored for the Oilers.

Villagers kill eight soldiers in northwest Indonesia

military chief; UPDATES with 10 soldiers escaping, victims pulled
off a bus &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A mob of 200 villagers, some armed
with machetes, tortured and killed eight Indonesian soldiers after
stopping a public bus in a northwestern province. Two dozen people
were arrested, the military said Wednesday.
	   The Tuesday incident in Aceh province was likely to raise
tensions in a region where the Indonesian military recently ended a
decade-long campaign against separatist rebels. Officials suspect
guerrilla followers were behind the attack.
	   Accused of widespread atrocities in Aceh, the military
apologized and withdrew some troops in a conciliatory gesture after
the resignation in May of former President Suharto. However,
resentment toward the military remains deep.
	   In Jakarta, armed forces chief Gen. Wiranto said the attack on
off-duty soldiers could jeopardize a plan to reduce the military
presence by entrusting community leaders with security.
	   ``The killing was a brutal action which can never be tolerated
by the armed forces,'' Wiranto said. ``This action could spoil the
wishes of the Aceh people to free the region of military
operations.''
	   The assailants forced the victims to get off a bus in the
village of Lhok Nibung that was heading to the nearby city of
Medan. Ten other soldiers managed to escape and reported to their
superiors, who dispatched hundreds of troops to search for the
killers.
	   Wiranto said eight soldiers were killed and that 25 people
suspected of provoking the mob attack were arrested.
	   Aceh, about 1,750 kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of Jakarta,
is a staunchly Muslim province where rebels have been fighting for
an Islamic state for decades.
	   The military has acknowledged that 760 people died in fighting
since the late 1980s, although human rights groups put the death
toll higher. Mass graves have been uncovered and some widows have
alleged they were raped by soldiers.

Inquiries to follow Australian race disaster

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Two inquiries will be held into the
deadly Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race amid claims that race organizers
knew of the potential danger 24 hours before the fleet was
decimated by a massive storm.
	   Four bodies were recovered and rescuers have given up hope of
finding two others presumed drowned in the worst death toll in the
54-year history of the event. Winds up to 90 mph (144 kph) and
waves 35 feet (11 meters) high carved a path of destruction through
the annual race this week.
	   A New South Wales government Coroner's inquiry has been ordered
to probe the loss of life while the Cruising Yacht Club of
Australia, the race organizer, will also investigate the disaster.
	   The club defended its decision to appoint immediate past
commodore Peter Bush to hold its inquiry, saying no independent
body could do as good a job.
	   The inquiries are certain to focus on the weather and what
information was passed on to the crew aboard the 115 yachts.
Seventy yachts had withdrawn from a race wrecked by the massive
waves and rescuers saved about 50 sailors from seven stricken
craft.
	   The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper Wednesday quoted an unnamed
source from the weather bureau as saying the yacht club and the
Australian Maritime Safety Authority were given early notice of the
approaching storm.
	   ``We gave them 24 hours notice and that is a long lead time for
weather at sea,'' the source said. ``Most times 12 hours is
considered to be satisfactory.''
	   The source said the information was passed on two hours after
the start of the race at Sydney Harbor on Dec. 26. The paper said
the weather bureau was concerned by reports that the fleet was
given no warning about the intensity of the storms.
	   Richard Winning, who captained the yacht Winston Churchill which
sank, killing three, admitted he had been told that conditions
would be bad.
	   ``I think we were given adequate information, yes,'' Winning
said.
	   Bush defended the yacht club holding its own inquiry, which will
be conducted in private with the report made public later.
	   ``I don't think by any stretch of the imagination that you want
to assume that this is not going to be an objective review,'' Bush
said Wednesday.
	   He said the inquiry would consider whether or not the race, won
by billionaire skipper Larry Ellison on United States maxi
Sayonara, should have been abandoned when the storm hit.
	   ``Had we called the race off when we were aware of the strength
of those conditions, little else could have happened other than
what happened because these guys were already on the race course,''
Bush said.
	   ``And for us to say, `OK guys all stop racing and go home,'
they're still out there, they've still got 100 or 30 or 50 miles
(160 or 48 or 80 kilometers) to get to shore and it's not actually
as simple as that.''
	   Current club commodore Hugo van Kretschmar said he had opposed
an abandonment of the race and said it was run under international
rules leaving the responsibility with the individual skippers.
	   ``The unsinkable and unrollable yacht, like the Titanic, doesn't
exist,'' Van Kretschmar said.
	   Australian prime minister John Howard praised the rescue
operation, which at its peak included 35 aircraft and almost as
many water craft.
	   ``The Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race is part of the Christmas to
New Year period of Australia, it's part of our way of life and
these people have lost their lives following a sport they love,''
Howard said Wednesday.
	   ``That doesn't make it any easier for their families. I think
it's just a miracle for which we should be very thankful that more
lives weren't lost and the people you can thank for that are very
much the people in the rescue operations. I think they are
magnificent.''
	   The bodies of two members of the Winston Churchill, Jim Lawler
and Michael Bannister, were recovered from Bass Strait on Tuesday.
Two others, Bruce Guy and Phil Skeggs from Business Post Naiad,
were killed when their yacht rolled over Sunday during the peak of
the storms.
	   Before they were rescued, crew mates strapped the bodies of Guy
and Skeggs to the boat, which was towed 120 kilometers (75 miles)
back to shore at Eden, New South Wales. The floating coffin docked
Wednesday afternoon.
	   British Olympic Games sailor Glyn Charles, 33, and Australian
John Dean, 47, are presumed dead.
	   The Maritime Authority abandoned its search Tuesday afternoon,
saying no hope was held for the pair.
	   Dean had told his family that when he died he wanted his ashes
spread at sea.
	   ``It looks like he has got his wish,'' said Dean's 15-year-old
son Peter. ``At least he died doing something he loved.''

Purdue 37, No. 4 Kansas State 34

<TEXT>
	   SAN ANTONIO (AP) _ Maybe Kansas State was right. It didn't
belong in the Alamo Bowl after all.
	   The unranked Purdue Boilermakers shocked the No. 4 Wildcats
37-34 Tuesday night, using an incredible last-minute scoring drive
to embarrass a team that was once close to a shot at the national
championship.
	   After losing a 14-point lead in the final quarter and letting
Kansas State jump ahead 34-30, Purdue (9-4) drove 80 yards in 54
seconds to win it on Drew Brees' 19-yard pass to Isaac Jones with
30 seconds left.
	   It was a bitter ending for Kansas State (11-2), which felt
snubbed at not getting an invitation to a top-tier bowl after being
knocked out of the national title picture with a 36-33
double-overtime loss to Texas A&AMP;M in the Big 12 championship.
	   In fact, the Wildcats seemed to play the first three quarters as
if they resented even being in this game.
	   Quarterback Michael Bishop lost a fumble and threw four
interceptions, but also threw an Alamo Bowl-record 88-yard
touchdown pass to Darnell McDonald with 6:23 remaining. With 1:24
left, Bishop tossed a 2-yard touchdown pass to Justin Swift as
Kansas State went ahead 34-30, completing a comeback that brought
30,000 purple-clad fans to their feet.
	   Purdue scored 17 points off Wildcats fumbles, and Kansas State
stayed in touch only because it scored its first two touchdowns
after recovering bad snaps on Purdue punt attempts. The Wildcats
got the ball on the 1 after the first and recovered the second in
the end zone.
	   The offense didn't produce a touchdown until three minutes into
the fourth quarter on David Allen's 3-yard run that got Kansas
State back into the game at 27-20.
	   A 37-yard field goal by Purdue's Travis Dorsch put the
Boilermakers ahead 30-20 with 6:44 left.
	   Kansas State answered on the next play with Bishop's 88-yard
touchdown pass to Darnell McDonald, moving the Wildcats to within
30-27 with 6:23 to play.
	   Purdue dominated Kansas State like no team had this season. The
Boilermakers made the most of Kansas State's two fumbles in the
second quarter and led 17-7 at halftime.
	   Kansas State, failing to score in the first quarter for the
first time this season, got on the board with 9:49 remaining in the
second after a bad snap that eluded Purdue punter Andy Standifer
gave Kansas State possession at the Boilermakers 1. K-State scored
on a 1-yard pass from Bishop to McDonald.
	   Brees was 25-of-53 for 230 yards and three touchdowns with three
interceptions, while Bishop was only 9-of-24 for 182 yards with
three touchdowns and four interceptions, matching his interception
total for the entire season.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk refused
Wednesday to approve amnesty for two leaders of the genocidal Khmer
Rouge, setting up a collision course with his prime minister, who
has pledged to shield them from trial.
	   The refusal casts doubt on the legitimacy of the deal Prime
Minister Hun Sen has made with Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea to
defect to the government in exchange for assurances they will not
be tried for crimes against humanity.
	   ``Taking into account the very wide and undeniable discontent of
the majority of the Khmer people, I announce to this majority that
I respect them and will not renew my power of amnesty for major
Khmer Rouge criminals, who are anti-Cambodian people,'' the king
said.
	   Sihanouk, 76, receiving medical treatment for a range of
ailments in Beijing, made the comments in his palace bulletin.
	   Sihanouk said that an international tribunal would have ``the
perfect right to take up the case of genocide in Cambodia, because
it concerns crimes against humanity.''
	   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, both members of the inner circle of
the late Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot, spent their second day in
Phnom Penh after being greeted by Hun Sen with smiles Tuesday and
assured they would not stand trial.
	   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea told a news conference Tuesday they
were ``very sorry'' for the deaths of as many as 2 million
Cambodians under Khmer Rouge rule between 1975 and 1979 but refused
to accept responsibility. Khieu Samphan said: ``Let bygones be
bygones.''
	   They and Hun Sen said separately that pursuing Khmer Rouge
leaders for prosecution would simply lead to a renewal of civil
war.
	   Khieu Samphan met Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the former United
Nations secretary general, who is in Cambodia to promote the French
language as head of the International Francophone Organization.
Boutros-Ghali made no comment as he left the meeting.
	   The Cambodia Daily newspaper quoted Boutros-Ghali as saying
Tuesday that he did not support the formation of an international
tribunal to bring the Khmer Rouge leaders to trial.
	   That clashes with the mission of a U.N. team dispatched by the
present secretary-general, Kofi Annan, to Cambodia recently to
assess the possibility of creating such a tribunal.
	   ``My personal view is that this is a Cambodian problem,''
Boutros-Ghali was quoted as saying. ``The U.N. should not interfere
in the affairs of member countries.''
	   Sihanouk is clearly chafing at the amnesty he was pressured to
give Ieng Sary, another Khmer Rouge leader, in 1996 to persuade him
to lead thousands of guerrillas out of a stalemated civil war.
	   The deal broke the back of a conflict that had festered after
the Khmer Rouge were toppled by a Vietnamese invasion in 1979.
Since, more fighters made peace and the movement has become nearly
extinct.
	   The de facto surrender of Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea leaves
just one leader, the brutal general Ta Mok, at large with no more
than 100 troops. They pose no threat to national stability.
	   ``From now on, I leave all the responsibility to Hun Sen of
handling this unfortunate and dramatic affair of pardons accorded
to the Khmer Rouge,'' Sihanouk said. ``I will sign no more decrees
concerning the Khmer Rouge.''
	   That leaves Hun Sen, who defeated the prince in disputed
elections in July and is now sole premier, alone in facing intense
international pressure to bring the new defectors to trial.
	   With peacemaking no longer seen as a reason to swallow pardons
for men with so much blood on their hands, demands have been
building for someone to be held accountable.
	   However, Hun Sen is Cambodia's most powerful man and his will
amounts to law. He controls the judiciary and security services and
could simply accord the pair a de facto pardon, possibly through
the pliant court system.
	   The king's rejection would make a pardon less legitimate in the
eyes of the world and many Cambodians. But Sihanouk is largely a
figurehead and has no way to enforce his will.
	   The Khmer Rouge won a civil war in 1975 and emptied Cambodia's
cities in a Maoist-inspired plan to turn the country into a huge
labor camp. About one person in five died of overwork, starvation,
disease and systematic executions.
	   Sihanouk was Cambodia's ruler before being toppled in a
U.S.-backed military coup in 1970 for being perceived as siding
with communist North Vietnam in the Vietnam War.
	   Knowing little about the Khmer Rouge, then a tiny movement,
Sihanouk lent them his considerable personal prestige to fight the
new government. The Khmer Rouge discarded him after they seized
power.

Recalled Warne admitted he feared the worst

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Recalled Australian spinner Shane
Warne admitted he feared the worst during his nine-month exile from
the international arena which ended Wednesday.
	   Warne replaced rookie paceman Matthew Nicholson in the
Australian team after its stunning 12-run loss to England at the
MCG on Tuesday and will play in Saturday's fifth test in Sydney.
	   The most successful spinner in cricket history said he felt his
career was starting again and admitted there were times he feared
it might be over.
	   ``My life has been a bit like a soap opera,'' Warne said. ``It's
been like a drama, especially the last six months.''
	   Warne had surgery in April to fix a shoulder injury and the
Australian public has been following the injury's every twinge.
	   Warne said he hit a low point about six weeks after surgery and
when told he could be out of action for two years.
	   ``When I got out of the sling in six weeks nothing was really
happening,'' Warne said Wednesday. ``I started to think `well geez,
what am I going to do.' I'm not qualified at anything, I've
basically dedicated my whole life to cricket.''
	   Warne started to read up on his injury, and got no great relief
from his investigation.
	   ``I did a bit of research and some baseballers and javelin
throwers never came back from identical surgery,'' Warne said.
``That was a bit distressing. I started feeling sorry for myself
for a while then I spurred myself on and got motivated to get back
in the side.''
	   He has been low key in three Sheffield Shield matches this
season but is confident he can return to the form which has brought
him 313 test wickets.
	   ``There's no drama in my shoulder anymore, it feels good, I'm
ready,'' Warne said.
	   Warne has not played international cricket for eight months but
he has maintained a record of grabbing as many headlines as
wickets.
	   His troublesome year culminated this month when he publicly
admitted taking money from an illegal Indian bookmaker during
Australia's tour of Sri Lanka in 1994.
	   Warne and teammate Mark Waugh were fined by the Australian
Cricket Board for providing pitch and weather information to the
bookmaker in action kept secret for almost four years.

Four people killed and three injured in avalanche on Scottish

mountain &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FORT WILLIAM, Scotland (AP) _ Four hikers have been killed and
three injured in a mountain avalanche on Scotland's northwestern
coast, police said Wednesday.
	   The seven person group were participating in ''winter skills''
training course on Aonoch Mor near Ben Nevis in the Scottish
highlands when they were caught in the avalanche, police said.
	   The hikers were reported missing at 2230 GMT Tuesday when they
did not return from the day's climb. A search was immediately
launched by a Royal Air Force mountain rescue team. Gale force
winds forced a helicopter to abandon rescue attempts, but ground
crews managed to locate the group at 0120 GMT Wednesday, a police
spokesman said, speaking with customary anonymity.
	   The three survivors were carried off the mountain, and were
being treated for injuries at a local hospital. Police did not say
whether any of their injuries were life-threatening.
	   ``They had been caught in an avalanche and it has been confirmed
that there are four fatalities and three injured,'' the police
spokesman said.
	   Rescuers were still struggling Wednesday to recover the bodies
of those killed, he said. Their efforts were being hampered by the
threat of further avalanches.
	   Northern England and Scotland have been hit by strong winds and
cold weather over the Christmas holiday, and the storm conditions
continued Wednesday.
	   Police did not release any of the victim's names or any more
information.
	   ``I'm afraid it may be some while before we get more details
because we are having to do everything on foot because of the
treacherous conditions,'' said the spokesman.

Balloon capsule lifts off for first time during testing

	   ALICE SPRINGS, Australia (AP) _ Technical problems were
identified Wednesday when the spaceship-like capsule a
U.S.-Australian team hopes to fly around the world beneath a
balloon was lifted off the ground for the first time in Outback
Australia.
	   But organizers for the latest bid to be the first to fly nonstop
around the world say the problems were part of normal testing and
the final adjustments process, and should not in themselves delay
the launch, planned for Jan. 1.
	   The 7-ft. by 8-ft. (2.1-meter by 2.4-meter) gondola was lifted
off the ground for the first time in the Australian launch zone
Wednesday.
	   But it rose only inches (centimeters) over the red sand of the
desert launch zone, dangling beneath a crane to be weighed and for
some ballast and landing equipment checks.
	   The bid by the Re/Max team comes just days after Chicago
millionaire Steve Fossett and his team splashed down in the Pacific
Ocean.
	   Fossett, British millionaire Richard Branson and Per Lindstrand
of Sweden abandoned their more conventional balloon flight near the
northeast tip of Oahu, Hawaii on Christmas Day. They have tried a
total of 11 times.
	   For the Re/Max attempt, testing Wednesday showed uneven weight
distribution between the six steel cables from which the gondola
will be strung beneath the giant polyethylene balloon which the
three pilots plan to fly at the edge of space.
	   Technicians began working on redistribution of the 6,600-pound
(2,970-kilogram) capacity payload.
	   Scientists and engineers continued checking equipment, including
oxygen and nitrogen tanks to create the atmosphere inside the
pressurized gondola, space suits and parachutes the pilots will
wear, scientific and communications equipment and food and waste
disposal units.
	   ``We're checking and rechecking every circuit, every life
support component,'' team leader and Denver, Colorado real estate
magnate Dave Liniger said Wednesday.
	   ``There's no question that it's more dangerous than the other
missions,'' Liniger said.
	   ``The other people, if they get in trouble they can slowly go
down and sit down in the ocean. If we get into trouble, we're 25
miles (40 kilometers) up, so it creates some special hazards.''
	   The tin workshop outside the central Australian town of Alice
Springs, which serves as balloon central, was a hive of activity
Wednesday as team members including many volunteers continued final
preparations.
	   Spokesman Kevin Roark said the team was not behind schedule for
the planned Jan. 1 launch, despite many components not yet being
installed in the capsule.
	   Weather conditions may yet delay the launch further, however, if
dangerously strong winds continue to blow over the site.
	   The attempt has already been delayed twice; once when the
contract for the C-130 Hercules transport plane, which was to have
brought the capsule to Australia from the United States, was
canceled because of the latest Gulf crisis and once by high winds
and unseasonal rain over the launch zone.
	   The capsule, carrying pilots Liniger, journalist Bob Martin from
Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Australian John Wallington, will
dangle beneath a balloon that is 460 feet (138 meters) in diameter
at ``full float'' and 700 feet (210 meters) high, large enough to
envelope the Houston Astrodome.
	   It will rise 1,000 feet (300 meters) a minute during takeoff,
filling with helium on the way up to a cruising altitude of 130,000
feet (39,000 meters), or about 24 miles (39 kilometers) above sea
level.
	   There, the team expects to catch winds that will carry it west
at up to 80 mph (128 kph) along a route that almost directly
follows the Tropic of Capricorn, and complete the 22,800-mile
(36,480-kilometer) journey in about 18 days.
	   The NASA-developed balloon type has been used before, but only
to carry unmanned scientific payloads to heights of about 80,000
feet (24,000 meters)
	   ``Its great to see her hanging here,'' said Martin as he oversaw
the weighing procedures and began fitting the cameras he expects
will transmit pictures from the edge of space.
	   Martin said that along with the landing, the launch would be the
most dangerous part of the trip.
	   ``We have parachutes, but in reality below about 10,000 feet
(3,000 meters) it is doubtable that the parachute will open in time
to save you,'' he said.
	   ``For the first 500-1,000 feet (150-300 meters) will be very
risky, we will be biting our fingernails.''

Dollar down against yen, Tokyo stocks close lower

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell marginally against the yen
Wednesday in thin, year-end trading. Share prices closed lower in
the last trading session of 1998.
	   The dollar bought 115.32 yen at midafternoon, down 0.04 yen from
late Tuesday and below its late New York level of 115.53 yen
overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 4.73 points,
or 0.03 percent, to finish at 13,842.17 points. On Tuesday, the
average closed up 137.84 points, or 1.01 percent.
	   The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed out the year with a half-day
session. It will reopen on Jan. 4, 1999.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar remained in a narrow range amid
the year-end lull. Even a sharp drop in government bond prices did
not spur currency traders to action.
	   Many players were also holding back to await the Jan. 1 launch
of Europe's single currency, the euro.
	   On the stock market, stocks finished lower as the plunging bond
prices rekindled fears about recent turmoil in credit markets.
	   But trades remained extremely sparse as most investors were
already away for the New Year's holidays.
	   When trading resumes next year, investors will be closely
monitoring talks between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and
the opposition Liberal Party on forming a coalition government,
analysts said.
	   ``The domestic political and economic situations remain
uncertain,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, a general manager at Chuo
Securities.
	   Still, Wednesday's market got some support from an overnight
rise on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average closed
at 9,320.98 points, up 94.23.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section closed down 1.84 points, or 0.17 percent, at
1,086.99. The TOPIX closed up 8.94 points, or 0.83 percent, the day
before.
	   Advances outnumbered declines 576 to 490, with 191 issues
unchanged.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond soared to 2.010 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.885
percent, the highest it has been in 15 1/2 months.
	   The bond's price, which moves in the opposite direction,
finished the year at 98.33 yen, down from 99.31 yen.

Flyers best Flames 4-3
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC;

<TEXT>
	   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) _ Valeri Zelepukin scored 1:57 into
overtime as the Philadelphia Flyers, despite a second-period injury
to Eric Lindros, battled back from a two-goal deficit to beat the
Calgary Flames 4-3 Tuesday night.
	   Zelepukin took the puck over the Calgary blue line, cut to his
left and beat Andrei Trefilov high on the blocker side from the top
of the faceoff circle.
	   Lindros was hit twice on the same shift along the side boards
with six minutes left in the second and did not return. His status
was not immediately known.
	   Trailing 3-1 entering the third period, the Flyers tied the game
on goals by Danius Zubrus and Dan McGillis. Colin Forbes also
scored for the Flyers, who extend their unbeaten streak to nine
games (5-0-4).
	   Clarke Wilm, Theoren Fleury and Todd Simpson had goals for the
Flames, who have lost five in a row at home.
 &UR; Lightning 3, Islanders 0 &QC; 
	   In Tampa, Florida, Vincent Lecavalier had a spectacular
second-period goal and Bill Ranford stopped 35 shots as Tampa Bay
snapped a nine-game home losing streak.
	   Lecavalier spilt the defense near the blue line and then put a
shot between goalie Marcel Cousineau's pads while being pulled down
from behind by New York defenseman Zdeno Chara at 6:43 of the
second.
	   Ranford preserved his 15th career shutout by stopping Robert
Reichel's breakaway attempt midway through the third period.
 &UR; Canadiens 5 Oilers 2 &QC; 
	   In Edmonton, Alberta, Mark Recchi ended a career-worst 18-game
goalless drought without taking a shot and added a second goal in
Montreal's win.
	   On a delayed tripping penalty against Recchi, Oilers defenseman
Janne Niinimaa banked a pass off the boards that slid the length of
the ice and into the unoccupied Edmonton net with goaltender
Mikhail Shtalenkov on the bench for an extra attacker. Recchi was
given credit for the goal at 5:56 of the first period because he
was the last Montreal player to touch the puck.
	   Brett Clark and Sergei Zholtok also scored for the Canadiens,
who had ended an 11-game winless streak with a 2-1 victory last
Saturday in Toronto.
	   Rem Murray and Josef Beranek scored for the Oilers.
 &UR; Avalanche 4, Canucks 2 &QC; 
	   In Vancouver, British Columbia, Valeri Kamensky had a goal,
ending a 15-game scoring drought, and added three assists as the
Colorado won a fight-filled game.
	   Claude Lemieux, who also had an assist, scored the go-ahead goal
to snap a 2-2 tie 6:59 into the third period as the Avalanche won
for only the third time in their last nine games (3-5-1).
	   The teams, playing for the second time in 12 days, had two
fights in a first period that featured 96 minutes in penalties,
including game misconducts to Avalanche's Wade Belak and the
Canucks' Chris McAllister.
	   The Canucks, coming off back-to-back shutout losses, lost their
third straight and are 4-10-3 in their last 17 games.

Moderate earthquake awakens many residents in central Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUMAGUETE CITY, Philippines (AP) _ A moderate earthquake with a
preliminary magnitude of 4.3 shook several central Philippine towns
early Wednesday, rousing many residents from sleep but causing no
casualties or damages, witnesses said.
	   The earthquake hit several towns in the island provinces of
Negros Oriental and Bohol at 2:45 a.m. (1845 GMT Tuesday) and was
centered 35 kilometers (22 miles) southwest of Dumaguete City in
Negros, seismologists said.
	   ``I was awakened and felt my house shaking,'' said businessman
Manuel Sagarbaria in Dumaguete. A reporter said some residents
rushed out of several houses in the city.
	   Government seismologist Henry Penarubia said the earthquake,
caused by a movement in the Negros Trench 18 kilometers (11 miles)
below the ground, was not strong enough to generate destructive
waves or destroy structures.
	   The Philippines is located in one of the most earthquake-prone
regions in the world.

Vietnam loses export revenue from lower prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam has lost dlrs 630 million in
export revenue this year due to lower prices for some key items,
Wednesday's Labor newspaper quoted Trade Minister Truong Dinh Tuyen
as saying.
	   Lower world prices for crude oil, seafood, garments and rubber
have cost the country dlrs 1.16 billion in export revenue, but that
was partially offset by a dlrs 530 million gain from higher prices
for rice, coffee and cashew nuts, Tuyen said.
	   The Asian crisis has taken a toll on Vietnam's exports, which
grew only 0.9 percent to dlrs 9.356 billion this year, compared
with an average of 25 percent in recent years, according to
preliminary data from the General Statistical Office.
	   This year's trade deficit stands at dlrs 2.034 billion, down
from dlrs 2.35 billion last year.
	   The National Assembly last month set an export growth target of
5 percent to 7 percent for 1999.
	   Tuyen said Vietnam can achieve its export target of dlrs 10
billion for next year with efforts to increase export revenues of
crude oil, garments and shoes.
	   Tuyen projects that world prices for Vietnam's key export items
next year will see only very little improvement compared with 1998.

Five Thai elephants stranded in Indonesia return home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Five Thai elephants stranded in
Indonesia for the past 15 months returned home on Wednesday,
arriving by barge in the early morning darkness at the southern
port of Phuket.
	   A score of animal rights activists and government officials were
on hand to greet the elephants as a crane lifted them, one by one
with their handlers riding on their backs to keep them calm, on to
the dock at Phuket, a resort island, 690 kilometers (430 miles)
southwest of Bangkok.
	   The activists, who had been waging a campaign to pressure the
government to rescue the elephants, held yellow banners that read
``Welcome Home to Thailand Elephant.''
	   They draped the beasts with garlands of marigolds while some fed
them bananas and other fruits.
	   Thais regard elephants as a symbol of their nation, and all
white elephants are regarded as property of the royal family.
	   The elephants and their handlers were sent to Indonesia last
year on a ten-year contract to train elephants in that country's
logging industry.
	   But when a severe economic crisis hit Indonesia, the company
that hired the elephants and their handlers could not pay their
salaries.
	   The handlers returned to Thailand, but with no money or way to
transport their charges, were forced to leave them behind.
Indonesian officials said their government was too broke to pay for
the elephants transport home.
	   The elephants left the Indonesian port of Medan on the island of
Sumatra and sailed across the Andaman Sea to Phuket after
government officials raised 1.5 million baht (dlrs 40,500) in
donations to transport them.
	   Hardwood logging has been illegal in largely-deforested Thailand
since 1989, depriving elephants of one of their valued roles in
this country.
	   With their habitat rapidly shrinking, many handlers have had
little choice but to lead their beasts along city streets begging
for food.
	   Illegal logging is still ongoing in many border areas.
	   The governor of Lampang province, one such area near the border
with Myanmar, or Burma, said more than 200 elephants were being
overworked and force fed amphetamines by illegal loggers in three
districts in his province, according to Wednesday's Bangkok Post
newspaper.
	   The Post also reported that an elephant stomped his handler to
death in a forest in Lampang on Tuesday, but was eventually subdued
with tranquilizer darts.

Villagers told not to confront wild elephants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Villagers in the southern province of Dong
Nai have been told not to confront a herd of 14 wild elephants that
have killed three people this month, a local government official
said Wednesday.
	   Local officials, meeting Saturday, also crafted ways to live in
peace with the pachyderms. They include informing villagers who
reside near jungles not to go to rice fields after 3 p.m. and to
offer more food to the elephants, said Nguyen Bach Mo, chief of the
Dinh Quan district forest control bureau.
	   The elephants often terrify villagers at night. Earlier this
month, three people were trampled by the elephants, bringing the
number of deaths to nine since 1993. Fifteen families have been
evacuated, Mo said.
	   But he said long-term solutions _ evacuation of some 400
families living in areas often threatened by the elephants or
relocation of the animals to other areas _ would be expensive.
	   The officials agreed to provide relief aid to families who go
hungry because they can not harvest their crops in areas frequented
by elephants, Mo said. Those villagers also have been encouraged to
buy life insurance.
	   Over the past few months, the elephants have terrified villagers
once every week or two. During their rampages, they have eaten all
the available food, including rice and salt.
	   The provincial government has allocated 40 million dong (dlrs
3,000) to buy salt, which is to be mixed with shell and bones and
placed at spots that the elephants frequent.
	   Mo said the herd became particularly aggressive since 1993, when
a team of foreign elephant trainers was hired to trap 11 elephants
and transport them to a village in the central highland province of
Daklak for taming. All of those elephants later died.
	   The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development estimates
Vietnam has 120 to 130 wild elephants down from 1,500 to 2,000 a
decade ago.

Indonesia rejects request by Portuguese lawmaker to extradite
</HEADLINE>
Suharto

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The government on Wednesday ruled out
a Portuguese lawmaker's request for the extradition of former
President Suharto because of atrocities in East Timor.
	   Justice Minister Muladi said there was no extradition treaty
with Portugal, East Timor's former colonial master, and that
Suharto should be held accountable in Indonesia for any wrongdoing.
	   ``Indonesia has the greatest responsibility to try Suharto if he
is involved in any crimes or violations,'' Muladi said.
	   Indonesian state prosecutors are investigating corruption
allegations against Suharto, who quit in May after riots and
student protests against his 32-year authoritarian rule.
	   The Portuguese attorney general's office has said that
Portuguese law provided no legal grounds to pursue the request for
the extradition of Suharto.
	   A Portuguese lawmaker, Nuno Correia da Silva, had based his
appeal on human rights abuses committed by the Indonesian military
in East Timor during and after its 1975 invasion. Separatist
guerrillas continue to fight.
	   The United Nations regards Portugal as East Timor's
administering power. Correia da Silva had said this _ and current
attempts to extradite former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet
from Britain to Spain _ strengthened his case.

Four Westerners killed in bloody end to Yemen kidnapping

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Troops surrounded a band of Islamic
extremists holding 16 Western tourists hostage and opened fire,
bringing a bloody end to the kidnapping that left four Westerners
dead and two others injured.
	   The remaining 10 hostages were freed unharmed following
Tuesday's military operation, in which three kidnappers died.
	   Yemen's Interior Ministry said the kidnappers had killed three
of the captives and that a fourth died later in hospital.
	   It was not immediately clear if the victims were slain before or
during the fighting between extremists and some 200 Yemen security
forces.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman Lee McClenny said that according
to the Yemen government, troops stormed the hideout only after the
kidnappers began killing the hostages.
	   The 16 tourists _ 12 Britons, two Americans and two Australians
_ were kidnapped Monday near the southern town of Mawdiyah, about
175 miles (280 kms) south of the capital, San`a.
	   In London, the Foreign Office confirmed that three Britons _
Ruth Williamson, Margaret Whitehouse and Peter Rowe _ were killed,
but did not provide their ages or hometowns.
	   The fourth victim was a 35-year-old Australian man from Sydney,
the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said. His
name was not released pending notification of next of kin.
	   The other tourists wounded in the clash were an American woman
and a British woman.
	   Three of the kidnappers, including an Egyptian, were killed, the
Interior Ministry said. It was not immediately known if there were
any other kidnappers and whether they had been apprehended.
	   The surviving hostages were recovering from their ordeal at a
hotel in Aden, where volunteers from the British and American
communities were helping them cope with their trauma, said David
Pearce, a British Embassy official in San`a.
	   ``They are obviously in a state of severe shock, and I mean
severe shock,'' Pearce told the British news agency Press
Association. ''They are uninjured but obviously very tired, very
stunned and in need of a good meal, a good rest and someone to talk
to. They have been through an awful experience.''
	   In London, British newspapers on Wednesday criticized the
bungled rescue attempt. The Daily Mail, a London-based tabloid,
asked on the front page, ``Did our tourists really need to die?''
	   The kidnapping began Monday when the tourists' convoy of five
vehicles was ambushed by men who opened fire on their police
escorts. The kidnappers threatened to kill the tourists if the
police did not back off, Yemeni security officials said.
	   Tribesmen in unruly Yemen have frequently kidnapped tourists to
pressure the government into providing them with new roads, water
or clinics. But the hostages generally have been treated as guests
and released unharmed.
	   Four Germans are being held by a tribe in northeast Yemen. The
kidnappers are demanding more schools, hospitals and telephone
lines in their area.
	   The latest incident marked the first time an abduction was
carried out by Islamic extremists. Security officials said the
kidnappers belong to Islamic Jihad, many of whose leaders fought
Russian troops in Afghanistan. The group is believed to have about
200 members.
	   The Interior Ministry said members of the ``extremist terrorist
gang'' killed three of the captives _ two men and a woman.
	   ``They proceeded in killing the captives after refusing any
attempts at negotiations, which led security forces to storm the
area to prevent further bloodshed and ensure the safe release of
the rest of the hostages,'' the statement said.
	   The bodies of the dead and injured tourists were ferried by
government helicopter to a hospital in the southern port city of
Aden, security officials said. The other tourists were escorted by
troops to a hotel in Aden.
	   After the shootout, security forces detained scores of suspected
Islamic extremists, said the officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   The kidnappers had demanded the release of their leader, Saleh
Haidara al-Atwi, who was detained two weeks ago as part of a
government crackdown on Islamic vigilantes who had been enforcing
strict Islamic rules in southern Yemen, security officials said.
	   Islamic Jihad members reportedly were flogging women who did not
observe the Islamic dress code and men for selling and drinking
alcohol, which is forbidden in Islam.
	   The kidnappers also wanted the release of another leader, the
officials said. They did not identify him.
	   The group ran a military camp in southern Yemen, security
officials said.
	   Yemen was once a haven for Islamic militant fugitives from other
countries, but the government has expelled many of them.
	   Before the shootout, Yemeni officials tried to negotiate with
the kidnappers while security forces encircled the area.
	   Ahmad Ali Mohsen, governor of Abyan province, where the
kidnapping took place, was leading the talks with leaders of the
Al-Fadl tribe, to which the kidnappers belong, an official at the
governor's office said.
	   A London-based Islamic human rights group said Tuesday that it
had contacted the kidnappers the night before and received
assurances that they would not harm the hostages.
	   ``They promised not to harm the hostages,'' said a spokesman for
the Islamic Observation Center. ``We hold the Yemeni government
responsible for the deaths. The way the authorities handled the
situation was barbaric and irresponsible.''

Inquiries to follow Australian race disaster

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Two inquiries will be held into the
deadly Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race amid claims that race organizers
knew of the potential danger 24 hours before the fleet was
decimated by a massive storm.
	   Four bodies were recovered and rescuers have given up hope of
finding two others presumed drowned in the worst death toll in the
54-year history of the event. Winds up to 90 mph (144 kph) and
waves 35 feet (11 meters) high carved a path of destruction through
the annual race this week.
	   A New South Wales government Coroner's inquiry has been ordered
to probe the loss of life while the Cruising Yacht Club of
Australia, the race organizer, will also investigate the disaster.
	   The club defended its decision to appoint immediate past
commodore Peter Bush to hold its inquiry, saying no independent
body could do as good a job.
	   The inquiries are certain to focus on the weather and what
information was passed on to the crew aboard the 115 yachts.
Seventy yachts had withdrawn from a race wrecked by the massive
waves, and rescuers saved about 50 sailors from seven stricken
craft.
	   The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper Wednesday quoted an unnamed
source from the weather bureau as saying the yacht club and the
Australian Maritime Safety Authority were given early notice of the
approaching storm.
	   ``We gave them 24 hours notice and that is a long lead time for
weather at sea,'' the source said. ``Most times 12 hours is
considered to be satisfactory.''
	   The source said the information was passed on two hours after
the start of the race at Sydney Harbor on Dec. 26. The paper said
the weather bureau was concerned by reports that the fleet was
given no warning about the intensity of the storms.
	   Richard Winning, who captained the yacht Winston Churchill which
sank, killing three, admitted he had been told that conditions
would be bad.
	   ``I think we were given adequate information, yes,'' Winning
said.
	   Bush defended the yacht club holding its own inquiry, which will
be conducted in private with the report made public later.
	   ``I don't think by any stretch of the imagination that you want
to assume that this is not going to be an objective review,'' Bush
said Wednesday.
	   He said the inquiry would consider whether or not the race, won
by billionaire skipper Larry Ellison on United States maxi
Sayonara, should have been abandoned when the storm hit.
	   ``Had we called the race off when we were aware of the strength
of those conditions, little else could have happened other than
what happened because these guys were already on the race course,''
Bush said.
	   ``And for us to say, `OK guys all stop racing and go home,'
they're still out there, they've still got 100 or 30 or 50 miles
(160 or 48 or 80 kilometers) to get to shore and it's not actually
as simple as that.''
	   Current club commodore Hugo van Kretschmar said he had opposed
an abandonment of the race and said it was run under international
rules leaving the responsibility with the individual skippers.
	   ``The unsinkable and unrollable yacht, like the Titanic, doesn't
exist,'' Van Kretschmar said.
	   Australian Prime Minister John Howard praised the rescue
operation, which at its peak included 35 aircraft and almost as
many water craft.
	   ``The Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race is part of the Christmas to
New Year period of Australia, it's part of our way of life and
these people have lost their lives following a sport they love,''
Howard said Wednesday.
	   ``That doesn't make it any easier for their families. I think
it's just a miracle for which we should be very thankful that more
lives weren't lost and the people you can thank for that are very
much the people in the rescue operations. I think they are
magnificent.''
	   The bodies of two members of the Winston Churchill, Jim Lawler
and Michael Bannister, were recovered from Bass Strait on Tuesday.
Two others, Bruce Guy and Phil Skeggs from Business Post Naiad,
were killed when their yacht rolled over Sunday during the peak of
the storms.
	   Before they were rescued, crew mates strapped the bodies of Guy
and Skeggs to the boat, which was towed 120 kilometers (75 miles)
back to shore at Eden, New South Wales. The floating coffin docked
Wednesday afternoon.
	   British Olympic Games sailor Glyn Charles, 33, and Australian
John Dean, 47, are presumed dead.
	   The Maritime Authority abandoned its search Tuesday afternoon,
saying no hope was held for the pair.
	   Dean had told his family that when he died he wanted his ashes
spread at sea.
	   ``It looks like he has got his wish,'' said Dean's 15-year-old
son Peter. ``At least he died doing something he loved.''

Joint venture for Vietnam's first oil refinery gets license
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A joint venture with Russia to build and
run Vietnam's first oil refinery has been granted an operating
license, the Vietnam News Agency reported Wednesday.
	   The license was granted Tuesday for the VietRoss Refinery, to be
located at the small fishing village of Dung Quat about 100
kilometers (60 miles) south of Danang.
	   It is expected to refine 6.5 million tons (1.88 billion gallons)
of crude oil per year, with the first phase to be operational in
2001.
	   The refinery is a joint venture between Vietnam's oil and gas
monopoly, PetroVietnam, and Russia's Zarubezhneft. They signed a
contract last month and are to equally fund the projected
investment capital of dlrs 1.3 billion.
	   At a meeting in August, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
Vietnamese counterpart Tran Duc Luong pledged to rebuild their
countries' Soviet-era alliance.
	   ``As a minimum, we should restore our past relations,
concentrating on the oil and gas complex,'' Yeltsin said.
	   The first oil production joint venture between the countries was
VietSovpetro, established in 1986.
	   It has been Vietnam's major crude oil producer ever since,
accounting for 80 percent of this year's total output of crude and
earning about dlrs 1.2 billion from exports this year _ 13 percent
of the country's total export turnover.
	   Before the contract was signed, speculation had been rife that
the refinery project never would be finished. Two potential foreign
partners backed out, concerned about the distance from the
oilfields and lack of control over pricing.
	   Vietnam exports high-quality sweet crude from its White Tiger
offshore field near the Spratly islands, mostly to Japan. But it
had to import 6 million tons of refined products in 1997.
	   Foreign investors wanted the refinery in southern Vietnam, near
the oil and gas fields. The government opted for Quang Ngai
province, on the typhoon-prone central coast, to help the poor
region.

Three Balkan journalists share Olof Palme Prize
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Three journalists working for
independent news organizations in Serbia, Croatia and
Bosnia-Herzegovina shared the Olof Palme Prize this year.
	   The journalists recognized Tuesday were Veran Matic, chairman of
the ANEM, a network of independent radio stations in Serbia; Senad
Pecanin, chief editor of the independent weekly DANI in Sarajevo,
Bosnia-Herzegovina; and Viktor Ivancik, executive editor for the
independent political weekly Feral Tribune in Split, Croatia.
	   The fund cited them for ``continuing the struggle for free
expression despite violations, harassments and abuse.''
	   ``This should be seen as a recognition of all those within
independent media fighting for democracy and peace in the former
Yugoslavia,'' said Pierre Schori, president of the Olof Palme
Memorial Fund.
	   The prize has been awarded annually since 1987 by the Olof Palme
Memorial Fund, established by the family of the assassinated
Swedish prime minister and his Social Democratic Party to foster
international understanding.
	   Recipients of the prize include Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa,
Czech president Vaclav Havel in 1989 when he still was a dissident
in his own country, and Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng.
	   The prize this year is worth about dlrs 50,000.

With US, Iraq, still in military mode, UN tries to find its future
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors joke about looking
for new work and outgoing Security Council members trot to their
last meetings, apparently relieved their two-year terms will end
before the council decides what to do about Iraq.
	   It seems few people at the United Nations sense an urgent need
to figure out a future for U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq _ at
least not during the holidays or as long as Baghdad and Washington
still trade fire and angry rhetoric.
	   But there is little question they must do so: U.N. resolutions
and international law demand that U.N. weapons experts oversee the
elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction before sanctions
are lifted.
	   Most diplomats acknowledge that the process of finding a new
relationship with Iraq will be long and contentious in the wake of
the U.S.-British bombing campaign and Iraq's declaration that
inspectors will never return.
	   Permanent council members Russia and China have criticized both
the strikes and chief weapons inspector Richard Butler, whose
report on Iraq's alleged lack of cooperation triggered the military
attack. Iraq's other sympathizer on the council _ France _ has
suggested a whole new system of monitoring Iraq's proscribed
weapons programs.
	   The result is that nearly two weeks after the first cruise
missiles fell, the Security Council has yet to agree on a formal
response to the bombing campaign and the future of Butler's U.N.
Special Commission.
	   ``Major differences remain,'' Russia's deputy U.N. ambassador,
Yuriy Fedotov, told reporters heading into a council meeting on an
entirely different subject: the Ethiopia-Eritrea dispute.
	   Indeed, the United States objects to the key elements of a
Russia-drafted statement on Iraq, most significantly a reference
that the council ``expresses regret'' that force was used against
Baghdad.
	   Meanwhile, on the 38th floor, Secretary-General Kofi Annan has
assembled a team of four of his closest aides to advise him on what
to do next. But he is bound by the will of the council, which seems
paralyzed _ at least temporarily _ by the conflict.
	   ``He clearly wants guidance from the council,'' said U.N.
spokesman Manoel de Almeida E Silva, indicating that Annan, too,
feels powerless by the divisions.
	   Annan told reporters last week that he hoped council members
would use the Christmas holidays to reflect on how they could
bridge the gaps among themselves to ``forge the way ahead.''
	   ``To do that, in my judgment, will require flexibility,
compromise, and a willingness to really think creatively,'' he
said.
	   On Jan. 1, the council welcomes five new nonpermanent members _
Canada, the Netherlands, Argentina, Malaysia and Namibia _ who will
have to take up Annan's call.
	   On Tuesday, Portuguese Ambassador Antonio Monteiro was downright
jovial as he headed into one of his last council meetings,
indicating his relief that he wouldn't have to deal with the
situation.
	   Inspectors, meanwhile, continued working in New York, preparing
documents for a future assessment of Iraq's weapons capabilities,
U.N. spokesman Ewen Buchanan said Tuesday.
	   A third of the inspectors who were pulled from Baghdad just
before the first missiles rained down have been sent home, however.
	   Inspectors joke about updating their resumes and finding new
work, citing predictions of the demise of UNSCOM and the calls for
Butler's ouster by Iraq, Russia and others.
	   One such call came from an unusual place this week: Former
inspector Scott Ritter, one of Iraq's greatest critics, wrote in
Monday's Wall Street Journal that Butler should resign for having
allowed himself to be used by Washington.

Warne says public behind him in scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Legspinner Shane Warne said
Wednesday he had the support of the Australian public as he
prepared to testify before a Pakistan judicial inquiry into match
fixing in cricket.
	   Warne will give evidence to the Pakistan commission in Melbourne
on Jan. 8 along with teammate Mark Waugh and former Australian team
manager Alan Crompton.
	   The inquiry wants to interview Waugh and Warne after revelations
of their involvement with an illegal Indian bookmaker during
Australia's tour of Sri Lanka in 1994.
	   The pair were fined for providing pitch and weather information
to the bookmaker by the Australian Cricket Board in February 1995
in action kept secret until three weeks ago.
	   Waugh and Warne then alleged they were offered bribes by former
Pakistan captain Salim Malik during Australia's tour of Pakistan
that followed Sri Lanka.
	   Warne said Wednesday the controversy had taken its toll but
praised a ``fully supportive'' public.
	   ``The last two or three weeks have been tough,'' he said after
being recalled to the Australian side after an eight-month absence
through shoulder injury.
	   ``The public in Melbourne have been fantastic, when we
(Victoria) went to the Sheffield Shield game in Sydney they were
sensational.''
	   The champion legspinner said he was happy to give evidence in
public to the Pakistan inquiry.
	   ``I'm happy to do whatever is required,'' he said. ``When it
actually happened in Pakistan we went straight to the people (team
management) and told them what happened and that was four years
ago.
	   ``Nothing has changed since then, I'll be giving the same
evidence as what I did four years ago. Let's just wait and see what
the outcome is.''
	   Warne was uncertain whether he and Waugh's involvement with the
Indian bookmaker led to the alleged approach from Malik to throw a
game.
	   ``Hopefully that's something that can be worked out,'' Warne
said.
	   He said he was surprised to learn a bloc of subcontinent cricket
nations _ Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka _ want he and Waugh banned
for life.
	   The nations will lobby to that effect at an International
Cricket Council meeting in New Zealand on Jan. 10-11.
	   ``That was a bit out of leftfield,'' he said of reports
detailing the call for life bans. ``Everyone is entitled to their
own opinion, people can say whatever they want. But I don't think
that (life bans) will be happening.''
	   Warne and Waugh will also be interviewed by an independent
Australian inquiry about the bookmaker controversy.
	   The inquiry, headed by Rob O'Regan, was established by the
Australian Cricket Board and wants to interview all Australian
players since 1992 and any former players with relevant
information.
	   The O'Regan inquiry starts on Jan. 12. (djp)

	   ALICE SPRINGS, Australia (AP) _ Technical problems were
identified Wednesday when the spaceship-like capsule a
U.S.-Australian team hopes to fly around the world beneath a
balloon was lifted off the ground for the first time in Outback
Australia.
	   But organizers for the latest bid to be the first to fly nonstop
around the world say the problems were part of normal testing and
the final adjustments process, and should not in themselves delay
the launch, planned for Jan. 1.
	   The 7-ft. by 8-ft. (2.1-meter by 2.4-meter) gondola was lifted
off the ground for the first time in the Australian launch zone
Wednesday.
	   But it rose only inches (centimeters) over the red sand of the
desert launch zone, dangling beneath a crane to be weighed and for
some ballast and landing equipment checks.
	   The bid by the Re/Max International team comes just days after
Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett and his team splashed down in the
Pacific Ocean.
	   Fossett, British millionaire Richard Branson and Per Lindstrand
of Sweden abandoned their more conventional balloon flight near the
northeast tip of Oahu, Hawaii on Christmas Day. They have tried a
total of 11 times.
	   For the Re/Max attempt, testing Wednesday showed uneven weight
distribution between the six steel cables from which the gondola
will be strung beneath the giant polyethylene balloon which the
three pilots plan to fly at the edge of space.
	   Technicians began working on redistribution of the 6,600-pound
(2,970-kilogram) capacity payload and said later the joining pins
between the gondola and some of the cables could be shifted and the
tension adjusted to solve the problem.
	   Scientists and engineers continued checking equipment, including
oxygen and nitrogen tanks to create the atmosphere inside the
pressurized gondola, space suits and parachutes the pilots will
wear, scientific and communications equipment and food and waste
disposal units.
	   ``We're checking and rechecking every circuit, every life
support component,'' team leader and Denver, Colorado real estate
magnate Dave Liniger said Wednesday.
	   ``There's no question that it's more dangerous than the other
missions,'' Liniger said.
	   ``The other people, if they get in trouble they can slowly go
down and sit down in the ocean. If we get into trouble, we're 25
miles (40 kilometers) up, so it creates some special hazards.''
	   The tin workshop outside the central Australian town of Alice
Springs, which serves as balloon central, was a hive of activity
Wednesday as team members including many volunteers continued final
preparations.
	   Spokesman Kevin Roark said the team was not behind schedule for
the planned Jan. 1 launch, despite many components not yet being
installed in the capsule.
	   Weather conditions may yet delay the launch further, however, if
dangerously strong winds continue to blow over the site.
	   The attempt has already been delayed twice; once when the
contract for the C-130 Hercules transport plane, which was to have
brought the capsule to Australia from the United States, was
canceled because of the latest Gulf crisis and once by high winds
and unseasonal rain over the launch zone.
	   The capsule, carrying pilots Liniger, journalist Bob Martin from
Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Australian John Wallington, will
dangle beneath a balloon that is 460 feet (138 meters) in diameter
at ``full float'' and 700 feet (210 meters) high, large enough to
envelope the Houston Astrodome.
	   It will rise 1,000 feet (300 meters) a minute during takeoff,
filling with helium on the way up to a cruising altitude of 130,000
feet (39,000 meters), or about 24 miles (39 kilometers) above sea
level.
	   There, the team expects to catch winds that will carry it west
at up to 80 mph (128 kph) along a route that almost directly
follows the Tropic of Capricorn, and complete the 22,800-mile
(36,480-kilometer) journey in about 18 days.
	   The NASA-developed balloon type has been used before, but only
to carry unmanned scientific payloads to heights of about 80,000
feet (24,000 meters)
	   ``Its great to see her hanging here,'' said Martin as he oversaw
the weighing procedures and began fitting the cameras he expects
will transmit pictures from the edge of space.
	   Martin said that along with the landing, the launch would be the
most dangerous part of the trip.
	   ``We have parachutes, but in reality below about 10,000 feet
(3,000 meters) it is doubtable that the parachute will open in time
to save you,'' he said.
	   ``For the first 500-1,000 feet (150-300 meters) will be very
risky, we will be biting our fingernails.''

Drug-related crimes quadrupled in Ho Chi Minh City this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Drug-related crimes have quadrupled this
year in Ho Chi Minh City, the Thanh Nien newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   It cited a report from the city prosecutor's office as saying it
handled 1,473 cases this year from 388 in 1997, evidence of
Vietnam's growing drug problem.
	   The Ho Chi Minh City Police newspaper reported Tuesday that
courts nationwide this year have issued a record 49 death penalties
_ up from 26 last year _ and 31 life sentences for convicted
traffickers.
	   It said 18,000 people in 9,000 cases have been arrested
nationwide this year on drug-related charges, up 44 percent and 35
percent, respectively, from 1997.
	   Police have seized 65.53 kgs (144.5 pounds) of heroin and 1,135
kgs (2,502 pounds) of opium so far this year.
	   In a major crackdown as part of the government's anti-drug
campaign, police arrested 1,119 people in 607 cases nationwide in
15 days ending Dec. 15, seizing 4.06 kilograms (8.95 pounds) of
heroin and 22 kilograms (48.5 pounds) of opium.
	   There are about 80,000 drug addicts in the country with police
records, but the National Drug Control Committee estimates that
there are 134,000 drug addicts nationwide, 70 percent under age 30.

Sports institute to investigate abuse claims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian Institute of Sport (AIS)
director John Boultbee said Wednesday he will investigate claims
that female tennis scholarship holders were subjected to starvation
diets and verbal abuse.
	   However, Boultbee believes the AIS should never be blamed for
athletes failing to make the grade at international level, saying
the taxpayer-funded program provides the ``opportunity'' only for
graduates to reach greater heights.
	   Responding to claims from at least 34 women that their careers
were ruined by the AIS training regime, Boultbee said the AIS had
to ensure basic fitness requirements were met.
	   ``It's all too easy to blame the AIS when someone is not
successful,'' Boultbee said. ``Sometimes the athletes should
perhaps look at themselves a bit more closely.''
	   Players involved in the program between 1981 and 1995 have
leveled the accusations, with some saying they developed eating
disorders because of the pressure to lose weight. (djp)

Olympic organizers want Howard to muzzle renegade legislator
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard on Wednesday
ignored pleas from Olympics organizers to silence a former sports
minister who wants the Games abolished following a bribery scandal.
	   International Olympic Committee (IOC) member Kevan Gosper of
Australia said Howard should bring renegade member of Parliament
Andrew Thomson into line, but the prime minister said Thomson was
entitled to an opinion, even if he did not share it.
	   ``He's a mere backbencher, he's entitled to his view,'' Howard
said.
	   Thomson, who was replaced as sports minister after the October
federal election, this week said the international Olympic movement
was so tainted by bribery scandals that the 2004 Olympics in Athens
should be the last modern Olympics.
	   Howard said he would not take any disciplinary action against
Thomson, even though Gosper said his comments could damage Olympic
reputation ahead of the 2000 Games in Sydney.
	   Thomson said IOC members, who are not elected but appointed for
life, were a bizarre group of men.
	   ``If you're going to organize sport on a global level I would
have thought the first requirement would be that it be ethically
clean and that there be no suggestion of any financial taint to it
all,'' Thomson said.
	   ``But I don't think that with these people (IOC members)
appointed for life, silly as that obviously is, that they can
redeem themselves.
	   ``Why can't we organize a global competition in some other form
where the franchises are not handed out by this extraordinary,
bizarre group of men ... What better than to say Athens . . . why
not make 2004 the last?'' (djp)

Estrada says 1999 budget to put Philippine economy out of danger
</HEADLINE>
zone

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada on Wednesday
formally approved a 1999 budget of 579.5 billion pesos (dlrs 14.8
billion), which he said would allow the Philippine economy to
recover from Asia's financial crisis.
	   ``With this expenditure program, we will be able to give our
economy the push it needs to get out of the danger zone and set it
firmly on the path of steady growth,'' Estrada said.
	   He said nearly 68 percent of the budget would be spent for
social services, infrastructure in rural areas and the development
of agriculture which would help the country register a gross
national product growth of 3.0 to 3.5 percent next year.
	   The Philippine economy suffered a slowdown this year due to the
effects of the regional financial turmoil, a severe drought and a
series of killer typhoons that devastated key agricultural regions.
	   Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno said that with better weather
and more rainfall forecast next year and funding for projects aimed
at boosting agricultural production, the government's economic
targets could be attained.
	   Estrada said changes have been made in budgetary disbursement
procedures to avoid corruption and allow the prompt payment of
financial obligations. Details of major budget releases would be
posted on the Internet for transparency, he said.
	   The Department of Education, Culture and Sports got the highest
appropriation amounting to 88.3 billion pesos (dlrs 2.26 billion),
followed by the defense department with 51.7 billion (dlrs 1.32
billion) and the Department of Public Works and Highways with 38.2
billion pesos (dlrs 979 million), Diokno said.

DNA expert matches Anwar DNA to semen stains on mattress
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with judge allowing DNA evidence, supporters chanting
for Anwar outside courtroom, other details

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The prosecution in the sex and
corruption trial of ousted Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim
dealt him a huge blow Wednesday when a state DNA expert positively
identified his semen on a mattress.
	   Prosecutors are trying to prove Anwar had sex with the wife of
his former secretary, sodomized his family driver and abused his
powers to try to cover up sexual trysts.
	   The mattress was seized by police in July from an apartment in a
Kuala Lumpur suburb that Anwar is accused of using for secret
meetings with sex partners.
	   Prosecution witness, DNA expert Lim Kong Boon, told the court
that the DNA taken from 10 of the 13 stains on the mattress matched
Anwar's DNA. He said that several of the mattress stains containing
DNA from Anwar, referred to as Male One, were also mixed with DNA
from Shamsidar Taharin, the wife of Anwar's former personal
secretary.
	   He said one stain matched DNA from Anwar, Shamsidar and an
unidentified man; another stain contained DNA from Anwar and an
unidentified woman and man.
	   ``My reference to Male One, based on the DNA results I obtained,
is Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim,'' Lim said, using Anwar's formal Malay
title.
	   This set off chaos in the courtroom, with the defense and
prosecution shouting at the same time. Anwar bowed his head and his
wife, Azizah Ismail, continued to focus on the court documents she
was reading.
	   Outside the courtroom, hundreds of Anwar supporters shouted
``Reformasi!'' _ the rallying cry of his fledgling reform movement
demanding greater political freedoms.
	   Anwar was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 2,
after Mahathir deemed him morally unfit to lead the country. He was
arrested on Sept. 20 and badly beaten while in police custody,
causing an outcry over his treatment.
	   He is on trial for abuse of power and will be tried separately
on charges of engaging in illegal sex acts, including sodomy.
	   Anwar has denied all the accusations against him, saying they
were fabricated as part of a government conspiracy to undermine his
challenge to Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   Lim, who said in his 20 years of experience he had analyzed some
1,000 blood samples, testified that the chances of Anwar's DNA
matching another ethnic Malay were one in several billion.
	   Lim donned white latex gloves and inspected the 13 plastic bags
containing swatches from the mattress. He said he knew the blood
samples given to him were from Anwar because police had told him
so.
	   ``I was informed by police, they forwarded this information,''
he said.
	   Anwar's relatives started clapping and laughing at this
statement because it implied that the police had already told the
scientist that the blood belonged to Anwar even before he conducted
the test.
	   ``Why are you laughing? This is not a theater,'' scolded High
Court Judge Augustine Paul.
	   Doctors have testified that they took blood samples from Anwar
on Sept. 28, eight days after his arrest, and that he agreed to be
tested for sexually transmitted diseases.
	   The defense team asked Paul to dismiss the DNA evidence, saying
that at no time did Anwar consent to his blood being used for DNA
analysis.
	   ``The blood samples were used by police through trickery,
misrepresentation and deception. It infringes Anwar's right against
self-incrimination,'' argued defense attorney Gurbachan Sing.
	   The defense team on Monday implied that hair and semen samples
may have been taken from Anwar while he was unconscious after his
beating in police custody.
	   But Paul accepted the DNA evidence.
	   ``I hold that the blood test results are admissible and I
overrule the objection,'' he said.
	   Anwar's lawyers told The AP they had filed a request asking the
court for more time to analyze the DNA results. They also said a
foreign DNA expert would brief them on how to cross-examine Lim.

<TEXT>
	   FORT WILLIAM, Scotland (AP) _ Four hikers have been killed and
three injured in a mountain avalanche on Scotland's northwestern
coast, police said Wednesday.
	   The seven person group were participating in ``winter skills''
training course on Aonoch Mor near Ben Nevis in the Scottish
highlands when they were caught in the avalanche, police said.
	   Police did not release any of the victims' names.
	   Police Inspector Chas Ross told British Broadcasting Corp.'s
Radio 4 that the climbers were ''not well versed in the ways of the
hills but they had an instructor with them.''
	   The hikers were reported missing at 2230 GMT Tuesday when they
did not return from the day's climb. A search was immediately
launched by Royal Air Force mountain rescue teams. Gale force winds
forced a helicopter to abandon rescue attempts, but ground crews
managed to locate the group at 0120 GMT Wednesday, a police
spokesman said, speaking with customary anonymity.
	   The three survivors were carried off the mountain one at a time,
said a spokesman for Inverness ambulance services, speaking with
customary anonymity. He said they were taken to Belford Hospital in
Fort William, where they were being treated for hypothermia.
	   ``They had been caught in an avalanche and it has been confirmed
that there are four fatalities and three injured,'' the police
spokesman said.
	   Rescuers recovered two of the victim's bodies Wednesday morning,
and were still struggling to bring the other two off the mountain,
police said. Their efforts were being hampered by the threat of
further avalanches.
	   Northern England and Scotland have been hit by strong winds and
cold weather over the Christmas holiday, and the storm conditions
continued Wednesday.
	   ``I'm afraid it may be some while before we get more details
because we are having to do everything on foot because of the
treacherous conditions,'' said the police spokesman.

Taiwan warns China against stepping up diplomatic isolation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's foreign minister on Wednesday
warned China against stepping up its campaign to isolate the
island, saying it will only hinder reunification of the two sides.
	   ``China believes when it succeeds in taking away all of our
diplomatic allies, the time will come for reunification,'' Jason Hu
told a news conference. ``But I am afraid the more they push to
leave us zero diplomatic allies, it will only mean zero chance of
reunification.
	   ``Their suppression only sparks antagonism among our people, and
they must try to understand how people feel about it.''
	   Taiwan lost four diplomatic allies to Beijing this year _ South
Africa, Central African Republic, Guinea Bissau and Tonga. But it
picked up one new ally, the Marshall Islands.
	   Despite that gain, Taiwan is left with just 27 allies, mostly
small countries in Africa and Central and South America.
	   China considers Taiwan a renegade province and threatens to use
force to retake it, if necessary, after 49 years of political
separation following a civil war.
	   Hu warned China against pursuing so-called ``Big Country
Diplomacy'' by striking strategic alliances with advanced nations
while seeking their commitments to isolate Taiwan.
	   During his visit to Beijing last summer, U.S. President Bill
Clinton pledged not to support Taiwan's efforts to rejoin the
United Nations or its independence.
	   ``Despite their closer relations, Western nations will never
ease their attacks on the mainland's human rights violations,'' Hu
said. ``As Washington and Beijing get closer to each other, they
will also realize the wide gaps between them.''
	   When asked to comment on news reports that Washington has urged
Taiwan and China to establish a direct link between their military
forces, Hu said it has remained a ``scholastic idea.''
	   Setting up a hot line between Taiwan and China was among several
ideas U.S. officials have broached to help avoid a confrontation
resulting from a misjudgment of the other side's military
maneuvers, he said.
	   None of the ideas shall materialize unless both Taiwan and China
agree, he said.

Japan to retire original bullet trains
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Once the fastest railcars in the world and a symbol
of modern Japan, the nation's original bullet trains will make
their final runs in 1999, a railway official said Wednesday.
	   The trains will be gradually retired throughout next year to
make way for a new, faster express, said Yukihiro Ishitani of
Central Japan Railways.
	   Billed as the ``superexpresses of the century'' when they
debuted in 1964, the first-generation trains traveled between Tokyo
and the western city of Osaka at a record-setting speed of 210 kph
(130 miles per hour).
	   New routes have been added since then, and a total of 3,216 cars
of the original model were built by the defunct Japanese National
Railways (JNR), the forerunner of the privatized Japan Railway
group companies.
	   Sleeker, faster trains have also been introduced, including the
``Nozomi,'' which travels the 408-km (253 mile-) distance from
Tokyo to Osaka in just two and a half hours, compared to four hours
on the original train.
	   A new version of the Nozomi, with a maximum speed of 285 kph
(177 miles per hour), will debut in March 1999.
	   Kazutaro Oishi, 65, who drove the original bullet train on its
first day of operation, said he is sorry to see it go, Kyodo News
Agency reported Wednesday.
	   ``The train was high-tech, totally different from the trains
before,'' he was quoted as saying. ``It's really sad to see them
retire.''

Fighting erupts in Tajik capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Rival groups staged a fierce gun
battle in the center of Tajikistan's capital Dushanbe on Wednesday,
news reports said.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties in the Central Asian
nation.
	   Security guards from the National Reconciliation Commission
traded fire with troops loyal to a military commander, Rakhmon
Sanginov, according to Russia's Interfax news agency.
	   Civilians fled the center of the capital, leaving it deserted
except for the combatants, who were armed with rifles, machine guns
and grenade launchers, Russian news agencies reported.
	   It was not immediately clear what sparked the conflict in
Tajikistan, which is still recovering from a 5-year-civil war that
formally ended last year.
	   Ex-rebels now serve in the government, the army, and the
National Reconciliation Commission, which was established to bring
the former combatants together. However, there are still frictions
among the various groups.
	   Russia has about 25,000 troops in the Central Asian nation to
support President Emomali Rakhmonov, but there was no indication
that they were involved in the fighting.

Year-end lottery sales up for first time in four years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Ticket sales for Japan's year-end lottery rose for
the first time in four years, as many Japanese gambled on one last
chance for something to cheer about in a year filled with miserable
economic news.
	   Sales of ``Jumbo'' lottery tickets rose to 215.5 billion (dlrs
1.87 billion), up 6 percent from a year ago, the company that sells
the tickets, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., said Wednesday. The sales
figure was short of the record of 244.3 billion yen (dlrs 2.12
billion) set in 1994, the bank said.
	   The increase in lottery sales reflected people's hopes for a big
win amid the nation's deepening recession, said Satoshi Oda,
spokesman for Dai-Ichi Kangyo.
	   Japan is mired in its worst recession since the end of World War
II, with unemployment at a record high.
	   Tickets for the year-end lottery cost 300 yen (dlrs 2.6) each.
The first prize is 60 million yen (dlrs 521,000), an amount that
would buy a 100-square-meter (1,125 square feet) home in a Tokyo
suburb.
	   The drawing for the grand prize will be held Thursday at noon
and will be televised nationally.

Chechen businessman released from captivity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A businessman was released from captivity in the
breakaway region of Chechnya on Wednesday, two weeks after he was
taken hostage, a news report said.
	   Salamabek Khadshiyev, who heads a department of the regional gas
company Chechengazprom, was on his way to work when he was taken
hostage in mid-December, according to the Interfax news agency. No
details about his release, including whether a ransom was paid,
were available.
	   Chechen bandits have kidnapped hundreds of people for ransom
since the end of Chechnya's 1994-96 independence war with Russia.
	   Chechnya now runs its own affairs, though no country recognizes
its claim of independence, and Moscow says the territory remains
part of Russia.

Viet-Australian businessman given five years for smuggling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ High-profile Vietnam-born Australian
businessman Nguyen Trung Truc and one of his associates have been
sentenced to five years in jail for smuggling 242 motorcycles, a
court official said Wednesday.
	   Truc and Nguyen Van Dung were convicted in a one-day trial last
Friday in the southern province of Ba Ria Vung Tau. They have 15
days to appeal.
	   Truc set up a joint venture with the now-bankrupt Peregrine
Capital Holdings in 1991 to engage in financial and investment
consulting.
	   Between the end of 1995 and mid-1996, he authorized Dung to
arrange import quotas for motorbikes with local companies and
imported three batches, the court official said.
	   He imported a fourth batch of 242 Piaggio motorbikes in
September 1996, but could only arrange for the import quota with a
local trading company in December 1996.
	   The local company refused to sign the import contract because
the motorcycles already had been brought in, the official said, and
in March 1997, customs officials decided to confiscate them.
	   The case sent chills through the foreign investor community
because many businessmen say Vietnam's rules are unclear and
unevenly enforced, encouraging risk-taking that can backfire.
	   In May this year, Truc and five of his associates were charged
with tax evasion. With a series of affiliate companies, he
allegedly avoided dlrs 8 million in taxes by declaring imported
goods at lower prices than actual costs.
	   Truc was one of the first businessmen to jump into the Vietnam
market in the early 1990s, when the government had just begun
liberalizing its Soviet-style planned economic system.
	   His flamboyant style and rapid success in setting up auto and
computer dealerships brought him the spotlight, and he was
frequently profiled by international business publications as a
Vietnam success story.

U.S. and Israel form committee to monitor Holocaust restitution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's parliament and the U.S. Congress are
forming a committee to monitor the return of Holocaust-era property
worldwide, an Israeli legislator said Wednesday.
	   The committee, headed by Congressman Ben Gilman, a New York
Republican, and Israeli legislator Avraham Hirshson from the Likud
Party, will monitor implementation of restitution plans that
representatives from over 40 countries made at a conference in
Washington, D.C. last month, Hirshson said.
	   ``We want to remind these countries of their commitments,''
Hirshson said. He estimated the value of Jewish property either
plundered by the Nazis or left unclaimed after its owners perished
in the Holocaust at several billion dollars.
	   Restoring the property will be complicated, Hirshson said,
because many of the assets, including gold, works of art and real
estate, have changed hands several times.
	   Several countries have already begun restoring property or
paying out insurance claims.
	   Hirshson said there was no way to know how long the restitution
process would take but that participants in last month's conference
agreed to meet twice more to continue discussing the issue.

Myanmar military says 192 opposition members resign from party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ In the steady and mysterious collapse
of Myanmar's main opposition party, 192 more members have resigned
from Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, the
state-run New Light of Myanmar reported on Wednesday.
	   The 183 members from Ayerwaddy Division, or province, and nine
from Myeik Township, ``on their own volition tendered their
resignations'' to the Election Commission because ``they no longer
wished to participate in the activities of the NLD,'' the paper
said.
	   The paper, which is tightly controlled by the military
government, did not explain what prompted so many party members to
reach that decision simultaneously after eight years of membership.
	   Myanmar's laws have forbidden parties from taking on new members
since that time.
	   The paper also did not say if the 192 were among the more than
900 NLD members detained by the military since September.
	   A government spokesman has said they are staying at government
guest houses for a friendly exchange of views.
	   Nearly 500 have since been released, after resigning from the
party or signing undertakings pledging not to be involved in
political activity.
	   Those who have not resigned from the party have not been
released.
	   The military has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, in various
forms since 1962. In 1990, an election was held in which the NLD
won 82 percent of the seats in parliament.
	   The military refused to honor the result and has never allowed
parliament to convene. Suu Kyi's attempt to assemble the surviving
parliamentarians in September resulted in the mass detentions.
	   Suu Kyi, the daughter of Myanmar's independence hero, was placed
under house arrest from 1989-95 for her campaign to restore
democracy to the resource-rich, but poverty-stricken country.
	   In 1991 she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
	   ``We want to make clear that all these resignations were made
under coercion,'' Suu Kyi said in November. ``We are heartened by
the spirit of the great majority of the NLD members. The great
majority of our members remained staunch and have not been shaken
in their resolve.''
	   Asked if the mass resignations of members could paralyze her
party, Suu Kyi replied: ``The NLD will stand as it always stands _
fighting fit.''
	   She said the NLD leadership does not recognize the resignations.
	   Suu Kyi, who preaches nonviolence, emerged as the leader of
Myanmar's democratic movement in August 1988, two weeks after the
military crushed a nationwide uprising against its rule by gunning
down more than 3,000 protesters.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ More than 100 inmates escaped
Thailand's overcrowded prisons in 1998, a record year for
jailbreaks, the Department of Corrections said Wednesday.
	   Only 10 of the 102 prisoners who escaped, however, remain at
large, department statistics showed. The rest have been captured.
	   The department did not provide statistics for previous years,
but Interior Ministry officials have been expressing alarm since
mid-year at the rising number of jailbreaks.
	   Ministry officials said earlier this year that Thailand's prison
population was surging as more people turned to crime because of
the country's economic crisis.
	   At the same time, the crisis has forced budgets for government
agencies, including the Department of Corrections, to be slashed.
	   Thailand is in the midst of its worst economic downturn in
modern times and is receiving a dlrs 17.2 billion bailout from the
International Monetary Fund.
	   Four of the prisoners still at large escaped during the past
week.
	   Two convicted killers who escaped from the maximum security Bang
Kwan prison on the outskirts of Bangkok on Tuesday were still on
the run, as were two prisoners who escaped from a northeastern jail
over the weekend.

Four Westerners killed in bloody end to Yemen kidnapping

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemen faced a barrage of criticism Wednesday
after its troops stormed the hideout of Islamic extremist
kidnappers holding 16 Western hostages. Four of the hostages were
killed.
	   Two other hostages were wounded during the siege near the
southern town of Mawdiyah, about 175 miles (280 kilometers) south
of the capital, San`a.
	   The remaining 10 hostages were freed unharmed. Three kidnappers
died.
	   Yemen's Interior Ministry blamed the kidnappers for the deaths
of the three Britons killed instantly and an Australian who died in
later in a hospital. It said security forces intervened after the
kidnappers had begun killing the hostages.
	   ``They proceeded in killing the captives after refusing any
attempts at negotiations, which led security forces to storm the
area to prevent further bloodshed and ensure the safe release of
the rest of the hostages,'' a ministry statement said.
	   But British newspapers accused the Yemeni authorities of
premature intervention in the case. The Daily Mail asked on the
front page, ``Did your tourists really need to die?''
	   British Ambassador Vic Henderson reportedly had pleaded with the
San`a government to do nothing ``that in any way could jeopardize
the safety of the hostages.''
	   In San`a, Yemenis told journalists they were surprised the
government had intervened so quickly when it usually negotiated for
several days, if not weeks, in the hostage-taking frequent in
Yemen.
	   A London-based Islamic human rights group said Tuesday that it
had contacted the kidnappers the night before and received
assurances that they would not harm the hostages.
	   ``We hold the Yemeni government responsible for the deaths. The
way the authorities handled the situation was barbaric and
irresponsible,'' said a spokesman for the Islamic Observation
Center.
	   Kidnappings of foreigners occur often in Yemen, large parts of
which are run by lawless tribes, but until now the hostages usually
have been treated well and released unharmed.
	   But this was the first time an abduction was carried out by
Islamic extremists. Security officials said the kidnappers belong
to Islamic Jihad, many of whose leaders fought Russian troops in
Afghanistan. The group is believed to have about 200 members.
	   The 16 tourists, 12 Britons, two Americans and two Australians,
were kidnapped Monday near Mawdiyah.
	   In London, the Foreign Office confirmed that three Britons _
Ruth Williamson, Margaret Whitehouse and Peter Rowe _ were killed,
but did not provide their ages or hometowns.
	   The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the
fourth victim was a 35-year-old man from Sydney whose name would
not be released until next of kin had been informed.
	   The tourists wounded in the clash were an American woman and a
British woman.
	   The surviving hostages were recovering from their ordeal at a
hotel in Aden, where volunteers from the British and American
communities were helping them cope with their trauma, said David
Pearce, a British Embassy official in San`a.
	   ``They are obviously in a state of severe shock, and I mean
severe shock,'' Pearce told the British news agency Press
Association. ''They are uninjured but obviously very tired, very
stunned and in need of a good meal, a good rest and someone to talk
to. They have been through an awful experience.''
	   After the shootout, security forces detained scores of suspected
Islamic extremists, said the officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   At least three of the kidnappers _ including the mastermind of
the abduction _ were captured alive, the Interior Ministry said. It
said one of the kidnappers killed was an unidentified Egyptian.
	   The kidnapping began Monday when the tourists' convoy of five
vehicles was ambushed by men who opened fire on their police
escorts. The kidnappers threatened to kill the tourists if the
police did not back off, Yemeni security officials said.
	   The kidnappers demanded the release of their leader, Saleh
Haidara al-Atwi, who was detained two weeks ago in a government
crackdown on Islamic vigilantes who had been enforcing strict
Islamic rules in southern Yemen, security officials said.
	   The kidnappers also wanted the release of another leader, the
officials said. They did not identify him.
	   Yemen said the governor of Abyan province, Ahmad Ali Mohsen, was
negotiating with leaders of the Al-Fadl tribe, to which the
kidnappers belong, before the shootout occurred.
	   Tribesmen usually kidnapped foreigners to pressure the
government into providing them with new roads, water or clinics.
	   Four Germans are being held by a tribe in northeast Yemen. The
kidnappers are demanding more schools, hospitals and telephone
lines in their area.
	   German diplomats have appealed to the Yemeni authorities not to
attempt to rescue the four German hostages being held by a tribe in
a different part of the country, Yemeni officials said Wednesday.

Government: Chinese economy grew by 7.8 percent in 1998

 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to UPDATE with figures on inflation, incomes,
state-industry losses. No pickup.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Boosted by massive state spending on public
works, China's economy grew by 7.8 percent this year but missed its
official target, according to figures released Wednesday.
	   Growth was down sharply from 1997, when the economy expanded by
8.8 percent. Chinese leaders had hoped for at least 8 percent this
year to create jobs for millions of workers laid off in a sweeping
overhaul of state companies.
	   China has escaped the full impact of the 18-month-old Asian
financial crisis, but faces serious problems of its own in trying
to turn around money-losing state industries and clean up its
state-owned banking system.
	   The Chinese economy has slowed since its days of double-digit
growth in the early 1990s, but still is doing better than its
neighbors. Indonesia, one of the Asian economies hardest hit by the
crisis, says its economy could shrink by up to 15 percent this
year.
	   In a positive sign, the Chinese growth rate began to rise in
recent months, pumped up by the start of a dlrs 1.4 trillion,
three-year stimulus plan of spending on new highways and other
projects, according to the State Statistical Bureau.
	   Investment in fixed assets _ the centerpiece of the stimulus
plan _ was up 15 percent to 2.9 trillion yuan (dlrs 364.4 billion).
Most of that spending came from state companies, while investment
by private companies was unchanged, said Ye Zhen, a spokesman for
the Statistical Bureau.
	   Industrial output was up 8.8 percent.
	   Exports were almost unchanged from 1997 at dlrs 182 billion,
while imports fell 3.8 percent to dlrs 137 billion. That left China
with a trade surplus of dlrs 45 billion, up dlrs 4.7 billion from
the previous year.
	   Ye, speaking at a news conference, declined to give a growth
forecast for 1999. He said it would be released by the National
People's Congress early next year.
	   The economy expanded by only 7 percent in the first half of
1998. That prompted Chinese leaders to implement the stimulus plan
and increase lending by state banks, loosening austerity measures
that date to the early 1990s.
	   Those austerity measures, imposed to fight inflation that at the
time was raging at more than 20 percent a year, have been so
effective at cooling the economy that the Statistical Bureau said
consumer prices fell by 2.8 percent this year.
	   Spurred by the increased spending, the economy grew by 9 percent
in the fourth quarter of the year, according to an estimate by the
Statistical Bureau.
	   Average urban incomes grew 6.6 percent to 5,454 yuan (dlrs 659)
per person in 1998, while rural incomes were up 4 percent to an
average of 2,150 yuan (dlrs 260).
	   Real utilized foreign investment for the year fell 16 percent to
dlrs 54 billion, according to the government figures.
	   Ye blamed the decline on the Asian financial crisis, which has
hurt Japan, South Korea and other key investors.
	   Foreign companies also have become more reluctant to invest in
China because of dissatisfaction with low profits.
	   The Statistical Bureau acknowledged significant problems at
state industries, reporting that total losses were 25.8 percent
higher this year than in 1997.
	   ``Market demand remains insufficient, while production capacity
is in serious oversupply,'' said Ye. ``Economic efficiency remains
relatively poor.''

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Ticket sales for Japan's year-end lottery rose for
the first time in four years, as many Japanese gambled on one last
chance for something to cheer about in a year filled with miserable
economic news.
	   Sales of ``Jumbo'' lottery tickets rose to 215.5 billion (dlrs
1.87 billion), up 6 percent from a year ago, the company that sells
the tickets, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., said Wednesday. The sales
figure was short of the record of 244.3 billion yen (dlrs 2.12
billion) set in 1994, the bank said.
	   The increase in lottery sales reflected people's hopes for a big
win amid the nation's deepening recession, said Satoshi Oda,
spokesman for Dai-Ichi Kangyo.
	   Japan is mired in its worst recession since the end of World War
II, with unemployment at a record high.
	   Tickets for the year-end lottery cost 300 yen (dlrs 2.6) each.
The first prize is 60 million yen (dlrs 521,000), an amount that
would buy a 100-square-meter (1,125 square feet) home in a Tokyo
suburb.
	   The drawing for the grand prize will be held Thursday at noon
and will be televised nationally.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada on Wednesday
formally approved a 1999 budget of 579.5 billion pesos (dlrs 14.8
billion), which he said would allow the Philippine economy to
recover from Asia's financial crisis.
	   ``With this expenditure program, we will be able to give our
economy the push it needs to get out of the danger zone and set it
firmly on the path of steady growth,'' Estrada said.
	   He said nearly 68 percent of the budget would be spent for
social services, infrastructure in rural areas and the development
of agriculture which would help the country register a gross
national product growth of 3.0 to 3.5 percent next year.
	   The Philippine economy suffered a slowdown this year due to the
effects of the regional financial turmoil, a severe drought and a
series of killer typhoons that devastated key agricultural regions.
	   Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno said that with better weather
and more rainfall forecast next year and funding for projects aimed
at boosting agricultural production, the government's economic
targets could be attained.
	   Estrada said changes have been made in budgetary disbursement
procedures to avoid corruption and allow the prompt payment of
financial obligations. Details of major budget releases would be
posted on the Internet for transparency, he said.
	   The Department of Education, Culture and Sports got the highest
appropriation amounting to 88.3 billion pesos (dlrs 2.26 billion),
followed by the defense department with 51.7 billion (dlrs 1.32
billion) and the Department of Public Works and Highways with 38.2
billion pesos (dlrs 979 million), Diokno said.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea will abolish its
20-year-old import ban on an assortment of Japanese cars and other
industrial goods by June next year, government officials said
Wednesday.
	   South Korea currently bans the import of 48 Japanese products,
including many types of cars, as part of its effort to protect
domestic industries and fight a chronic trade imbalance with Japan.
	   South Korea will begin Thursday by first lifting the ban on 32
products, including station wagons with 1- to 1.5-liter engine
capacity, jeeps with over 1.5-liter gasoline engines, as well as
camcorders, copy machines and audio components.
	   The remaining 16 items _ such as sedans, color televisions, cell
phones and station wagons with less than 3-liter engine capacity _
will be freed from the import ban on June 30 next year, said the
Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy.
	   ``In the long run, the decision will likely increase our trade
deficit with Japan,'' said Choi Chul-woo, a ministry official. ``It
will most likely affect domestic car, electronic home appliances
and machine tool industries.''
	   But with the country's imports remaining sluggish amid an
economic crisis, the Japanese products newly exempt from the ban
will pose little immediate competition to domestic manufacturers,
Choi said.
	   South Korea imposed the ban in 1978 to control a chronic trade
deficit with Japan, which had provided up to 40 percent of all
South Korean imports in the 1970s.
	   The ban helped South Korea to reduce its dependence on its
neighbor for imports to around 24 percent in the 1990s. But its
trade deficit with Japan has kept increasing _ from dlrs 2.8
billion in 1980 to dlrs 13 billion last year.
	   Tokyo has complained that the restrictions are an unfair trade
practice, and Seoul has been gradually lifting the ban, reducing
the number of goods prohibited.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nomura Securities Co., Japan's biggest brokerage,
will cut 650 overseas jobs next year as part of a major
restructuring campaign, a company official said Wednesday.
	   Facing massive losses in its overseas operations, the company
will shed nearly 20 percent of its work force in Europe and the
Americas and close some overseas offices, Nomura representative
Kimizo Hayakawa said.
	   At the same time, the company will hire 50 new employees in Asia
outside Japan to strengthen securities operations in Taiwan and the
Philippines, he said.
	   As of the end of September, Nomura employed 4,600 people outside
Japan, including 1,400 in North and South America and 2,300 in
Europe.
	   Through the planned job cuts, to be carried out by March 1999,
the company hopes to reduce fixed overseas costs by 30 billion yen
(dlrs 259 million), targeting overseas businesses that sustained
big losses in the first half of fiscal 1998.
	   Nomura announced in October that it would cut 2,000 jobs from
its 13,000-strong domestic work force by 2001 and close about 20
percent of its Japanese retail outlets to cope with the nation's
economic recession.
	   At that time, the company reported 207.2 billion yen (dlrs 1.76
billion) in losses, mostly from foreign operations, for the first
half of fiscal 1998.

Indonesian president orders end to Suharto investigation before
</HEADLINE>
June
 &UR; With Indonesia-Corruption

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie on Wednesday
ordered state prosecutors to wrap up their corruption investigation
of former authoritarian leader Suharto before national elections in
June.
	   The statement was unlikely to appease student protesters who
have been pressing for an immediate trial of Suharto, who quit in
May after riots and protests against his rule.
	   Critics believe Habibie, whose career in the government
flourished under the tutelage of his predecessor, is too
compromised to push hard for a thorough investigation of the wealth
of 77-year-old Suharto.
	   Suharto is alleged to have helped his six children build
business empires by granting them tax breaks, government contracts
and other official perks. He denies any wrongdoing.
	   Habibie gave a deadline for the investigation one day after the
government announced that corrupt business practices, largely by
the family and associates of Suharto, cost Indonesia as much as
dlrs 580 million over the last five years.
	   ``The president has today instructed state officials to
accomplish the investigation of former President Suharto before the
general election in June,'' Information Minister Yunus Yosfiah said
after a Cabinet meeting.
	   Habibie scheduled the parliamentary elections as part of a
program of political reforms, but students say he is not moving
fast enough on democratic change.
	   Also Tuesday, Attorney General Andi Mohamad Ghalib warned
witnesses in the Suharto case that they could face charges if they
give misleading information to prosecutors.
	   Suharto's credibility was eroded in part by allegations of
official graft at a time when Indonesia's economy was buckling
under the worst financial crisis in decades. Millions of people
have lost their jobs and inflation has soared.

Purdue 37, No. 4 Kansas State 34
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS touchdown distance in 3rd graf to 24-yard &QL; 
 &UR; By KELLEY SHANNON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN ANTONIO (AP) _ Maybe Kansas State was right. It didn't
belong in the Alamo Bowl after all.
	   The unranked Purdue Boilermakers shocked the No. 4 Wildcats
37-34 Tuesday night, using an incredible last-minute scoring drive
to embarrass a team that was once close to a shot at the national
championship.
	   After losing a 14-point lead in the final quarter and letting
the Wildcats jump ahead 34-30, Purdue used just 54 seconds for the
game-winning drive, capped by Drew Brees' 24-yard pass to Isaac
Jones with 30 seconds left.
	   It was a bitter ending for Kansas State (11-2), which felt
snubbed at not getting an invitation to a top-tier bowl after being
knocked out of the national title picture with a 36-33
double-overtime loss to Texas A&AMP;M in the Big 12 championship.
	   In fact, the Wildcats seemed to play the first three quarters as
if they resented even being in this game.
	   Quarterback Michael Bishop lost a fumble and threw four
interceptions, but also threw an Alamo Bowl-record 88-yard
touchdown pass to Darnell McDonald with 6:23 remaining. With 1:24
left, Bishop tossed a 2-yard touchdown pass to Justin Swift as
Kansas State went ahead 34-30, completing a comeback that brought
30,000 purple-clad fans to their feet.
	   Purdue scored 17 points off Wildcats fumbles, and Kansas State
stayed in touch only because it scored its first two touchdowns
after recovering bad snaps on Purdue punt attempts. The Wildcats
got the ball on the 1 after the first and recovered the second in
the end zone.
	   The offense didn't produce a touchdown until three minutes into
the fourth quarter on David Allen's 3-yard run that got Kansas
State back into the game at 27-20.
	   A 37-yard field goal by Purdue's Travis Dorsch put the
Boilermakers ahead 30-20 with 6:44 left.
	   Kansas State answered on the next play with Bishop's 88-yard
touchdown pass to Darnell McDonald, moving the Wildcats to within
30-27 with 6:23 to play.
	   Purdue dominated Kansas State like no team had this season. The
Boilermakers made the most of Kansas State's two fumbles in the
second quarter and led 17-7 at halftime.
	   Kansas State, failing to score in the first quarter for the
first time this season, got on the board with 9:49 remaining in the
second after a bad snap that eluded Purdue punter Andy Standifer
gave Kansas State possession at the Boilermakers 1. K-State scored
on a 1-yard pass from Bishop to McDonald.
	   Brees was 25-of-53 for 230 yards and three touchdowns with three
interceptions, while Bishop was only 9-of-24 for 182 yards with
three touchdowns and four interceptions, matching his interception
total for the entire season.

Nice hotel, tours, beaches: Khmer Rouge leaders get VIP treatment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Relaxing in a luxury hotel and
planning tours and a beach holiday, two Khmer Rouge leaders basked
in VIP treatment Wednesday in the capital they emptied of people in
1975 to launch a reign of terror.
	   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea are widely believed responsible for
crimes against humanity. But since arriving Tuesday in Phnom Penh
to be greeted by Prime Minister Hun Sen under guarantees they will
not be prosecuted, they've been living the good life.
	   On Wednesday, they woke up in crisp sheets at Le Royal hotel, a
made-over colonial-era structure, had breakfast in the stylish Thai
restaurant and set about a busy day of meetings that included
Boutros Boutros-Ghali, a former U.N. secretary general.
	   Their families embarked on a tour of the capital in luxury cars,
viewing temples and palaces that they last saw 20 years ago when
the Vietnamese army toppled the Khmer Rouge regime.
	   In coming days, they plan to visit the historic Angkor temples
in the north, the Sihanoukville seaside resort in the south, and
their home provinces before settling in at an ex-stronghold,
Pailin.
	   Not all staff at Le Royal, where lodging runs from dlrs 120 to
dlrs 540 per night, are pleased at the lavish treatment.
	   ``I'm very disappointed,'' said a hotel security guard, speaking
on condition of anonymity for fear of losing his job. ``I don't
think soldiers who lost their legs to defend the country enjoy the
same treatment given to these people here.''
	   Well-groomed and neatly dressed, the leaders and their families
resemble upper-class urban Cambodians. In 1975, they would have
worn the black pajamas that became a revolutionary symbol.
	   The Khmer Rouge emptied Phnom Penh and all other cities after
taking power _ even forcing hospital patients onto the roads _ and
marched the populations at gunpoint to rural slave labor camps.
	   As many as 2 million people _ one Cambodian in five _ died of
overwork, starvation, disease or systematic executions.
	   The Khmer Rouge waged a long civil war after being ousted. Hun
Sen has justified pardoning surviving leaders in the interests of
peace, but the movement is extinct anyway and many feel the Khmer
Rouge are getting off too lightly.
	   ``It will set a bad precedent,'' said Chhay Yi Heang, dean of
philosophy at the University of Phnom Penh. ``Those who used to
kill will continue to kill in future because they will believe they
can be easily pardoned.''

 &UR; MARTINIQUE: Police unblock port _ again _ as workers continue
protest &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ Police on Tuesday cleared
angry banana workers from a back entrance of Martinique's main port
as exporters rushed to move shipments blocked for weeks by
protesters' barricades.
	   The workers continued to block the port's main entrance with a
weighted freight container. Police reported no injuries or arrests.
	   About 200 banana workers struck Nov. 21 to demand raises. They
agreed Dec. 19 to remove the barricades, but raised them again
after labor negotiations fell through on Dec. 22.
	   On Monday, police cleared the back entrance long enough for
freight companies to move about 300 containers of goods ranging
from clothing to groceries. As soon as they left, the protesters
resumed the blockade.
	   About 4,200 containers are stranded on the port, said
Jean-Claude Lubin, manager of the Martinique Chamber of Commerce.
He said the protesters struck as retailers were gearing up for the
lucrative holiday business season.
	   ``Several companies will face financial obstacles and file for
bankruptcy because of the strike,'' Lubin told the newspaper
France-Antilles.
	   Companies have lost about dlrs 200 million (1 billion French
francs) because of the barricades, said Daniel Robin, president of
the Regional Union of Small Companies.
	   On Dec. 18, hundreds of company managers gathered in front of
the government's prefecture offices to stage a counter-protest
against the workers.
 &UR; TRINIDAD: Fugitive suffocated in jetliner's wheel well, coroner
says
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Antiguan fugitive Trevor Jacobs
suffocated while stowing away in the landing gear well of a BWIA
jetliner, coroners in Trinidad said Tuesday.
	   Pathologist Ramnath Chandu Lal of the Trinidad Forensic Science
Center said Trevor Jacobs, a 30-year-old former police officer,
died from lack of air at high altitude during the flight from
Antigua to Trinidad.
	   Jacobs' frozen body was found Dec. 22 by workers doing
maintenance on the Lockheed 1011 in a hangar at Trinidad's Piarco
International Airport. It apparently had frozen in temperatures
near -40 degrees Fahrenheit (-40 degrees Celsius) at the airplane's
cruising altitude.
	   The flight began in Toronto, and police believe Jacobs climbed
aboard the aircraft during a stopover in Antigua.
	   Jacobs was wanted by Antiguan authorities on charges of
kidnapping 60-year-old Donna Pietracupa on Oct. 7. Pietracupa was
later released unharmed.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Referendum winners claim governor fudging results
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Opponents claim Gov. Pedro
Rossello, an advocate of U.S. statehood for Puerto Rico, is using
government ads to gloss over his defeat in a Dec. 13 referendum on
the issue.
	   The opposition Popular Democratic Party complained Tuesday to
the Puerto Rico Elections Commission and the Comptroller's Office
about State Department ads that imply statehood won.
	   ``The government of Pedro Rossello is demonstrating its
disregard for the democratic processes and the sentiment of the
majority of the people,'' Sen. Antonio Fas Alzamora said in the
newspaper El Nuevo Dia.
	   The ads claim that through the vote, the Puerto Ricans are
urging the U.S. Congress to end ``100 years of political
subordination'' and clear up the island's ambiguous relationship
with the United States.
	   It lists U.S. statehood coming in first with 728,157 votes,
followed by independence with 39,838 votes.
	   But the winner in the referendum was a ``none of the above''
protest vote backed by supporters of the status quo. It got 787,900
votes, or 50.3 percent, compared to 46.5 percent for U.S.
statehood.
	   The ads list the ``none of the above'' option at the bottom,
grouped with totals for ``null and void'' and ``blank ballots.''
	   Last week, the Elections Commission certified statehood's loss,
despite appeals from Rossello's New Progressive Party.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Bahamians arrested in drug bust
	   SALEM, New Hampshire (AP) _ Police seized more than four pounds
(two kilos) of cocaine and arrested three men as part of an
undercover drug bust in the northeastern state of New Hampshire.
	   Tracey Swann, 28, of Tallmadge, Ohio, and Meriden, Connecticut;
Maurice Barr, 30, of the Bahamas and Meriden; and Kendall
Barr-Smith, 28, of the Bahamas were arrested Monday night and
charged with selling cocaine, a felony.
	   They were being held on dlrs 250,000 cash bail each, pending
arraignment Tuesday in Salem District Court.
	   All three men were from the Bahamas, and state police were
working with the Immigration and Naturalization Service to figure
out their residency status. If convicted, they could be deported.
	   State police said a trooper was able to infiltrate the group of
large-scale drug traffickers.
	   After a month of undercover work, the trooper arranged to buy
two kilograms of cocaine, or 4.4 pounds, for dlrs 37,000 from
Swann, who acted as the middleman, state police narcotics officers
said.
	   Barr-Smith, the group's leader, got the drugs in the Bahamas and
arranged for them to be delivered to the United States through
Florida, state police said. Barr acted as the lookout man and
bodyguard.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Smuggled Cubans land in South Florida
	   MIAMI (AP) _ At least 35 more Cubans landed in Florida early
Tuesday, bringing to 117 the number of immigrants smuggled into the
United States since Friday.
	   Miami Beach police reported nine people ashore Tuesday in trendy
South Beach, said Border Patrol Assistant Chief Daniel Geoghegan.
Less than an hour later, police on Key Biscayne reported 20
arrivals. Monroe County officials called from the Florida Keys
about four hours after that to say that six Cuban men had been
found near Marathon.
	   ``They're all being smuggled professionally,'' Geoghegan said
Tuesday.
	   The 35, including some children, were taken to the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service's Krome Detention Center
west of Miami. Geoghegan said one boat was recovered, but officials
weren't immediately sure who owned it or who was operating it.
	   Earlier, 46 Cubans, 30 Haitians and six Jamaicans were been
picked up at eight sites from West Palm Beach to Key West in the
days just after Christmas.Twelve children were included among the
three groups.
	   One person required medical attention after complaining of chest
pains. All others were reported to be in good condition.
	   Miami Border Patrol Assistant Chief Keith Roberts would not say
how many alleged smugglers were among those caught, nor what
happened to the would-be immigrants. Immigrants pay thousands of
dollars to smugglers so they can reach the U.S. shore.
	   Last Tuesday, Border Patrol agents intercepted nine Haitians who
scrambled from a speedboat in a North Miami canal to a waiting
truck. Earlier this month, a speedboat overloaded with Cubans
capsized near the Florida Keys and 14 people drowned.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Local stocks rose in 1998 as interest rates dipped
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Stocks of publicly traded Puerto
Rican companies, most of them banks, soared in 1998 because of
lower interest rates, financial experts say.
	   The Puerto Rico Stock Index, a basket that includes most of the
public companies on the island, rose 36 percent during the year to
8,237 as of Dec. 24, the San Juan Star reported Wednesday.
	   But experts said the increases were due to the Federal Reserve
Bank's lowering of interest rates, since six of the 11 companies in
the index are banks.
	   ``It's not like the Dow, which is a representative sample of all
types of businesses,'' said Todd Savastano, branch compliance
manager for brokerage firm Samuel Ramirez and Co. ``When rates go
down, people refinance mortgages and banks make money. So this is
not really a good indicator of the economy in general.''
	   The largest gain during the year was CoreComm, the local branch
of Cellular One, which saw its stock price nearly quadruple from
dlrs 4.87 on Jan. 2 to dlrs 18.75 on Dec. 24.
	   Banks R &AMP; G Financial Corp. and Doral Financial Group saw their
stock prices rise 117 percent and 82 percent, respectively.
	   Firstbank of Puerto Rico posted a gain of 67 percent, while
competitors Popular Inc., WesternBank and Oriental Financial gained
between 16 and 27 percent each.
 &UR; SURINAME: President to visit Cuba Jan. 11
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ Surinamese President Jules
Wijdenbosch will visit Cuba on Jan. 11, the government announced
Tuesday.
	   Wijdenbosch, whose South American country is the second-poorest
in the Western Hemisphere after Haiti, is facing increasing
pressure to resign and has been seeking support from other leaders
in the region.
	   Cuba, meanwhile, has courted Suriname as part of its push to
become a member of the 15-member Caribbean Community trade group.
	   Wijdenbosch's visit is to ``contribute to the aim of deepening
the relationship'' between the two countries, the government said.
	   Cuban President Fidel Castro has been invited to Suriname next
year, it said.

Kyrgyzstan's new prime minister appoints Cabinet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Kyrgyzstan's new prime minister unveiled his
Cabinet on Wednesday, a week after the old government of the
Central Asian nation resigned, a news report said.
	   The previous Cabinet quit on Dec. 23 after President Askar
Akayev accused it of incompetence in dealing with the nation's
economic problems.
	   Prime Minister Zhumabek Ibraimov, himself approved by parliament
only days ago, appointed new ministers in trade, industry and
finance, among others, the Interfax news agency said.
	   A number of officials, including the ministers of national
security, foreign affairs, health and justice, all retained their
posts, according to Interfax.
	   Kyrgyzstan, a mountainous agricultural nation, posted modest
economic growth in 1998, according to government figures. But the
country suffers from high inflation, a trade deficit, and a
weakening currency, and has seen little economic development since
the 1991 Soviet breakup.

French unemployment rates falls to 11.5 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's unemployment rate dropped slightly to 11.5
percent in November, but nearly 3 million people remain without a
job, the Labor Ministry said Friday.
	   The number of unemployed fell to 2,940,800 in November down
4,700 from October, the Labor Ministry said. The jobless rate in
October had been 11.6 percent.
	   Young people less than 25 years old were the main winners,
although jobless over 50 also managed to find work, the ministry
said.
	   Unemployment is one of France's worst economic problems, with
joblessness among young people a major problem that has contributed
to a rise in crime and violence.

Shares down ahead of New Year break
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong closed lower
Wednesday in lackluster trading ahead of the year-end holidays.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 104.53 points, or 1 percent,
to close at 10,121.44.
	   Turnover climbed to 1.96 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
251 million) from Tuesday's 1.33 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 171 million).
	   Since last week, the Hang Seng has bounced in a narrow range
just above the benchmark 10,000-point support level. The Hang Seng
fell 0.5 percent on Tuesday.
	   The index rose as high as 10,266.21 early in the session,
following a rise in the futures market, but it slipped later as
investors sold shares for cash ahead of the long weekend.
	   The market closes for the year at midday Thursday and reopens
Monday.
	   A slight recovery in market volume showed that retail and
institutional investors were trying to sell their stock holdings
before the holidays, said Johnson Hui, research head at BOCI
Securities Ltd.
	   There was little buying interest ahead of the introduction of
the European Union's new single currency, the euro, which begins
trading on Monday, Hui said.
	   Among the most active blue chips, banking giant HSBC Holdings,
which dominates the index, lost 1.50 Hong Kong dollars to 195.50.
Its affiliate, Hang Seng Bank, also lost 1.50 to 69.50.
	   Property company Cheung Kong (Holdings) inched up 25 Hong Kong
cents to 56.75. But its associate Hutchison Whampoa closed down 25
cents at 54.50.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ They wrapped up the year's trading with a
ceremonial round of applause, but traders had little to clap about
Wednesday at the end of a gloomy 12 months on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
	   Stock prices fell in the last trading session of 1998, with the
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average down 4.73 points, or 0.03
percent, to finish at 13,842.17 points.
	   The average closed 1,416.57 points lower than last year's finish
of 15,258.74, a fitting end to a year in which the Japanese economy
sunk to new lows, unable to free itself from the worst recession in
decades.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the U.S. currency was lower
against the yen.
	   The dollar bought 115.20 yen in late trading, down 0.16 yen from
late Tuesday and below its late New York level of 115.53 yen
overnight.
	   On the stock exchange Wednesday, share prices fell as plunging
bond prices rekindled fears about recent turmoil in credit markets.
	   Trades remained extremely sparse as most investors were already
away for the New Year's holidays.
	   Still, the market got some support from an overnight rise on
Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average closed at
9,320.98 points, up 94.23.
	   When trading resumes on Jan. 4, investors will be closely
monitoring talks between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and
the opposition Liberal Party on forming a coalition government,
analysts said.
	   ``The domestic political and economic situations remain
uncertain,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, a general manager at Chuo
Securities.
	   The Japanese economy continues to falter, as shown by government
figures released last week showing retail sales and industrial
output slumping and unemployment at a new postwar high.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section closed down 1.84 points, or 0.17 percent, at
1,086.99. The TOPIX closed up 8.94 points, or 0.83 percent, the day
before.
	   An estimated 115.95 million shares changed hands Wednesday on
the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Advances outnumbered
declines 576 to 490, with 191 issues unchanged.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar remained in a narrow range amid
the year-end lull. Even a sharp drop in government bond prices did
not spur currency traders to action.
	   Many players were also holding back to await the Jan. 1 launch
of Europe's single currency, the euro.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond soared to 2.010 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.885
percent, the highest it has been in 15 1/2 months.
	   The bond's price, which moves in the opposite direction,
finished the year at 98.33 yen, down from 99.31 yen.

Four Westerners killed in bloody end to Yemen kidnapping

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemen was criticized on Wednesday after its
troops stormed the hideout of Islamic extremist kidnappers holding
16 Western hostages. Four of the hostages were killed.
	   Two other hostages were wounded during the siege near the
southern town of Mawdiyah, about 175 miles (280 kilometers) south
of the capital, San`a.
	   The remaining 10 hostages were freed unharmed. Three kidnappers
died.
	   Yemen's Interior Ministry blamed the kidnappers for the deaths
of the three Britons killed instantly and for the death of an
Australian who died later in a hospital. It said security forces
intervened after the kidnappers began killing the hostages.
	   ``They proceeded in killing the captives after refusing any
attempts at negotiations, which led security forces to storm the
area to prevent further bloodshed and ensure the safe release of
the rest of the hostages,'' a ministry statement said.
	   But British newspapers accused the Yemeni authorities of
premature intervention in the case. The Daily Mail asked on the
front page, ``Did your tourists really need to die?''
	   British Ambassador Vic Henderson reportedly had pleaded with the
San`a government to do nothing ``that in any way could jeopardize
the safety of the hostages.''
	   In San`a, Yemenis told journalists they were surprised the
government had intervened so quickly when it usually negotiated for
several days, if not weeks, in hostage situations, which are
frequent in Yemen.
	   A London-based Islamic human rights group on Tuesday said it had
contacted the kidnappers the night before and received assurances
they would not harm the hostages.
	   ``We hold the Yemeni government responsible for the deaths. The
way the authorities handled the situation was barbaric and
irresponsible,'' said a spokesman for the Islamic Observation
Center.
	   Kidnappings of foreigners occur often in Yemen, large parts of
which are run by lawless tribes, but until now the hostages usually
have been treated well and released unharmed.
	   But this was the first time an abduction was carried out by
Islamic extremists. Security officials said the kidnappers belong
to Islamic Jihad, many of whose leaders fought Russian troops in
Afghanistan. The group is believed to have about 200 members.
	   The 16 tourists, 12 Britons, two Americans and two Australians,
were kidnapped on Monday near Mawdiyah.
	   In London, the Foreign Office confirmed that three Britons _
Ruth Williamson, Margaret Whitehouse and Peter Rowe _ were killed,
but did not provide their ages or hometowns.
	   The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the
fourth victim was a 35-year-old man from Sydney whose name would
not be released until next of kin had been informed.
	   The tourists wounded in the clash were an American woman and a
British woman.
	   The surviving hostages were taken to a hotel in Aden, where they
were being helped by British and American volunteers, said David
Pearce, a British Embassy official in San`a.
	   ``They are obviously in a state of severe shock, and I mean
severe shock,'' Pearce told the British news agency Press
Association. ``They are uninjured but obviously very tired, very
stunned and in need of a good meal, a good rest and someone to talk
to. They have been through an awful experience.''
	   After the shootout, security forces detained scores of suspected
Islamic extremists, said the officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   At least three of the kidnappers were captured alive, the
Interior Ministry said. It said one of the kidnappers killed was an
unidentified Egyptian.
	   The kidnapping began Monday when the tourists' convoy of five
vehicles was ambushed by men who opened fire on their police
escorts. The kidnappers threatened to kill the tourists if the
police did not back off, Yemeni security officials said.
	   The kidnappers demanded the release of their leader, Saleh
Haidara al-Atwi, who was detained two weeks ago in a government
crackdown on Islamic vigilantes who had been enforcing strict
Islamic rules in southern Yemen, security officials said.
	   The kidnappers also wanted the release of another leader, the
officials said. They did not identify him.
	   Yemen said the governor of Abyan province, Ahmad Ali Mohsen, was
negotiating with leaders of the Al-Fadl tribe, to which the
kidnappers belong, before the shootout occurred.
	   Tribesmen usually kidnapped foreigners to pressure the
government into providing them with new roads, water or clinics.
	   Four Germans are being held by a tribe in northeast Yemen. The
kidnappers are demanding more schools, hospitals and telephone
lines in their area.
	   German diplomats have appealed to the Yemeni authorities not to
attempt to rescue the four German hostages being held by a tribe in
a different part of the country, Yemeni officials said Wednesday.

Sutton hopes 1998 was just the start
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Of the top 20 players on the PGA Tour money
list, no one played as many tournaments as Hal Sutton. He entered
30 events, and never took more than a two-week break.
	   Even when he was home, his clubs were not far away.
	   Why? Given the arduous climb from rock bottom of his career,
Sutton is driven by fear of another slide, something he can't
afford at age 40.
	   ``When I have two or three days in a row that I don't have
anything to do, that worries me,'' Sutton said recently during a
telephone interview. ``When the weather gets bad and I don't play,
I worry about that. I don't like taking golf for granted. I've
worked too hard.''
	   And it has paid off. Sutton is coming off his best season since
1983, when he won The Players Championship and the PGA
Championship, led the money list and was christened as the next
Jack Nicklaus.
	   After a slump so deep he had to use a one-time exemption to keep
his card, he won the Texas Open and the Tour Championship and
finished fifth on the money list with $1.8 million.
	   ``It made me appreciate being able to get back,'' he said.
	   Sutton compares his resurgence to someone who has lost a lot of
weight.
	   ``When you go to the trouble to do that, you're aware of what
you've been doing,'' he said. ``You've paid the price, and you're
not going to eat a piece of pie because it's there.''
	   Should there be another major in store for Sutton this year _
and his win at the Tour Championship certainly proved he's capable
of that _ 11 career victories would include two majors, The Players
Championship and the Tour Championship.
	   ``I'm going to set lofty goals and do things I haven't done
before,'' Sutton said. ``I haven't won a Ryder Cup, but I want to
make another team. My game hasn't been such that I was a factor in
any major championships, and I had some decent majors in the midst
of all of this. So that's a focal point in my mind.''
	   Sutton has not played since the Shark Shootout. He made the
Presidents Cup team, but withdrew when his father-in-law died of a
heart attack. His next tournament will be the Mercedes
Championships, but he's likely to throttle back on his schedule
early next year. His wife Ashley, pregnant with twins, is due the
first of the year.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; REVISIONIST MONTY: Even though he has won the European money
title a record six straight years, the knock on Colin Montgomerie
is that he has never won a major and never won on American soil.
	   The Scotsman can't deny he is 0-for-30 in the majors, but he
counts at least one victory in the United States _ his victory at
the Andersen Consulting World Championship of Golf last January in
Scottsdale, Ariz.
	   He also won individual honors at the World Cup of Golf, a team
event, at Kiawah Island, S.C. in November 1997.
	   ``The win at the Andersen Consulting event was important to me
because it represented my first big individual win in the States,''
Montgomerie wrote in a column for Golfweb. ``And it was all the
more important because I was able to beat golfers like Ernie Els
and Davis Love III in the process.''
	   Still, he advanced to the semifinals by winning three matches in
the European division at Buckinghamshire Golf Club in England.
Also, the Andersen field was 32 players, eight of those from Japan.
	   But when Montgomerie looks back on 1998, his highlights include
three wins in Europe, leading the Order of Merit and ``a season in
which I won for the first time on American soil.''
	   ``While I didn't win a major, nothing happened which suggests
that I can't go on to win one sometime in the future,'' he added.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; MAJOR ODDS: According to a London bookmaker, Tiger Woods is the
clear favorite to win the four major championships in 1999.
	   Ladbrokes lists Woods' odds of winning the Masters at 5-1, the
U.S. Open at 8-1 and both the British Open and the PGA Championship
at 9-1. No one else was listed at better than 14-1 in any of the
majors.
	   In fact, only David Duval, Lee Westwood and two-time U.S. Open
champion Ernie Els had odds better than 20-1 in any major. Duval,
the leading money-winner on the PGA Tour, is listed at 14-1 to win
the Masters and 16-1 in the other three, while Els was 14-1 to win
the British Open and 16-1 in the Masters, U.S. Open and PGA.
	   Westwood's odds are 14-1 in the U.S. Open, 16-1 in the Masters
and PGA and 20-1 in the British Open.
	   Masters and British Open champion Mark O'Meara is a 25-1
favorite to win any of the American majors, and 33-1 to win the
British Open. Greg Norman, who missed most of last year after
shoulder surgery, is listed at 33-1 to win the Masters or U.S. Open
and 40-1 to win either the British Open or PGA.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DIVOTS: The next time Annika Sorenstam is featured in Sports
Illustrated, it won't be in the Golf Plus section. The Swede will
be in next year's swimsuit issue, in a section devoted to famous
athletes modeling the latest swimming attire. ... Jim Furyk will
also turn into a model, although not swimsuits. He has signed a
three-year deal to represent the Johnnie Walker Collection, a
casual menswear line introduced in October, and will appear in its
advertising next year. ... Se Ri Pak donated $30,000 to the LPGA
Foundation for its Urban Youth Golf Program. It was the largest
single donation by an LPGA player to the program.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; STAT OF THE WEEK: Allen Doyle won the medalist honors at
Q-school for the PGA Tour and the Senior PGA Tour _ just two years
apart.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; FINAL WORD: ``He tried really hard and he was grinding to the
end.'' _ Annika Sorenstam on her husband, David Esch, who turned
pro to play the mixed-team JC Penney Classic. They finished 50th in
a 52-team field.

Sri Lanka yet to act on international mediation offers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Sri Lanka has yet to decide on
international mediation offers to settle the 15-year-old ethnic
conflict with Tamil Tiger rebels, President Chandrika Kumaratunga
was quoted Wednesday as saying.
	   But Sri Lanka will not again seek India's help, as it did in the
1980s when Indian troops became embroiled in the conflict and
ultimately withdrew after heavy casualties, she said.
	   Sri Lanka has received many offers from different countries and
international organizations. ``We will decide when the time
arises,'' Kumaratunga told a group of senior Indian journalists on
Tuesday.
	   She flew home Wednesday after three days in New Delhi during
which she signed an agreement setting up a free trade area between
the two countries.
	   Kumaratunga said her peace plan offering autonomy to the
country's nine provinces, including the Tamil-dominated north, was
widely favored by the people. But she accused the main opposition
party of blocking its adoption in Parliament, where she lacks the
required two-thirds majority.
	   Tamil rebels are fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils, accusing the majority Sinhalese of widespread
discrimination in education and jobs. More than 50,000 people have
been killed.
	   India's previous involvement in the conflict stems from its
geographic proximity and the fact that Sri Lankan Tamils share a
common language and culture with those living on the southern
India.
	   Asked about the possibility of resumption of peace process with
Tamil Tigers, Kumaratunga said the LTTE must agree to certain
conditions if the dialogue were to be resumed.
	   She didn't elaborate, but in a recent interview with Frontline
magazine she said the Tigers must agree to a time frame so that
negotiations will not drag on and allow the guerrilla army to
regroup. An earlier demand for the rebels to surrender some arms
has been dropped.
	   The last round of peace talks broke down after three months in
1995. Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 18.5 million
people.

Chinese eye doctor executed for killing police officer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ An eye doctor has been executed for killing and
dismembering a police official who had an affair with his wife in
what newspapers called one of southern China's most gruesome
murders.
	   Yang Li was taken to the execution grounds in Zhenjiang city on
Tuesday and shot, the state-run Yangcheng Evening News reported
Tuesday.
	   His wife, Gao Yuechun, was given a 15-year prison sentence for
helping him, the newspaper said.
	   The two were originally convicted a year ago, but the newspaper
gave no reason for the delay in carrying out the sentence. Although
appeals are automatic when death sentences are issued, they are
usually quick and rarely change the lower court verdict.
	   The couple were both eye doctors at a Zhenjiang hospital.
Newspapers previously gave the following account of the crime:
	   On New Year's Day of 1997, Yang learned from Gao that she was
having an affair with He Long, deputy head of a branch of the city
police department. Two days later, Yang had Gao lured He to their
home. Yang then used a cleaver to kill He, and the couple butchered
and cooked his remains.

	   LYON, France (AP) _ An Air France plane on a regular domestic
flight between Lyon and Nantes lost a wheel after takeoff Wednesday
but made an emergency landing safely, the Lyon airport said.
	   The Boeing 737-300 plane, with 59 people on board, landed at
Lyon-Satolas airport about 10:20 a.m. (0920 GMT), the airport said.
	   The flight, AF7863, was to have flown from Lyon to the western

Skipper died in friend's arms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ One survivor tells of how his friend
and skipper died in his arms from a heart attack in the flooded
cabin of a stricken Sydney-to-Hobart race yacht.
	   Another says he almost drowned as he struggled to free himself
from the deadly trap of a safety harness, which drowned a crewmate,
after a giant wave overturned their yacht.
	   Sailors Steve Walker and Rob Matthews were giving the first
accounts Wednesday of their nightmare hours on the Tasmanian
12-meter (40-foot) Business Post Naiad after it was disabled by
huge seas on Sunday night in Bass Strait during the annual race.
	   Four race sailors died and two are missing and presumed drowned.
	   Business Post Naiad owner-skipper Bruce Guy, 51, and crew member
Phil Skeggs, 35, who lived in the same street in the Launceston,
Tasmania suburb of Riverside, died.
	   An emotional Walker, who broke down several times, said the
weather steadily worsened during Sunday afternoon and night.
	   During the early evening, a massive breaking wave rolled their
boat 360 degrees.
	   The mast, windows and cabin were broken and four crew went over
the side in their harnesses but were rescued.
	   They sent out a mayday, which was acknowledged, cleared the
shrouds from the propeller and started their engine intending to
head for the closest land.
	   ``It was very difficult to keep on course dodging the waves,''
Walker said. ``We had two on deck in one-hour shifts, one giving
compass headings and the other steering.''
	   About 11 p.m. that night, another wave rolled the boat, but this
time it stayed upside down for four to five minutes.
	   Matthews, who was on deck shift with Skeggs, said: ``I was
trapped over the back of the boat in underneath the cockpit behind
the aft lifelines.
	   ``When the boat initially rolled I thought it would do like it
did the first time and just pop back up again. So for the first 10
to 15 seconds I made no attempt to unhook my harness because I
didn't want to leave the boat.
	   ``Then when it stayed inverted I started to try to get my
harness undone which I found really difficult even though I had the
hooks on my chest because I was being pulled every which way and I
was right at the end of the harness and I was using all my
strength.
	   ``I had nearly run out of breath when the boat was lifted by
another wave and I just sucked enough air to keep me going for
another 10 or 15 seconds, I don't know how long, and I forced the
harness off.
	   ``Then the back of the boat was only two feet behind me and I
popped to the surface and hung onto the ropes at the stern. I am
the luckiest man alive.''
	   Skeggs, in a similar situation, could not free himself.
	   Walker, Guy and the five other crew were below decks and upside
down.
	   ``We heard Rob calling for Phil,'' Walker said. ``We didn't hear
Phil answer and couldn't do anything.
	   ``Then another huge wave righted the boat leaving about a meter
of water below decks _ Bruce was beside the main hatchway,'' Walker
said.
	   ``As he tried to get up he had a (heart) seizure and died in my
arms and I tried to keep him above the water.''
	   The shocked crew battened the boat down and rode the night out
below decks.
	   ``Below decks was horrendous,'' Walker said. ``There was flotsam
everywhere and the water was surging like being on a surf beach.''
	   About 3 am. more massive waves washed away the liferafts which
had been lowered to one side of the boat.
	   ``We were too exhausted to do anything about it,'' Walker said.
``Everyone was bashed and bruised.''
	   A search aircraft found them at 7.30 am. Monday and about half
an hour later a helicopter winched the seven survivors to safety.
	   The two bodies were secured on the boat and left.
	   ``We didn't want to leave Phil and Bruce but we were glad to get
off that boat,'' Walker said.
	   The boat, with the two bodies aboard, was towed to shore on
Wednesday. (djp)

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk refused
Wednesday to approve amnesty for two leaders of the genocidal Khmer
Rouge, setting up a collision course with his prime minister, who
has pledged to shield them from trial.
	   The refusal undermines a deal Prime Minister Hun Sen has struck
with Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea to allow them to defect and give
up to his government with assurances they will not be tried for
their roles in the deaths of as many as 2 million people.
	   ``Taking into account the very wide and undeniable discontent of
the majority of the Khmer people, I announce to this majority that
I respect them and will not renew my power of amnesty for major
Khmer Rouge criminals,'' the king said.
	   Sihanouk, 76, receiving medical treatment for several ailments
in Beijing, made the comments in his palace bulletin.
	   However, Hun Sen is Cambodia's most powerful man and his will
amounts to law. He controls the judiciary and security services and
could simply accord the pair a de facto pardon, possibly through
the pliant court system.
	   The popular king's stance will make a pardon less legitimate in
the eyes of the world and many Cambodians. But Sihanouk is largely
a figurehead and has no way to enforce his will.
	   The Khmer Rouge won a civil war in 1975 and turned the country
into a huge slave labor camp. One person in five perished of
overwork, starvation, disease and systematic executions. They were
ousted by a Vietnamese invasion in 1979 but waged a long guerrilla
war.
	   Two years ago, the government pressured a reluctant Sihanouk to
break the stalemate by granting amnesty to a Khmer Rouge chieftain,
Ieng Sary, in exchange for making peace.
	   Ieng Sary led thousands of guerrillas out of combat and the
movement is now all but extinct. Many now question Hun Sen's
assertion that amnesty is needed for Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea to
prevent a slide back into civil war.
	   Sihanouk said that an international tribunal would have ``the
perfect right to take up the case of genocide in Cambodia, because
it concerns crimes against humanity.''
	   ``From now on, I leave all the responsibility to Hun Sen of
handling this unfortunate and dramatic affair of pardons accorded
to the Khmer Rouge,'' Sihanouk said. ``I will sign no more decrees
concerning the Khmer Rouge.''
	   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, both members of the inner circle of
the late Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot, have basked in VIP treatment
at a luxury hotel since coming to Phnom Penh on Tuesday to cement
their deal with Hun Sen. Ieng Sary is with them.
	   Their families are touring the temples and palaces of a capital
emptied at gunpoint in 1975, when the Khmer Rouge forced Cambodians
into rural slave labor camps. Visits to the historic Angkor
complex, their home provinces and a seaside resort are also
planned.
	   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea told a news conference Tuesday they
were ``very sorry'' for the Khmer Rouge terror but refused to
accept personal responsibility. Khieu Samphan said: ``Let bygones
be bygones.''
	   Eam Chan, 55, one of the handful of survivors from the infamous
Tuol Sleng torture center where perhaps 20,000 people were
brutalized before being executed, said the apology can't erase his
suffering.
	   Accused of being a U.S. spy, Eam Chan was subjected to daily
torture by electroshock and asphyxiation.
	   ``The Cambodian people cannot forget that so easily,'' Eam Chan
said. ``As a victim, my mind cannot be at rest without seeing the
prosecution of these people, because the suffering was
indescribable.''
	   On Wednesday, Khieu Samphan met Boutros Boutros-Ghali, former
United Nations secretary general, who is in Cambodia to promote the
French language as head of the International Francophone
Organization.
	   The Cambodia Daily newspaper quoted Boutros-Ghali as saying
Tuesday that he did not support the formation of an international
tribunal to try the Khmer Rouge leaders.
	   That clashes with the mission of a U.N. team dispatched by the
present secretary-general, Kofi Annan, to Cambodia recently to
assess the possibility of creating such a tribunal.
	   ``My personal view is that this is a Cambodian problem,''
Boutros-Ghali was quoted as saying. ``The U.N. should not interfere
in the affairs of member countries.''

Khmer Rouge apologies not enough for man brutally tortured

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ One of the handful of survivors from
a Khmer Rouge torture center where perhaps 20,000 people were
brutalized said Wednesday that the ``sorry'' offered by two rebel
leaders trying to defect can't erase his suffering.
	   Eam Chan, 55, was once an inmate at Tuol Sleng, the infamous
high school that the Maoist revolutionaries turned into a crude
prison and torture center after seizing power in Cambodia in 1975.
	   The crumbling buildings, still hung with rusted barbed wire and
furnished with the iron beds victims were strapped to, stands as a
museum commemorating the estimated 2 million Cambodians who died in
the Khmer Rouge genocide.
	   ``The Cambodian people cannot forget that so easily,'' said Eam
Chan, a sculptor. ``As a victim, my mind cannot be at rest without
seeing the prosecution of these people, because the suffering was
indescribable.''
	   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, members of the inner circle of
notorious Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot, are being received in Phnom
Penh as VIPs by Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has vowed to shield
them from prosecution from crimes against humanity.
	   Hun Sen reasoned that absolving them is necessary to end the
last vestiges of civil war the Khmer Rouge waged after being ousted
in 1979 by a Vietnamese invasion. Many Cambodians disagree and King
Norodom Sihanouk said Wednesday he would not approve amnesty.
	   Neither does Eam Chan, who lost eight family members.
	   Eam Chan expressed anger at Khieu Samphan's remarks at a news
conference Tuesday that he was ``very sorry'' and his urgings to
``let bygones be bygones.''
	   ``So much blood was shed,'' Eam Chan said. ``One word `sorry'
means nothing. I don't understand why these people are being given
freedom so quickly.''
	   Eam Chan was arrested in 1976 and accused of being a U.S. spy.
He spent more than two years in different prison camps before being
sent to Tuol Sleng.
	   Eam Chan said he was subjected to daily torture by electric
shock or asphyxiation. If he blacked out, he was revived and
tortured again.
	   One technique was to tie him to a table and cover his face with
a wet rag. Water was dripped on it, causing him to slowly
suffocate.
	   When an invading Vietnamese army reached Phnom Penh in January
1979, the Tuol Sleng wardens fled, leaving seven sickly prisoners
still alive.
	   Eam Chan was in one of the last groups sent to be executed at a
killing field outside the capital. But the procession was shelled
and Eam Chan was able to escape as his captors scrambled for
safety.
	   ``The Khmer Rouge will not be truly finished unless these people
are tried,'' Eam Chan said. ``If they aren't, I'm afraid they will
return to their past practices.''

New Year festivities muted in areas of Christian-Hindu clashes

<TEXT>
	   MULCHAND, India (AP) _ With a dozen churches in ruins, Christian
congregations in western India are canceling New Year prayers this
year, fearful of provoking more violence from radical Hindus on an
anti-missionary crusade.
	   In the last five days, Hindu and Christian villages in the dry
hills of Gujarat have become increasingly antagonistic toward one
another.
	   The troubles also are rebounding against the governing Hindu
nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which is facing demands to
protect the Christian minority from its affiliated Hindu parties.
Its hard core supporters say missionaries are bribing poor Hindus
_sometimes by offering them jobs_to become Christian. The
missionaries deny this.
	   In the latest incidents, two Christian prayer halls in southern
Gujarat were razed Tuesday. Since Friday, 17 churches, prayer halls
or Christian schools have been attacked by mobs wielding axes, iron
bars, hammers and stones.
	   In Mulchand, a village of just 500 people, gold and silver
Christmas tinsel hangs from the charred mud-tiled roof of the
Protestant church. Flags of saffron, an auspicious color in
Hinduism, fly from many of the thatched huts where Hindus live.
	   ``We usually have a big New Year service just like the Christmas
service. This year we're afraid to pray publicly,'' said Avinash
Prabhakar. About one-fourth of the people are Christians in
Mulchand, a farming village 130 kilometers (80 miles) from the
nearest city, Surat.
	   Harish Armali, a Hindu, said the damage to Mulchand is deep and
permanent. ``There will be no peace now. We cannot be together
after this, our ties are severed,'' said Armali, who said Christian
schools required pupils to read from the Bible.
	   The small chapel in nearby Jamalpada was one of the first
sanctuaries stormed. Bamboo poles prop up wooden beams, and smashed
tiles lie on the ground. The only wall left standing is adorned
with a paper crucifix _ once the backdrop of the altar.
	   Hansa Parmar, 10, saw a mob hurling stones at an empty Christian
boarding school. ``I first thought it was raining stones. Then I
got very scared of their shouting. Why do they want to chase us
away?''
	   The trouble began Christmas Day when Hindus attending a rally
hurled insults at Christian women returning from a prayer meeting
in the town of Ahwa. Stones began flying in both directions.
	   An anti-missionary call was taken up at a convention of the
extremist Vishwa Hindu Parishad. On Sunday, Ashok Singhal, leader
of the VHP which stands for World Hindu Council, accused
missionaries of converting gullible, illiterate tribespeople with
promises of jobs or financial gain.
	   Fear of missionaries is deeply embedded in India, and
anti-missionary actions flare up periodically. The conversion of
Hindus is seen as a continuing legacy of British colonial rule. At
the same time, competition is stiff for places in private ``convent
schools,'' which teach in English and are considered superior to
government schools.
	   Private Christian schools are normally open to anyone who can
pay the relatively high fees and does not object to the Christian
orientation, which may include regular prayers and classes in
ethics.
	   While convent schools are coveted by the urban elite,
missionaries are most active among rural indigenous tribes and low
caste Hindus. Christians are 2.5 percent of India's population of
nearly 1 billion.
	   Some priests, speaking on condition on anonymity, said many
conversions do take place in remote villages, but they denied
resorting to bribes or inducements.
	   In Mulchand, Nanubhai Zhugrabhoy said some people turned to
Christianity after they were cured of debilitating diseases, from
tuberculosis to alcoholism. ``I am the only Christian from a Hindu
family. When I was ill I came to the church and found help. Then I
took on this religion.''
	   Preetesh Rangdeve, 20, whose father converted to Christianity
years ago, said missionaries had helped low caste Hindus with
education and employment. ``Now the people who neglected villagers
for years are telling them to come back and become Hindus,'' he
said.
	   Economic and social interests are also at stake, because upper
caste Hindus fear they will lose the advantage they have over the
illiterate lower castes, say some missionaries.
	   ``They are not attacking us for our religion. They are against
us because we educated the lower castes. This is a caste war,''
said the Rev. Oscar Barreto, a Roman Catholic priest.

Turkish troops kill 10 Kurdish rebels in southeast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DIYARBAKIR, Turkey (AP) _ Troops killed 10 Kurdish rebels in
clashes in southeastern Turkey, authorities announced Wednesday.
	   The clashes between the Turkish army and rebels of the Kurdistan
Workers Party, or PKK, took place in the provinces of Diyarbakir
and Batman. Authorities did not say when the fighting took place.
	   Despite pledges to end violence by PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan,
fighting continues in the southeast, where the rebels have been
waging a 14-year-old war for autonomy.
	   Ocalan was detained in Rome last month. Turkey, which holds him
responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of people, wants
him extradited for trial on terrorism charges, but Italy says it
cannot extradite him because Turkey has the death penalty.
	   On Tuesday, the National Security Council, which includes
Turkey's top civilian and military leaders, reiterated its
determination to fight the PKK.

Yeltsin calls for program to combat extremism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin called Wednesday for the
government to combat political and religious extremism in the wake
of several anti-Semitic outbursts by Russian politicians.
	   Yeltsin issued instructions to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
and several other senior officials, calling on them to draw up a
program to oppose extremism, presidential spokesman Dmitry
Yakushkin told Russian news agencies.
	   The brief reports did not specify what sorts of measures Yeltsin
envisioned.
	   Several Communist Party leaders have made anti-Semitic remarks
in recent months, and a number of smaller political movements
routinely preach anti-Semitism.
	   Many mainstream politicians, as well as religious leaders and
human rights activists, have denounced the remarks by the Communist
Party officials. Several prominent Russian businessmen and
politicians have even called for banning the Communist Party,
saying it had evolved into fascism.
	   Russian authorities have said they are investigating the
anti-Semitic statements, but have not prosecuted any of the
Communist officials.
	   Meanwhile, Yeltsin also planned to meet Wednesday with his chief
of staff Nikolai Bordyuzha at Gorky-9, the country residence
outside Moscow where Yeltsin has spent much of his time in recent
months.

Philippine president says it's too late to stop execution of rapist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada said
Wednesday he would not grant a last-minute reprieve to a convicted
rapist who is set to be executed by lethal injection next week.
	   ``It's too late, it's too late,'' Estrada said when asked if
there was still a possibility of stopping Monday's execution of Leo
Echegaray, who has been convicted of repeatedly raping a
10-year-old stepdaughter.
	   ``As I said, he committed this crime not because of poverty but
because of his animal instinct, so that's unforgivable, especially
to a little girl. I cannot forgive that,'' Estrada told reporters.
	   Echegaray's execution, the first to be scheduled since capital
punishment was restored in the Philippines in 1994, has triggered a
debate among many Filipinos over the death penalty.
	   Last Monday, Echegaray's lawyer petitioned the Supreme Court to
defer the execution while lawmakers review the law that restored
capital punishment. The court justices are on recess and it's not
clear whether a decision could be expected before Monday's
execution.
	   In recent weeks, several senators and congressmen have expressed
doubts about whether capital punishment will deter crimes and filed
resolutions seeking a review of the law that reimposed the death
penalty.
	   The Vatican, the European Union and Canada also recently sent
appeals to the Philippine government to abolish capital punishment,
arguing that death penalty would not reduce widespread crime.
Estrada has turned down the appeals.
	   Authorities in the national penitentiary in suburban Muntinlupa,
where Echegaray is detained with more than 800 other death row
convicts, have been carrying out mock executions in recent days.
	   They also have strengthened security around the prison and
prepared barbed wire roadblocks to control expected protests by
anti-death penalty groups.
	   Prison chaplain Roberto Olaguer said an all-night prayer vigil
will be held outside the penitentiary on the eve of the execution
by groups opposing capital punishment.
	   Between 1924 and 1976, the Philippines executed 84 people.
	   In 1987, a new constitution abolished the death penalty but gave
Congress the option of restoring it for ``heinous'' crimes such as
murder, kidnapping for ransom, rape and drug trafficking.
	   Legislators, alarmed by a rise in crime, took that option,
bringing back the death penalty in 1994.
	   Many Filipinos say the death penalty will deter criminals, and
that crime has become rampant because no one has been executed in
recent years.
	   Roman Catholic bishops and other civic groups opposed to the
death penalty say there is no proof of the deterrent effect. They
claim that poor people are more likely to be sentenced to death
because they cannot afford good lawyers.

Ukraine's privatization revenues in 1998 far below target
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine has raised less than half of its
planned privatization revenues in 1998, partly because of problems
caused by Russia's financial crisis, a news report said Wednesday.
	   The State Property Fund had channeled 422 million hryvna (dlrs
123 million) to the state budget as of Tuesday, far below the 1
billion hryvna (dlrs 292 million) the government originally planned
for the year, according to the fund's acting chairman, Vadym
Vasyliev.
	   Vasyliev said privatization efforts this year were hindered by
neighboring Russia's financial crisis, which sent aftershocks into
Ukraine's economy and scared foreign investors away from its shaky
financial markets.
	   Still, privatization results were better than in previous years.
	   The government received only 70 million hryvna (dlrs 20 million)
from state property sales in 1997, Vasyliev said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   He said the government hopes to draw investors back to Ukraine
next year by offering them controlling stakes in several
enterprises.
	   Vasyliev did not name the companies, but was apparently
referring to the former Soviet republic's energy giants, which the
government was preparing to sell this year. The sale was delayed
because of the financial crisis.
	   Ukraine also wants to sell its telecommunications monopoly, but
preparations for the auction are not expected to be complete until
2000.
	   The government has set its privatization revenue target at 800
million hryvna (dlrs 233 million) for 1999.

Pakistani authorities allow Bhutto to travel abroad on court order

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani authorities allowed former
prime minister Benazir Bhutto to board a Dubai-bound flight on
Wednesday, days after they barred her from leaving the country, an
official from her party said.
	   Bhutto left for Dubai on Wednesday, said Munawar Suharwardi, a
spokesman of Bhutto's Pakistan Peoples' Party.
	   On Monday, authorities prevented Bhutto from going to Dubai,
saying she may not leave because of corruption cases against her.
	   Lahore High Court on Tuesday gave permission for her to leave.
	   ``It is a victory of justice,'' Bhutto told reporters at the
airport.
	   Bhutto, the twice elected prime minister and the opposition
leader, has gone to Dubai to celebrate New Year with her three
children who are studying there.
	   Former president Farooq Leghari sacked Bhutto's government in
1996 under allegations of corruption and misrule. Bhutto and her
jailed husband Asif Ali Zardari face a number of corruption cases.
	   Bhutto has denied the charges and accuses Sharif of graft and of
victimizing the opposition.
	   There was no immediate comment from the government.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ While a DNA expert said in court
that seminal fluid stains on a mattress belonged to jailed
politician Anwar Ibrahim, hundreds of people gathered outside to
rally support for their fallen leader.
	   Many waited in the compound of a neighboring mosque. Still
others lined the opposite side of the riverbank flanking the
red-bricked courthouse.
	   Police holding 5-foot rattan canes cordoned off the back
entrance of the courtroom where Anwar was expected to be brought
out after the day's proceedings ended.
	   They began waving and shouting ``Reformasi'' _ the rallying cry
of Anwar's fledgling reform movement _ as the wife of Anwar's
private secretary, Shamsidar Taharin, walked out of the courtroom
and was driven away.
	   Shamsidar is alleged to have been one of Anwar's sex partners.
	   ``The police planted the DNA evidence,'' said a 26-year-old man
who asked not to be named, as he waved to Shamsidar, who was
accompanied by her husband. ``Anwar is innocent. Our spirits will
never give up.''
	   He said he dashed to the courthouse that afternoon to show
support for Anwar after hearing rumors that a state DNA expert
testified that several of the mattress stains contained DNA from
Anwar mixed with DNA from Shamsidar.
	   Minutes later, the crowd's sporadic cries became loud chants of
``Long live Anwar!'' as police hustled Malaysia's former No. 2 out
of the courtroom and bundled him into a blue jeep that whisked him
back to a prison south the capital.
	   The cheers continued as Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail and daughter
came out and went near the river. Azizah held a thumbs up to the
air, shook her fist and smiled.
	   As they drove off, Nurul Izzah, Anwar's 18-year-old daughter,
popped out from the family car's sun roof and joined in their cries
of ``reformasi.''
	   Anwar was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 2
after he was deemed morally unfit to lead the country. Police
arrested Anwar eighteen days later after he organized a mammoth
anti-government protest in the capital.
	   He is currently facing trial for abuse of power and will be
tried separately on charges of engaging in illegal sex acts,
including sodomy.
	   Anwar has denied all the accusations against him, saying they
were trumped up to undermine his challenge to Mahathir's 17-year
rule.

North Korea warns of possible suspension of tourism project
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea warned Wednesday it may
suspend South Korean tours to a scenic mountain on its east coast
because of a delay in payment for the project.
	   ``The Kumkang Mountain tour ... is now facing a grave
obstacle,'' the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency said
in a commentary, threatening a possible suspension of the project.
	   About 10,000 South Koreans have visited Kumkang (Diamond)
Mountain since Hyundai, South Korea's largest business
conglomerate, launched the unprecedented sightseeing cruise tours
Nov. 18.
	   The tourism deal, the largest joint venture between the divided
Koreas, called for Hyundai to pay dlrs 948 million to North Korea
over the next six years in return for the rights to organize the
tours and develop the mountain as a major resort park.
	   The first batch of dlrs 25 million should be paid by Thursday,
but so far Hyundai has paid only dlrs 5.8 million in cash and
Hyundai cars.
	   The Seoul government has blocked the remittance of the remaining
dlrs 19.2 million, saying the Hyundai-North Korean contract failed
to define how long Hyundai will be allowed to run the tourism
project.
	   Hyundai said it was asking North Korea to help put down the
details. Hyundai wants to have a 30-year exclusive right to develop
the mountain.
	   But North Korea said it did not want such a clear-cut condition
because it assumes that the two Koreas will remain divided for 30
more years, and disappoints people longing for an early
reunification.
	   South Korean officials feared that North Korea may be trying to
create a loophole in the contract in order to suspend or rescind
the project in case tension flares up between the two Koreas.
	   The Korean Peninsula was divided into the communist North and
the capitalist South in 1945.

Eritrea demands investigation into death of nationals detained in

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Eritrea has demanded an investigation
into the deaths of two of its nationals held for months in
detention camps in Ethiopia set up after the eruption of a violent
border dispute in May.
	   Mohammed Said Abdulbeker Idris died of jaundice and other
complications in early December and Mohamedzeyen Said Kahsay died
Nov. 25 of pulmonary tuberculosis in hospital in southwestern
Ethiopia, according to Iternational Committee of the Red Cross
death notifications sent to the Eritrean government.
	   The Eritrean Foreign Ministry said the two men, both in their
mid-thirties, were ``detained illegally'' in the Blatein detention
center in southwestern Ethiopia and died of ``inhuman treatment and
lack of medical attention.''
	   Ethiopia maintains it has detained only Eritreans suspected of
assisting the Eritrean war effort.
	   In October, three other Eritrean detainees died at the Blatein
camp, according to the Red Cross.
	   Tesfamariam Tekeste, a senior Foreign Ministry official said
Ethiopia maintains detention centers for Eritreans throughout the
country.
	   The ministry called on Ethiopia to release all Eritrean
civilians.
	   The Red Cross will not comment on because it could hamper the
agency's ability to assist those in detention.
	   Hostilities erupted between Ethiopia and Eritrea in May over
disputed border areas, resulting in the deaths of hundreds in two
weeks of heavy fighting.
	   Since then, tensions have simmered along the 990-kilometer
(620-mile) border, where forces massed on both sides exchange
sporadic artillery fire. Each government has accused the other of
deporting tens of thousands of their nationals.
	   Eritrean officials charge that an estimated 700 to 1,000
Eritreans are being deported from Ethiopia each week.
	   Ethiopian government spokeswoman Selome Tadesse said Tuesday
that only family members of suspected Eritrean spies had been
expelled in the last three weeks, but an Ethiopian government
source said on condition of anonymity confirmed close to 1,000 had
been deported each of the past three weeks.
	   Selome said Ethiopia has expelled an estimated 10,000, while
Eritrea claims that figure is as high as 45,000.

Malaysian activist lashes out at prime minister, Anwar trial

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A top Malaysian activist on Wednesday
reiterated his call for the removal of Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad _ but said Malaysia needs even broader reforms to avoid
sliding deeper into a political and economic morass.
	   Tian Chua, who recently got out of jail after his latest arrest
without charge, also called the sex-and-corruption case against
sacked deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim a ``comedy'' that is
amusing the populace at a time when Malaysians should be focusing
on broader issues.
	   Tian said the only way out of Malaysia's mess is a radical
shakeup of what he characterized as a corruption-ridden political
and legal system.
	   ``We must have a steady and constant change of new blood that
can guarantee transparency and accountability in government,'' said
Tian, chairman of Malaysia's opposition Coalition of People's
Democracy. Tian, 36, who was freed on bail Dec. 5, met Wednesday
afternoon with journalists in Hong Kong to discuss the human rights
situation in Malaysia.
	   Relaxed and soft-spoken, Tian said his interrogations by
Malaysian authorities were harsh, but he said he was only slightly
beaten, compared to some prisoners who were more severely abused.
He added that political detainees were placed in overcrowded cells
without access to clean water.
	   ``We were jailed with drug addicts and common criminals,'' Tian
said.
	   Tian's coalition, composed of 20 human rights and opposition
political groups, has demanded reform and protested against
Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   Tian said Mahathir may call snap elections within six months,
but Tian did not name an alternative political candidate that the
opposition would back.
	   Tian cautioned that Mahathir's removal alone would not ensure a
viable leadership. The immediate concern of the reform movement _
or ``reformasi'' as it is called _ was the abolition of laws that
restrict political freedoms.
	   ``We must look into the constitution itself so that civil and
human rights may be better integrated,'' Tian said.
	   Tian said the ongoing Anwar trial was a sham that the Malaysian
people found ``extremely amusing.''
	   ``The government is determined to sentence Anwar regardless of
what the independent courts say,'' Tian said.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar on Sept. 2 after deeming him morally unfit
to lead the country. Anwar was arrested on Sept. 20 and badly
beaten while in police custody.
	   Anwar now is on trial for abuse of power and will be tried
separately on charges of engaging in illegal sex acts, including
sodomy. Prosecutors are trying to prove Anwar had sex with the wife
of his former secretary, sodomized his family driver and abused his
powers to cover up the affairs.
	   Tian called for an independent judiciary that did not condone
intimidation of lawyers, a fair and honest electoral system, and an
investigation into the business practices of Malaysia's
politicians.
	   Because Asia's financial crisis shows little sign of abating,
Tian called for loosening the ties between the political and
financial communities to better position Malaysia for recovery.
	   ``Economic affairs must be as transparent as possible,'' Tian
said.
	   Tian also said the recently concluded summit of the 11-member
Association of Southeast Asian Nations did little to further a
reassessment of the organization's founding policy of
non-interference in each others' internal affairs.
	   ``Human rights and civil liberties transcend national borders,''
Tian said.

Israeli soldier killed in Lebanon, apparently by friendly fire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli soldier was killed and two were
wounded before dawn Wednesday when one Israeli army unit mistakenly
opened fire on another in southern Lebanon, radio reports said.
	   The army confirmed the casualties and said it was investigating
whether friendly fire was the cause.
	   The dead soldier was identified as Staff Sgt. Ohad Zach, 19,
from the northern village of Nofit.
	   Israel radio and Israel army radio said the incident occurred
when two units of soldiers on patrol lost contact with each other,
and one unit fired on the other.
	   The shooting occurred in Israel's self-styled security zone.
Israel has occupied the zone since 1985 to prevent cross-border
guerrilla attacks. With rising casualties, public pressure has been
mounting to withdraw Israel's 2,000 soldiers from Lebanon.
	   David Bar-Illan, a senior aide to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, said Zach's death, the 24th Israeli casualty in
Lebanon this year, did not affect the ongoing Cabinet debate over
withdrawal from Lebanon.
	   ``It does not change the need for safety of the people in the
Galilee,'' Bar-Illan said, referring to the section of northern
Israel that the security zone is designed to protect.
	   Bar-Illan denied that Israel is losing its edge in southern
Lebanon.
	   ``One soldier killed by friendly fire, if that was indeed the
case, doesn't indicate anything except that in one incident it was
a case of negligence,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Wednesday's incident was the second case of injuries apparently
from friendly fire this month. Zach was to be buried later
Wednesday.

Indonesian military warns of stern measures in case of looting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian military warned that it
might shoot looters if security deteriorates at the end of the
Islamic holy month of Ramadan, the official Antara news agency
reported Wednesday.
	   Every year, millions of people in predominately Muslim Indonesia
leave the cities to spend at least a week of holidays in their home
villages after fasting during Ramadan, which ends Jan. 18.
	   Last year, the period was marred by riots over food prices and
looting in many small towns as Indonesia's worst economic crisis in
decades kicked in. Inflation has soared and millions of people have
lost their jobs.
	   The Southeast Asian nation of 200 million endured deadly riots
this year that reached a peak in May shortly before the turbulent
ouster of former authoritarian President Suharto. Some 1,200 people
died in several days of violence in Jakarta.
	   Since then, ethnic and religious tensions have risen and student
protesters have been pressed for swifter political reforms in
sometimes violent demonstrations.
	   Lt. Gen. Fachrul Razi, a military security chief, said at least
50 places on the main island of Java and the tourist island of Bali
had been identified as possible areas of unrest during celebrations
to mark the New Year and the end of Ramadan.
	   Antara quoted Razi as saying Tuesday that soldiers would crack
down on criminals and rioters if they threatened the safety of
others. Measures included orders to shoot looters on the spot, he
said.
	   He said security forces were guarding highways on Java's
northern and southern coasts after reports that trucks carrying
goods had been looted. Troops will also be deployed in areas of
Jakarta and other cities where crime has been on the rise.
	   Brig. Gen. Togar Manatar Sianipar, a national police spokesman,
said police have arrested 175 people suspected of looting across
Java in recent weeks.
	   The transport ministry predicted that the number of people
returning to their hometowns next month will be 16,922,000, down 8
percent from earlier this year. Many cash-strapped people can no
longer afford to go to their villages.

Looming deadline sees flood of land claims in SAfrica
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Government officials have been
swamped by a flood of land claims ahead of a Thursday deadline to
reclaim property confiscated during white rule.
	   Officials at the Department of Land Affairs told the Cape Times
newspaper Wednesday that some regional offices had taken more than
1,000 calls in recent days from people seeking to press their
claims.
	   Land Affairs Director-General Geoff Budlender said the rush
would see a total of about 40,000 claims registered by the cut-off
point.
	   Colonial governments and then apartheid rulers confiscated the
best land for whites, crowding millions of blacks into tiny tribal
homelands unable to support such large populations.
	   During 1994's all-race elections which ended apartheid, the
prospect of giving land back to poor blacks was a key factor in
sweeping the African National Congress into power.
	   However, progress has been slow and dogged by legal
complications. So far only 27 claims have been processed by the
Commission on Restitution of Land.
	   Processing all the claims, some of which date back to 1913, is
expected to take at least five years.
	   Some black opposition politicians have criticized the slow
progress and called on the ANC to revoke the deadline.
	   ``Those who dispossessed our people did not have a time frame to
dispossess them,'' said Ngila Muendane, general secretary of the
black nationalist Pan-Africanist Congress.

Nice hotel, tours, beaches: Khmer Rouge leaders get VIP treatment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS name of hotel, 3rd graf
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Relaxing in a luxury hotel, planning
tours and a beach holiday, two Khmer Rouge leaders basked in VIP
treatment Wednesday in the capital they emptied of people in 1975
to launch a reign of terror.
	   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea are widely believed responsible for
crimes against humanity. But since arriving Tuesday in Phnom Penh
to be greeted by Prime Minister Hun Sen under guarantees they will
not be prosecuted, they've been living the good life.
	   On Wednesday, they awoke in crisp sheets at the Royal Phnom Penh
Hotel, had breakfast in the stylish Thai restaurant and set about a
busy day of meetings that included Boutros Boutros-Ghali, a former
U.N. secretary general.
	   Their families embarked on a tour of the capital in luxury cars,
viewing temples and palaces that they last saw 20 years ago when
the Vietnamese army toppled the Khmer Rouge regime.
	   In coming days, they plan to visit the historic Angkor temples
in the north, the Sihanoukville seaside resort in the south, and
their home provinces before settling in at an ex-stronghold,
Pailin.
	   Not all staff at the hotel, where lodging runs from dlrs 120 to
dlrs 540 per night, are pleased at the lavish treatment.
	   ``I'm very disappointed,'' said a hotel security guard, speaking
on condition of anonymity for fear of losing his job. ``I don't
think soldiers who lost their legs to defend the country enjoy the
same treatment given to these people here.''
	   Well-groomed and neatly dressed, the leaders and their families
resemble upper-class urban Cambodians. In 1975, they would have
worn the black pajamas that became a revolutionary symbol.
	   The Khmer Rouge emptied Phnom Penh and all other cities after
taking power _ even forcing hospital patients onto the roads _ and
marched the populations at gunpoint to rural slave labor camps.
	   As many as 2 million people _ one Cambodian in five _ died of
overwork, starvation, disease or systematic executions.
	   The Khmer Rouge waged a long civil war after being ousted. Hun
Sen has justified pardoning surviving leaders in the interests of
peace, but the movement is extinct anyway and many feel the Khmer
Rouge are getting off too lightly.
	   ``It will set a bad precedent,'' said Chhay Yi Heang, dean of
philosophy at the University of Phnom Penh. ``Those who used to
kill will continue to kill in future because they will believe they
can be easily pardoned.''

China concerned over Japanese satellites
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China expressed concern Wednesday that Japanese
plans to launch military satellites and research an anti-missile
system with the United States could affect security in Asia.
	   Japan's Cabinet has approved a plan to launch four surveillance
satellites by 2002, apparently to monitor North Korea's weapons
program. U.S. and Japanese officials have also decided to study a
regional missile defense system.
	   ``China is deeply concerned about the political and military
connotation of the aforementioned moves, as well as their possible
impact on regional and global security,'' Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao said in a statement carried by the official
Xinhua News Agency.
	   Zhu warned that the development of a ``strategic arms system''
could ``spark arms races and harm both the global strategic balance
and stability.''
	   ``China sincerely hopes Japan will strictly abide by a defense
policy limited to its own territory and coastal waters, and adhere
to a peaceful development path,'' Zhu said.

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemen faced a barrage of criticism Wednesday
after its troops stormed the hideout of Islamic extremist
kidnappers holding 16 Western hostages. Four of the hostages were
killed.
	   Two other hostages were wounded during the siege near the
southern town of Mawdiyah, about 175 miles (280 kilometers) south
of the capital, San`a.
	   One casualty, Briton Claire Marston, was in a critical condition
Wednesday after undergoing an operation, her relatives said in
Kent, England. Her husband, Canadian-born Peter Rowe, a mathematics
lecturer from Durham University, was one of the four persons
killed.
	   The remaining 10 hostages were freed unharmed. Three kidnappers
died.
	   Yemen's Interior Ministry blamed the kidnappers for the deaths
of the three Britons and an Australian, one of whom died later in
in a hospital. It said security forces intervened after the

Yugoslavia seeks to have Kosovo rebels declared terrorists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with top Serb official in Kosovo saying
government will fight KLA, Kosovo reported quiet; trims &QL; 
 &UR; By VESELIN TOSHKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top government official in Kosovo
warned in remarks published Wednesday that Serbia is running out of
patience with ethnic Albanian rebels and suggested it could launch
another large-scale action against them.
	   Veljko Odalovic, the province's leading official, accused the
Kosovo Liberation Army of taking advantage of an October truce to
take positions abandoned by withdrawing Serbian police and Yugoslav
army.
	   ``We have to defend our state, its integrity and people ... with
or without the international community,'' said Odalovic in an
interview with the Belgrade daily Glas. ``There will be problems,
but we will punish the last terrorist.''
	   Odalovic's comments came amid growing fears that the October
truce, mediated by American diplomats, could collapse altogether.
Four days of fierce fighting last week in northern Kosovo claimed
at least 15 lives and sent thousands fleeing.
	   Serb officials accuse the KLA of triggering the clashes by
attacking police and army in Kosovo. Yugoslavia, formed of Serbia
and Montenegro, on Tuesday urged the United Nations to declare the
KLA a terrorist organization and crack down on their support
network abroad.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is monitoring the Kosovo truce, has sent an additional 100
international observers to the province. They will bring to about
700 the number of Americans, Canadians and Europeans trying to ease
tensions in Kosovo.
	   An OSCE spokesman said the province was quiet Wednesday. On
Tuesday Serb sources reported that the bodies of five ethnic
Albanians were found in three different locations in Kosovo. It was
not clear who killed them.
	   Odalovic accused the independence-seeking rebels of trying to
frighten the minority Serbs into leaving Kosovo and create an
ethnically pure Albanian land. Ethnic Albanians make up some 90
percent of the population in Kosovo, a province in southern Serbia,
while the Serb population has decreased in the past decades.
	   ``There can be only one state here, one authority, one police
and one army. There is no space for any paramilitary forces,'' said
Odalovic, referring to the ethnic Albanians' struggle to form their
own state in Kosovo since Serbia revoked their autonomy in 1989.
	   ``We are not asking anything else from the international
community, but to let us use our legitimate right'' to crack down
on the KLA, said Odalovic.
	   A Serb crackdown against KLA earlier this year claimed over
1,000 lives and left some 300,000 people homeless. Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic ended it in the face of the threat of
NATO airstrikes.
	   NATO has said it is ready to act in fighting in Kosovo flares up
again.
	   Acknowledging ``problems and limits,'' Odalovic still said ``we
cannot stand by and watch crimes being committed.''
	   ``People are not safe in their homes, at work, schools or bars.
That is something which has pushed our patience beyond limits,''
said Odalovic.
	   Yugoslavia's Serb-led government claims the ethnic Albanian
Kosovo Liberation Army is a terrorist organization which should be
branded as such by world leaders in order to restrict its support
from Albanian expatriate communities in Switzerland, Germany and
elsewhere.
	   Yugoslavia's foreign minister Zivadin Jovanovic claimed Tuesday
the rebels have carried out 470 attacks since the October
agreement, including the killing of ethnic Albanians loyal to the
government.

Philippine president says it's too late to stop execution of rapist
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Supreme Court chief saying there is a possibility
petition to save Echegaray from death may be taken up before
execution in 6th graf

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada said
Wednesday he would not grant a last-minute reprieve to a convicted
rapist who is set to be executed by lethal injection next week.
	   ``It's too late, it's too late,'' Estrada said when asked if
there was still a possibility of stopping Monday's execution of Leo
Echegaray, who has been convicted of repeatedly raping a
10-year-old stepdaughter.
	   ``As I said, he committed this crime not because of poverty but
because of his animal instinct, so that's unforgivable, especially
to a little girl. I cannot forgive that,'' Estrada told reporters.
	   Echegaray's execution, the first to be scheduled since capital
punishment was restored in the Philippines in 1994, has triggered a
debate among many Filipinos over the death penalty.
	   Last Monday, Echegaray's lawyer petitioned the Supreme Court to
defer the execution while lawmakers review the law that restored
capital punishment.
	   Supreme Court chief justice Hilario Davide Jr. said there is a
possibility the tribunal might take up the petition and issue a
decision before the execution. Under its rules, even one of the
Supreme Court's 13 justices can order to defer the execution.
	   In recent weeks, several senators and congressmen have expressed
doubts about whether capital punishment will deter crimes and filed
resolutions seeking a review of the law that reimposed the death
penalty.
	   The Vatican, the European Union and Canada also recently sent
appeals to the Philippine government to abolish capital punishment,
arguing that death penalty would not reduce widespread crime.
Estrada has turned down the appeals.
	   Authorities in the national penitentiary in suburban Muntinlupa,
where Echegaray is detained with more than 800 other death row
convicts, have been carrying out mock executions in recent days.
	   They also have strengthened security around the prison and
prepared barbed wire roadblocks to control expected protests by
anti-death penalty groups.
	   Prison chaplain Roberto Olaguer said an all-night prayer vigil
will be held outside the penitentiary on the eve of the execution
by groups opposing capital punishment.
	   Between 1924 and 1976, the Philippines executed 84 people.
	   In 1987, a new constitution abolished the death penalty but gave
Congress the option of restoring it for ``heinous'' crimes such as
murder, kidnapping for ransom, rape and drug trafficking.
	   Legislators, alarmed by a rise in crime, took that option,
bringing back the death penalty in 1994.
	   Many Filipinos say the death penalty will deter criminals, and
that crime has become rampant because no one has been executed in
recent years.
	   Roman Catholic bishops and other civic groups opposed to the
death penalty say there is no proof of the deterrent effect. They
claim that poor people are more likely to be sentenced to death
because they cannot afford good lawyers.

Angolan president rejects peace talks with UNITA rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ President Jose Eduardo dos Santos ruled
out talks with the rebel group UNITA on ending the country's
renewed civil war, and described rebel leader Jonas Savimbi as a
liar for pretending to be committed to a 1994 peace pact.
	   Dos Santos said in a speech broadcast on state radio RNA late
Tuesday that the army had given ``the correct response'' to UNITA's
failure to heed the terms of the United Nations-brokered peace
accord.
	   Dos Santos indicated that he will not yield to international
pressure to call off the army offensive against rebel strongholds
in the central highlands which began Dec. 4.
	   The government ``will never again accept the demands from
outside the country to give ... one more chance to the liars who
have demonstrated that they are unable to accept differences of
opinion within the framework of peace and democracy,'' he said.
	   The U.N. Security Council has blamed UNITA, a Portuguese acronym
for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, for
the return to war.
	   The movement defied the 1994 pact by refusing to yield control
of its strongholds and maintaining a hidden army, according to the
United Nations.
	   The United Nations has spent dlrs 2 billion implementing the
peace agreement, stationing more than 7,000 peace verifiers in the
southwest African country after the deal was signed in the Zambian
capital Lusaka.
	   U.N. spokesman Hamadoun Toure said the United Nations still
regarded the 1994 accord as valid.
	   ``We must go by the Lusaka protocol. What we want is a return to
dialogue,'' Toure said by phone.
	   The country has been ravaged by conflict since gaining
independence from Portugal in 1975. A 1991 peace deal collapsed the
following year when UNITA rejected its defeat in the country's
first democratic elections.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A mob of 200 villagers, some armed
with machetes, tortured and killed eight Indonesian soldiers after
stopping a public bus. On Wednesday, rioters in the same area
attacked a police station and burned two police cars.
	   The violence in northwestern Aceh province was likely to raise
tensions in a region where the Indonesian military recently ended a
decade-long campaign against separatist rebels.
	   Officials suspect guerrilla followers were behind the slayings
of the soldiers on Tuesday.
	   Accused of widespread atrocities in Aceh, the military
apologized and withdrew some troops in a conciliatory gesture after
the resignation in May of former President Suharto. However,
resentment toward the military remains deep.
	   In Jakarta, armed forces chief Gen. Wiranto said the attack on
off-duty soldiers could jeopardize a plan to reduce the military
presence by entrusting community leaders with security.
	   ``The killing was a brutal action which can never be tolerated
by the armed forces,'' Wiranto said. ``This action could spoil the
wishes of the Aceh people to free the region of military
operations.''
	   The assailants forced the victims to get off a bus in the
village of Lhok Nibung that was heading to the nearby city of
Medan. Ten other soldiers managed to escape and reported to their
superiors, who dispatched hundreds of troops to search for the
killers.
	   Wiranto said eight soldiers were killed and that 25 people
suspected of provoking the mob attack were arrested.
	   In a separate incident in the nearby town of Lhokseumawe, a mob
of 500 people hurled stones at a police station after a dispute
between a policeman and a security guard at a neighboring building.
There were no reported injuries or arrests.
	   Lhokseumawe, a center of Indonesia's oil and gas industry, was
hit by anti-military rioting in August and November.
	   Aceh, about 1,750 kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of Jakarta,
is a staunchly Muslim province where rebels have been fighting for
an Islamic state for decades.
	   The military has acknowledged that 760 people died in fighting
since the late 1980s, although human rights groups put the death
toll higher. Mass graves have been uncovered and some widows have
alleged they were raped by soldiers.
	   Separatist guerrilla movements also operate in the remote
province of Irian Jaya and the former Portuguese colony of East
Timor.

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemen faced a barrage of criticism Wednesday
after its troops stormed the hideout of Islamic extremist
kidnappers holding 16 Western hostages. Four of the hostages were
killed.
	   Two other hostages were wounded during the siege near the
southern town of Mawdiyah, about 175 miles (280 kilometers) south
of the capital, San`a.
	   One casualty, Briton Claire Marston, was in a critical condition
Wednesday after undergoing an operation, her relatives said in
Kent, England. Her husband, Canadian-born Peter Rowe, a mathematics
lecturer from Durham University, was one of the four persons
killed.
	   The remaining 10 hostages were freed unharmed. Three kidnappers
died.
	   Yemen's Interior Ministry blamed the kidnappers for the deaths
of the three Britons and an Australian, one of whom died later in
in a hospital. It said security forces intervened after the
kidnappers had begun killing the hostages.
	   ``They proceeded in killing the captives after refusing any

Hong Kong Monetary Authority head sees difficult year ahead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TARA SUILEN DUFFY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ After hitting the worst recession in years,
banks in Hong Kong face an even more difficult new year, the head
of the de-facto central bank warned Wednesday.
	   Joseph Yam, chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,
also told reporters the authority is on ``full alert'' for another
potential attack on its currency, the Hong Kong dollar.
	   ``Although the economy is expected to recover somewhat in 1999
from the rather depressed state of 1998, the banking scene is
likely to get more difficult next year'' as the problems in the
territory's corporations catch up with the banks that lent them
money, Yam said in a year-end press conference.
	   Yam said he expected to see a slight increase in bad debts as
companies that ran into trouble this year find themselves unable to
repay existing loans.
	   ``I won't actually be surprised if one or two of the banks this
year report a loss,'' for their activities in 1998, he said, but
dismissed the possibility of any banks becoming insolvent.
	   After facing the ``most difficult year in monetary history,''
the de-facto central bank will be watching out for possible renewed
speculative attacks on the Hong Kong dollar by hedge funds. In
August, investors aggressively sold the Hong Kong dollar, forcing
monetary authorities to raise interest rates to preserve the
currency's fixed link with the U.S. dollar.
	   ``We have to be on full alert,'' because the speculators may try
again to force a devaluation of the Hong Kong dollar, Yam said. Yam
predicted the link to the U.S. dollar will hold _ and said the
territory will raise interest rates if necessary to preserve it.
	   The speculators who were selling the currency in August also
sold borrowed shares in the Hong Kong stock market on a bet that
prices would fall. They then cashed in when the higher interest
rates pulled shares lower, prompting a dramatic and controversial
response from Hong Kong authorities.
	   The government spent the equivalent of U.S. dlrs 15.1 billion in
an unprecedented stock buying spree and later introduced a series
of regulations to restrict speculative activity and stabilize the
markets.
	   Although the small size of Hong Kong's markets make them
susceptible to speculation, the regulations will make it more
expensive for hedge funds to attack Hong Kong stock and currency
markets, if they decide to try again, Yam said.
	   Yam also said Hong Kong may have to draw down its massive
foreign exchange reserves _ which stood at U.S. dlrs 88.6 billion
as of Nov. 30 _ to fund a budget deficit for the coming fiscal year
that begins April 1.
	   Yam also said Hong Kong officials will keep a close watch on the
new European Union single currency _ the euro _ which begins
trading Monday. Yam said the government would consider adding euros
to its assets, but probably only on a small scale.

Army officers charged for alleged business deals in eastern Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Four Ugandan army officers have been
removed from their posts in eastern Congo and charged with failing
to carry out their duties, three apparently because of involvement
in mining ventures in the mineral rich region, a newspaper said
Wednesday.
	   The government-owned New Vision said Lt. Col. John Nyakaitana,
identified as the top strategist for Uganda's military operations
against Ugandan rebels operating in eastern Congo, was recalled
from the region along with three other officers in recent days.
	   Nyakaitana was charged with not carrying out certain duties,
while the three other officers were said to have been conducting
illegal business inside Congo, the newspaper cited an unidentified
Defense Ministry official as saying.
	   Uganda and Rwanda have acknowledged sending forces and military
equipment to assist Congolese rebels in eastern Congo trying to
oust Congolese President Laurent Kabila. Both countries maintain
Kabila has allowed rebels from Rwanda and Uganda to operate
unhindered in eastern Congo.
	   One of the officers was charged with vandalizing an army
vehicle, while the other three had apparently been involved in
shady business deals, the newspaper said, citing unidentified
military sources.
	   State Minister for Defense Steven Kavuma could not be reached
for comment.
	   On Tuesday, the New Vision, citing an anonymous army officer,
said Museveni ordered the arrest of the officers in eastern Congo
where they were suspected of dealing illegally in gold, timber and
other natural resources.
	   A senior military officer and four other people were killed in
September when a twin-engine Islander plane going from Kampala to
northeastern Congo, reportedly on a gold-buying mission, crashed
under mysterious circumstances in the foothills of the Rwenzori
Mountains that straddle the border between Uganda and Congo.
	   Contradictory government statements and reports further clouded
the circumstances behind the crash.
	   Citing other unnamed sources, New Vision said since the start of
the Congolese rebellion on Aug. 2, there has been an influx of
Ugandans, most of them relatives of army officers, on trading
missions in eastern Congo.

Asian markets close mixed in year-end lull
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Wednesday in
thin trading ahead of the year-end holidays, with some rising on
overnight Wall Street gains and others slipping amid local economic
and political worries.
	   In Tokyo, the region's biggest market, prices closed the year's
last trading day slightly lower amid plunging bond prices and
political and economic uncertainties.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 4.73 points,
or 0.03 percent, to finish at 13,842.17 points. On Tuesday, it
closed up 137.84 points, or 1.01 percent.
	   The Tokyo market reopens Monday.
	   The Nikkei had a turbulent year dominated by political
indecisiveness, an oscillating yen and a shrinking economy. It rose
to a year's high of 17,264.34 points on March 2. But it was mostly
downhill from there, hitting its yearly low of 12,879.97 points on
Oct. 9.
	   When trading resumes next year, investors will be closely
monitoring talks between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and
the opposition Liberal Party on forming a coalition government,
analysts said.
	   ``The domestic political and economic situations remain
uncertain,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, a general manager at Chuo
Securities.
	   Still, Wednesday's market got some support from Tuesday's rise
on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,320.98
points, up 1.02 percent.
	   In the currency market, the U.S. dollar fell marginally against
the Japanese yen in lackluster trading. The dollar bought 115.20
yen in late dealings, down 0.16 yen from late Tuesday and below its
late New York level of 115.53 yen overnight.
	   In Singapore, share prices closed higher on hopes of an
eleventh-hour interest rate cut before the end of the year.
	   The Straits Times Index closed 1.2 percent higher at 1,394.70.
	   Dealers said they expected the government-controlled Development
Bank of Singapore Ltd. to pave the way for lower rates with a
half-point cut in the prime lending rate, which stands at 5.5
percent.
	   In Taipei, stock prices fell for the fifth straight session to
near four-month lows.
	   The benchmark Weighted Price Index dropped 16.24 points at
6,462.03, the lowest level since it hit 6,219.89 on Sept. 1.
	   Investors continued to sell shares amid fears of Taiwan's weak
economy and ahead of the release of December corporate sales
results, due out by Jan. 10, dealers said.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index slumped 1 percent to
10,121.44 points in lackluster trading.
	   Retail and institutional investors were trying to sell their
stocks before the holidays, said Johnson Hui, research head at BOCI
Securities Ltd.
	   Elsewhere:
	   BANGKOK: Thai shares rose as local fund managers bought shares
in an effort to push up prices in their investment portfolios
before the year end. The SET index rose 1.1 percent at 351.81
points.
	   JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed a tumultuous year higher on
late buying in tobacco and mining blue chips. The JSX Composite
Index closed up 1.305 points at 398.038.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares finished mixed as investment
banks bought blue chips while retail investors sold their
second-tier holdings. The benchmark Composite Index rose 8.33
points to 574.56.
	   SYDNEY: Australian stocks ended higher, pushed along by rises in
blue-chip stocks such as Commonwealth Bank of Australia, News Corp.
and AMP Ltd. The All Ordinaries index closed up 0.6 percent at
2,784.2.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand's benchmark NZSE-40 capital index
finished lower, led by a fall in market heavyweight Telecom Corp.
of New Zealand. It shed 5.11 points to 2,105.23.
	   Markets in the Philippines and South Korea were closed
Wednesday.

Fighting in Tajik capital sends residents fleeing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with additional details throughout. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Rival groups waged a fierce gun
battle Wednesday in the center of Tajikistan's capital, leaving at
least two people dead and sending residents fleeing for cover.
	   The clash erupted along the main street in Dushanbe between two
feuding factions that control territory in the eastern part of
Dushanbe, witnesses said.
	   Supporters of the two groups opened fire outside the National
Reconciliation Commission, which was established to bring together
the combatants in the country's 5-year-old civil war, which
formally ended last year.
	   About 20 gunmen on each side took part in the shootout, which
damaged vehicles and buildings, witnesses said.
	   Both factions, led by commanders Rakhmon Sanginov and Ali
Pirmakh, had been expected to take part in meetings at the
commission, witnesses said.
	   At least two people were killed and three wounded in the
fighting, which drove civilians from the streets. The shooting
ended after about 45 minutes, and police restored order, witnesses
and Russian news agencies said.
	   Since the end of the civil war, ex-rebels have begun to serve in
the government, the army, and the National Reconciliation
Commission.
	   However, there are still frictions among the various groups, and
some renegade warlords have refused to recognize the peace
agreement.
	   Russia has about 25,000 troops in the Central Asian nation to
support President Emomali Rakhmonov, but there was no indication
that they were involved in the fighting.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Boutros-Ghali saying Cambodian solution must
prevail in absence of U.N. tribunal, last three grafs.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk refused
Wednesday to approve amnesty for two leaders of the genocidal Khmer
Rouge, setting up a collision course with his prime minister, who
has pledged to shield them from trial.
	   The refusal undermines a deal Prime Minister Hun Sen has struck
with Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea to allow them to defect and give
up to his government with assurances they will not be tried for
their roles in the deaths of as many as 2 million people.
	   ``Taking into account the very wide and undeniable discontent of
the majority of the Khmer people, I announce to this majority that
I respect them and will not renew my power of amnesty for major
Khmer Rouge criminals,'' the king said.
	   Sihanouk, 76, receiving medical treatment for several ailments
in Beijing, made the comments in his palace bulletin.
	   However, Hun Sen is Cambodia's most powerful man and his will
amounts to law. He controls the judiciary and security services and
could simply accord the pair a de facto pardon, possibly through
the pliant court system.
	   The popular king's stance will make a pardon less legitimate in
the eyes of the world and many Cambodians. But Sihanouk is largely
a figurehead and has no way to enforce his will.
	   The Khmer Rouge won a civil war in 1975 and turned the country
into a huge slave labor camp. One person in five perished of
overwork, starvation, disease and systematic executions. They were
ousted by a Vietnamese invasion in 1979 but waged a long guerrilla
war.
	   Two years ago, the government pressured a reluctant Sihanouk to
break the stalemate by granting amnesty to a Khmer Rouge chieftain,
Ieng Sary, in exchange for making peace.
	   Ieng Sary led thousands of guerrillas out of combat and the
movement is now all but extinct. Many now question Hun Sen's
assertion that amnesty is needed for Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea to
prevent a slide back into civil war.
	   Sihanouk said that an international tribunal would have ``the
perfect right to take up the case of genocide in Cambodia, because
it concerns crimes against humanity.''
	   ``From now on, I leave all the responsibility to Hun Sen of
handling this unfortunate and dramatic affair of pardons accorded
to the Khmer Rouge,'' Sihanouk said. ``I will sign no more decrees
concerning the Khmer Rouge.''
	   Sihanouk was held a prisoner in his palace under the Khmer Rouge
and lost a score of family members.
	   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, both members of the inner circle of
the late Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot, have basked in VIP treatment
at a luxury hotel since coming to Phnom Penh on Tuesday to cement
their deal with Hun Sen. Ieng Sary is with them.
	   Their families are touring the temples and palaces of a capital
emptied at gunpoint in 1975, when the Khmer Rouge forced Cambodians
into rural slave labor camps. Visits to the historic Angkor
complex, their home provinces and a seaside resort are also
planned.
	   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea told a news conference Tuesday they
were ``very sorry'' for the Khmer Rouge terror but refused to
accept personal responsibility. Khieu Samphan said: ``Let bygones
be bygones.''
	   Eam Chan, 55, one of the handful of survivors from the infamous
Tuol Sleng torture center where perhaps 20,000 people were
brutalized before being executed, said the apology can't erase his
suffering.
	   Accused of being a U.S. spy, Eam Chan was subjected to daily
torture by electroshock and asphyxiation.
	   ``The Cambodian people cannot forget that so easily,'' Eam Chan
said. ``As a victim, my mind cannot be at rest without seeing the
prosecution of these people, because the suffering was
indescribable.''
	   On Wednesday, Khieu Samphan met Boutros Boutros-Ghali, former
United Nations secretary general, who is in Cambodia to promote the
French language as head of the International Francophone
Organization.
	   At a news conference, Boutros-Ghali said that since the United
Nations has not established an international tribunal to deal with
crimes against humanity, Cambodia's decision would have to prevail.
	   A team of U.N. legal experts was dispatched by the present
secretary-general, Kofi Annan, to Cambodia recently to assess the
possibility of creating such a tribunal.
	   The international community would have to respect Cambodia's
decision, Boutros-Ghali said.

Millions stolen in armored car holdup in Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ A gang that held up an armored car
outside a bank near Frankfurt made off with millions of marks
(dollars), police said Wednesday.
	   Initial reports after the robbery Tuesday outside a Sparkasse
branch in Seligenstadt were that the four armed robbers, one with a
Kalashnikov submachine gun, had made off with a ``six-figure'' sum.
	   But police spokesman Georg Grebner said the actual amount was
much higher, ``in the millions.'' He declined to be more specific.
	   The transport company's insurance offered a 100,000 mark (dlrs
61,000) reward for information leading to the capture of the
robbers.

Israeli soldier killed in Lebanon, apparently by friendly fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli soldier was killed and two were
wounded before dawn Wednesday when one Israeli army unit mistakenly
opened fire on another in southern Lebanon, radio reports said.
	   The army confirmed the casualties and said it was investigating
whether friendly fire was the cause.
	   The dead soldier was identified as Staff Sgt. Ohad Zach, 19,
from the northern village of Nofit.
	   Israel radio and Israel army radio said the incident occurred
when two units of soldiers on patrol lost contact with each other,
and one unit fired on the other.
	   The shooting occurred in Israel's self-styled security zone.
Israel has occupied the zone since 1985 to prevent cross-border
guerrilla attacks. With rising casualties, public pressure has been
mounting to withdraw Israel's 2,000 soldiers from Lebanon.

Taiwan company to conduct own tests on waste dumped in Cambodia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The plastics company that shipped some
3,000 tons of mercury-laden waste to Cambodia is dispatching a team
of investigators on Thursday to conduct its own tests into the
material that caused a deadly scandal.
	   Formosa Plastics Corp. has taken issue with earlier tests taken
in Cambodia, including one by an environmental group, that found
illegal levels of mercury in the waste.
	   A dock worker died a day after cleaning the hold of the ship
that brought the waste, and four more people were killed in road
accidents in a panic-stricken exodus from the area.
	   The team organized by Formosa Plastics, to be led by a Taiwanese
lawmaker, Tseng Chen-nung, will collect samples and conduct tests
to decide whether or not the waste is toxic, executives said
Wednesday.
	   Cambodia has accused Taiwan of trying to dump toxic waste in
poor countries. The disclosure of the dump, discovered near the
port of Sihanoukville two weeks ago, sparked riots by residents who
accused officials of allowing the illegal shipment.
	   On Monday, Taiwanese officials said an analysis conducted on
samples taken by an environmental group showed the waste was more
toxic than allowed by law _ and they ordered Formosa Plastics to
bring the material back to Taiwan.
	   The mercury emission level of the waste was 0.284 parts per
million, compared to the safety standard of 0.2 ppm, according to
the analysis. The level refers to the mercury that can be emitted
from the waste when placed in a natural environment.
	   Formosa Plastics questioned the analysis and decided to conduct
its own sampling.
	   Meanwhile, Taiwanese newspapers reported another analysis made
by a Japanese expert showed the waste had a mercury content level
as high as 4,000 parts per million and could be hazardous to
humans.
	   But Lee Chih-chun, general manager at Formosa Plastics, said the
total mercury content cannot indicate whether the waste is
hazardous.
	   Reports from Cambodia said there were 3,000 tons of the waste,
but Formosa Plastics put the figure at around 2,800 tons.
	   Meanwhile, Wu Yih-hsiung, deputy director of Taiwan's
Environmental Protection Bureau, said Formosa Plastics should
either take back the waste or send it to the United States or a
European country for proper treatment.
	   ``The waste should be sent to a country which has the capability
to handle it, not another poor country,'' Wu said.

Prime Minister Vajpayee choses Indian tiger for greeting cards
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee is sending out New Year's greeting cards featuring two
Bengal tigers to promote efforts to rescue the endangered cat.
	   The gesture comes in the silver jubilee year of Project Tiger, a
nationwide effort to preserve the forests where tigers live.
	   ``When the government shows commitment to wildlife at the
highest level, the message goes down well,'' said Samar Singh,
secretary-general of the World Wildlife Fund-India, quoted by the
Times of India newspaper Wednesday.
	   Nearly 60 percent of the world's 7,000 tigers live in India.
They are threatened by poachers seeking their hide or bones, which
are used in Chinese medicines.

Fog disrupts air traffic in Warsaw
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Thick fog over Warsaw delayed most
outgoing flights Wednesday and forced airlines to reroute incoming
flights.
	   Anna Jozwik, spokeswoman for Warsaw's Okecie airport, said the
cloud level was low at 90 meters (300 feet) and visibility poor.
	   Planes were rerouted to other airports in Poland, such as Krakow
or Poznan, while a Delta flight from New York City landed in the
Czech capital of Prague.
	   Airline authorities canceled all domestic flights, she added.
	   Jozwik said 16 international flights had left Warsaw by noon,
all behind schedule.
	   Despite traffic disruption, only about 100 people, many of them
booked on the Delta return flight for New York City, were waiting
for departure at the airport. Jozwik said there are generally few
passengers at the turn of the year.
	   The weather was expected to improve by early afternoon.

Former U.N. chief urges respect over Khmer Rouge deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Former U.N. Secretary General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali said Wednesday that the world must respect
Cambodia's decision not to try two Khmer Rouge leaders for
genocide.
	   Boutros-Ghali said that as long as the United Nations is unable
to create an international tribunal to prosecute crimes against
humanity, national law will prevail.
	   ``You need an international intervention,'' Boutros-Ghali told a
news conference. ``It has to come from the forum which exists,
which is the United Nations.''
	   Boutros-Ghali, in Phnom Penh to promote the French language as
head of the International Francophone Organization, met one of the
Khmer Rouge leaders, Khieu Samphan.
	   ``It was quite interesting to know what had changed,''
Boutros-Ghali remarked. ``How I was not successful and a new
government was successful in finding a reconciliation.''
	   Boutros-Ghali was secretary general in the early 1990s during
the U.N.-organized, dlrs 2 billion project to hold elections and
bring peace to Cambodia.
	   The Khmer Rouge boycotted the vote, but the elections were a key
step in bringing peace to the country after decades of strife.
	   Khieu Samphan was the official head of the bloodstained
revolutionary group, though others held real power. Nuon Chea, long
seen as the number-two behind the late Pol Pot, is with him.
	   The pair traveled Tuesday to Phnom Penh to meet Prime Minister
Hun Sen, who promised to shield them from prosecution in what he
says is a necessary step to ensure the country does not return to
civil war.
	   Deals struck with other leaders over the past two years brought
peace to nearly all of Cambodia for the first time in a generation,
but the Khmer Rouge is now nearly extinct.
	   King Norodom Sihanouk, who refused to endorse the deal, is one
of many Cambodians who believe the pair should be held to account
before an international tribunal for the deaths of as many as 2
million people under their rule from 1975 to 1979.
	   The current U.N. secretary general, Kofi Annan, dispatched a
team of legal experts to Cambodia recently to assess the
feasibility of holding such a trial. Their report is due in a few
weeks.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ A convicted murderer who escaped from prison
here on Christmas was captured Wednesday, the Italian news agency
ANSA reported.
	   Joan Ursut, who in the past had escaped twice from Swedish
prisons, used a knotted bed sheet Friday to shimmy out of a Milan
prison window and to brief freedom.
	   Fog had hampered the immediate search.
	   ANSA reported that the 40-year-old Romanian, who has a 21-year
sentence for the murder of an Italian gangster, was arrested by
Italian police near Modena, a town about 170 km (110 miles) from
Milan.

Four bodies found on capsized barge in Russian Far East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Rescue workers on Wednesday found the bodies of
four border guards who drowned when a supply barge capsized and
sank in icy waters in Russia's Far East, a news report said.
	   One more body had been found Tuesday and four crew members were
still missing and feared dead.
	   Of the 11 men who were on the barge when it went down, only two
have been rescued. They survived by hanging onto the barge's hull
until rescuers found them, according to the Federal Border Guards
in Moscow.
	   The four bodies found Wednesday had been inside the barge's
control room, the Interfax news agency said. Workers were not able
to locate them earlier because poor weather slowed down rescue
efforts.
	   The search for the remaining bodies has been temporarily halted
because of high winds, Interfax said.
	   The barge, carrying supplies to a border guard post, overturned
and sank Sunday as it passed through a hard-to-navigate section of
the Kamchatka river, located on the Kamchatka peninsula about 6,700
kilometers (4,200 miles) east of Moscow.

Singapore announces point system to assess immigrant applications
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Immigration authorities announced Friday a
point system for assessing permanent resident applicants on their
ability to contribute to Singapore's growth and welfare.
	   It is the first time the criteria have ever been publicly
stated, said government television. The new rules take effect Jan.
2.
	   The city-state of 3.1 million people is undergoing its severest
economic crisis in more than a decade and many have complained
about the government's policy of encouraging ``foreign talent.''
	   At the same time, it was announced that work visas will not be
required for certain visitors, such as businessmen participating in
trade shows, and journalists covering specific news events.
	   Trade show participants had in the past found themselves in
Singapore illegally because they didn't know of the requirement for
work visas, said Graham Hayward, chairman of the Singapore Chamber
of Commerce.
	   Those seeking permanent residence will be judged on the basis of
points, awarded for the type of work they wish to do, how long they
want to stay, their academic qualifications, monthly salary, age
and local kinship ties.

Netanyahu urges top Likud ministers not to defect to other parties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Trying to stem a wave of defections from his
political camp, embattled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged
top Cabinet ministers Wednesday not to leave his Likud Party ahead
of May elections.
	   Netanyahu also played down a veiled threat by his closest
political ally, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, to run for prime
minister.
	   ``We are cooperating fully to win the elections,'' Netanyahu
said on Israel radio, referring to Sharon. ``I intend with his help
... to lead the government forward.''
	   Netanyahu is fighting an uphill battle to win re-election May
17.
	   He faces a growing field of challengers, including members of
his own Likud Party who either seek to wrest the party's nomination
from him or plan to run on their own slate.
	   Netanyahu's former foreign minister, David Levy, is negotiating
the terms of a political partnership with opposition leader Ehud
Barak. His agricultural minister, Rafael Eitan, has announced that
he is seeking the premiership. Eitan heads the Tsomet Party which
ran on a joint slate with Likud in 1996.
	   Two key Cabinet members from Likud, Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai and Communications Minister Limor Livnat, are considering
leaving the party to join a centrist slate being formed by a
popular former army chief of staff, Amnon Lipkin-Shahak.
	   Mordechai's departure would be a serious blow for Netanyahu and
underscore his growing political isolation. Mordechai is popular
among the Likud rank-and-file, especially with Sephardi voters.
	   It is speculated that if Mordechai quits the Likud, Sharon will
make his move and challenge Netanyahu for the premiership.
	   Asked Wednesday what message he had for Mordechai and Livnat,
Netanyahu said: ``Stay in your (political) home.''
	   Israeli President Ezer Weizman, meanwhile, came under fire after
the Haaretz daily reported that he had told visitors Barak and
Shahak should join forces, presumably to be in a better position to
beat Netanyahu. The job of president in Israel is largely
ceremonial and he is expected to remain above the political fray.
	   Weizman did not comment on the Haaretz report, but said
Wednesday that he would try everything in his power to get the
peace agreement with the Palestinians back on track.
	   ``My message today is that peace is paramount,'' Weizman said.
	   `I have limitations ... and people would like to limit me
more,'' he added, referring to the restrictions of his office and
the most recent criticism.
	   Netanyahu froze implementation of the Wye River
land-for-security agreement last month, citing Palestinian
violations of the accord.
	   Barak and Shahak are staunch supporters of the peace agreements
with the Palestinians, and while still in the army, were involved
in the peace talks.

Croatia purchases radar system from U.S. company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia has purchased a dlrs 16 million
radar system for maritime surveillance from a U.S. company,
Croatian media reported Wednesday.
	   Defense Ministry officials said the contract was signed with the
Metric System Corp. just before Christmas, according to the
Vecernji List daily, which did not have further details about the
firm.
	   The system will enable Croatia to monitor its part of the
Adriatic Sea, including submarines and low-flying planes, as well
as its more than 1,000-kilometer (625-mile) -long coast.
	   Croatia's maritime space, amounting to about 32,000 square
kilometers (13,000 square miles), equals half its continental
territory.
	   Vladimir Zagorec, head of the Defense Ministry's company for
arms trade, said the radar equipment will be used by the navy and
also police, to secure a timely action when needed.
	   Vecernji List said that with the new system, ``a possibility of
aliens' entrance into our territorial waters is reduced to a
minimum.'' That should also prevent smuggling at sea, it said.
	   Croatia, which seceded from the former Yugoslav federation in
1991, has had only the radar systems it inherited from the Yugoslav
army, so the purchase was necessary, Zagorec said.
	   In addition, the systems are compatible to NATO member
countries' equipment. Croatia hopes to be admitted to NATO's
Partnership for Peace program and is trying to adjust its military
to NATO standards.

Yugoslavia seeks to have Kosovo rebels declared terrorists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VESELIN TOSHKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top government official in Kosovo
warned in remarks published Wednesday that Serbia is running out of
patience with ethnic Albanian rebels and suggested it could launch
another large-scale action against them.
	   Veljko Odalovic, the province's leading official, accused the
Kosovo Liberation Army of taking advantage of an October truce to
take positions abandoned by withdrawing Serbian police and Yugoslav
army.
	   ``We have to defend our state, its integrity and people ... with
or without the international community,'' said Odalovic in an
interview with the Belgrade daily Glas. ``There will be problems,
but we will punish the last terrorist.''
	   Odalovic's comments came amid growing fears that the October
truce, mediated by American diplomats, could collapse altogether.
Four days of fierce fighting last week in northern Kosovo claimed
at least 15 lives and sent thousands fleeing.
	   Serb officials accuse the KLA of triggering the clashes by
attacking police and army in Kosovo. Yugoslavia, formed of Serbia
and Montenegro, on Tuesday urged the United Nations to declare the
KLA a terrorist organization and crack down on their support
network abroad.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is monitoring the Kosovo truce, has sent an additional 100
international observers to the province. They will bring to about
700 the number of Americans, Canadians and Europeans trying to ease
tensions in Kosovo.
	   An OSCE spokesman said the province was quiet Wednesday. On
Tuesday Serb sources reported that the bodies of five ethnic
Albanians were found in three different locations in Kosovo. It was
not clear who killed them.
	   Odalovic accused the independence-seeking rebels of trying to
frighten the minority Serbs into leaving Kosovo and create an
ethnically pure Albanian land. Ethnic Albanians make up some 90
percent of the population in Kosovo, a province in southern Serbia,
while the Serb population has decreased in the past decades.
	   ``There can be only one state here, one authority, one police
and one army. There is no space for any paramilitary forces,'' said
Odalovic, referring to the ethnic Albanians' struggle to form their
own state in Kosovo since Serbia revoked their autonomy in 1989.
	   ``We are not asking anything else from the international
community, but to let us use our legitimate right'' to crack down
on the KLA, said Odalovic.
	   A Serb crackdown against KLA earlier this year claimed over
1,000 lives and left some 300,000 people homeless. Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic ended it in the face of the threat of
NATO airstrikes.
	   NATO has said it is ready to act in fighting in Kosovo flares up
again.
	   Yugoslavia's Serb-led government says the ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army is a terrorist organization which should be branded
as such by world leaders in order to restrict its support from
Albanian expatriate communities in Switzerland, Germany and
elsewhere.
	   Yugoslavia's foreign minister Zivadin Jovanovic claimed Tuesday
the rebels have carried out 470 attacks since the October
agreement, including the killing of ethnic Albanians loyal to the
government.

Angolan president rejects peace talks with UNITA rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ President Jose Eduardo dos Santos ruled
out talks with the rebel group UNITA on ending the country's
renewed civil war, and said rebel leader Jonas Savimbi was a liar
for not complying with a 1994 peace pact.
	   Dos Santos said in a speech broadcast on state radio RNA late
Tuesday that the army had given ``the correct response'' to UNITA's
failure to heed the terms of the United Nations-brokered peace
accord.
	   Dos Santos indicated that he will not yield to international
pressure to call off the army offensive against rebel strongholds
in the central highlands which began Dec. 4.
	   The government ``will never again accept the demands from
outside the country to give ... one more chance to the liars who
have demonstrated that they are unable to accept differences of
opinion within the framework of peace and democracy,'' he said.
	   The U.N. Security Council has blamed UNITA, a Portuguese acronym
for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, for
the return to war.
	   The movement defied the 1994 pact by refusing to yield control
of its strongholds and maintaining a hidden army, according to the
United Nations.
	   The United Nations has spent dlrs 2 billion implementing the
peace agreement, stationing more than 7,000 peace verifiers in the
southwest African country after the deal was signed in the Zambian
capital Lusaka.
	   U.N. spokesman Hamadoun Toure said the United Nations still
regarded the 1994 accord as valid.
	   ``We must go by the Lusaka protocol. What we want is a return to
dialogue,'' Toure said by phone.
	   The country has been ravaged by conflict since gaining
independence from Portugal in 1975. A 1991 peace deal collapsed the
following year when UNITA rejected its defeat in the country's
first democratic elections.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1200 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Wednesday in thin
trading ahead of the year-end holidays, with some rising on
overnight Wall Street gains and others slipping amid local economic
and political worries. In Tokyo, the region's biggest market,
prices closed the year's last trading day slightly lower amid
plunging bond prices and political and economic uncertainties. The
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 4.73 points, or 0.03
percent, to finish at 13,842.17 points. On Tuesday, it closed up
137.84 points, or 1.01 percent. The Tokyo market reopens Monday.
The Nikkei had a turbulent year dominated by political
indecisiveness, an oscillating yen and a shrinking economy. It rose
to a year's high of 17,264.34 points on March 2. But it was mostly
downhill from there, hitting its yearly low of 12,879.97 points on
Oct. 9. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   SEOUL, South Korea _ South Korea will abolish its 20-year-old
import ban on an assortment of Japanese cars and other industrial
goods by June next year, government officials said Wednesday. South
Korea currently bans the import of 48 Japanese products, including
many types of cars, as part of its effort to protect domestic
industries and fight a chronic trade imbalance with Japan. South
Korea will begin Thursday by first lifting the ban on 32 products,
including station wagons with 1- to 1.5-liter engine capacity,
jeeps with over 1.5-liter gasoline engines, as well as camcorders,
copy machines and audio components. (SKOREA-JAPAN)
	   HANOI, Vietnam _ A joint venture with Russia to build and run
Vietnam's first oil refinery has been granted an operating license,
the Vietnam News Agency reported Wednesday. The license was granted
Tuesday for the VietRoss Refinery, to be located at the small
fishing village of Dung Quat about 100 kilometers (60 miles) south
of Danang. It is expected to refine 6.5 million tons (1.88 billion
gallons) of crude oil per year, with the first phase to be
operational in 2001. The refinery is a joint venture between
Vietnam's oil and gas monopoly, PetroVietnam, and Russia's
Zarubezhneft. They signed a contract last month and are to equally
fund the projected investment capital of dlrs 1.3 billion.

	   TOKYO _ Nomura Securities Co., Japan's biggest brokerage, will
cut 650 overseas jobs next year as part of a major restructuring
campaign, a company official said Wednesday. Facing massive losses
in its overseas operations, the company will shed nearly 20 percent
of its work force in Europe and the Americas and close some
overseas offices, Nomura representative Kimizo Hayakawa said. At
the same time, the company will hire 50 new employees in Asia
outside Japan to strengthen securities operations in Taiwan and the
Philippines, he said. As of the end of September, Nomura employed
4,600 people outside Japan, including 1,400 in North and South
America and 2,300 in Europe. (JAPAN-NOMURA)
	   BEIJING _ Boosted by massive state spending on public works,
China's economy grew by 7.8 percent this year but missed its
official target, according to figures released Wednesday. Growth
was down sharply from 1997, when the economy expanded by 8.8
percent. Chinese leaders had hoped for at least 8 percent this year
to create jobs for millions of workers laid off in a sweeping
overhaul of state companies. China has escaped the full impact of
the 18-month-old Asian financial crisis, but faces serious problems
of its own in trying to turn around money-losing state industries
and clean up its state-owned banking system. (ASIA-BUSINESS BRIEFS)

Former Myanmar ruling party leader dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Brig. Gen. Tin Oo, who was once general
secretary of Myanmar's ruling party, died of a heart attack at his
home Wednesday, family members said. He was 71.
	   Tin Oo was removed from office in 1983 and sentenced to life
imprisonment for misuse of state funds and property, but was
released after six years.
	   Tin Oo was a powerful figure in military intelligence under the
rule of Gen. Ne Win, who overthrew a civilian government in 1962
and imposed one-party military rule over the country, also known as
Burma.
	   The Burma Socialist Program Party beggared what had once been
the richest country in Southeast Asia until the people revolted
against military rule in 1988.
	   The revolt was bloodily suppressed. Ne Win and his party stepped
aside in favor of a younger generation of officers who introduced a
more market-oriented economy while keeping a firm lid on dissent.
	   Tin Oo spent his retirement devoted to religion and meditation.
He is survived by his wife and three grown children.

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemen faced a barrage of criticism Wednesday
after its troops stormed the hideout of Islamic extremist
kidnappers holding 16 Western hostages. Four of the hostages were
killed.
	   Two other hostages were wounded during the siege near the
southern town of Mawdiyah, about 175 miles (280 kilometers) south
of the capital, San`a. The remaining 10 hostages were freed
unharmed.
	   Al-Jamhouriya Hospital in the southern port of Aden said the two
wounded were women who had been bleeding profusely. ``One of them
was shot in the shoulder and the other in her pelvis. They each
were given 3.5 liters (3.71 quarts) of blood,'' a hospital official
said on condition of anonymity.
	   Relatives of one of the women, Claire Marston of Britain, told
reporters she was in a critical condition Wednesday and had been
operated on. Her husband, Canadian-born Peter Rowe, a mathematics
lecturer from Durham University, was one of the four persons
killed.
	   Security forces killed three of the kidnappers and captured
another three, including the leader, the Interior Ministry said.
	   Yemen's Interior Ministry blamed the kidnappers for the deaths
of the three Britons and an Australian, one of whom died later in
in a hospital. It said security forces intervened after the
kidnappers had begun killing the hostages.
	   ``They proceeded in killing the captives after refusing any
attempts at negotiations, which led security forces to storm the
area to prevent further bloodshed and ensure the safe release of
the rest of the hostages,'' a ministry statement said.
	   But British newspapers accused the Yemeni authorities of
premature intervention in the case. The Daily Mail asked on the
front page, ``Did our tourists really need to die?''
	   British Ambassador Vic Henderson reportedly had pleaded with the
San`a government to do nothing ``that in any way could jeopardize
the safety of the hostages.''
	   In San`a, Yemenis told journalists they were surprised the
government had intervened so quickly when it usually negotiated for
several days, if not weeks, in the hostage-taking frequent in
Yemen.
	   A London-based Islamic human rights group said Tuesday that it
had contacted the kidnappers the night before and received
assurances that they would not harm the hostages.
	   ``We hold the Yemeni government responsible for the deaths. The
way the authorities handled the situation was barbaric and
irresponsible,'' said a spokesman for the Islamic Observation
Center.
	   Kidnappings of foreigners occur often in Yemen, large parts of
which are run by lawless tribes, but until now the hostages usually
have been treated well and released unharmed.
	   But this was the first time an abduction was carried out by
Islamic extremists. Security officials said the kidnappers belong
to Islamic Jihad, many of whose leaders fought Russian troops in
Afghanistan. The group is believed to have about 200 members.
	   The 16 tourists, 12 Britons, two Americans and two Australians,
were kidnapped Monday near Mawdiyah.
	   In London, the Foreign Office confirmed that three Britons _
Ruth Williamson, Margaret Whitehouse and Peter Rowe _ were killed,
but did not provide their ages or hometowns.
	   The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the
fourth victim was a 35-year-old man from Sydney whose name would
not be released until next of kin had been informed.
	   The tourists wounded in the clash were an American woman and a
British woman.
	   The surviving hostages were recovering from their ordeal at a
hotel in Aden, where volunteers from the British and American
communities were helping them cope with their trauma, said David
Pearce, a British Embassy official in San`a.
	   ``They are obviously in a state of severe shock, and I mean
severe shock,'' Pearce told the British news agency Press
Association. ''They are uninjured but obviously very tired, very
stunned and in need of a good meal, a good rest and someone to talk
to. They have been through an awful experience.''
	   After the shootout, security forces detained scores of suspected
Islamic extremists, said the officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   The kidnapping began Monday when the tourists' convoy of five
vehicles was ambushed by men who opened fire on their police
escorts. The kidnappers threatened to kill the tourists if the
police did not back off, Yemeni security officials said.
	   The kidnappers demanded the release of their leader, Saleh
Haidara al-Atwi, who was detained two weeks ago in a government
crackdown on Islamic vigilantes who had been enforcing strict
Islamic rules in southern Yemen, security officials said.
	   The kidnappers also wanted the release of another leader and
were protesting the recent U.S. and British airstrikes against
Iraq, the officials said.
	   The officials identified one of the captured kidnappers as Osama
al-Masri of Egypt.
	   Yemen said the governor of Abyan province, Ahmad Ali Mohsen, was
negotiating with leaders of the Al-Fadl tribe, to which the
kidnappers belong, before the shootout occurred.
	   Tribesmen usually kidnapped foreigners to pressure the
government into providing them with new roads, water or clinics.
	   Four Germans are being held by a tribe in northeast Yemen. The
kidnappers are demanding more schools, hospitals and telephone
lines in their area.
	   German diplomats have appealed to the Yemeni authorities not to
attempt to rescue the four German hostages being held by a tribe in
a different part of the country, Yemeni officials said Wednesday.

	   A summary of news from The Associated Press. Some items have
moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f'' category
codes:
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ A mob of 200 villagers, some armed with
machetes, tortured and killed eight Indonesian soldiers after
stopping a public bus. On Wednesday, rioters in the same area
attacked a police station and burned two police cars. The violence
in northwestern Aceh province was likely to raise tensions in a
region where the Indonesian military recently ended a decade-long
campaign against separatist rebels. Officials suspect guerrilla
followers were behind the slayings of the soldiers on Tuesday.
Accused of widespread atrocities in Aceh, the military apologized
and withdrew some troops in a conciliatory gesture after the
resignation in May of former President Suharto. However, resentment
toward the military remains deep. (INDONESIA-SOLDIERS KILLED)
	   SAN`A, Yemen _ Yemen faced a barrage of criticism Wednesday
after its troops stormed the hideout of Islamic extremist
kidnappers holding 16 Western hostages. Four of the hostages were
killed. Two other hostages were wounded during the siege near the
southern town of Mawdiyah, about 175 miles (280 kilometers) south
of the capital, San`a. The remaining 10 hostages were freed
unharmed. Three kidnappers died. Yemen's Interior Ministry blamed
the kidnappers for the deaths of the three Britons and an
Australian, one of whom died later in in a hospital. It said
security forces intervened after the kidnappers had begun killing
the hostages. But British newspapers accused the Yemeni authorities
of premature intervention in the case. (YEMEN-KIDNAPPING)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ King Norodom Sihanouk refused Wednesday
to approve amnesty for two leaders of the genocidal Khmer Rouge,
setting up a collision course with his prime minister, who has
pledged to shield them from trial. The refusal undermines a deal
Prime Minister Hun Sen has struck with Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea
to allow them to defect and give up to his government with
assurances they will not be tried for their roles in the deaths of
as many as 2 million people. The king said he would not invoke ``my
power of amnesty for major Khmer Rouge criminals.'' However, Hun
Sen is Cambodia's most powerful man and his will amounts to law. He
controls the judiciary and security services and could simply
accord the pair a de facto pardon. The popular king's stance will
make a pardon less legitimate in the eyes of the world and many
Cambodians. But Sihanouk has no way to enforce his will.
(CAMBODIA-KHMER ROUGE)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ The prosecution in the sex and
corruption trial of ousted Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim
dealt him a huge blow Wednesday when a state DNA expert positively
identified his semen on a mattress. Prosecutors are trying to prove
Anwar had sex with the wife of his former secretary, sodomized his
family driver and abused his powers to try to cover up sexual
trysts. The mattress was seized by police in July from an apartment
in a Kuala Lumpur suburb that Anwar is accused of using for secret
meetings with sex partners. (MALAYSIA-ANWAR TRIAL)
	   LUANDA, Angola _ President Jose Eduardo dos Santos ruled out
talks with the rebel group UNITA on ending the country's renewed
civil war, and described rebel leader Jonas Savimbi as a liar for
pretending to be committed to a 1994 peace pact. Dos Santos said in
a speech broadcast on state radio RNA late Tuesday that the army
had given ``the correct response'' to UNITA's failure to heed the
terms of the United Nations-brokered peace accord. Dos Santos
indicated that he will not yield to international pressure to call
off the army offensive against rebel strongholds in the central
highlands which began Dec. 4. (ANGOLA)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ A top government official in Kosovo
warned in remarks published Wednesday that Serbia is running out of
patience with ethnic Albanian rebels and suggested it could launch
another large-scale action against them despite the possibility of
NATO intervention. Veljko Odalovic, the province's leading
official, accused the Kosovo Liberation Army of taking advantage of
an October truce to take positions abandoned by withdrawing Serbian
police and Yugoslav army. ``We have to defend our state, its
integrity and people ... with or without the international
community,'' said Odalovic in an interview with the Belgrade daily
Glas. ``There will be problems, but we will punish the last
terrorist.'' (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)

Germany calls on Turkey to reduce military on Cyprus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany welcomed on Wednesday the Greek
Cypriot president's decision not to deploy missiles on the divided
island, and called on Turkey to reduce its military presence there
in response.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann said such a move by
Turkey would contribute to building trust in Cyprus.
	   Germany, which assumes the rotating European Union presidency on
Friday, would like to help find a ``just and lasting solution'' for
the Cyprus problem, Erdmann said.
	   Turkey had threatened military action if the Russian-made
missiles were actually deployed.

Presentation of credentials _ a sometimes tricky exercise in

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ On his first day at work, the chief of
protocol strode confidently down a White House hallway, the
Sudanese ambassador following closely behind.
	   With a flourish, James Symington opened what he thought was a
door leading to the Oval Office, where President Lyndon Johnson was
waiting to receive the new ambassador's credentials.
	   But instead of stepping into America's most famous room, the two
men found themselves in a broom closet.
	   ``It is my first time in your country,'' said a bewildered
Mohammed Amin Hussein. ``And this is my first day on the job,''
responded Symington. ``We both had a laugh and went upstairs.''
	   Broom closet fiascoes, flags flown upside down, mixed up welcome
cards. These are protocol lapses that occur despite the stiff and
highly choreographed world of diplomacy.
	   But Symington, as well as other protocol chiefs who have
supervised credentials ceremonies, says such gaffes are inevitable
and the best way to deal with them is with a sense of humor.
	   ``Without a sense of humor you're finished. There's no hope,''
said Symington.
	   The presentation of credentials is a time-honored exercise of
diplomacy that symbolizes the importance the president has for the
relationship with the envoy's country. It is also an opportunity
for new ambassadors to have what in many cases is their only
one-on-one with the president of the United States.
	   The envoys and their families emerge from the meeting with
highly prized mementos: pictures with one of the world's most
powerful men that are prominently displayed on walls, pianos and
desks.
	   Lebanon's ambassador to Washington says the day he took his wife
and two teen-age boys with him to present his credentials to
President Bill Clinton was a ``great event.''
	   ``They were very happy,'' said Mohamad Chatah, recalling the
September 1997 ceremony. ``Everybody has heard of the White House
and the Oval Office, so there's something special about being
there.''
	   All ambassadors present their credentials _ official letters
establishing them as envoys _ to the president within a few weeks
or months of their arrival in Washington irrespective of the size
of their country or its relationship with the United States.
	   Depending on who's in the White House, the ceremony has peaked
in pomp and circumstance or has been simplified to suit the
president's schedule and priorities.
	   President George Bush sent limousines to pick up the envoys, who
were offered coffee, tea and juice before meeting with him.
President Jimmy Carter usually did not send limousines, but the
envoys had lunch at the White House dining room before or after
meeting the president. The Reagan ceremony was brief, the Bush one
more choreographed and homey. Mrs. Carter and Mrs. Bush were
usually on hand, Mrs. Reagan and Mrs. Clinton have stayed out of
the proceedings.
	   The person who plans the ceremony is the chief of protocol of
the White House, who is in fact a State Department staffer and is
also an assistant secretary of state.
	   The protocol chief acts as a mayor of the diplomatic corps, said
Evan Dobelle, who served in that post under President Carter. The
job includes taking care of the envoys' safety, the education of
their children and ambassadorial residences.
	   Several former protocol chiefs look back fondly on their days as
senior diplomats and chuckle when they recount their gaffes.
	   Symington said he didn't know exactly where to take the Sudanese
ambassador but didn't want to look indecisive.
	   ``The presidential aides were smiling and looking at me ... but
they weren't particularly helpful in directing me,'' recalled
Symington.
	   Joseph Reed has had his lapses.
	   On one occasion, Reed, who served under President Bush, greeted
what he thought was the ambassador of Gabon, a former French colony
in Africa, with his best Lausanne French.
	   ``I am the ambassador of Tanzania,'' came the response in Oxford
English.
	   ``I had gotten my welcome cards mixed up,'' recalled Reed. ``It
was so awful. But then we became great friends.''
	   Another embarrassing moment came when he sent a limousine to
pick up the Benin ambassador with the Benin flag flying upside
down.
	   That African country had just had a revolution and the flag was
new.
	   ``We weren't sure which side it was. But he didn't mind,'' said
Reed.
	   President Reagan's protocol chief, Selwa ``Lucky'' Roosevelt,
found herself in a quandary one chilly day in November 1983.
	   Peter Helemisi Mtetwa, the ambassador from Swaziland, showed up
for the presentation of credentials barefoot, wearing ceremonial
dress: a sheath covering a bit more than a loincloth and a spear.
	   Secret Service officials wouldn't let him see the president with
a ``lethal weapon,'' recalled Roosevelt. As she sent her assistants
to ``please explain this was not a serious threat to the
president,'' Roosevelt delayed the ambassador's entrance long
enough for someone to go warn Reagan about the envoy's garb.
	   Mtetwa did go in to see the president, spear in hand, said
Roosevelt.
	   ``That was an exception,'' she added.
	   Dobelle, who notes ``honestly and with great pleasure ... we
didn't make any mistakes,'' said being a protocol chief for four
years was a ``real privilege.''
	   ``It's a seat to history,'' said Dobelle. ``For me it was a
terrific ride.''

Rich residents accused of setting up `apartheid' with move to bar

<TEXT>
	   VUGHT, Netherlands (AP) _ Protesters on Wednesday accused a
group of rich residents of setting up a ``new apartheid'' by buying
a disused hospital for millions of guilders (dlrs) to prevent
asylum seekers being housed there.
	   A group of left-wing activists occupied the building known as De
Steffenberg after it was revealed Tuesday that a consortium of
residents had bought it for 3.7 million guilders (dlrs 1.9 million)
to prevent house prices in their leafy avenue plummeting.
	   ``This is like a new apartheid,'' said Socialist Party leader
Jan Marijnissen. ``People here are opting to live in a white
ghetto. It is white now and they want it to stay white.''
	   A government-funded bureau which finds accommodation for asylum
seekers had asked the municipality in this town 90 kilometers (56
miles) south of Dutch capital Amsterdam for permission to use the
former hospital to house 320 refugees pending the outcome of their
asylum requests.
	   But the residents' group wants the building to provide temporary
accommodation for elderly people forced out of their homes by
renovation work, Dutch daily De Volkskrant reported.
	   ``Their action is preventing the democratic process from taking
its course,'' Marijnissen said. He asked the government to
investigate ways of preventing similar actions in the future.
Marijnissen and 30 other protesters left the building peacefully in
the early afternoon.
	   The residents' group could not immediately be reached for
comment.
	   The Netherlands is struggling to find homes for an
ever-increasing number of refugees flooding across its borders. In
recent months, the government has set up three temporary tented
villages to house asylum seekers because all the permanent centers
are full.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top government official in Kosovo
warned in remarks published Wednesday that Serbia is running out of
patience with ethnic Albanian rebels and suggested it could launch
another large-scale action against them.
	   Veljko Odalovic, the province's leading official, accused the
Kosovo Liberation Army of taking advantage of an October truce to
take positions abandoned by withdrawing Serbian police and Yugoslav
army.
	   ``We have to defend our state, its integrity and people ... with
or without the international community,'' said Odalovic in an
interview with the Belgrade daily Glas. ``There will be problems,
but we will punish the last terrorist.''
	   Odalovic's comments came amid growing fears that the October
truce, mediated by American diplomats, could collapse altogether.
Four days of fierce fighting last week in northern Kosovo claimed
at least 15 lives and sent thousands fleeing.
	   Serb officials accuse the KLA of triggering the clashes by
attacking police and army in Kosovo. Yugoslavia, formed of Serbia
and Montenegro, on Tuesday urged the United Nations to declare the
KLA a terrorist organization and crack down on their support
network abroad.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is monitoring the Kosovo truce, has sent an additional 100
international observers to the province. They will bring to about
700 the number of Americans, Canadians and Europeans trying to ease
tensions in Kosovo.
	   An OSCE spokesman said the province was quiet Wednesday. On
Tuesday Serb sources reported that the bodies of five ethnic
Albanians were found in three different locations in Kosovo. It was
not clear who killed them.
	   Odalovic accused the independence-seeking rebels of trying to
frighten the minority Serbs into leaving Kosovo and create an
ethnically pure Albanian land. Ethnic Albanians make up some 90
percent of the population in Kosovo, a province in southern Serbia,
while the Serb population has decreased in the past decades.
	   ``There can be only one state here, one authority, one police
and one army. There is no space for any paramilitary forces,'' said
Odalovic, referring to the ethnic Albanians' struggle to form their
own state in Kosovo since Serbia revoked their autonomy in 1989.
	   ``We are not asking anything else from the international
community, but to let us use our legitimate right'' to crack down
on the KLA, said Odalovic.
	   A Serb crackdown against KLA earlier this year claimed over
1,000 lives and left some 300,000 people homeless. Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic ended it in the face of the threat of
NATO airstrikes.
	   NATO has said it is ready to act in fighting in Kosovo flares up
again.
	   Yugoslavia's Serb-led government says the ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army is a terrorist organization which should be branded
as such by world leaders in order to restrict its support from
Albanian expatriate communities in Switzerland, Germany and
elsewhere.
	   Yugoslavia's foreign minister Zivadin Jovanovic claimed Tuesday
the rebels have carried out 470 attacks since the October
agreement, including the killing of ethnic Albanians loyal to the
government.

False revolution hero arrested for fraud in Romania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A man who coaxed thousands of dollars
out of Romanian companies by evoking the name of a hero of the 1989
revolution has been arrested for suspected fraud, police said
Wednesday.
	   Catalin Alistar, 23, has been obtaining money and free services
for two years from companies that thought they were dealing with
the ``Gavroche'' of revolution fame, officer Mariana Apostol said.
	   The real Gavroche is Florin Vieru. Only a child during the
events that toppled communism, Vieru marched on the streets of the
capital waving a revolutionary flag. His picture appeared in the
media worldwide. He is now a taxi driver.
	   Alistar used to call managers of different companies pretending
to be a state secretary and saying someone nicknamed Gavroche would
come on his behalf to collect.
	   He was caught by police this week after receiving money from a
company in Focsani, 175 kilometers (110 miles) northeast of the
capital Bucharest.
	   Alistar admitted misleading even the Moldovan Interior Ministry,
which arranged for his accommodations and gave him presents during
a visit last year.
	   ``He managed to get tens of million lei (thousands of dollars)
from more than 20 companies in two years by appealing to their
naive patriotic feelings,'' Apostol said.

Israeli soldier killed by friendly fire in Lebanon

 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli soldier was killed and two were
wounded before dawn Wednesday when one Israeli army unit mistakenly
opened fire on another in southern Lebanon, an army commander said.
	   The two units had started out together on a patrol in Israel's
self-declared security zone in Lebanon, but were later separated
when one group lost its way.
	   ``The rear unit separated from the front forces and mistakenly
thought they were terrorists,'' Brig. Gen. Etti Eitan, an army
commander in the area, told Israel radio.
	   ``The rear force opened fire on the front force ... and as a
result of this, people were hurt,'' Eitan said.
	   Eitan said had requested and received permission from the base
commander to open fire.
	   The dead soldier was identified as Staff Sgt. Ohad Zach, 19,
from the northern village of Nofit.
	   Israel has occupied the zone since 1985 to prevent cross-border
guerrilla attacks. With rising casualties, public pressure has been
mounting to withdraw Israel's 2,000 soldiers from Lebanon.
	   Zach's mother told the radio that army commanders had ignored
warnings from soldiers that there were problems with path finding
and orientation within the unit.
	   ``If soldiers warn about a problem, they know what they're
saying, and commanders have to pay attention,'' she said. ``The
front shot the back, the back shot the front, and Ohad is no
more.''
	   David Bar-Illan, a senior aide to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, said Zach's death, the 24th Israeli casualty in
Lebanon this year, did not affect the ongoing Cabinet debate over
withdrawal from Lebanon.
	   ``It does not change the need for safety of the people in the
Galilee,'' Bar-Illan said, referring to the section of northern
Israel that the security zone is designed to protect.
	   Bar-Illan denied that Israel is losing its edge in southern
Lebanon.
	   ``One soldier killed by friendly fire, if that was indeed the
case, doesn't indicate anything except that in one incident it was
a case of negligence,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Wednesday's incident was the second case of injuries from
friendly fire this month. Zach was to be buried later Wednesday.

Minister: Egypt has no plans to sell natural gas to Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's oil minister said Wednesday that the
country has no plans to open negotiations to supply natural gas to
Israel.
	   He was responding to an announcement on Tuesday in Israel that
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon instructed the country's
national electricity supplier to open talks, saying the state-run
Egyptian General Petroleum Corp. had sent a letter expressing
interest in a deal.
	   The Israeli ministry said negotiations with EGPC over price and
the quantity of gas to be supplied were to begin in the next few
days.
	   But Egyptian Oil Minister Hamdy el-Banbi said in a statement on
Wednesday that all the gas produced by EGPC was being consumed
domestically and that Egypt planned to buy more from international
companies working in Egypt.
	   ``EGPC has signed a number of agreements with foreign companies
to buy its shares for the years to come to meet increasing domestic
demands for natural gas,'' he said in the statement, which was
faxed to The Associated Press.
	   Banbi said, however, that international companies working in the
country _ including America's Amoco and the Italian Agip _ have
been in contact with Israel about gas deals.
	   ``These companies _ including Amoco and Agip _ have been trying
for years to ensure their shares in the international market,''
Banbi said. He noted they have been in contact with a number of
countries in the region, including Israel and Turkey.
	   Relations between Israel and Egypt have been strained in recent
months by the deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
	   Egypt maintains a `cold peace'' with the Jewish state with few
commercial or economic ties.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli soldier was killed and two were
wounded before dawn Wednesday when one Israeli army unit mistakenly
opened fire on another in southern Lebanon, an army commander said.
	   The two units had started out together on a patrol in Israel's
self-declared security zone in Lebanon, but were later separated
when one group lost its way.
	   ``The rear unit separated from the front forces and mistakenly
thought they were terrorists,'' Brig. Gen. Etti Eitan, an army
commander in the area, told Israel radio.
	   ``The rear force opened fire on the front force ... and as a
result of this, people were hurt,'' Eitan said.
	   Eitan said the rear unit had requested and received permission
from the base commander to open fire.

PSG defender joins Gullit's Magpies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEWCASTLE, England (AP) _ Didier Domi joined Newcastle from
Paris Saint Germain on Wednesday and is set to make his Premier
League debut Jan. 9 against high-flying Chelsea, former club of
Magpies manager Ruud Gullit.
	   The 20-year-old defender, who has lost his place on the PSG
lineup, signed a 4 1/2-year contract worth 3.25 million pounds
(dlrs 5.4 million). The fee will rise to 4 million (dlrs 6.7
million) depending on the number of appearances he makes for his
new club.
	   ``I'm young but I'm very happy to be at Newcastle,'' Domi said
on his arrival at St. James' Park. ``The Premier League is very
good and the truth will be shown when I play. It's there that you
will see my true worth.''
	   Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit, who is trying to revive the
team's fortunes after 18 months of lackluster performances, said
Domi would fit in neatly to the left side of defense.
	   ``He's a very good positional player,'' he said. ``Of course in
England that is something we are not used to because in England
people want to have players who can tackle and run. But it's also
important to have the right position because if you are in the
right position, you don't have to tackle.''

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A 52-year-old driver was killed when her
truck exploded as it was being loaded with kerosene in central
Ukraine, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   A spark of electricity set off the blast, local officials said,
according to the daily Segodnya.
	   Firefighters at the oil plant in the town of Pryluky quickly put
out the flames, protecting 17 large containers of fuel nearby. But
they could not save the truck's driver, Valentyna Kyrychenko,
Segodnya said.

Hollioake scores 81 in England victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ England's Adam Hollioake scored 81
runs from 78 balls Wednesday as England defeated Queensland Country
by 53 runs in a limited-overs match at the Gabba.
	   Hollioake was the man of the series when England swept Australia
3-0 the last time the countries played one-day matches in 1997 and
he looked in equally strong form Wednesday.
	   His performance put the Englishmen on their way to 281-7 from
their 50 overs, a target which proved too much for the Queensland
Country side which was bowled out for 228 in 49.5 overs.
	   Hollioake, overlooked for the Ashes series, came to the crease
with his side struggling at 83-4 in the 20th over but scored runs
from a tiring attack and struck 10 boundaries to all parts of the
ground.
	   He was well-supported by younger brother Ben (51) while Mark
Alleyne added an unbeaten 52 from 49 balls, including a massive six
over mid-wicket off the final delivery of the innings.
	   Brad Smith was the pick of the country bowlers with 3-39 from
eight overs while Wayne Smith picked up 2-33 from his seven overs.
	   Controlled English bowling ensured Queensland Country never
looked likely of reeling in a big target on a damp outfield despite
the determined efforts of Brian May (59), David Todd (42) and Shane
Rynne (44 not out).
	   Country moved solidly to 86-1 after 22 overs before Todd holed
out to Gavin Hamilton at deep square leg from spinner Ashley Giles.
	   Former test spinner Robert Croft was introduced midway through
the innings and slowed the Country batting to finish with 2-28 off
seven overs, including the wicket of May who was well-stumped by
John Crawley.
	   Crawley, who continued his poor batting form with a 19,
performed well behind the stumps with three catches while Alleyne
backed up his batting effort with 3-31.
	   Wednesday's game was the first outing for the English one-day
squad which will contest the tri-series against Australia and world
champion Sri Lanka next month.
	   Ten of the 16-man English squad played against Queensland
Country, with Ashes players Alec Stewart, Nasser Hussain, Graeme
Hick, Dean Headley, Darren Gough and Alan Mullally to join the
squad after the fifth test. (djp)

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemen faced criticism Wednesday from Britain
after its troops stormed the hideout of Islamic militant kidnappers
holding 16 Western hostages. Four of the hostages _ three Britons
and an Australian _ and three kidnappers were killed.
	   Two other hostages were wounded during the siege near the
southern town of Mawdiyah, about 175 miles (280 kilometers) south
of the capital, San`a. The remaining 10 hostages were freed
unharmed.
	   The kidnappers, members of Islamic Jihad in Yemen, had demanded
the release from prison of two of the group's leaders and were
protesting the recent U.S.-British airstrikes against Iraq, Yemeni
security officials said.
	   Yemen's Interior Ministry blamed the kidnappers for the deaths,
saying that security forces intervened after the kidnappers began
killing the hostages. The security forces also captured three of
the kidnappers, including a leader, the ministry said.
	   ``They proceeded in killing the captives after refusing any
attempts at negotiations, which led security forces to storm the
area to prevent further bloodshed and ensure the safe release of
the rest of the hostages,'' a ministry statement said.
	   But British newspapers accused Yemeni authorities of intervening
prematurely. The Daily Mail asked on the front page, ``Did our
tourists really need to die?''
	   British Ambassador Vic Henderson reportedly had pleaded with the
San`a government to do nothing ``that in any way could jeopardize
the safety of the hostages.''
	   A London-based Islamic human rights group said Tuesday that it
had contacted the kidnappers the night before and received
assurances that they would not harm the hostages.
	   ``We hold the Yemeni government responsible for the deaths. The
way the authorities handled the situation was barbaric and
irresponsible,'' said a spokesman for the Islamic Observation
Center.
	   Foreigners often are kidnapped in Yemen, large parts of which
are run by tribes. But until now the hostages usually have been
treated well and released unharmed. Tribesmen typically use
kidnappings to pressure the government into providing new roads,
water or clinics.
	   This was the first time an abduction was carried out by Islamic
militants. Security officials said the kidnappers belong to Islamic
Jihad, many of whose leaders fought Russian troops in Afghanistan.
The group is believed to have about 200 members.
	   The 16 tourists, 12 Britons, two Americans and two Australians,
were kidnapped Monday near Mawdiyah.
	   In London, the Foreign Office confirmed that three Britons _
Ruth Williamson, Margaret Whitehouse and Peter Rowe _ were killed,
but did not provide their ages or hometowns.
	   The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the
fourth victim was a 35-year-old man from Sydney whose name would
not be released until next of kin had been informed.
	   The tourists wounded in the clash were an American woman and a
British woman.
	   Al-Jamhouriya Hospital in the southern port of Aden said the two
wounded were women, that one was shot in the shoulder and the other
in the pelvis, and that both had lost a lot of blood.
	   Relatives of one of the women, Claire Marston of Britain, told
reporters she was in critical condition Wednesday. She was married
to Canadian-born Peter Rowe, one of the four hostages killed.
	   The surviving hostages were recovering from their ordeal at a
hotel in Aden, where British and American volunteers helped them
cope with their trauma, said David Pearce, a British Embassy
official in San`a.
	   ``They are obviously in a state of severe shock, and I mean
severe shock,'' Pearce told the British news agency Press
Association. ``They are uninjured but obviously very tired, very
stunned and in need of a good meal, a good rest and someone to talk
to. They have been through an awful experience.''
	   After the shootout, security forces detained scores of suspected
Islamic extremists, said the officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   The kidnapping began Monday when the tourists' convoy of five
vehicles was ambushed by men who opened fire on their police
escorts. The kidnappers threatened to kill the tourists if the
police did not back off, Yemeni security officials said.
	   The kidnappers demanded the release of their leader, Saleh
Haidara al-Atwi, who was detained two weeks ago in a government
crackdown on Islamic vigilantes who had been enforcing strict
Islamic rules in southern Yemen, security officials said.
	   The kidnappers also wanted the release of another leader and
were protesting the recent U.S. and British airstrikes against
Iraq, the officials said.
	   The officials identified one of the captured kidnappers as Osama
al-Masri of Egypt.

Fog disrupts air traffic in Warsaw
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 6th graf with Delta flight canceled, the airline
refusing info about passengers stranded in Prague, new forecast &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Thick fog over Warsaw delayed most
outgoing flights Wednesday and forced airlines to reroute incoming
planes.
	   Anna Jozwik, spokeswoman for Warsaw's Okecie airport, said the
cloud level was low at 90 meters (300 feet) and visibility poor.
	   Planes were rerouted to other airports in Poland, such as Krakow
or Poznan, while a Delta flight from New York City landed in the
Czech capital of Prague.
	   Delta officials in Prague said all passengers were fine, but
refused to say how many were stranded and how they could get to
Warsaw.
	   After waiting more than four hours, about 80 passengers booked
on the return Delta flight from Warsaw to New York were told it was
canceled. Airline officials said they were hoping the weather
improves by Thursday so that the plane could make it from Prague to
Warsaw and then take off for New York.
	   Airline authorities also canceled all domestic flights, Jozwik
added.
	   Jozwik said 16 international flights had left Warsaw by noon,
all behind schedule.
	   Despite traffic disruption, only about 100 people were waiting
for departures at the airport. Jozwik said there are generally few
passengers at the turn of the year.
	   The weather, which already cleared in northern part of Warsaw,
was expected to improve in the airport area in late afternoon.

Israeli soldier killed by friendly fire in Lebanon

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with commander confirming soldier was
killed by friendly fire, details, comment from soldier's mother. &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli army unit in southern Lebanon
mistakenly opened fire on another unit before dawn Wednesday,
killing one soldier and wounding two, an army commander said.
	   The two units had started out on patrol together in Israel's
self-declared security zone, but were separated when one group lost
its way.
	   ``The rear unit separated from the front forces and mistakenly
thought they were terrorists,'' Brig. Gen. Etti Eitan, an army
commander in the area, told Israel radio.
	   ``The rear force opened fire on the front force ... and as a
result of this, people were hurt,'' Eitan said.
	   Eitan said the rear unit had requested and received permission
from the base commander to open fire.
	   The dead soldier was identified as Staff Sgt. Ohad Zach, 19,
from the northern village of Nofit.
	   Israel has occupied the zone since 1985 to prevent cross-border
guerrilla attacks. With casualties rising, public pressure has been
mounting to withdraw Israel's 2,000 soldiers from Lebanon.
	   Zach's mother told Israel radio that army commanders had ignored
warnings from soldiers that there were problems with path-finding
and orientation within the unit.
	   ``If soldiers warn about a problem, they know what they're
saying, and commanders have to pay attention,'' she said. ``The
front shot the back, the back shot the front, and Ohad is no
more.''
	   David Bar-Illan, a senior aide to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, said Zach's death, the 24th Israeli casualty in
Lebanon this year, did not affect the ongoing Cabinet debate over
withdrawing.
	   ``It does not change the need for safety of the people in the
Galilee,'' Bar-Illan said, referring to the section of northern
Israel that the occupied zone is designed to protect.
	   Bar-Illan denied that Israel is losing its edge in southern
Lebanon.
	   ``One soldier killed by friendly fire, if that was indeed the
case, doesn't indicate anything except that in one incident it was
a case of negligence,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Wednesday's shooting was the second case of injuries from
friendly fire this month. Zach was to be buried later Wednesday.

Germany defends finance minister's decision to skip Brussels
</HEADLINE>
meeting &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The German government on Wednesday defended
Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine's decision not to attend a
European Union meeting at which the exchange rate for the euro will
be formally set.
	   Lafontaine will be on vacation and Germany will be represented
at the Thursday meeting of EU finance and economics ministers
(Ecofin) by Economics Minister Werner Mueller, finance ministry
spokesman Torsten Albig said.
	   The general secretary of the opposition Christian Democrats,
Angela Merkel, accused Lafontaine of lacking ``a feel for historic
situations,'' and called his absence ``embarrassing.''
	   Albig said both the finance and economics ministers were
entitled to represent Germany at the meeting.
	   ``There's no rule about who goes and who doesn't. They are
interchangeable,'' said Albig.
	   ``Our economics minister will be our high-ranking and highly
qualified representative,'' Albig said.
	   The euro's exchange rate will be fixed Thursday, a day before it
becomes the currency of 11 EU nations.

Egypt, Israel and Palestinians to establish hi-tech park
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANA BUDEIRI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel, Eygpt and the Palestinian Authority
plan to establish a hi-tech industrial park on the edge of the Gaza
Strip, an Israeli government official said Wednesday.
	   In the beginning, organizers plan to build a hi-tech college to
be attended by Egyptian, Palestinian and Israeli students.
	   There are hopes that the project will later entice large
international companies to set up shop on the grounds and provide
jobs for the students, said Shlomo Dror, a spokesman for the Israel
government's Palestinian affairs adviser.
	   The school is to open in about two years on the southern tip of
Gaza, on a patch of land shared by Israel, Egypt and the
Palestinians.
	   The project will be funded largely by private investment, and is
aimed at creating job opportunities, especially in the Palestinian
areas where unemployment runs as high as 30 percent.
	   Representatives from Egypt, Israel and the Palestinian Authority
met for the first time Tuesday to discuss the project that was
initiated by Israeli industrialist Steff Wertheimer.
	   Gaza already has one industrial park at the Karni crossing
between Israel and the coastal strip. However, Karni focuses on
manufacturing and offers mainly blue-collar jobs to Palestinians.

Six rockets fired on army camp in Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Six rockets slammed into an Indian army
camp and injured two soldiers Wednesday in Srinagar, the city at
the center of a separatist movement in Indian Kashmir, an army
spokesman said.
	   The army said it did not know who fired the rockets or from
where. Some barracks and a workshop were damaged in the attack.
	   Soldiers immediately cordoned off residential areas around the
camp and conducted house-to-house searches for the attackers. One
suspected militant was arrested.
	   It was the first time in two years that rockets have been fired
on the army in Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state.
In 1996, rockets were fired near a stadium where a parade was under
way to celebrate India's republic day.
	   Dozens of groups in Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state,
have been fighting government troops since 1989 to secede from
predominantly Hindu India, either to become independent or join
with neighboring Islamic country of Pakistan. More than 17,000
people have been killed since the fighting began.

Birth of the euro marks beginning of a new era in Europe

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The birth of the euro is nigh. All the
hype and high anxiety will be turned into reality at midnight
Thursday when 11 European nations deliver their joint currency and
unite their monetary policies, a giant step towards further unity.
	   The euro will live as a virtual currency alongside German marks,
French francs, Italian lire and the rest for three years before it
consigns them to the history books and become the single street
currency from Spain's Mediterranean beaches to deep into Finland's
frozen tundra.
	   The finance ministers and central bankers from the 11 European
Union nations meet here Thursday to irrevocably lock the parities
of their currencies at set against the euro before toasting the
creation of the new currency, perhaps the most significant
development in the drive towards European unity since World War II.
	   On Jan 1, the euro will become a new trading currency around the
world and the Frankfurt-based European Central Bank will decide on
the monetary fate of the 11 euro nations. The euro is expected to
trade at around dlrs 1.18.
	   Of the 15 EU nations only Greece failed to make the strict
monetary conditions for joining, while Britain, Sweden and Denmark
decided to opt out for the time being, fearful the euro will erode
their cherished sovereignty. Surrendering one's currency
automatically means surrendering the right to set independent
monetary policy for domestic reasons, such as boosting the economy
or improving social conditions.
	   The euro will be the most palpable sign yet of European
integration, and will streamline trade in a bloc of 290 million
people with an economic clout rivaling that of the United States.
Prices will be easy to compare, international business will be
easier and intra-euro trade will no longer be hostage to fickle
currency fluctuations, a major boon for businesses.
	   For the world at large, visiting the 11 EU nations will become
somewhat easier, since they will be able to use euros when they pay
with credit cards and checks. Yet for the odd postcard and ice
cream, they will have to rely on the national currencies for three
more years. Euro notes and coins won't be issued until the first
half of 2002 only.
	   Banks, bonds and stock markets and international businesses do
not have that leeway and will spend the whole New Year weekend
adapting trading floors and computer screens to include the joint
currency to be ready when the euro show up for its first working
day on Monday.
	   ``We will be forced to deal simultaneously with francs and euros
in our whole computer system during the first three-year period.
That's why we had to change 60,000 of our computer systems,'' said
Jean-Francois Colin, euro coordinator of France's Banque Nationale
de Paris.
	   The markets also want to minimize the risk of last minute
foul-ups during the few days of transition.
	   ``There is a lot of work that goes into the planning for this.
Banks and institutions have been working for many, many years.
We've have lots of dress rehearsals, lots of testing,'' said
Margaret Soden, a senior Manager of euro planning at the
London-based HSBC Bank.
	   There will also be festive events. Balloons, bearing the euro
symbol, will be sent skywards from EU headquarters in Brussels.

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ A journalist's account and a
statement by an Islamic group received Wednesday in Dubai challenge
the Yemeni government's story of how four Western hostages were
killed in the country's south.
	   After the shootout Tuesday, a Yemeni Interior Ministry statement
said troops opened fire after the kidnappers, who were members of a
radical Islamic group, began killing some of the 16 Western
hostages they were holding.
	   But a Yemeni journalist who spoke to the Dubai bureau of The
Associated Press and a statement from the group Aden's Islamic Army
both suggest Yemeni soldiers opened fire without warning in an
apparent attempt to rescue the hostages.
	   ``The army and security forces started the indiscriminate attack
on the area where the hostages were being held using all kinds of
weapons, including heavy weapons, without any warning or notice,''
said the statement from the group, believed to be an offshoot of
Islamic Jihad, which held the hostages.
	   The journalist _ who spoke on condition of anonymity _ said he
talked with some of the freed hostages who said they were taken by
surprise when grenades suddenly were tossed at them and then their
captors fired back.
	   ``Some of us were injured by the grenades and others in the
crossfire,'' the journalist quoted one of the freed Westerners as
saying.
	   A member of the al-Fadl tribe, to which the kidnappers belonged,
also said Wednesday that after the shootout started, some of the
kidnappers tried to escape using the hostages as human shields.
	   Four hostages died and two were wounded during the siege near
the southern town of Mawdiyah, about 175 miles (280 kilometers)
south of the capital San`a. The remaining 10 hostages were freed
unharmed, and three of the captors were killed.

	   MULCHAND, India (AP) _ With a dozen churches in ruins, Christian
congregations in western India are canceling New Year prayers this
year, fearful of provoking more violence from radical Hindus on an
anti-missionary crusade.
	   In the last five days, animosity has polarized Hindu and
Christian villagers in the dry hills of Gujarat.
	   The troubles also are rebounding against the governing Hindu
nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which is facing demands to
protect the Christian minority from its affiliated Hindu parties.
Its hard core supporters say missionaries are bribing poor Hindus _
sometimes by offering them jobs _ to become Christian. The
missionaries deny this.
	   In the latest incidents, two prayer halls in southern Gujarat
were razed Tuesday. Since Friday, 17 churches, prayer halls or
Christian schools have been attacked by mobs wielding axes, iron
bars, hammers and stones.
	   In Mulchand, a village of just 500 people, gold and silver
Christmas tinsel hangs from the charred mud-tiled roof of the
Protestant church. Flags of saffron, an auspicious color in
Hinduism, fly from many of the thatched huts where Hindus live.
	   ``We usually have a big New Year service just like the Christmas
service. This year we're afraid to pray publicly,'' said Avinash
Prabhakar. About one-fourth of the people are Christians in
Mulchand, a farming village 130 kilometers (80 miles) from the
nearest city, Surat.
	   Harish Armali, a Hindu, said the damage to Mulchand is deep and
permanent. ``There will be no peace now. We cannot be together
after this, our ties are severed,'' said Armali, who said Christian
schools required pupils to read from the Bible.
	   The small chapel in nearby Jamalpada was one of the first
sanctuaries stormed. Bamboo poles prop up the wooden beams of the
skeletal frame, and smashed tiles litter the ground. The only wall
left standing is adorned with a paper crucifix _ once the backdrop
of the altar.
	   Hansa Parmar, 10, saw a mob hurling stones at an empty Christian
boarding school. ``I first thought it was raining stones. Then I
got very scared of their shouting. Why do they want to chase us
away?''
	   The trouble began Christmas Day when Hindus attending a rally
hurled insults at Christian women returning from a prayer meeting
in the town of Ahwa. Stones quickly began flying in both
directions.
	   An anti-missionary call was taken up at a convention of the
extremist Vishwa Hindu Parishad. On Sunday, Ashok Singhal, leader
of the VHP which stands for World Hindu Council, accused
missionaries of converting gullible, illiterate tribespeople with
promises of jobs or financial gain.
	   Singhal aroused a storm of protest when he denounced the late
Mother Teresa and said the Nobel prize awarded this year to
economist to Indian-born Amartya Sen year was part of a conspiracy
to justify Christian education in India.
	   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, whose Bharatiya Janata
Party shares an ideological parent with the VHP, described as
unfortunate the statements of some VHP leaders. ``We consider all
world as a family,'' he said. Some newspapers spoke Wednesday of an
emerging rift between the BJP and its more hardline support groups.
	   Fear of missionaries is deeply embedded in India, and
anti-missionary actions flare up periodically. The conversion of
Hindus is seen as a continuing legacy of British colonial rule. At
the same time, competition is stiff for places in private ``convent
schools,'' which teach in English and are considered far superior
to government schools, and are open to everyone.
	   Private Christian schools are normally open to anyone who can
pay the relatively high fees and does not object to the Christian
orientation, which may include regular prayers and classes in
ethics.
	   While convent schools are coveted by the urban elite,
missionaries are most active among rural indigenous tribes and low
caste Hindus. Christians are 2.5 percent of India's population of
nearly 1 billion.
	   Some priests, speaking on condition on anonymity, said many
conversions do take place in remote villages, but they denied
resorting to bribes or inducements.
	   In Mulchand, Nanubhai Zhugrabhoy said some people turned to
Christianity after they were cured of debilitating diseases, from
tuberculosis to alcoholism. ``I am the only Christian from a Hindu
family. When I was ill I came to the church and found help. Then I
took on this religion.''
	   Preetesh Rangdeve, 20, whose father converted to Christianity
years ago, said missionaries had helped low caste Hindus with
education and employment. ``Now the people who neglected villagers
for years are telling them to come back and become Hindus,'' he
said.
	   Economic and social interests are also at stake, because upper
caste Hindus fear they will lose the advantage they have over the
illiterate lower castes, say some missionaries. ``They are not
attacking us for our religion. They are against us because we
educated the lower castes. This is a caste war,'' said the Rev.
Oscar Barreto, a Roman Catholic priest.

Former East German communists stick by plan to hire ex-spy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Despite sharp criticism from conservatives,
the former East German communists held fast Wednesday to their plan
to hire a convicted spy who betrayed NATO secrets during the Cold
War.
	   ``We don't ask the other party's in Bonn whether they happen to
have former spies working for them,'' said Juergen Reents,
spokesman for the ex-communist party's parliamentary faction.
	   Rainer Rupp, a former communist mole at NATO headquarters, has
been serving a 12-year prison term since his 1994 for conviction
for spying. But he was moved Monday to a minimum-security facility,
meaning he can hold an outside job during the day.
	   Rupp, a west German, said he wanted to work as an adviser on
foreign and security affairs in parliament for the Party of
Democratic Socialism _ successor party to the East German
communists.
	   PDS leaders said they were interested in the offer. Reents said
he would not be a regular employee, but could work on a contract
basis.
	   Conservative lawmakers called the proposal ``grotesque'' and
``cheeky,'' and said they would ask a parliamentary rules committee
to examine the case.
	   But the parliamentary president, Wolfgang Thierse, of the ruling
Social Democrats, warned against a ``shutting out and abuse
campaign'' against the PDS.
	   Greens legal affairs expert Volker Beck called for a review of
the treatment of spies for East and West. Those who spied for the
communists should not be treated differently than those who spied
for the West, as long as they did not directly harm anyone, he
said.
	   Rupp was convicted in 1994 of handing over sensitive strategy
plans, codes and military preparedness to his communist contacts
when he worked at NATO headquarters in Belgium from 1977 to 1989.
	   During his trial, he said he acted out of the belief he was
helping to preserve world peace.

Chechnya's president says warlords can't remove him
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya's president said Wednesday that warlords
attempting to drive him from office would not succeed because he
still had the support of the people who had elected him in the
breakaway region.
	   President Aslan Maskhadov has seen many of his former allies
turn against him in recent months and mount a concerted campaign to
remove him as Chechnya's leader.
	   But Maskhadov said it would prove impossible ``to crush a
popularly elected president,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Maskhadov was a top guerrilla commander in the 1994-6 war
against Russia, and he won an overwhelming election victory shortly
after the war ended and the Russian troops left. But he's been
unable to bring law-and-order to Chechnya or rebuild the fractured
economy.
	   As a result, a number of war-time colleagues have deserted him.
They tried to impeach Maskhadov and accused him of violating
Chechnya's constitution, but the country's top Islamic court ruled
in Maskhadov's favor.
	   ``The proud ... Chechen people are standing behind me,''
Maskhadov said.
	   However, the court suspended parliament's ability to make laws,
dealing a blow to Maskhadov, who could usually count on the
lawmakers to support him.
	   Chechnya has run its own affairs since the Russian troops
withdrew in 1996, but no country has recognized its independence
claim and Moscow continues to consider the southern republic a part
of Russia.
	   Hundreds of people have been abducted for ransom in Chechnya in
recent years. In an unusually gruesome display of lawlessness, four
Western captives were beheaded earlier this month.

Israel's parliament bans genetic cloning of humans for five years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's parliament has passed legislation that
bans the cloning of humans for the next five years and monitors
genetic research, the sponsor of the bill said Wednesday.
	   ``Human cloning endangers humanity as seriously as nuclear
weapons,'' said Labor Party legislator Hagai Merom. ``That also
began as an experiment but later became a weapon of mass
destruction.''
	   The law which passed Tuesday allows genetic intervention for
medical purposes, such as cloning a healthy organ for donation.
	   Researchers wishing to conduct experiments in human genetics
must show an advisory committee that their research does not
violate the ban.
	   Violation of the ban is punishable by two years in prison.
	   The committee will report yearly to the science minister to
reassess whether the outlawed research harms human dignity.
	   Merom said that doctors, researchers, legislators, philosophers
and religious leaders discussed the issue for 18 months before
agreeing to the five-year moratorium. In 2003, parliament will
decide whether to renew the ban.
	   Merom said parliament was guided in its decision by other
countries and several U.S. states that have also banned human
cloning.
	   Unlike Christian leaders who have called for a ban on human
cloning, Israel's Chief Rabbinate has said Jewish law does not
necessarily rule it out.

Euro-zone inflation rate falls below 1 percent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With The Euro &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The annual inflation rate in the 11
nations that adopt the euro as their shared currency on Jan. 1 fell
to 0.9 percent in November, the European Union's statistics agency
reported Wednesday.
	   The fall continued the steady decline of inflation in the
euro-zone over the past year. Annual inflation stood at 1 percent
in October and 1.6 percent in November 1997, according to
Eurostat's monthly report.
	   In the 15 nation EU as a whole, inflation fell to 1 percent in
November compared to 1.5 percent in the United States and 0.8
percent in Japan.
	   Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium,
Austria, Portugal, Finland, Ireland and Luxembourg are set to adopt
the euro as a common currency at midnight on New Year's Eve.
	   The latest figures may hint at trouble ahead for the euro-zone
with significant increases over the year in Portugal and Ireland.
With the European Central Bank setting a common interest rate for
the whole bloc, some economists fear the low rate designed to boost
core EU economies like France and Germany may bring overheating in
smaller nations with faster growth.
	   There was good news for Greece which was kept out of the
euro-zone for failing to meet economic conditions for joining,
including low inflation. It's rate was 3.9 percent in November down
from 5 percent a year before. Greece hops to join the euro-zone in
2001.
	   Denmark, Sweden and Britain decided to stay out of the euro for
political reasons.
	   Eurostat gave the following rates for November 1998, with
November 1997 in brackets:
	   Sweden, 0.1 (2.7); France, 0.2 (1.4); Germany, 0.6 (1.4);
Austria, 0.5 (1.1); Luxembourg, 0.5 (1.5); Belgium, 0.6 (1.3
percent); Denmark, 1.1 (1.6); Netherlands, 1.5 (2.5); Finland, 0.9
(1.8); Britain, 1.4 (1.9); Spain, 1.4 (1.9); Italy, 1.7 (1.8);
Portugal, 2.6 (1.9); Ireland, 2.2 (1.1); Greece, 3.9 (5).

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Keisuke Kinoshita, a prominent Japanese director
noted for tackling contemporary social problems and depicting the
beauty of human weakness in his films, died at his home in Tokyo on
Wednesday, his family said. He was 86.
	   The cause of death was a stroke, said a family member.
	   Kinoshita, a native of Hamamatsu in central Japan, joined what
is now Shochiku Co., one of Japan's major movie companies, in 1933.
	   He made his directorial debut with ``Hanasaku Minato'' (The Port
where Flowers Bloom) in 1943, the same year Akira Kurosawa directed
his first film. Kurosawa, one of Japan's most famous filmmakers,
died at the age of 88 on Sept. 6.
	   Kinoshita's most successful and best known film was ``Nijushi No
Hitomi'' (Twenty-four Eyes), which won the Kinema Jumpo Award, one
of Japan's top cinema prizes, as the best movie of 1954.
	   It depicts the warm relationship between a female teacher and 12
pupils over the course of three decades, including the devastation
of World War II.
	   ``Kinoshita depicted the feelings and beauty of human weakness,
in contrast to Kurosawa, who depicted people's strength,'' said
Taichi Yamada, a noted Japanese playwright.
	   Kinoshita's other famous films include ``Karumen Kokyo Ni
Kaeru'' (Carmen Comes Home) in 1951 and ``Narayama-Bushi Ko'' (The
Ballad of Narayama) in 1958
	   According to critics, a hallmark of Kinoshita's work was his
fondness for long, panoramic shots that offer the viewer a feel for
the setting of his films.
	   For a time, Kinoshita directed dramas for television, but
returned to making films in 1976 with ``Shodo Satsujin, Musukoyo''
(Impulse Murder, My Son).
	   He was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with
Rosette from the Japanese government in 1984 for his contributions
to the film industry.
	   Kinoshita is survived by three adopted sons. A funeral service
was planned for Jan. 8 at Tokyo's Tsukiji Honganji Buddhist Temple.

Soccer strike deals blow to already reeling sport
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Just when Greek soccer fans hoped the
worst was over, they learned the new year will bring even more
anguish: a soccer club strike in a sport reeling from fan violence
and corruption allegations.
	   All first, second and third division games planned for this
weekend were called off Tuesday due to a strike called by the
Association of Professional Soccer Clubs, or EPAE.
	   The association, which organizes Greece's top three soccer
leagues, is demanding 300 million drachmas (more than dlrs 1
million) that it says are owed by the state agency that organizes
the weekly soccer pools.
	   The association has also demanded an increase in the percentage
of pool profits it receives. But the agency, known as OPAP, has
refused to budge.
	   Unless the agency pays the 300 million drachmas by Jan. 4, EPAE
has threatened to extend its strike to cover the weekend of Jan.
9-11.
	   This would force a second postponement of the matches.
	   ``A hungry bear can't dance. We will play if OPAP gives us the
money,'' said Petros Theodoridis, the owner of the first-division
Iraklis team, according to the daily Sportime newspaper.
	   EPAE's strike appears to be further reducing the public's
interest in soccer _ which is losing ground in Greece to
basketball.
	   ``It will not be the end of the world if there is no soccer for
a few weeks,'' the Athens daily Kathimerini quoted Sports Minister
Andreas Fouras as saying.
	   His comments seem to reflect the feelings of many soccer
followers, who have shown no signs of being troubled by the
prospect of two weekends without matches.
	   The strike comes towards the end of the holiday season, with
most people taking advantage of the long weekend to head to the
countryside.
	   But a recent series of violent fan clashes and allegations of
bribery and corruption have already diminished the game's appeal to
mainstream followers.
	   Sparked by accusations of biased refereeing, a wave of vandalism
and violence began in November. It led to harsh criticism of the
sport in a parliamentary committee report.
	   ``Our country is being internationally defamed at the time it is
preparing to organize the Olympic Games,'' the report said.
	   Rioting fans during a first division match on Dec. 8 between
Olympiakos Piraeus and its main rival Panathinaikos left a stream
of burnt cars, battered bystanders and damaged seats from the
stadium set to host the 2004 Olympic Games.
	   Last year, nearly half the country's 300 lawmakers issued a
statement complaining soccer ``is being led to decline and
extermination.''

Schmitt edge Wildhoelzl to win first of Four Hills
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OBERSTHOF, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Martin Schmitt Wednesday
reaffirmed his dominance this year in ski jumping, outleaping
Austria's Andreas Goldberger to capture the first of the Four Hills
tournaments.
	   The 20-year-old Schmitt compiled 244.8 points, edging Goldberger
at 242.8, to win his fifth event in seven outings this season.
	   The sudden popularity of Schmitt in Germany, who has emerged
from nowhere this season, lured 25,000 spectators to see the first
event of the 47-year-old tournament.
	   ``The mood here was crazy, it was fun,'' said Schmitt. ``I'm
sure the attention will get even worse, but I think I know when to
turn off.''
	   Japan's Noriaki Kasai finished third at 241.7 points while
Andreas Widhoelzl faded to fourth after soaring 124.0 meters on his
first leap.
	   Schmitt's second clean jump of 115.5 meters, as a backwind died
and dropped distances, thrust him into the lead. His first attempt
had been 120.0.
	   Wildhoelzl, leaping afterwards, failed to keep pace and flew
only 109.5 meters.
	   ``He knew he had to jump at least 111, 112 meters. He probably
put himself under too much pressure,'' said Schmitt.
	   The other three events will be held at Garmisch-Partenkirchen on
New Year's Day, Innsbruck on Jan. 3 and Bischofshofen on Jan. 6.
	   The Four Hills tournament is regarded as ski jumping's most
prestigious prize outside of the Olympics and world championships.

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemen faced a barrage of criticism Wednesday
after its troops stormed the hideout of Islamic extremist
kidnappers holding 16 Western hostages. Four of the hostages were
killed.
	   Two other hostages were wounded during the siege Tuesday near
the southern town of Mawdiyah, about 175 miles (280 kilometers)
south of the capital, San`a. The remaining 10 hostages were freed
unharmed.
	   One of the wounded, Claire Marston of Britain, was ``in a very
bad way,'' British diplomat David Pearce told reporters at
Al-Jamhouriya Hospital in the southern port of Aden.
	   Marston was awake after surgery on her shoulder _ where she was
shot _ and knew her husband, Canadian-born Peter Rowe, had been
killed, Pearce said.
	   The two women were ``as well as can be expected,'' he added. The
other woman, an unidentified American, was shot in the pelvis,
hospital officials said on condition of anonymity.
	   Security forces killed three of the kidnappers and captured
another three, including the leader, the Interior Ministry said.
	   Yemen blamed the kidnappers for the deaths of the three Britons
and an Australian, one of whom died later in in a hospital.
	   Brig. Mohammad Saleh al-Turaiq, the chief of security in Aden
province, said Wednesday that the kidnappers were the first to open
fire.
	   ``The Egyptian (kidnapper) began shooting at the hostages, which
forced our troops to storm the hideout,'' he told reporters in the
presence of the British ambassador.
	   Al-Turaiq said his forces were chasing some kidnappers who got
away. He accused foreign elements of instigating the kidnapping,
but refused to elaborate.
	   Yemeni officials have identified the Egyptian as Osama al-Masri.
In Cairo, Egyptian security sources said the name was the alias of
a wanted Islamic extremist. They refused to give his real name.
	   The officials said the kidnappers belonged to Islamic Jihad, a
group of about 200 members based in a camp in south Yemen.
	   They had seized the hostages _ 12 Britons, two Americans and two
Australians _ to demand the release of two of their leaders and in
protest against the recent U.S. and British airstrikes against
Iraq, officials said. Police had detained the leaders in a
crackdown on Islamic vigilantes.
	   Kidnappings of foreigners occur often in Yemen, large parts of
which are run by lawless tribes, but until now the hostages usually
have been treated well and released unharmed.
	   This was the first time Islamic extremists had abducted
foreigners.
	   British newspapers accused the Yemeni authorities of premature
intervention. The Daily Mail asked on the front page, ``Did our
tourists really need to die?''
	   British Ambassador Vic Henderson reportedly had pleaded with the
San`a government to do nothing ``that in any way could jeopardize
the safety of the hostages.''
	   In San`a, Yemenis told journalists they were surprised the
government had intervened so quickly when it usually negotiated for
several days, if not weeks, with kidnappers.
	   A London-based Islamic human rights group said Tuesday that it
had contacted the kidnappers on Monday and received assurances that
they would not harm the hostages.
	   ``We hold the Yemeni government responsible for the deaths. The
way the authorities handled the situation was barbaric and
irresponsible,'' said a spokesman for the Islamic Observation
Center.
	   In the wake of the killings, Germany appealed to the San`a
government not to attempt to rescue the four Germans held hostage
by a tribe in northeast Yemen, Yemeni officials said Wednesday.
	   In London, the Foreign Office confirmed that three Britons _
Ruth Williamson, Margaret Whitehouse and Rowe _ were killed, but
did not provide their ages or hometowns.
	   The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the
fourth victim was a 35-year-old man from Sydney whose name would
not be released until next of kin had been informed.
	   The surviving hostages were recovering from their ordeal at an
Aden hotel, diplomat Pearce said Tuesday.
	   ``They are obviously in a state of severe shock, and I mean
severe shock,'' Pearce said.
	   Pearce said Wednesday it was hoped that the 11 Britons could be
flown home on Friday.
	   The kidnapping began Monday when the tourists' convoy of five
vehicles was ambushed by men who opened fire on their police
escorts near Mawdiyah, Yemeni security officials said.
	   Yemen said the governor of Abyan province, Ahmad Ali Mohsen, was
negotiating with leaders of the Al-Fadl tribe, to which the
kidnappers belong, before the shootout occurred.
	   Tribesmen usually kidnap foreigners to press the government to
provide new roads, water or clinics.

Four people killed and three injured in avalanche on Scottish

mountain &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details, quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FORT WILLIAM, Scotland _ An avalanche struck a party of seven
hikers on a mountain in northwest Scotland, killing four, police
said Wednesday. Rescuers saved three survivors trapped in tons of
snow.
	   The hikers had been participating in ``winter skills'' training
course on Aonoch Mor near Ben Nevis in the Scottish Highlands on
Tuesday when they were caught in the avalanche at about 3,500 feet
(900 meters) on the mountainside, police said.
	   ``Rescuers spotted one of the survivors whose top half was
showing, but it took another two hours to dig everyone else out,''
said police inspector Charles Ross. ``It is amazing that anyone
survived in the circumstances. They were all experienced climbers
who were members of some kind of organization and had decided they
wanted to get some winter conditions experience.''
	   The hikers were reported missing at 2230 GMT Tuesday when they
did not return from the day's climb. Royal Air Force mountain
rescue teams immediately began a search. Gale force winds forced a
helicopter to abandon rescue attempts, but ground crews found the
group at 0120 GMT Wednesday, a police spokesman said.
	   The three survivors were found Wednesday, buried under three
feet of snow about 16 hours after the avalanche hit.
	   Rescue leader Terry Confield said the instructor had left
details of the group's route and itinerary.
	   ``Within about an hour we had located one of the survivors who
was stuck in the snow with the upper part of their body exposed,''
Confield said. ``If he hadn't been so easily visible we would have
had a massive job on our hands.''
	   Confield said said rescuers frantically dug down into the snow
to recover the remaining members of the party.
	   ``Sadly, four of them were already dead but we were all
delighted that three had survived,'' he said.
	   Steven Newton, 24; Sarah Finch, 25, and instructor Roger Wilde,
were carried off the mountain one at a time, and taken to Belford
Hospital in Fort William, where they were being treated for
hypothermia.
	   The bodies of Emma Ray, 29; Paul Hopkins, 28; Matthew Lewis, 28,
and Ian Edwards, 30, were recovered Wednesday.

Ukrainian and British leader appeal for Chernobyl shelter aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and
British Prime Minister Tony Blair appealed for donors to help
renovate the sarcophagus covering a ruined reactor at the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant, an official said Wednesday.
	   Kuchma and Blair sent a joint letter asking for aid to the
leaders of Argentina, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary,
Slovenia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, New Zealand, Brunei and Qatar, said
the Ukrainian leader's foreign policy aide, Volodymyr Ohryzko.
	   The sarcophagus was hastily built after the world's worst
nuclear disaster in April 1986, when Chernobyl's reactor No. 4
exploded during a test and sent a radioactive cloud over much of
Europe.
	   The shaky structure has leaks and tons of nuclear fuel still
might remain inside.
	   Ukraine has appealed to world nations to help it make the
concrete and steel sarcophagus environmentally safe. Since 1997,
about 20 donor nations have pledged dlrs 390 million of the
estimated dlrs 758 million in shelter repair costs.

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Jordan, Egypt, Kuwait &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan and Iraq will hold talks starting
Monday to renew for 1999 the barter deal under which Jordan gets
oil from its neighbor.
	   Energy Minister Hani Mulqi said Wednesday that the meetings will
be held in Baghdad. The talks had been planned earlier but were put
off because of the U.S. and British airstrikes on Iraq in
mid-December.
	   Jordan currently meets its total oil requirements of 90,000
barrels per day with shipments trucked in tankers across the desert
border from Iraq.
	   Some of the oil is given at a concession price. The oil goes
toward paying Iraq's dlrs 1.3 billion debt to Jordan, accumulated
during the 1980s, and to cover the cost of food and medicine
imported from Jordan.
	   Mulqi said Jordan was seeking an increase of 5 percent to 7
percent in oil supplies next year to meet ``natural growth in
industry and civic consumption.''
	   He also intends to speak with Iraq's oil minister, Lt. Gen. Amer
Mohammed Rashid, on ways to increase cooperation in oil and gas
exploration. The two also are expected to resume discussion on
building a 700 kilometer (420 mile) pipeline to carry oil from Iraq
to Jordan.
	   Mulqi revealed that Jordan was affected by the airstrikes on
Iraq, during which oil shipments to Jordan were suspended. He said
Jordan signed agreements to import 60,000 tons of diesel fuel and
40,000 tons of liquefied gas from from the international market.
	   The barter deal is an exception from U.N. sanctions, imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, that limit Iraqi oil sales.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt is planing to hold its first trade
fair in Tehran since the 1979 Islamic revolution in, Egyptian Trade
Minister Ahmed Guweili was quoted Wednesday as saying.
	   Guweili told the Egyptian Gazette that the fair, which will
exhibit a variety of Egyptian-made goods, will run June 21-26.
	   Its aim is to open a new market for Egyptian products abroad,
Guweili told the English-language daily. He described Iran as a
promising market.
	   Egypt has slowly but steadily been moving toward restoring
economic and political ties with Iran, which it severed after the
revolution nearly 20 years ago. The two countries recently
exchanged trade delegations.
 &UR; ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Parliament has passed a bill that proposes to make
it obligatory for foreigners living in this oil-rich Gulf state to
buy health insurance, the Arab Times daily reported Wednesday.
	   The bill still needs the approval of the emir, Sheik Jaber
al-Ahmed al-Sabah, to become law.
	   The government has one year to implement the bill, which will
affect 1.4 million expatriate workers who currently enjoy free
health care in state hospitals along with 800,000 Kuwaiti citizens.
	   Lawmakers voted for the bill 34-9 Tuesday, with one abstention,
the English-language daily Arab Times said. It was proposed by a
group of legislators.
	   Although the bill is apparently aimed at reducing the government
health expenditure, critics said it would unjustly hit low-income
foreign workers. They said the scheme was devised to benefit
insurance companies.
	   Workers who refuse to buy insurance will not be given work
permits under the bill.
	   Ibrahim Behbehani, a former Health Ministry official who opposes
the bill, told the Arab Times he will challenge it in court.
	   Behbehani said the government spends only about 16 dinars (dlrs
53) a year on health services for every foreigner, a figure so
small that it is hardly worth canceling.
	   The obligatory insurance will not apply to a few categories of
non-Kuwaitis: children of Kuwaiti women married to foreigners,
foreign wives of Kuwaiti men and up to three domestic helpers for
every household.

League chief urges apology for Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Arab League Secretary-General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid on Wednesday suggested that many of Iraq's woes could
have been avoided if Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had apologized for
his 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   ``The recent ramifications of the Iraqi crisis represent a link
in a long chain of events that started with Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait,'' Abdel-Meguid said.
	   ``This crisis would have been resolved had the Iraqi regime
officially apologized for its aggression on the state of Kuwait,''
he added. ``But that never happened.''
	   Abdel-Meguid did not elaborate, but he seemed to be suggesting
that a formal apology might convince Kuwait and its Gulf allies to
support the league's efforts to end Iraq's isolation.
	   Abdel-Meguid made the remarks on an Egyptian television talk
show to be aired later in the day. Excerpts were carried by Egypt's
Middle East News Agency.
	   In the interview, Abdel-Meguid expressed regret that an Arab
League foreign ministers' meeting planned for this week to discuss
a call for an Arab Summit had been put off.
	   The postponement to Jan. 24 was requested by the Gulf states.
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations have not forgiven
Saddam for the 1990 invasion.
	   The league's ministers also were to discuss the U.S. and British
airstrikes that ended Dec. 20 and the effects of eight years of
U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
	   Abdel-Meguid said he agreed to the postponement of the meeting
to avoid a further split in Arab ranks, MENA said.

 &UR; Angolan rebels bombard second-largest city &QL; 
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Rebel forces Wednesday launched an
hour-long artillery bombardment against Huambo, the country's
second-largest city and a base for United Nations and aid agency
staff, according to reports.
	   Some shells landed in downtown areas of the central highland
city which lies about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of the
capital, Luanda, state radio RNA reported from Huambo.
	   The explosions reportedly began at noon and caused panic among
local people in the government-held city which the army is using as
a base to fly in reinforcements for fighting in surrounding areas.
	   Before the civil war restarted Dec. 4 Huambo had a population of
about 300,000, but tens of thousands of refugees fleeing fighting
in the countryside have converged on the city in recent weeks.
	   U.N. spokesman Hamadoun Toure said from Luanda he had no reports
of injuries to United Nations staff in Huambo.
	   The World Food Program and International Red Cross also have
staff in the city, but officials were not immediately available for
comment.
	   A cargo plane chartered by the United Nations crashed near
Huambo on Saturday with 14 people on board. The cause of the crash,
as the plane passed over the war zone, was not known.
	   Artillery shells were also landing about every 15 minutes in
Kuito, 130 kilometers (80 miles) to the east of Huambo, which has
been under a rebel siege for more than two weeks, according to RNA.
	   The rebels apparently were targeting the airport, RNA said.
	   The United Nations observer mission, which is monitoring a 1994
peace accord that halted a two-decade civil war between the rebels
and the government, has been unable to stop the renewed fighting
which so far been concentrated in the central highlands.
	   The U.N. Security Council has blamed UNITA, a Portuguese acronym
for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, for
the return to war.
	   UNITA refused to yield control of areas under its control and
maintained a hidden army, according to the United Nations.
	   The country has been ravaged by conflict since gaining
independence from Portugal in 1975.

Duisenberg says he won't leave ECB after four years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Wim Duisenberg, the head of the new European
Central Bank, said in an interview published Wednesday that he
won't step down after completing half his term as earlier agreed.
	   ``I had hoped you wouldn't ask me that question. The answer is
no,'' Duisenberg told the Le Monde daily, which had asked him if he
would step down after four years on the job.
	   Duisenberg was named this spring as head of the new European
Central Bank, which will govern the policies of the euro, the new
single currency which goes into effect Jan. 1.
	   France surprised its euro partners by proposing its central
banker, Jean-Claude Trichet, at the last minute for the job
Duisenberg was expected to secure easily.
	   Although he was elected easily, Duisenberg agreed to step down
after four years of his eight year term although he has since said
no such ``gentleman's agreement'' exists.
	   Duisenberg told Le Monde, a newspaper that fervently has backed
the euro, that the the introduction of the new currency is the most
``significant'' step so far toward European unification.
	   However, he said that he would like to see further political
integration, especially in the area of foreign tax and social
policies.

Kosovo radicals praise KLA, moderates expect NATO intervention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ An alliance of radical Kosovo
Albanian parties expressed full support Wednesday for the
pro-independence armed force, the Kosovo Liberation Army, and
suggested that fighting may re-escalate.
	   ``The Kosovo Liberation Army is the central national, political
and moral force,'' said Rexhep Qosja, the leader of six parties and
political groups of ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province.
	   The alliance is a rival of the main ethnic Albanian leader,
Ibrahim Rugova, despite their common ultimate goal of an
independent Kosovo.
	   In turning to armed struggle, ``Albanians in Kosovo have decided
to use their natural right for defense after many years of
endurance'' of Serbian rule, Qosja said.
	   Asked if the current, shaky truce in the province would hold,
Qosja said that ``a lasting peace has not been secured, and
therefore, I'm a pessimist.''
	   Also on Wednesday, a Rugova aide acknowledged that differences
within the Kosovo Albanian camp should be resolved and that
``reality requires a consensus of all Kosovo Albanian factions.''
	   U.S. mediators in the conflict have been trying to unite Kosovo
Albanian factions, a prerequisite for any fruitful direct peace
talks with the Serbian government.
	   Ajeti also said the ethnic Albanians still expect NATO
intervention against the government troops fighting to prevent the
secession.

Turkey threatens to maintain pressure over Russian missiles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUZAN FRASER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey claimed as victory Wednesday a
Greek Cypriot decision to cancel deployment of Russian-made
missiles on Cyprus but warned it would use military force to
prevent any installation on the Greek island of Crete.
	   Greek Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides announced the
cancellation of the plans late Tuesday and said he would negotiate
with Russian government officials for the deployment of the
controversial S-300 surface-to-air missiles on Crete.
	   ``We would take all appropriate political and military means if
they were to be deployed in Crete,'' Foreign Minister Ismail Cem
told reporters. ``If there is a threat directed toward Turkey, then
we will do the necessary analysis and respond accordingly.''
	   Turkey had threatened to use military strikes to block the
missiles' deployment on Cyprus ever since plans were announced two
years ago. The United States and NATO also criticized the decision
as potentially leading to conflict between NATO members Turkey and
Greece.
	   Turkey rejected outright a Greek Cypriot proposal to cancel
their deployment if Ankara accepted a plan for the demilitarization
of the island.
	   There is no firm decision on what would happen to the missiles.
Some reports suggested the missiles would now be stored.
	   Greece strongly urged Cyprus to shift the missiles to Crete as a
way to avoid a possible military showdown with Turkey.
	   Greek officials feared that a costly increase of its military
presence in Cyprus _ under a defense pact _ could set back
austerity measures aimed at qualifying Greece for the European
Union's single currency group.
	   Athens also worries that escalating tensions on the divided
island could weaken Cyprus' bid to join the European Union.
	   Cem said Crete was an unacceptable option because it would
intensify tensions between Greece and Turkey and entail the
presence of Russian military officials on NATO territory.
	   ``We will watch the developments carefully and continue to take
every kind of measure possible,'' Cem said. ``They should not think
that Turkey will sit around with its arms crossed.''
	   Cyprus has been divided since since 1974, when Turkey sent in
troops after a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   ``They cannot find a place for the missiles,'' Turkish daily
Radikal quoted Turkey's defense minister Ismet Sezgin as saying.
``This is Turkey's victory.''
	   ``Turkey did not want the missiles in Cyprus, so it's an
achievement that they are not going there,'' said Ilter Turan
professor of political science at Istanbul's Bilgi University.
``It's a victory for common sense since it should reduce tensions
in the region.''

Khmer Rouge leaders bask in luxury as king, victims oppose amnesty

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Two Khmer Rouge leaders relaxed at a
luxury hotel Wednesday while Cambodia's king and prime minister
disagreed over granting them amnesty for their roles in the deaths
of as many as 2 million people.
	   King Norodom Sihanouk, 76, said he would refuse amnesty for
Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, both members of the inner circle of
the notorious Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot, who died in April of a
heart attack.
	   The refusal puts Sihanouk on a collision course with Prime
Minister Hun Sen, who struck a deal with the pair allowing them to
defect to his government with assurances they would not be put on
trial.
	   The king, receiving treatment for several ailments in Beijing,
stated in his palace bulletin that he feels the majority of
Cambodians do not support a pardon.
	   ``I announce to this majority that I respect them and will not
renew my power of amnesty for major Khmer Rouge criminals,''
Sihanouk said. ``I leave all the responsibility to Hun Sen of
handling this unfortunate and dramatic affair of pardons accorded
to the Khmer Rouge.''
	   Hun Sen was silent on the issue Wednesday, but he is Cambodia's
most powerful man. If he wants to pardon the pair _ which he claims
is needed to prevent Cambodia sliding back toward civil war _ he
can easily do so through the pliant court system.
	   Without the popular king's approval, however, the deal will lack
legitimacy in the eyes of many countries and Cambodians.
	   Sihanouk, who lost a score of family members under the Khmer
Rouge regime, said the world had a ``perfect right'' to bring the
pair before an international tribunal to face justice for crimes
against humanity.
	   Monsignor Emile Destombes, Roman Catholic bishop of Phnom Penh,
was quoted by Fides, a Vatican news agency, as supporting such a
tribunal.
	   ``The church works for reconciliation, but this must be based on
truth, justice and the recognition of responsibility by those who
have committee wrongdoing,'' Destombes said.
	   Sihanouk bowed to pressure from his government in 1996 to grant
amnesty to another Khmer Rouge leader, Ieng Sary, who in exchange
broke the back of the rebel group by leading thousands of
guerrillas out of a festering civil war.
	   But with the Khmer Rouge now all but extinct, many wonder why
Hun Sen is pushing amnesty again. Speculation has always run high
that as a former Khmer Rouge field officer before fleeing purges in
1977, he wants to protect his own past.
	   Those who have studied evidence against the Khmer Rouge,
however, say Hun Sen is relatively clean.
	   But pressure is growing to hold someone accountable for the
Khmer Rouge atrocities.
	   The Khmer Rouge won a civil war in 1975 and turned the country
into a slave labor camp. One person in five perished of overwork,
starvation, disease and systematic executions. They were ousted by
a Vietnamese invasion in 1979.
	   After years of living in guerrilla camps in the jungles along
the Thai-Cambodian border, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea are enjoying
dlrs 240-a-night hotel suites since coming to the capital to cement
their deal Tuesday. Ieng Sary is with them.
	   Their families have toured the temples and palaces of a capital
that never fully recovered after being emptied at gunpoint in 1975,
when the Khmer Rouge forced Cambodians into agricultural
collectives.
	   The rebel leaders and their families plan visits to the historic
Angkor temple complex, the seaside resort of Sihanoukville in the
south, and their home provinces.
	   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea told a news conference Tuesday they
were ``very sorry'' for the Khmer Rouge terror but refused to
accept personal responsibility. Khieu Samphan said: ``Let bygones
be bygones.''
	   Eam Chan, 55, one of the handful of survivors from the infamous
Tuol Sleng torture center where perhaps 20,000 people were
brutalized before being executed outside the capital, said the
apology can't erase his suffering.
	   Accused of being a U.S. spy, Eam Chan was tortured daily by
electroshock and asphyxiation. A favorite technique was to hold a
wet rag over his face and drip water on it, suffocating him.
	   ``The Cambodian people cannot forget that so easily,'' Eam Chan
said. ``As a victim, my mind cannot be at rest without seeing the
prosecution of these people, because the suffering was
indescribable.''
	   Khieu Samphan met Boutros Boutros-Ghali, former United Nations
secretary general, who is in Cambodia to promote the French
language as head of the International Francophone Organization.
	   Boutros-Ghali told a news conference that since the United
Nations has not established an international tribunal, Cambodia's
decision would have to prevail and the international community
respect it.
	   U.N. legal experts were dispatched by the present
secretary-general, Kofi Annan, to Cambodia recently to assess the
possibility of creating such a tribunal. Their report is due in a
few weeks.

	   ROME (AP) _ A U.N. agency that delivers emergency food aid says
that in 1999 more people around the world will probably need
humanitarian assistance because of crises this year like Hurricane
Mitch and economic collapses in Indonesia and Russia.
	   ``We have to enter 1999 with the understanding that we may face
an increased threat of famine, malnutrition and endemic hunger,''
Catherine Bertini, executive director of the World Food Program,
said in a statement Wednesday.
	   Other developments cited by the Rome-based agency as possible
causes for driving up world hunger: flareups of civil warfare in
Kosovo and Angola.

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ A hamstring injury has left West
Indian star bowler Courtney Walsh doubtful for the next test match
against South Africa, team officials said Wednesday.
	   Walsh injured his left hamstring Tuesday while fielding on the
last day of the third test. The series, which South Africa leads
3-0, moves to Cape Town on Saturday.
	   Curtly Ambrose, suffering from fluid on the knee, also is not in
top form but he could still play.
	   ``We're awaiting the doctor's report,'' said West Indies manager
Clive Lloyd. ``Mr. Walsh, according to the doctor, has a slight
tear of the hamstring. I doubt whether he will play,'' Lloyd said.
	   The West Indians are struggling on the field. They lost by four
wickets at the Wanderers stadium in Johannesburg, by 178 runs at
St. George's in Port Elizabeth and by nine wickets at Kingsmead
here.
	   The last time a South African team has led 4-0 was against
Australia. No South African team has won a series 5-0.

<TEXT>
	   ADEN, Yemen (AP) _ Westerners freed after a shootout fatal to
four foreign tourists said Wednesday that the battle started when
Yemeni security forces attacked Islamic radicals holding the
foreigners hostage.
	   Their accounts appeared to contradict a Yemeni government
statement, which said security forces only opened fire Tuesday
after the kidnappers began killing some of their hostages at a camp
in the country's south.
	   But the hostages told The Associated Press that once their
kidnappers were attacked, they tried to use their prisoners as
shields and eventually shot two of the captives in ``revenge
killings'' as they fled.
	   ``The worst time for me was that time when a barrel was pointed
at my chest. I said, `No, no, no,'' recounted Erik Firkin, who said
a fellow captive, a woman, was shot dead in front of him by one of
the kidnappers.

Russia faces default on Soviet-era debt payment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With Russia effectively in default on a major
foreign debt, Western creditors were trying to decide Wednesday how
to deal with a country that's struggling to pay its bills.
	   Russia failed Tuesday to make a dlrs 363 million cash payment on
dlrs 26 billion worth of loans that Moscow must repay to the London
Club of commercial creditors.
	   Russian officials said that the country was technically not in
default because more than 70 percent of the debt holders had agreed
to accept new bonds instead of cash.
	   Russia's Vneshekonombank, the state-owned bank responsible for
repaying the debt, claimed it only needed the support of two-thirds
of creditors to make the payment in bonds.
	   But London Club members have indicated that 95 percent of debt
holders will need to approve the plan. Bank of America, the payment
agent for the London Club, was expected to make a statement on the
issue Wednesday.
	   If creditors want to formally declare Russia in default on the
debts, it would require a majority vote of the London Club members.
	   But such a move could only further complicate efforts to sort
out Russia's mounting debt problems, analysts said.
	   Russia now faces about dlrs 150 billion in foreign debts that it
must repay in coming years.
	   When the country's economic crisis hit in August, the government
also effectively defaulted on dlrs 40 billion worth of domestic
treasury bonds.
	   Russia is seeking to work out restructuring agreements with its
creditors, but the process has been moving slowly, while the
economy continues to crumble.
	   Most of Russia's foreign debt was inherited from the Soviet
Union, and those are considered the riskiest debts. Moscow has
tried to stay current on debt that was run up in the post-Soviet
period, and the country has continued paying interest on Eurobonds
issued after the Soviet breakup.
	   But if Russia misses too many loan repayments, then it's
unlikely to get new loans needed to help it through the current
crisis, which hit this past summer.
	   Without foreign aid, the government is likely to print a huge
amount of new cash, leading to the kind of high inflation that has
plagued Russia in the early 1990s.
	   Since the crisis hit in August, the Russian ruble has fallen
from 6 to U.S. dollar to 21. Inflation, which appeared under
control until the crisis hit, is expected to top 70 percent for the
year.

Libya orders the arrest of Americans in 1986 air attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ In a symbolic _ if futile _ move, a Libyan
prosecutor on Wednesday ordered the arrest of nine American
officials allegedly behind the 1986 bombing of two Libyan cities,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   Among those on the list is William Casey, the late director of
the CIA.
	   The announcement came as Libya is maneuvering over American and
British demands that two Libyan suspects be turned over for trial
in the Netherlands for the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet that killed
270 people.
	   MENA said that the prosecutor, Mohammed Abdel-Wahab, announced
the arrest orders at a news conference at the People's Court in the
Libyan capital Tripoli.
	   In addition to Casey, Abdel-Wahab gave the names of a number of
American pilots as well as former National Security Adviser John
Poindexter and Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North.
	   The prosecutor said that if Libya failed to secure their arrest,
``it will resort to (U.N.) Security Council to get the accused,''
MENA said.
	   Former U.S. President Ronald Reagan ordered an air attack on
Libya in 1986 in retaliation for the bombing of a Berlin
discotheque in which two U.S. servicemen were killed.
	   Libya said 37 people, including an adopted daughter of Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi, were killed in the attack on Tripoli and
the port of Benghazi.
	   Reagan's name was not on the list released by Libya, according
to the MENA report.
	   The United States and Britain have demanded that Libya turn over
two suspects in the bombing of the Pan Am jet over Lockerbie,
Scotland.
	   They have said that if Libya does not do so, they will ask the
Security Council to expand sanctions against Libya.

USOC president promises closer oversight of site selection
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WILL LESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. Olympic Committee president Bill Hybl is
promising ``closer oversight'' of Olympic city selection by the
USOC after a special commission investigates alleged bribes by Salt
Lake City organizers to help win the 2002 Winter Games.
	   Asked why the USOC wasn't providing closer scrutiny already,
Hybl pointed to predecessor Robert Helmick, who quit in 1991, two
years after Salt Lake City was awarded the 2002 Winter Games by the
International Olympic Committee.
	   Hybl took the USOC president's job on an interim basis after
Helmick resigned when it was found Helmick received approximately
dlrs 300,000 in fees from federations and other business
organizations connected with the Olympic community. Hybl was
elected to a four-year term in 1996.
	   When the Salt Lake controversy surfaced, Helmick said that
certain IOC members are willing to exchange votes for gifts ranging
from airline tickets to fur coats to shopping sprees for members'
wives where thousands of dollars were spent on clothing.
	   Earlier this month, Hybl appointed a special commission to look
into the Salt Lake complaints and the overall selection process.
	   Former U.S. Senate leader and Northern Ireland peace negotiator
George Mitchell promised Tuesday that an investigation of alleged
bribes by Salt Lake Olympic officials to help secure the Winter
Games would be ``thorough and prompt.''
	   ``One of the most difficult parts is the judging of past actions
by current standards,'' Mitchell said. ``How do you treat people
fairly? We will do the best we can within the limits of time and
scope.''
	   After his first meeting with members of a special commission
investigating the allegations, Mitchell told reporters the
five-member panel must file its report to the U.S. Olympic
Committee by Feb. 28. He said there would be no public reports
before then.
	   Hybl said the USOC put in tough rules on gifts and gratuities in
November 1997 and emphasized the investigation will look for ways
to prevent the kinds of abuses alleged against Salt Lake.
	   Past and present officials of the Salt Lake City Olympic
Committee have acknowledged that they gave members of the IOC gifts
and paid college tuition to some of the committee's relatives prior
to the city being selected for the Winter Games.
	   USOC officials said tougher guidelines and oversight will be in
place for the site selection for the 2007 Pan Am Games and the 2012
Summer Olympics.

	   LYON, France (AP) _ An Air France plane on a regular domestic
flight between Lyon and Nantes lost a wheel after takeoff Wednesday
but made an emergency landing safely, the Lyon airport said.
	   The Boeing 737-300 plane, with 59 people on board, landed at
Lyon-Satolas airport about 10:20 a.m. (0920 GMT), the airport said.
	   The flight, AF7863, was to have flown from Lyon to the western
French city of Nantes. The rear left wheel of the six-wheel plane
fell off just after takeoff.
	   ``The risk was minimal,'' said Eric Samuel, an Air France
official at the airport. ``It was much less serious than if it had
been a nose wheel.''

Catalan poet/artist Joan Brossa dies at 79
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ Joan Brossa, a versatile Catalan poet
associated with some of the pillars of the Spanish surrealist
movement and best known for his ``visual poems,'' died Wednesday,
National Spanish Television TVE reported.
	   Brossa died from a heart attack in a hospital of this
northeastern Spanish city, he was 79. His funeral was scheduled for
Thursday, TVE said.
	   A friend of artist Joan Miro, Brossa founded a surrealist
magazine called Dau al Set in 1948 together with another of
Catalonia's formidable artistic lineup Antoni Tapies.
	   His poems, written in Catalan, were first published in 1951 and
his last book came out in 1987.
	   Known for his caustic whit and hostility toward artistic
convention, Brossa began developing his ``visual poems'' in the
1950s _ a rifle barrel toped with a church candle snuffer entitled
``Conscientious Objector'' or a football crowned by a Spanish comb

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Telephone technicians ended a two-week
strike to await further negotiations on pay with the state phone
company, the government said Wednesday.
	   Information and Telecommunications Minister Chen Chimutengwende
said the technicians employed on fixed line telephone services were
demanding a 200 percent salary increase to match wages paid to
technicians employed by mobile phone companies.
	   Chimutengwende described the demands as ``impossible'' and said
the antiquated fixed phone system charged much cheaper rates for
calls and was far less profitable than three mobile companies, one
of them state-owned.
	   The Posts and Telecommunications Corp. is already indebted to
local banks by more than 300 million Zimbabwe dollars (dlrs 8
million) as it tries to upgrade its equipment.
	   The telephone service has been frequently criticized for its
inefficiency, with one High Court judge recently describing it as
breaching constitutional rights to freedom of speech through its
constant breakdowns.

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Four Ugandan army officers have been
removed from their posts in eastern Congo and charged with
wrongdoing, three of them apparently because of involvement in
mining ventures in the mineral rich region, a newspaper said
Wednesday.
	   The government-owned New Vision said Lt. Col. John Nyakaitana,
identified as the top strategist for Uganda's military operations
against Ugandan rebels operating in eastern Congo, was recalled
from the region along with three other officers in recent days.
	   Nyakaitana was charged with not carrying out certain duties,
while the three other officers were said to have been conducting
illegal business inside Congo, the newspaper cited an unidentified
Defense Ministry official as saying.
	   Uganda and Rwanda have acknowledged sending forces and military
equipment to assist Congolese rebels in eastern Congo trying to
oust Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
	   --
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Rebel forces Wednesday launched an
hour-long artillery bombardment against Huambo, the country's
second-largest city and a base for United Nations and aid agency
staff, according to reports.
	   Some shells landed in downtown areas of the central highland
city which lies about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of the
capital, Luanda, state radio RNA reported from Huambo.
	   The explosions caused panic in the government-held city, which
the army is using as a base to fly in reinforcements for fighting
in surrounding areas.
	   Before the civil war restarted Dec. 4 Huambo had a population of
about 300,000, but tens of thousands of refugees fleeing fighting
in the countryside have converged on the city in recent weeks.
	   --
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ Foreign investment in 1998 totaled
dlrs 770 million, with most of the money going to the industrial,
agro-industrial and tourism sectors, state radio said Wednesday.
	   The Investment Promotion Centre received 300 project
applications, of which 190 have been implemented. South Africa and
Portugal lead foreign investment in Mozambique, Radio Mozambique
said.

IOC vice president meets behind closed doors with SLOC officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ International Olympic Committee vice
president Dick Pound has held closed-door meetings with Salt Lake
Olympics officials as head of the IOC's probe into allegations of
bribery in connection with the 2002 Winter Games.
	   Pound was in Salt Lake City on Tuesday to review documents and
to interview individuals involved with the city's effort to secure
the 2002 Games.
	   Meanwhile, in Washington, a U.S. Olympic Committee panel headed
by former U.S. Senate leader and Northern Ireland peace negotiator
George Mitchell began its own investigation.
	   Salt Lake Olympic officials have admitted having a dlrs 400,000
scholarship fund that benefited 13 recipients, including six
relatives of IOC members. IOC members also were given thousands of
dollars worth of guns and skis, and some received free medical
treatment, including plastic surgery.
	   Pound spent much of the day pursuing his probe at offices of the
Salt Lake Organizing Committee.
	   Shelley Thomas, SLOC senior vice president of communications,
said she was not part of the proceedings and was unsure who was
interviewed. Pound, an attorney from Montreal, told her only that
he did not plan to make any statements to the media.
	   The IOC panel has hired a Los Angeles law firm, O'Melveny and
Myers, to represent it in the investigation, according to USA
Today.
	   ``I thought with so many investigations going on, I should
probably hire a lawyer so we're not bumping into each other,''
Pound told the newspaper.
	   Thomas was uncertain whether Pound's investigation would
continue Wednesday. The commission he leads is expected to submit a
report to the IOC executive board on Jan. 24 in Lausanne,
Switzerland.
	   Mitchell's group is planning to issue its report to the USOC by
Feb. 28.
	   SLOC's ethics committee also is investigating, and the American
federal Justice Department announced last week that it would
investigate to determine whether any laws were broken.

Elke Sommer wins verdict against Zsa Zsa Gabor's husband
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NUREMBERG, Germany (AP) _ German actress Elke Sommer won the
latest round Wednesday in a long-running war of words with Zsa Zsa
Gabor and her German husband, Prince Frederic von Anhalt.
	   A Bavarian court rejected an appeal from the prince, who had
been ordered by a lower court to stop going around telling people
that Sommer had once called all German men ``pigs.''
	   But since Sommer could not definitively prove that she had not
made the disputed statement, the court did not order von Anhalt to
make a full retraction.
	   The three have been spatting for years. According to Sommer, the
bad blood began after she remarked once that Gabor had a large
butt.
	   In 1992, a Los Angeles jury ordered Hungarian-born Gabor and von
Anhalt, a former Munich champagne dealer and Gabor's eighth
husband, to pay Sommer dlrs 2.5 million in damages for describing
her as a haggard Hollywood has-been.

WIndies bowler Walsh is doubtful for next cricket test v. SAfrica
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ A hamstring injury has left West
Indian star bowler Courtney Walsh doubtful for the next test match
against South Africa, team officials said Wednesday.
	   Walsh injured his left hamstring Tuesday while fielding on the
last day of the third test. The series, which South Africa leads
3-0, moves to Cape Town on Saturday.
	   Curtly Ambrose, suffering from fluid on the knee, also is not in
top form but he could still play.
	   ``We're awaiting the doctor's report,'' said West Indies manager
Clive Lloyd. ``Mr. Walsh, according to the doctor, has a slight
tear of the hamstring. I doubt whether he will play,'' Lloyd said.
	   The West Indians are struggling on the field. They lost by four
wickets at the Wanderers stadium in Johannesburg, by 178 runs at
St. George's in Port Elizabeth and by nine wickets at Kingsmead
here.
	   The last time a South African team has led 4-0 was against
Australia. No South African team has won a series 5-0.

In St. Mark's Square, death knell for puniest of Venice's pigeons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VENICE, Italy (AP) _ Venice's mayor has signed an order
authorizing the killing of the sickliest among the city's pampered
pigeon population, Italian newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   Surveys estimate the number of the birds at more than 100,000,
many of which live out their days clustered around the pigeon-food
stands in St. Mark's Square.
	   Tourists delight in feeding the throngs of cooing birds,
nurturing a Venetian pigeon flock estimated to be 20 times that of
Rome's.
	   Venice officials say 15 percent of the birds carry salmonella, a
bacterial disease transmittable to humans, and call even the
healthy ones a menace to the city's monuments.
	   Mayor Massimo Cacciari approved a plan Tuesday allowing city
workers to destroy the ailing ones.
	   Venice previously tried to control the size of the flocks by
scattering chemically treated birdseed meant to sterilize the
birds. Animal-rights groups oppose the latest plan; city officials
call it essential.

	   Three Britons and an Australian were killed in the siege
Tuesday, and an American and a Briton were wounded. Yemen's
Interior Ministry said its forces killed three of the kidnapers and
captured three others during the shootout in Mawdiyah town, 175
miles (286 kilometers) south of the capital, San`a.
	   Firkin, 55, from Croyden, England, said he was with a group of
11 hostages. The kidnappers had split their 16 captives into two
groups, and Firkin and Brian Smith, another hostage, said they did
not know how the other group had come under attack.
	   Both men said their group wound up in the middle of a gun battle
after government troops opened fire on the kidnappers as they fled
with their hostages.
	   ``We were being led into the mountains to a hiding. Then we
heard the gunfire,'' said Firkin, a chemistry professor whose
sandals were still dusty from the trek.
	   He and Smith, 52, a postal worker from Peterborough, England,
were interviewed at a hotel in Aden where they were taken to rest
from their ordeal.
	   Smith said the gun battle went on for about two hours, with
bullets whizzing over the heads of the hostages.
	   ``We were in the middle of a battle. We weren't armed, with no
military knowledge,'' he said.

Libya orders the arrest of Americans in 1986 air attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ In a symbolic _ if futile _ move, a Libyan
prosecutor on Wednesday ordered the arrest of nine American
officials allegedly behind the 1986 bombing of two Libyan cities,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   Among those on the list is William Casey, the late director of
the CIA.
	   The announcement came as Libya is maneuvering over American and
British demands that two Libyan suspects be turned over for trial
in the Netherlands for the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet that killed
270 people.
	   MENA said that the prosecutor, Mohammed Abdel-Wahab, announced
the arrest orders at a news conference at the People's Court in the
Libyan capital Tripoli.
	   In addition to Casey, Abdel-Wahab gave the names of a number of
American pilots as well as former National Security Adviser John
Poindexter and Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North.
	   The prosecutor said that if Libya failed to secure their arrest,
``it will resort to (U.N.) Security Council to get the accused,''
MENA said.
	   Former U.S. President Ronald Reagan ordered an air attack on
Libya in 1986 in retaliation for the bombing of a Berlin
discotheque in which two U.S. servicemen were killed.
	   Libya said 37 people, including an adopted daughter of Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi, were killed in the attack on Tripoli and
the port of Benghazi.
	   Reagan's name was not on the list released by Libya, according
to the MENA report.
	   The United States and Britain have demanded that Libya turn over
two suspects in the bombing of the Pan Am jet over Lockerbie,
Scotland.
	   They have said that if Libya does not do so, they will ask the
Security Council to expand sanctions against Libya.

Netanyahu urges top Likud ministers not to defect to other parties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Trying to stem a wave of defections from his
political camp, embattled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged
top Cabinet ministers Wednesday not to leave his Likud Party ahead
of May elections.
	   Netanyahu also played down a veiled threat by his closest
political ally, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, to run for prime
minister.
	   ``We are cooperating fully to win the elections,'' Netanyahu
said on Israel radio, referring to Sharon. ``I intend with his help
... to lead the government forward.''
	   Netanyahu is fighting an uphill battle to win re-election May
17.
	   He faces a growing field of challengers, including members of
his own Likud Party who either seek to wrest the party's nomination
from him or plan to run on their own slate.
	   Netanyahu's former foreign minister, David Levy, is negotiating
the terms of a political partnership with opposition leader Ehud
Barak. His agricultural minister, Rafael Eitan, has announced that
he is seeking the premiership. Eitan heads the Tsomet Party which
ran on a joint slate with Likud in 1996.
	   Two key Cabinet members from Likud, Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai and Communications Minister Limor Livnat, are considering
leaving the party to join a centrist slate being formed by a
popular former army chief of staff, Amnon Lipkin-Shahak.
	   Mordechai's departure would be a serious blow for Netanyahu and
underscore his growing political isolation. Mordechai is popular
among the Likud rank-and-file, especially with Sephardi voters.
	   It is speculated that if Mordechai quits the Likud, Sharon will
make his move and challenge Netanyahu for the premiership.
	   Asked Wednesday what message he had for Mordechai and Livnat,
Netanyahu said: ``Stay in your (political) home.''
	   Israeli President Ezer Weizman, meanwhile, came under fire after
the Haaretz daily reported that he had told visitors Barak and
Shahak should join forces, presumably to be in a better position to
beat Netanyahu. The job of president in Israel is largely
ceremonial and he is expected to remain above the political fray.
	   Weizman did not comment on the Haaretz report, but said
Wednesday that he would try everything in his power to get the
peace agreement with the Palestinians back on track.
	   ``My message today is that peace is paramount,'' Weizman said.
	   `I have limitations ... and people would like to limit me
more,'' he added, referring to the restrictions of his office and
the most recent criticism.
	   Netanyahu froze implementation of the Wye River
land-for-security agreement last month, citing Palestinian
violations of the accord.
	   Barak and Shahak are staunch supporters of the peace agreements
with the Palestinians, and while still in the army, were involved
in the peace talks.

Emirates pardons 171 prisoners in Ramadan gesture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ The Emirates granted amnesty
Wednesday to 171 prisoners to mark the Islamic holy month of
Ramadan, the official news agency reported.
	   The emirate of Sharjah released 125 prisoners while the
neighboring emirate of Ajman freed 46, the Emirates News Agency
said.
	   The fasting month of Ramadan marks the revelation of the Koran,
Islam's holy book, to the Prophet Mohammed some 1,400 years ago.
Muslims are forbidden to eat, drink or have sex between sunrise and
sunset during the month.
	   During Ramadan, and the feast that follows it, many Arab Gulf
rulers grant amnesties to petty criminals.
	   Sharjah and Ajman are two of the seven emirates of the United
Arab Emirates.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Thick fog over Warsaw prevented planes
from landing Wednesday, causing delays or cancellations of outgoing
international flights and jeopardizing New Year's Eve plans of
stranded travelers.
	   A Delta Airlines flight from New York to Warsaw had to land in
Prague in neighboring Czech Republic, and the airline said the
unspecified number of passengers on board would spend the night
there.
	   That stranded 80 passengers waiting in Warsaw for the return
flight. Hundreds more passengers on canceled flights for
Copenhagen, Zurich, Paris and Frankfurt stood in front of the
flight information board at Okecie airport, hoping for a sudden
change in the weather.
	   ``I have a New Year's Eve date with my boyfriend in Paris,''
said Monica Kubiak, 25, as she punched numbers on her cellular
telephone. ``I'm optimistic, but we'll see.''
	   While two international flights landed in the afternoon, cloud
levels as low as 30 meters (100 feet) made conditions too dangerous
most of the day, said airline spokesman Marek Wos. He said the
airport lacked the radar technology for flights to land in such
conditions.
	   Outside the Delta office, U.S. college students Joe Cali, 21,
Maja Toth, 20, and her brother Joey, 19, wondered if they would be
able to attend a New Year's Eve block party in Phoenix, Arizona, as
planned.
	   Cali seemed more concerned about using his ticket for the Jan. 4
Fiesta Bowl college football championship game, being played in
Arizona.
	   ``As long as I make the Fiesta Bowl, I'll be happy,'' he said.
	   The three complained that little information on the canceled
flight was immediately available.
	   ``I thought it was pretty unprofessional,'' Cali said. ``They
tell us it's leaving at 1 o'clock, but no one tells us it was
canceled.''
	   Some incoming planes were rerouted to other airports in Poland,
such as Krakow or Poznan, while all domestic flights were canceled.
An airport spokeswoman said 16 international flights left Warsaw by
midday, all behind schedule.
	   Delta officials in Prague said all passengers on the diverted
flight from New York were fine, but they refused to release the
number or say when they would get to Warsaw.
	   In Warsaw, Delta officials said the flight diverted to Prague
would come to Warsaw on Thursday morning, weather permitting, and
then make the return flight to New York.

Israel's parliament bans genetic cloning of humans for five years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's parliament has passed legislation that
bans cloning humans for the next five years and monitors genetic
research, the sponsor of the bill said Wednesday.
	   The law, passed Tuesday, allows genetic intervention for medical
purposes, such as cloning a healthy organ for donation. Researchers
wishing to conduct experiments in human genetics must show an
advisory committee that their research does not violate the ban, an
infraction punishable by two years in prison.
	   ``Human cloning endangers humanity as seriously as nuclear
weapons,'' said Labor Party legislator Hagai Merom. ``That also
began as an experiment but later became a weapon of mass
destruction.''
	   The committee will report yearly to the science minister to
reassess whether the outlawed research harms human dignity.
	   Merom said doctors, researchers, legislators, philosophers and
religious leaders discussed the issue for 18 months before agreeing
to the five-year moratorium. In 2003, parliament will decide
whether to renew the ban.
	   Unlike Christian leaders who have called for a ban on human
cloning, Israel's Chief Rabbinate has said Jewish law does not
necessarily rule it out.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's controversial navy chief, who
failed to promote officials recommended by the Defense Ministry,
was fired Wednesday following a long-running spat with top
bureaucrats.
	   ``The government has terminated the services of Chief of Navy
Staff Admiral (Vishnu) Bhagwat,'' an official statement said. The
dismissal took effect immediately.
	   Vice Adm. Sushil Kumar, who was in charge of the navy's
operations in south India, was named the new naval chief.
	   The government also transferred Ajit Kumar, the top official in
the Defense Ministry involved in the controversy, to the industrial
policy and promotion department.
	   The decision came following acrimonious exchange of letters
between Bhagwat and the Defense Ministry. Bhagwat was unavailable
for comment.

Israel put price tag on the Golan Heights
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel conducted a survey to determine how much
money it would have to pay residents of the Golan Heights if it
were to give their land back to Syria, Israel's former finance
minister said Wednesday.
	   ``When we started serious discussions with the Syrians in '95,
we did an inventory of what it was we were dealing with,'' said
Labor legislator Avraham Shohat, who supervised the year-long
survey when he was finance minister.
	   Shohat said the survey was conducted under Labor prime ministers
Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, but stopped when Benjamin
Netanyahu's Likud government came into power in May, 1996.
	   The Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot reported Wednesday that
Netanyahu's government continued the assessment project.
Netanyahu's office was not immediately available for comment.
	   Shohat wouldn't say how much the Golan was actually worth, but
Yediot Ahronot put the price tag at ten billion shekels (dlrs 2.5
billion).
	   Golan Heights residents complained that the government made
plans to turn over their land in secret.
	   ``We are a sovereign part of Israel'' said Avi Zeira, chairman
of the Golan Heights residents committee. ``The government must not
deal with this (possibility).''
	   Shohat said that while no withdrawal plans had been formulated,
he ordered the survey learn estimated costs. He said the project
was conducted secretly to avoid inflaming a sensitive issue.
	   Israel captured the heights from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war
and annexed the area in 1981.
	   Israel conducted peace talks with the Syrians under the Labor
governments of Rabin and Peres, but talks broke off when
Netanyahu's Likud government came to power.
	   Syria says that when the talks broke off in 1996, the Peres
government had given the Syrians to understand that for a full
peace agreement, they could expect to get all of the Golan.
	   The Syrians insist that the Netanyahu government recognize the
understandings Damascus reached with the previous Israeli
government. Netanyahu has refused to do so, saying continued
control over the Golan is vital for Israel's security. He has
approved expansion of Jewish settlements in the Golan.
	   Last week, the Israeli press reported that Netanyahu and
opposition leader Ehud Barak reached a secret deal to give back the
Golan. Netanyahu denied the report.
	   About 17,000 Israelis live in the Golan, along with about 14,000
Druze Arabs.

Singapore announces point system to assess immigrant applications

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Immigration authorities announced Wednesday a
point system for assessing permanent resident applicants on their
ability to contribute to Singapore's economy.
	   It is the first time the criteria have ever been publicly
stated, said government television. The new rules take effect Jan.
2.
	   The city-state of 3.1 million people is undergoing its severest
economic crisis in more than a decade and many have complained
about the government's policy of encouraging ``foreign talent.''
	   At the same time, it was announced that professional visit visas
will no longer be required for businessmen participating in trade
shows. However, journalists covering specific news events and those
coming for religious or political reasons will still need the
special visas.
	   Trade show participants had in the past found themselves in
Singapore illegally because they didn't know of the requirement for
work visas, said Graham Hayward, chairman of the Singapore Chamber
of Commerce.
	   Those seeking permanent residence will be judged on the basis of
points, awarded for the type of work they wish to do, how long they
want to stay, their academic qualifications, monthly salary, age
and local kinship ties.

<TEXT>
	   OBERSTDORF, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Martin Schmitt, emerging
from nowhere this season, outleaped Austria's Andreas Goldberger
Wednesday to capture the first stop of the ski jumping Four Hills
tour.
	   Schmitt, luring a record crowd of 40,000 to the event, soared to
jumps of 120.0 and 115.5 meters to compile 244.8 points and edge
Goldberger at 242.8.
	   It also proved once again his unexpected success this season is
no fluke.
	   It was the 20-year-old German's fifth World Cup win in seven
outings this season, although he still slightly trails Finland's
Janne Ahonen in the overall standings.
	   Schmitt popularity in Germany has exploded, one reason the crowd
shattered the previous record in Obersthof of 24,000.
	   ``All those spectators motivate me. The mood here was crazy, it
was fun,'' said Schmitt, whose best finish until this season was an
11th. ``I'm sure the attention will get even worse, but I think I
know when to turn off.''
	   Japan's Noriaki Kasai finished third at 241.7 points while
Austria's Andreas Widhoelzl faded to fourth after leading after the
first jump.
	   Widhoelzl, as a backwind pushed up distances on the first leap,
jumped to a day's best of 124.0 meters. But his sizeable lead
melted away on his second attempt when he could only manage 109.5
meters.
	   ``That Wildhoelzl failed was my luck. He knew he had to jump at
least 111, 112 meters to match me. He probably put himself under
too much pressure,'' said Schmitt.
	   The other three Four Hills tour stops will be held at
Garmisch-Partenkirchen on New Year's Day, Innsbruck on Jan. 3 and
Bischofshofen on Jan. 6.
	   Ahonen had to settle for fifth after leaps of 117.00 and 115.00
meters but it was enough to maintain first in the overall World Cup
standings.
	   Ahonen, who seized the lead when Schmitt sat out the last two
World Cup events, has 653 points to the German's 640. Olympic
champion Kazuyoshi Funaki of Japan is third at 478.
	   Funaki finished sixth with leaps of 118.0 and 113.0.

	   The kidnappers, from Yemen-based group of about 200 members
called Islamic Jihad, had demanded the release from prison of two
of the group's leaders and were protesting the recent U.S.-British
airstrikes against Iraq, Yemeni security officials said.
	   Yemeni officials blamed the kidnappers for the deaths. Brig.
Mohammad Saleh al-Turaiq, the chief of security in Aden province,
said Wednesday that the kidnappers were the first to open fire.
	   One kidnapper ``began shooting at the hostages, which forced our
troops to storm the hideout,'' he told reporters in the presence of
the British Ambassador Vic Henderson
	   Al-Turaiq said his forces were chasing some kidnappers who got
away. He accused foreign elements of instigating the kidnapping,
but refused to elaborate.
	   The security chief said the kidnapper who opened fire on the
hostages was an Egyptian. Yemeni officials already have identified
the Egyptian as Osama al-Masri. In Cairo, Egyptian security sources
said the name was the alias of a wanted Islamic extremist. They
refused to give his real name.

	   British newspapers accused Yemeni authorities of intervening
prematurely. The Daily Mail asked on the front page, ``Did our
tourists really need to die?''
	   British Ambassador Vic Henderson reportedly had pleaded with the
San`a government to do nothing ``that in any way could jeopardize
the safety of the hostages.''
	   Foreigners often are kidnapped in Yemen, large parts of which
are run by tribes. But until now the hostages usually have been
treated well and released unharmed. Tribesmen typically use
kidnappings to pressure the government into providing new roads,
water or clinics.
	   This was the first time an abduction was carried out by Islamic
militants. Security officials said the kidnappers belong to Islamic
Jihad, many of whose leaders fought Russian troops in Afghanistan.
The group is believed to have about 200 members.
	   The 16 tourists, 12 Britons, two Americans and two Australians,
were kidnapped Monday near Mawdiyah.
	   In London, the Foreign Office confirmed that three Britons _
Ruth Williamson, Margaret Whitehouse and Peter Rowe _ were killed,
but did not provide their ages or hometowns.
	   The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the
fourth victim was a 35-year-old man from Sydney whose name would
not be released until next of kin had been informed.
	   Al-Jamhouriya Hospital officials in the southern port of Aden,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said one of the wounded women
was shot in the shoulder and the other in the pelvis, and that both
had lost a lot of blood.
	   One of the wounded, Claire Marston of Britain, was ``in a very
bad way,'' British diplomat David Pearce told reporters at the
hospital.
	   Marston was awake after surgery on her shoulder and knew her
husband, Canadian-born Peter Rowe, was one of the hostages who had
been killed, Pearce said.
	   The two women were ``as well as can be expected,'' he added.
	   Surviving hostages were recovering from their ordeal at a hotel
in Aden, where British and American volunteers helped them cope
with their trauma, Pearce said.
	   The kidnapping began Monday when the tourists' convoy of five
vehicles was ambushed by men who opened fire on their police
escorts. The kidnappers threatened to kill the tourists if the
police did not back off, Yemeni security officials said.
	   The kidnappers demanded the release of their leader, Saleh
Haidara al-Atwi, who was detained two weeks ago in a government
crackdown on Islamic vigilantes who had been enforcing strict
Islamic rules in southern Yemen, security officials said.
	   The kidnappers also wanted the release of another leader and
were protesting the recent U.S. and British airstrikes against
Iraq, the officials said.
	   The officials identified one of the captured kidnappers as Osama
al-Masri of Egypt.

Yugoslavia seeks to have Kosovo rebels declared terrorists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with radical opposition backing KLA.
 &UR; By VESELIN TOSHKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top government official in Kosovo
warned in remarks published Wednesday that Serbia is running out of
patience with ethnic Albanian rebels and suggested it could launch
another large-scale action against them.
	   Veljko Odalovic, the province's leading official, accused the
Kosovo Liberation Army of taking advantage of an October truce to
take positions abandoned by withdrawing Serbian police and Yugoslav
army.
	   ``We have to defend our state, its integrity and people ... with
or without the international community,'' said Odalovic in an
interview with the Belgrade daily Glas. ``There will be problems,
but we will punish the last terrorist.''
	   Odalovic's comments came amid growing fears that the October
truce, mediated by American diplomats, could collapse altogether.
Four days of fierce fighting last week in northern Kosovo claimed
at least 15 lives and sent thousands fleeing.
	   Serb officials accuse the KLA of triggering the clashes by
attacking police and army units. Yugoslavia, formed of Serbia and
Montenegro, on Tuesday urged the United Nations to declare the KLA
a terrorist organization and crack down on their support network
abroad.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is monitoring the Kosovo truce, has sent an additional 100
international observers to the province. They will bring to about
700 the number of Americans, Canadians and Europeans trying to ease
tensions in Kosovo.
	   An OSCE spokesman said the province was quiet Wednesday. On
Tuesday Serb sources reported that the bodies of five ethnic
Albanians were found in three different locations in Kosovo. It was
not clear who killed them.
	   In Pristina, an alliance of radical Kosovo Albanian parties
expressed full support Wednesday for the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   ``The Kosovo Liberation Army is the central national, political
and moral force,'' said Rexhep Qosja, the leader of six parties and
political groups of ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province.
	   The alliance is a rival of the main ethnic Albanian leader,
Ibrahim Rugova, despite their common ultimate goal of an
independent Kosovo. Though most Kosovo Albanians still support
Rugova, the statement was symbolically important to the KLA, which
is at odds with the Rugov camp.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ In his New Year's address, German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said the new beginning promised in
1999 by the government's return to Berlin does not mean an end to
remembering Germany's past.
	   ``We cannot allow a final line to be drawn under the past, just
as we can't look away when injustice and violence occurs today
against minorities or people of other origins,'' he said in an
advance copy of a speech to be broadcast Thursday.
	   Schroeder, the first German chancellor too young to remember
World War II, noted that Germany's federal republic and its postwar
constitution turn 50 years old in 1999. ``And today we can say,
full of pride: `We've created a model that has proven itself,''' he
said.
	   The same values of a ``living democracy'' will be transferred
along with parliament and the government from Bonn to Berlin this
year, he promised. ``Berlin will then really be our capital, and
not just on paper.''
	   Parliamentary president Wolfgang Thierse, in his New Year's
address, described Berlin as ``the suture point of German unity''
and called for a continuation of ``good democratic politics.''
	   Schroeder and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer reiterated their
desire to make fighting unemployment their No. 1 goal in the New
Year, when Germany takes over the rotating European Union
presidency. Other important goals are strengthening the union and
passing administrative and agricultural reforms.
	   Schroeder also noted Germany hosts the 1999 Group of Seven
summit of leading industrial nations. ``There we'll especially have
to work on an international financial architecture that will
prevent entire economies from collapsing through speculation,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
	   ADEN, Yemen (AP) _ Westerners freed after a shootout fatal to
four foreign tourists said Wednesday that the battle started when
Yemeni security forces attacked Islamic radicals holding the
foreigners hostage.
	   Their accounts appeared to contradict a Yemeni government
statement, which said security forces only opened fire Tuesday
after the kidnappers began killing some of their hostages at a camp
in the country's south.
	   But the hostages told The Associated Press that once their
kidnappers were attacked, they tried to use their prisoners as
shields and eventually shot two of the captives in ``revenge
killings'' as they fled.
	   ``The worst time for me was that time when a barrel was pointed
at my chest. I said, `No, no, no,''' recounted Eric Firkin, who
said a fellow captive, a woman, was shot dead in front of him by
one of the kidnappers.
	   Three Britons and an Australian were killed in the siege
Tuesday, and an American and a Briton were wounded. Yemen's
Interior Ministry said its forces killed three of the kidnapers and
captured three others during the shootout near Mawdiyah town, 175
miles (286 kilometers) south of the capital, San`a.
	   The 16 hostages _ 12 Britons, two Americans and two Australians
_ were seized nearby a day earlier.
	   Firkin, 55, from Croyden, England, said he was with a group of
11 hostages. The kidnappers had split their captives into two
groups. Firkin and Brian Smith, another hostage, said they did not
know how the other group had come under attack.
	   Both men said two in their group were killed by the kidnappers
after the hostages wound up in the middle of a battle started when
government troops opened fire.
	   ``We were being led into the mountains to a hideout. Then we
heard the gunfire,'' said Firkin, a chemistry professor whose
sandals were still dusty from the trek.
	   He and Smith, 52, a postal worker from Peterborough, England,
were interviewed at a hotel in the southern port of Aden where they
were taken to rest from their ordeal.
	   Smith said the gun battle went on for about two hours, with
bullets whizzing over the heads of the hostages.
	   ``We were in the middle of a battle. We weren't armed, with no
military knowledge,'' he said.
	   One of the wounded, Claire Marston of Britain, was ``in a very
bad way,'' British diplomat David Pearce told reporters at
Al-Jamhouriya Hospital in Aden.
	   Marston was awake after surgery on her shoulder _ where she was
shot _ and knew her husband, Canadian-born Peter Rowe, had been
killed, Pearce said.
	   The two women were ``as well as can be expected,'' he added. The
other woman, an unidentified American, was shot in the pelvis,
hospital officials said on condition of anonymity.
	   In San`a, Brig. Mohammad Saleh al-Turaiq, the chief of security
in Aden province, said Wednesday that the kidnappers were the first
to open fire.
	   ``The Egyptian (kidnapper) began shooting at the hostages, which
forced our troops to storm the hideout,'' he told reporters in the
presence of the British ambassador.
	   Al-Turaiq said his forces were chasing some kidnappers who got
away. He accused foreign elements of instigating the kidnapping,
but refused to elaborate.
	   Yemeni officials have identified the Egyptian as Osama al-Masri.
In Cairo, Egyptian security sources said the name was the alias of
a wanted Islamic extremist. They refused to give his real name.
	   The officials said the kidnappers belonged to Islamic Jihad, a
group of about 200 members based in a camp in south Yemen.
	   They had seized the hostages to demand the release of two of
their leaders and in protest against the recent U.S. and British
airstrikes against Iraq, officials said. Police had detained the
leaders in a crackdown on Islamic vigilantes.
	   Kidnappings of foreigners occur often in Yemen, large parts of
which are run by lawless tribes, but until now the hostages usually
have been treated well and released unharmed.
	   This was the first time Islamic extremists had abducted
foreigners.
	   British newspapers accused the Yemeni authorities of premature
intervention. The Daily Mail asked on the front page, ``Did our
tourists really need to die?''
	   British Ambassador Vic Henderson reportedly had pleaded with the
San`a government to do nothing ``that in any way could jeopardize
the safety of the hostages.''
	   In San`a, Yemenis told journalists they were surprised the
government had intervened so quickly when it usually negotiated for
several days, if not weeks, with kidnappers.
	   After the killings, Germany appealed to the San`a government not
to attempt to rescue the four Germans held hostage by a tribe in
northeast Yemen, Yemeni officials said Wednesday.
	   The British Foreign Office confirmed that three Britons _ Ruth
Williamson, Margaret Whitehouse and Rowe _ were killed, but did not
provide their ages or hometowns.
	   The Australian's name is Andrew Colin Thirsk, 35, of Sydney.
	   The kidnapping began when the tourists' convoy of five vehicles
was ambushed by men who opened fire on their police escorts, Yemeni
security officials said.
	   Yemen said negotiations had been underway when the shootout
began. Tribesmen usually kidnap foreigners to press the government
to provide new roads, water or clinics.

	   ADEN, Yemen (AP) _ Hostages freed after a shootout that killed
four foreign tourists said Wednesday that the battle started when
Yemeni security forces attacked the Islamic militants who were
holding the foreigners hostage.
	   Their accounts appeared to contradict a Yemeni government
statement, which said security forces only opened fire Tuesday

Interior Ministry said its forces killed three of the kidnappers
and captured three others during the shootout in Mawdiyah town, 175
miles (290 kilometers) south of the capital, San`a.
	   The kidnappers, from Yemen-based group of about 200 members
called Islamic Jihad, had demanded the release from prison of two
of the group's leaders and were protesting the recent U.S.-British
airstrikes against Iraq, Yemeni security officials said.
	   Surviving hostages told The Associated Press that once their
kidnappers were attacked, they tried to use their prisoners as
shields and eventually shot two of the captives in ``revenge
killings'' as they fled.
	   ``The worst time for me was that time when a barrel was pointed

are run by tribes. But until now the hostages usually have been
treated well and released unharmed. Tribesmen typically use
kidnappings to pressure the government into providing new roads,
water or clinics.
	   This was the first time an abduction was carried out by Islamic
militants.
	   The 16 tourists, 12 Britons, two Americans and two Australians,
were kidnapped Monday near Mawdiyah.
	   In London, the Foreign Office confirmed that three Britons _
Ruth Williamson, Margaret Whitehouse and Peter Rowe _ were killed,
but did not provide their ages or hometowns.
	   The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the
fourth victim was a 35-year-old man from Sydney whose name would
not be released until next of kin had been informed.
	   One of the wounded, Claire Marston of Britain, was ``in a very
bad way,'' British diplomat David Pearce told reporters at
Al-Jamhouriya Hospital in Aden. Marston was awake after surgery on
a shoulder wound and knew her husband, Canadian-born Peter Rowe,

Pearce said.
	   The two women were ``as well as can be expected,'' he added.
	   The kidnapping began Monday when the tourists' convoy of five
vehicles was ambushed by men who opened fire on their police
escorts. The kidnappers threatened to kill the tourists if the
police did not back off, Yemeni security officials said.
	   The kidnappers demanded the release of their leader, Saleh
Haidara al-Atwi, who was detained two weeks ago in a government
crackdown on Islamic vigilantes who had been enforcing strict
Islamic rules in southern Yemen, security officials said.
	   The kidnappers also wanted the release of another leader and
were protesting the recent U.S. and British airstrikes against
Iraq, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

16 Iranian groups form coalition to contest municipal elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Sixteen moderate political groups have
formed a coalition to contest crucial municipal elections in
February, newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   The elections will present a fresh test of popularity for
politicians aligned with the reformist President Mohammad Khatami
and his hard-line rivals in the ruling clergy.
	   The new coalition, which calls itself the Coordination
Headquarters of the Elections of the Islamic Councils, said it will
try to make its mark in the Feb. 26 polls for mayors and municipal
councils _ the first to be held since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   Moderates hope the municipal elections will produce a huge
turnout similar to the one that gave Khatami his own victory in the
May 1997 polls. Of Iran's 38.5 million eligible voters, 30 million
cast ballots, 20 million of them for Khatami.
	   ``We call on those who were active in the presidential elections
to cooperate with our group and continue playing a role,'' Khordad
newspaper quoted a statement by the coalition as saying.
	   A victory by moderate candidates would be seen as an endorsement
of Khatami's efforts to ease social and political restrictions
imposed by the clergy.
	   Among the groups in the coalition is the powerful and outspoken
student association, the Office of Fostering Unity, and the
newly-formed Participation Front of Islamic Iran, which was
launched by government officials allied with Khatami.
	   The influential Association of Combatant Clergy, of which
Khatami was a founder, is also part of the coalition.
	   There are 10,000 municipalities in Iran, and voters will be
selecting mayors and governing councils. More than 200,000
officials will be elected to manage local government affairs and
advise the central government on social and cultural activities.
	   Political parties are not allowed in Iran and candidates are
officially independent but usually aligned to either moderate or
hard-line camps.
	   Since Khatami took office, hard-liners have resisted his efforts
to grant more freedom to the press and the arts and to reduce
Islamic strictures on average Iranians _ reforms that seem to have
widespread public support.

Former hostages say Yemeni troops started fatal shootout

<TEXT>
	   ADEN, Yemen (AP) _ Hostages freed after a shootout that killed
four foreign tourists said Wednesday that the battle started when
Yemeni security forces attacked the Islamic militants who were
holding the foreigners hostage.
	   Their accounts appeared to contradict a Yemeni government
statement, which said security forces only opened fire Tuesday
after the kidnappers began killing some of their hostages at a camp
in the country's south.
	   Three Britons and an Australian were killed in the siege
Tuesday, and an American and a Briton were wounded. Yemen's
Interior Ministry said its forces killed three of the kidnappers
and captured three others during the shootout in Mawdiyah town, 175
miles (290 kilometers) south of the capital, San`a.
	   The 16 hostages _ 12 Britons, two Americans and two Australians
_ were seized nearby a day earlier.
	   The kidnappers, from Yemen-based group of about 200 members
called Islamic Jihad, had demanded the release from prison of two
of the group's leaders and were protesting the recent U.S.-British
airstrikes against Iraq, Yemeni security officials said.
	   Surviving hostages told The Associated Press that once their
kidnappers were attacked, they tried to use their prisoners as
shields and eventually shot two of the captives in ``revenge
killings'' as they fled.
	   ``The worst time for me was that time when a barrel was pointed
at my chest. I said, `No, no, no,'' recounted Eric Firkin, who said
a fellow captive, a woman, was shot dead in front of him by one of
the kidnappers.
	   Firkin, 55, from Croyden, England, said he was with a group of
11 hostages. The kidnappers had split their 16 captives into two
groups, and Firkin and Brian Smith, another hostage, said they did
not know how the other group had come under attack.
	   Both men said their group wound up in the middle of a gun battle
after government troops opened fire on the kidnappers as they fled
with their hostages.
	   ``We were being led into the mountains to a hiding. Then we
heard the gunfire,'' said Firkin, a chemistry professor whose
sandals were still dusty from the trek.
	   He and Smith, 52, a postal worker from Peterborough, England,
were interviewed at a hotel in the southern port of Aden where
surviving hostages were taken to rest from their ordeal.
	   Smith said the gun battle went on for about two hours, with
bullets whizzing over the heads of the hostages.
	   ``We were in the middle of a battle. We weren't armed,'' he
said.
	   In San`a, Brig. Mohammad Saleh al-Turaiq, the chief of security
in Aden province, said Wednesday that the kidnappers were the first
to open fire.
	   ``The Egyptian (kidnapper) began shooting at the hostages, which
forced our troops to storm the hideout,'' he told reporters in the
presence of the British ambassador.
	   Al-Turaiq said his forces were chasing some kidnappers who got
away. He accused foreign elements of instigating the kidnapping,
but refused to elaborate.
	   Yemeni officials have identified the Egyptian as Osama al-Masri.
In Cairo, Egyptian security sources said the name was the alias of
a wanted Islamic extremist. They refused to give his real name.
	   One of the wounded, Claire Marston of Britain, was ``in a very
bad way,'' British diplomat David Pearce told reporters at
Al-Jamhouriya Hospital in Aden.
	   Marston was awake after surgery on her shoulder _ where she was
shot _ and knew her husband, Canadian-born Peter Rowe, had been
killed, Pearce said.
	   The two women were ``as well as can be expected,'' he added. The
other woman, an unidentified American, was shot in the pelvis,
hospital officials said on condition of anonymity.
	   Kidnappings of foreigners occur often in Yemen, large parts of
which are run by tribes, but until now the hostages usually have
been treated well and released unharmed.
	   This was the first time Islamic extremists had abducted
foreigners.
	   British newspapers accused the Yemeni authorities of premature
intervention. The Daily Mail asked on the front page, ``Did our
tourists really need to die?''
	   British Ambassador Vic Henderson reportedly had pleaded with the
San`a government to do nothing ``that in any way could jeopardize
the safety of the hostages.''
	   In San`a, Yemenis told journalists they were surprised the
government had intervened so quickly when it usually negotiated for
several days, if not weeks, with kidnappers.
	   After the killings, Germany appealed to the San`a government not
to attempt to rescue the four Germans held hostage by a tribe in
northeast Yemen, Yemeni officials said Wednesday.
	   The British Foreign Office confirmed that three Britons _ Ruth
Williamson, Margaret Whitehouse and Rowe _ were killed, but did not
provide their ages or hometowns.
	   The Australian's name is Andrew Colin Thirsk, 35, of Sydney.
	   The kidnapping began when the tourists' convoy of five vehicles
was ambushed by men who opened fire on their police escorts, Yemeni
security officials said.
	   Yemen said negotiations had been underway when the shootout
began. Tribesmen usually kidnap foreigners to press the government
to provide new roads, water or clinics.

Planned strike by clubs deals another blow to already reeling

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Violence, bribery and corruption
allegations and now a strike by clubs. The beating being taken by
Greek soccer will continue into the new year.
	   All first-, second- and third-division games planned for this
weekend were called off Tuesday by the Association of Professional
Soccer Clubs (EPAE) because of money it says the government owes it
from the weekly gambling pools.
	   And if it doesn't get it by Monday, it will extend the strike
for games Jan. 9-11.
	   EPAE is demanding 300 million drachmas (more than dlrs 1
million) from OPAP, the state agency that organizes the betting
pools, that already is owed and to increase its percentage from the
pool.
	   But the agency, known as OPAP, has refused to budge.
	   ``A hungry bear can't dance. We will play if OPAP gives us the
money,'' Iraklis club owner Petros Theodoridis was quoted in the
daily newspaper Sportime.
	   EPAE's actions appears to be further reducing the public's
interest in soccer _ which is losing popularity in Greece to
basketball.
	   ``It will not be the end of the world if there is no soccer for
a few weeks,'' the Athens daily Kathimerini quoted Sports Minister
Andreas Fouras as saying.
	   His comments seem to reflect the feelings of many soccer fans,
who have shown no signs of being troubled by the prospect of two
weekends without matches.
	   The strike comes towards the end of the holiday season, with
most people taking advantage of the long weekend to head to the
countryside.
	   But a recent series of violent incidents by fans and allegations
of bribery and corruption already have diminished the game's appeal
to mainstream followers.
	   Sparked by accusations of biased officiating, a wave of
vandalism and violence began in November. It led to harsh criticism
of the sport in a parliamentary committee report.
	   ``Our country is being internationally defamed at the time it is
preparing to organize the Olympic Games,'' the report said.
	   Fans that rioted after a first-division match on Dec. 8 between
Olympiakos Piraeus and its main rival Panathinaikos left a stream
of burned cars, battered bystanders and damaged seats in the
stadium set to host the 2004 Olympic Games.
	   Last year, nearly half the country's 300 lawmakers issued a
statement complaining soccer ``is being led to decline and
extermination.''

Switzerland reports zero inflation rate

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland has won the battle
against inflation, with a zero rate of price increase recorded for
1998, according to official figures issued Wednesday.
	   It was the lowest rate since 1959 and marked the fifth straight
year that the government had achieved its goal of price stability _
an inflation rate of less than 2 percent.
	   With the Swiss economy in good shape, the country's central bank
has said there is little chance of deflation or recession in the
foreseeable future.
	   Economists predict that an increase in value-added tax from Jan.
1 will lead to a rise in the consumer price index of around 0.5
percent early next year but have said significant price hikes are
unlikely.
	   The December consumer price index was unchanged from November
and decreased 0.2 percent year on year, the federal statistical
office said. This was partly thanks to falling gasoline prices and
personal computer prices.

Government announces formation of national child pornography
</HEADLINE>
investigation network

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The government will spend one
million guilders (dlrs 532,000) next year setting up a nationwide
police network dedicated to investigating child pornography, Dutch
Justice Minister Benk Korthals announced Wednesday.
	   The announcement follows a number of high-profile child sex
cases in the Netherlands since the summer when an international
pedophile ring's headquarters was discovered in a seaside
apartment.
	   Korthals plans to set up special child porn teams within police
forces across the country which will be coordinated from a national
center with its own public prosecutor. Currently, regional police
forces do not routinely exchange information on child porn
investigations.
	   The new approach also aims at simplifying probes into child
pornography spread on the Internet by setting up permanent
surveillance of Internet sites where pedophiles exchange child
pornographic images.
	   Korthals also announced that the government plans to raise the
penalty for employing child prostitutes in the nation's brothels
from one to six years.

State run company bans printing of Albanian daily
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A state-run printing house in Kosovo
on Wednesday served notice it would stop printing the oldest
Albanian-language daily in the Serbian province, in the latest step
of a crackdown on independent media.
	   A terse directive telling employees of the Panorama print works
not to print the Bujku daily was posted in the plant without any
details on the ban.
	   Bujku is one of the three largest dailies in the ethnic-Albanian
majority province which is gripped in a bloody struggle between
government forces and Albanian guerrillas seeking independence.
	   The authoritarian Serbian government, after cracking down
earlier this year on Serbian-language papers in the country, has
moved to suppress Albanian-language papers because of their support
for independence.
	   Bujku is the first Kosovo Albanian newspaper targeted. The
state-run plant actually stopped printing the daily two weeks ago,
claiming it was in arrears for printing costs. It has not appeared
on newsstands since then.
	   There was no immediate comment Wednesday from Bujku staff, but
other Albanian-language papers still publishing have said they
would defy government pressure on them.

16 Iranian groups form coalition to contest municipal elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Sixteen moderate political groups have
formed a coalition to contest crucial municipal elections in
February, newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   The elections will present a fresh test of popularity for
politicians aligned with the reformist President Mohammad Khatami
and his hard-line rivals in the ruling clergy.
	   The new coalition, which calls itself the Coordination
Headquarters of the Elections of the Islamic Councils, said it will
try to make its mark in the Feb. 26 polls for mayors and municipal
councils _ the first to be held since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   Moderates hope the municipal elections will produce a huge
turnout similar to the one that gave Khatami his own victory in the
May 1997 polls. Of Iran's 38.5 million eligible voters, 30 million
cast ballots, 20 million of them for Khatami.
	   ``We call on those who were active in the presidential elections
to cooperate with our group and continue playing a role,'' the
Khordad newspaper quoted a statement by the coalition as saying.
	   A victory by moderate candidates would be seen as an endorsement
of Khatami's efforts to ease social and political restrictions
imposed by the clergy.
	   Among the groups in the coalition is the powerful and outspoken
student association, the Office of Fostering Unity, and the
newly-formed Participation Front of Islamic Iran, which was
launched by government officials allied with Khatami.
	   The influential Association of Combatant Clergy, of which
Khatami was a founder, is also part of the coalition.
	   There are 10,000 municipalities in Iran, and voters will be
selecting mayors and governing councils. More than 200,000
officials will be elected to manage local government affairs and
advise the central government on social and cultural activities.
	   Political parties are not allowed in Iran and candidates are
officially independent but usually aligned to either moderate or
hard-line camps.
	   Since Khatami took office, hard-liners have resisted his efforts
to grant more freedom to the press and the arts and to reduce
Islamic strictures on average Iranians _ reforms that seem to have
widespread public support.

	   The introduction of the euro, a common currency for 11 countries
in Europe, on Jan. 4 will bring several changes to two AP financial
market fixtures. Here's a rundown:
	    &UR; FOREIGN CURRENCY TABLES &QC; 
	   Starting with tables produced Monday, Jan. 4, quotes for the ECU
and its forward contracts will be listed as euro. This item is
slugged BC-US-Foreign Exchange and moves to all points.
	   The currencies from the 11 participating countries will still
appear in the table. There will be a three-year transition period
during which euros and the existing national currencies will both
be recognized as legal tender.
	   However, during this time, the national currencies from the 11
countries will be locked to the euro, meaning that they will move
in unison against the dollar and other currencies as the euro does.
	   The 11 countries launching the euro are Austria, Belgium,
Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Spain and Portugal.
	    &UR; FOREIGN STOCK TABLES &QC; 
	   Starting Jan. 4, tables that show the prices of stocks traded in
the 11 countries using the euro will be quoted in euros. This item
is slugged BC-Europe Markets, which moves to subscribers in Europe
and Latin America.
	   The list that moves Dec. 31 will contain the current stock price
and the previous stock price in the existing currency. The list
that moves Jan. 4 will have both prices in euros.
	   The exchanges affected are: Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt,
Madrid, Milan, Paris. Exchanges in the list that won't be changing
are: Johannesburg, London, Stockholm and Zurich.

Kidnappers of wealthy lawyer escape with ransom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss police are hunting for three
kidnappers who seized a wealthy lawyer and escaped with 500,000
Swiss francs (dlrs 368,000) in ransom.
	   The hostage, 26-year-old Stephane Lagonico, was freed Dec. 23 as
he was being moved by car. He had been overpowered by four men two
days earlier while getting into his own vehicle in Lausanne.
	   Authorities only released details Wednesday. They said eight
people had been arrested but the three Swiss ringleaders remained
on the run.
	   Lagonico's parents paid out 500,000 francs in agreement with
police to trap the kidnappers, who initially demanded 5 million
francs (dlrs 3.7 million) ransom.
	   The Lagonico family is well-known and influential in the
French-speaking part of Switzerland.

Juve gives up bid to sign star Turkish striker Sukur
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Italian club Juventus is no longer
interested in signing Turkish striker Hakan Sukur from Galatasaray,
reports said Wednesday.
	   Celalettin Bilgic, a liaison official in Istanbul for Juventus,
told the Anatolia news agency that the Italian club has withdrawn
its reported dlrs 12-15 million transfer bid for Sukur.
	   Bilgic gave no reason for the Juventus decision.
	   But private NTV television speculated that Juve was put off by
Sukur's hesitation in accepting the transfer and by his financial
demands.
	   Sukur rebuffed the Juve offer last week but later accepted it on
condition that he is paid dlrs 2 million a year, reports said.
	   His reluctance to go back to Italy partly stemmed from a
diplomatic rift between Turkey and Italy over Rome's refusal to
extradite a Kurdish rebel leader, Abdullah Ocalan.
	   Sukur had a brief stint with Italian club Torino three years
ago.
	   The Galatasaray board, seeking ways to come out of a financial
crisis, was favorable to Sukur's transfer which would have brought
fresh income.
	   Sukur was the top scorer in the Turkish first division last
season with 32 goals for reigning champion Galatasaray.

Birth of the euro marks beginning of a new era in Europe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo BRU101 &QL; 
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The birth of the euro is nigh. The hype
and high anxiety turns to reality at midnight Thursday when 11
European nations deliver their joint currency and merge their
monetary policies, a giant step in solidifying European unity.
	   The euro will live as a virtual currency alongside German marks,
French francs, Italian lire and the others for three years before
it replaces them as the notes and coins used from Spain's
Mediterranean beaches to deep into Finland's frozen tundra.
	   The finance ministers and central bankers from the 11 European
Union nations meet here Thursday to irrevocably lock the exchange
rates of their currencies against the euro before toasting the
creation of the new currency, perhaps the most significant
development in the drive towards European unity since World War II.
	   On Jan 1, the euro will become a new trading currency around the
world and the Frankfurt-based European Central Bank will decide on
the monetary fate of the 11 euro nations. The euro is expected to
trade at around dlrs 1.18.
	   Of the 15 EU nations only Greece failed to make the strict
monetary conditions for joining, while Britain, Sweden and Denmark
decided to opt out for the time being, fearful the euro will erode
their cherished sovereignty. Surrendering one's currency
automatically means surrendering the right to set independent
monetary policy for domestic reasons, such as boosting the economy
or improving social conditions.
	   The euro will be the most palpable sign yet of European
integration, and will streamline trade in a bloc of 290 million
people with an economic clout rivaling that of the United States.
Prices in the neighboring countries will be simpler to compare,
international business will be easier and intra-euro trade will no
longer be hostage to fickle currency fluctuations, a major boon for
businesses.
	   For the world at large, visiting the 11 EU nations will become
somewhat easier, since they will be able to use euros when they pay
with credit cards and checks. Yet for the odd postcard and ice
cream, they will have to rely on the national currencies for three
more years. Euro notes and coins won't be issued until the first
half of 2002 only.
	   Banks, bonds and stock markets and international businesses do
not have that leeway and will spend the whole New Year weekend
adapting trading floors and computer screens to include the joint
currency to be ready when the euro shows up for its first working
day on Monday.
	   ``We will be forced to deal simultaneously with francs and euros
in our whole computer system during the first three-year period.
That's why we had to change 60,000 of our computer systems,'' said
Jean-Francois Colin, euro coordinator of France's Banque Nationale
de Paris.
	   The markets also want to minimize the risk of last minute
foul-ups during the few days of transition.
	   ``There is a lot of work that goes into the planning for this.
Banks and institutions have been working for many, many years.
We've had lots of dress rehearsals, lots of testing,'' said
Margaret Soden, a senior Manager of euro planning at the
London-based HSBC Bank.
	   There will also be festive events. Balloons, bearing the euro
symbol, will be sent skywards from EU headquarters in Brussels.

Olympic debut proposed for mermaid mimics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The obscure sport of fin swimming _ in
which racers don a mermaid-like flipper _ is being proposed to
become part of the Olympics, the organizers for the 2004 Games said
Wednesday.
	   The final decision on including any new sports rests with the
International Olympic Committee.
	   Fin swimmers stick both feet in a single rubber-and-fiberglass
``mono fin'' up to 80 centimeters (32 inches) wide. They clasp
their hands together in front and propel through the water with
undulating whale-like thrusts of the fin.
	   World-class fin swimmers can move about 30 percent faster than
their conventional counterparts. Some fin swimmers use a snorkel,
but it was not clear if it would be used in possible Olympic
competition.
	   The sport is growing in nations such as Russia, China and
Australia, organizers said.
	   Athens has already proposed water skiing for 2004. A spokeswoman
for the organizing committee, Julie Velisaratou, said billiards and
karate may also be suggested.
	   Other sports waiting for the Olympic limelight include surfing,
ballroom dancing, acrobatics, roller skating and basque pelota, a
fast squash-like game in which contestants hurl the ball with large
curled scoops.
	   At the 2000 games in Sydney, Australia, taekwondo and the
grueling swim-bike-run triathlon will be elevated to Olympic status
for the first time. In Atlanta in 1996, softball and beach
volleyball made their debut.

Virginia Tech stops Tide 38-7

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ Virginia Tech ended its 10-game
losing streak against the Alabama Crimson Tide Tuesday night,
intercepting three passes and blocking two punts enroute to a 38-7
rout in the inaugural Music City Bowl.
	   The victory ended a two-game losing streak in bowls for Virginia
Tech (9-3), one of only 10 American college gridiron football teams
to go to a post-season bowl game in each of the last six years.
	   The Hokies also picked up their first-ever victory over a
Southeastern Conference team.
	   The Hokies, second in the country with 23 interceptions this
season, set the tone when Keion Carpenter got to Alabama punter
Daniel Pope on his first punt of the game, and Ryan Smith
intercepted Andrew Zow's pass on Alabama's second possession.
	   Virginia Tech led 10-7 at halftime and then put the game away
with 28 unanswered points.
	   Zow was throwing from his own end zone when Phillip Summers
picked off his pass and returned it to the Alabama 2. Lamont Pegues
scored from a yard out two plays later for a 17-7 lead.
	   Corey Moore got his hand on Pope's punt on Alabama's next
possession, and Summers recovered at the Alabama 29. Shyrone Stith
ran in from 4 yards out a minute later for a 24-7 lead.
	   Jimmy Kibble got into the act with a 49-yard punt that backed up
Alabama's Arvin Richards, who had the ball bounce off him into the
arms of Tech's Cory Bird. That set up Pegues' second TD run of the
game for a 31-7 lead with 13:31 left.
	   Anthony Midget ended the scoring by stepping in front of Zow's
pass and returning it 27 yards for a TD midway through the final
quarter.

Angolan rebels bombard second-largest city

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Rebel forces Wednesday launched an
hour-long artillery bombardment against Huambo, the country's
second-largest city and a base for U.N. and aid agency staff,
according to reports.
	   Some shells landed in downtown areas of the central highland
city which lies about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of the
capital, Luanda, state radio RNA reported from Huambo.
	   The explosions reportedly began at noon and caused panic among
local people in the government-held city which the army is using as
a base to fly in reinforcements for fighting in surrounding areas.
	   Before the civil war restarted Dec. 4 Huambo had a population of
about 300,000, but tens of thousands of refugees fleeing fighting
in the countryside have converged on the city in recent weeks.
	   U.N. spokesman Hamadoun Toure said from Luanda he had no reports
of injuries to U.N. staff in Huambo.
	   The World Food Program and International Red Cross also have
staff in the city, but officials at those groups were not
immediately available for comment.
	   A cargo plane chartered by the United Nations crashed near
Huambo on Saturday with 14 people on board. The cause of the crash,
as the plane passed over the war zone, was not known.
	   Artillery shells were also landing about every 15 minutes in
Kuito, 130 kilometers (80 miles) to the east of Huambo, which has
been under a rebel siege for more than two weeks, according to RNA.
	   The rebels apparently were targeting the airport, RNA said.
	   The United Nations observer mission, which is monitoring a 1994
peace accord that halted a two-decade civil war between the rebels
and the government, has been unable to stop the renewed fighting
which so far been concentrated in the central highlands.
	   The U.N. Security Council has blamed UNITA, a Portuguese acronym
for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, for
the return to war.
	   UNITA refused to yield control of areas under its control and
maintained a hidden army, according to the United Nations.
	   The country has been ravaged by conflict since gaining
independence from Portugal in 1975.

	   ROME (AP) _ A U.N. agency that delivers emergency food aid says
that in 1999 more people around the world will probably need
humanitarian assistance because of crises this year like Hurricane
Mitch and economic collapses in Indonesia and Russia.
	   ``We have to enter 1999 with the understanding that we may face
an increased threat of famine, malnutrition and endemic hunger,''
Catherine Bertini, executive director of the World Food Program,
said in a statement Wednesday.
	   Other developments cited by the Rome-based agency as possible
causes for driving up world hunger: flareups of civil warfare in
Kosovo and Angola.

League chief urges apology for Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Arab League Secretary-General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid suggested Wednesday that many of Iraq's woes could
have been avoided if Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had apologized for
his 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   ``The recent ramifications of the Iraqi crisis represent a link
in a long chain of events that started with Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait,'' Abdel-Meguid said.
	   ``This crisis would have been resolved had the Iraqi regime
officially apologized for its aggression on the state of Kuwait,''
he added. ``But that never happened.''
	   Abdel-Meguid did not elaborate, but he seemed to be suggesting
that a formal apology might convince Kuwait and its Gulf allies to
support the league's efforts to end Iraq's isolation.
	   Abdel-Meguid made the remarks on an Egyptian television talk
show to be aired later in the day. Excerpts were carried by Egypt's
Middle East News Agency.
	   In the interview, Abdel-Meguid expressed regret that an Arab
League foreign ministers' meeting planned for this week to discuss
a call for an Arab Summit had been put off.
	   The postponement to Jan. 24 was requested by the Gulf states.
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations have not forgiven
Saddam for the 1990 invasion.
	   The league's ministers also were to discuss the U.S. and British
airstrikes that ended Dec. 20 and the effects of eight years of
U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
	   Abdel-Meguid said he agreed to the postponement of the meeting
to avoid a further split in Arab ranks, MENA said.

Bosnia's Muslim leader: optimistic about politics, pessimistic
</HEADLINE>
about economy in 1999

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia's Muslim leader is
predicting membership in the European Union next year despite
continued ethnic unrest, corruption and a sickly post-war economy
that is expected to continue to underperform in 1999.
	   ``We expect ... membership in the European Union,'' said Alija
Izetbegovic, the Muslim member of Bosnia's presidential troika.
Bosnia is not being considered for membership by the EU, and it was
unclear what Izetbegovic's optimism was based on _ even countries
being actively considered are not likely to be offered membership
as early as next year.
	   The 73-year-old leader of the Muslim Party of Democratic Action
spoke at his traditional year's end news conference. He said that
because of an expected decrease in foreign donations and plans to
sell parts of the state-run economy, the country will be facing
economic and social difficulties next year.
	   He blamed rampant corruption in the country on ``the fact that
the borders are open, uncontrolled, which gives endless
opportunities for smuggling and cheating on the state.''
	   Izetbegovic said attempts to unify the country in the wake of
war that ended in 1995 have foundered because of obstacles posed by
Bosnia's neighbors, Croatia, and Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.

Netanyahu urges top Likud ministers not to defect to other parties

 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Trying to stem a wave of defections from his
political camp, embattled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged
top Cabinet ministers Wednesday not to leave his Likud Party ahead
of May elections.
	   Netanyahu also played down a veiled threat by his closest
political ally, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, to run for prime
minister.
	   ``We are cooperating fully to win the elections,'' Netanyahu
said on Israel radio, referring to Sharon. ``I intend with his help
... to lead the government forward.''
	   Netanyahu is fighting an uphill battle to win re-election May
17.
	   He faces a growing field of challengers, including members of
his own Likud Party who either seek to wrest the party's nomination
from him or plan to run on their own slate.
	   Netanyahu's former foreign minister, David Levy, is negotiating
the terms of a political partnership with opposition leader Ehud
Barak. His agricultural minister, Rafael Eitan, has announced that
he is seeking the premiership. Eitan heads the Tsomet Party which
ran on a joint slate with Likud in 1996.
	   Two key Cabinet members from Likud, Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai and Communications Minister Limor Livnat, are considering
leaving the party to join a centrist slate being formed by a
popular former army chief of staff, Amnon Lipkin-Shahak.
	   Mordechai's departure would be a serious blow for Netanyahu and
underscore his growing political isolation. Mordechai is popular
among the Likud rank-and-file, especially with Sephardi voters.
	   It is speculated that if Mordechai quits the Likud, Sharon will
make his move and challenge Netanyahu for the premiership.
	   Asked Wednesday what message he had for Mordechai and Livnat,
Netanyahu said: ``Stay in your (political) home.''
	   Israeli President Ezer Weizman, meanwhile, came under fire after
the Haaretz daily reported that he had told visitors Barak and
Lipkin-Shahak should join forces, presumably to be in a better
position to beat Netanyahu. The job of president in Israel is
largely ceremonial and he is expected to remain above the political
fray.
	   Weizman did not comment on the Haaretz report, but said
Wednesday that he would try everything in his power to get the
peace agreement with the Palestinians back on track.
	   ``My message today is that peace is paramount,'' Weizman said.
	   `I have limitations ... and people would like to limit me
more,'' he added, referring to the restrictions of his office and
the most recent criticism.
	   Netanyahu froze implementation of the Wye River
land-for-security agreement last month, citing Palestinian
violations of the accord.
	   Barak and Lipkin-Shahak are staunch supporters of the peace
agreements with the Palestinians, and while still in the army, were
involved in the peace talks.

Hutu rebels kill eight in two separate attacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) _ Hutu rebels attempting to overthrow
the Tutsi-led government killed eight people and wounded another in
two separate attacks, government officials said.
	   The attacks took place late Tuesday in the province of Muramvya,
50 kilometers (22 miles) west of the capital, Bujumbura. One of the
victims was a local official; two others were teachers.
	   The killings were the latest in a spate of rebel attacks to hit
this tiny Central African nation. Insurgents killed four people,
including an agriculture official, in raids overnight Sunday in the
town of Buhonga, 5 miles south of the capital.
	   The rebels, who claim to represent the country's 85 percent Hutu
majority, are fighting to overthrow the government of Pierre
Buyoya, a retired Tutsi military officer, who seized the presidency
in a bloodless coup in 1996.
	   Bloodshed between the rebels and the Tutsi-dominated military
has claimed more than 200,000 lives, most of them civilian, since
1993, when Tutsi paratroopers killed the country's first
democratically elected president, a Hutu.
	   Talks on ending the conflict are scheduled to resume next month
in Arusha, Tanzania.

Allied forces claim gains in Congo fighting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANGUS SHAW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The Zimbabwe government claimed
Wednesday that allied forces of Congolese President Laurent have
captured two key towns from rebels.
	   The offensive began Dec. 25. and has halted rebel advances in
north and eastern Congo, the government said in a communique.
	   It said Allied Task Force headquarters in the Congolese capital,
Kinshasa, reported heavy enemy casualties in air strikes on rebel
and Rwandan and Ugandan positions along the Congo river with no
losses of allied aircraft.
	   None of the communique's claims could be independently
confirmed.
	   Zimbabwe has 8,000 troops backed by armor and warplanes fighting
alongside Congolese, Angolan, Chadian and Namibian troops in the
five-month Congo war.
	   An ``intensified offensive'' launched on Christmas Day ``largely
immobilized the invading forces and thwarted their attempts at any
further territorial gain,'' the Zimbabwe government said.
	   The communique gave no details of allied casualties. Zimbabwe
has said that 26 of its soldiers died in Congo since mid-August,
most in fighting over Kabalo that began two weeks ago.
	   The government said that Congolese forces on Monday captured the
town of Fizi, close to the border with Burundi, and this cut off a
key rebel supply route from their strongholds of Goma and Bukavu.
	   In the north, also on Monday, allies took control of the
rebel-held town of Businga near Gbadolite, the document said.
	   Gbadolite was the home of former Zairean dictator Mobutu Sese
Seko, who died shortly after being ousted by Kabila nearly two
years ago.
	   The communique said the allies captured former ethnic Hutu
militants who claimed they were released from Rwandan jails on
condition they join rebel forces. The captured men said they were
to help hold the strategic eastern town of Kabalo commanded by
Rwandan Tutsi officers.
	   It also alleged Ugandan forces were enticing retired Tanzanian
soldiers to join the rebels ``through offers of high financial
incentives and other lucrative packages.''
	   The Congolese rebels, backed by Rwanda and Uganda, are a
coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disaffected soldiers and opposition
politicians who took up arms Aug. 2 to topple Kabila. They accuse
him of corruption and fomenting ethnic war.
	   International efforts to broker a cease fire have been blocked
by Kabila's persistent refusal to negotiate with the rebels. He
accuses them of being puppets of Rwanda and Uganda.

Schmitt wins first of Four Hills and draws record crowd
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS Schmitt's best jump from 120.0 to 120.5 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OBERSTDORF, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Martin Schmitt, emerging
from nowhere this season, outleaped Austria's Andreas Goldberger
Wednesday to capture the first stop of the ski jumping Four Hills
tour.
	   Schmitt, luring a record crowd of 40,000 to the event, soared to
jumps of 120.5 and 115.5 meters to compile 244.8 points and edge
Goldberger at 242.8.
	   It also proved once again his unexpected success this season is
no fluke.
	   It was the 20-year-old German's fifth World Cup win in seven
outings this season, although he still slightly trails Finland's
Janne Ahonen in the overall standings.
	   Schmitt popularity in Germany has exploded, one reason the crowd
shattered the previous record in Obersthof of 24,000.
	   ``All those spectators motivate me. The mood here was crazy, it
was fun,'' said Schmitt, whose best finish until this season was an
11th. ``I'm sure the attention will get even worse, but I think I
know when to turn off.''
	   Japan's Noriaki Kasai finished third at 241.7 points while
Austria's Andreas Widhoelzl faded to fourth after leading after the
first jump.
	   Widhoelzl, as a backwind pushed up distances on the first leap,
jumped to a day's best of 124.0 meters. But his sizeable lead
melted away on his second attempt when he could only manage 109.5
meters.
	   ``That Wildhoelzl failed was my luck. He knew he had to jump at
least 111, 112 meters to match me. He probably put himself under
too much pressure,'' said Schmitt.
	   The other three Four Hills tour stops will be held at
Garmisch-Partenkirchen on New Year's Day, Innsbruck on Jan. 3 and
Bischofshofen on Jan. 6.
	   Ahonen had to settle for fifth after leaps of 117.00 and 115.00
meters but it was enough to maintain first in the overall World Cup
standings.
	   Ahonen, who seized the lead when Schmitt sat out the last two
World Cup events, has 653 points to the German's 640. Olympic
champion Kazuyoshi Funaki of Japan is third at 478.
	   Funaki finished sixth with leaps of 118.0 and 113.0.

Turkish Cypriots form new government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ President Rauf Denktash on Wednesday
approved a coalition government that promises to seek international
recognition for the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state and remain in
close cooperation in Turkey.
	   Dervis Eroglu remains premier under a coalition partnership with
a center-left party, led by Mustafa Akinci. Eroglu has led
goverments on the Turkish side of the divided island of Cyprus
since 1996.
	   ``Our foreign policy is based on the integration of Turkish
Cypriots with Turkey through a special relationship,'' the Turkish
Cypriot news agency TAK quoted Denktash as saying. ``It appears
that the new government will remain loyal to these principles.''
	   Cyprus has been split in two since 1974, when Turkey sent in
troops after a coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
	   The Turkish Cypriots declared their own state in 1983, which is
recognized only by Turkey.
	   U.N. efforts to reunify the island have failed and the Turkish
Cypriots now insist on international recognition before talks can
resume.
	   Eroglu's center-right National Unity Party won 24 seats in the
Dec 6. elections. Akinci's Salvation party has seven seats in the
50-member Parliament. Akinci is to serve as deputy premier in the
11-member Cabinet.
	   Eroglu received 40 percent of the votes in the elections, seen
as voter approval for his hard-line stance on the future of his
republic.

Catalan poet/artist Joan Brossa dies at 79
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ Joan Brossa, a versatile Catalan poet
associated with some of the pillars of the Spanish surrealist
movement and best known for his ``visual poems,'' died Wednesday,
National Spanish Television TVE reported.
	   Brossa died from a heart attack at a hospital in this
northeastern Spanish city. He was 79. His funeral was scheduled for
Thursday, TVE said.
	   A friend of artist Joan Miro, Brossa founded a surrealist
magazine called Dau al Set in 1948 together with another of
Catalonia's artistic lineup, Antoni Tapies.
	   His poems, written in Catalan, were first published in 1951 and
his last book came out in 1987.
	   Known for his caustic wit and hostility toward artistic
convention, Brossa began developing his ``visual poems'' in the
1950s _ a rifle barrel toped with a church candle snuffer entitled
``Conscientious Objector'' or a football crowned by a Spanish comb
entitled ``The Nation.''
	   Several examples of his work are displayed in major Spanish
galleries including the Reina Sofia modern art museum in Madrid and
the Fundacion Miro in Barcelona.
	   Upon learning of Brossa's death Tapies said, ``Brossa always
called himself a poet rather than an artist, and I agree with
him,'' the state-owned news agency EFE reported.
	   His career also included several theatrical works.
	   Brossa, who fought for the Republicans in the 1936-39 Spanish
Civil War with a book by Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca in his
pocket, was awarded several prizes for his contribution to Spanish
culture.
	   He is survived by his wife Pepa Llopis.

Wednesday that he would try everything in his power to get the
peace agreement with the Palestinians back on track.
	   ``My message today is that peace is paramount,'' Weizman said.
	   ``I have limitations ... and people would like to limit me
more,'' he added, referring to the restrictions of his office and
the most recent criticism.
	   Netanyahu froze implementation of the Wye River
land-for-security agreement last month, citing Palestinian
violations of the accord.
	   Barak and Lipkin-Shahak are staunch supporters of the peace
agreements with the Palestinians, and while still in the army, were
involved in the peace talks.

BBC faces the music as cricket fans miss famous victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ They wanted to watch Headley and Gough. Instead,
it was Handel and Grieg.
	   Thanks to a blunder by the BBC, thousands of cricket fans
watched an introduction to classical music for children on Tuesday
instead of the final few exciting overs of England's unexpected
12-run win over Australia.
	   While Dean Headley and Darren Gough bowled out the Australians
for England's victory in Melbourne, viewers who switched on around
breakfast time back in England didn't see a ball bowled.
	   ``We've had hundreds of calls,'' a BBC spokesman said. ``At one
point there were 60 people waiting on the lines to make an official
complaint.''
	   Although the BBC changed the schedules last week, the
alterations didn't make the daily papers.
	   Tuesday's victory lifted the spirits of England's downhearted
cricket followers and was celebrated nationwide, even though the
Australians, 2-1 ahead in the series, have already made sure of the
big prize, keeping the Ashes.
	   England can still tie the series by winning the final test at
Sydney on Saturday.

Yugoslavia seeks to have Kosovo rebels declared terrorists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMS. UPDATES with Kosovo newspaper ban, body found. Changes
byline.
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo was reported quiet Wednesday,
but a top government official in the ethnic Albanian majority
province warned a new offensive was possible anytime authorities
deemed it necessary.
	   Veljko Odalovic, the province's leading official, accused the
Kosovo Liberation Army of taking advantage of an October truce to
take positions abandoned by withdrawing Serbian police and Yugoslav
army.
	   ``We have to defend our state, its integrity and people ... with
or without the international community,'' said Odalovic in an
interview with the Belgrade daily Glas. ``There will be problems,
but we will punish the last terrorist.''
	   Odalovic's comments heightened concerns that the October truce,
mediated by American diplomats, could collapse altogether.
	   Four days of fierce fighting last week in northern Kosovo
claimed at least 15 lives and sent thousands fleeing. Ethnic
Albanian sources reported that the body of an elderly ethnic
Albanian was found Wednesday near Lapastica, 30 kilometers (20
miles) north of Pristina, and that he was presumably killed during
last week's clashes.
	   Serb officials accuse the KLA of triggering the clashes by
attacking police and army units. Yugoslavia, formed of Serbia and
Montenegro, on Tuesday urged the United Nations to declare the KLA
a terrorist organization and crack down on their support network
abroad.
	   The guerillas assert they are only responding to attacks on
them. They received a psychological boost on Wednesday, when an
alliance of radical Kosovo Albanian parties expressed full support
Wednesday for the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   ``The Kosovo Liberation Army is the central national, political
and moral force,'' said Rexhep Qosja, the leader of six parties and
political groups of ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province.
	   The alliance is a rival of the main ethnic Albanian leader,
Ibrahim Rugova, despite their common ultimate goal of an
independent Kosovo. Though most Kosovo Albanians still support
Rugova, the statement was symbolically important to the KLA, which
is at odds with the Rugova camp.
	   Kosovo's Serb-Albanian struggle continued Wednesday despite the
lack of reported violence, with a state-run printing house in
Kosovo serving notice it would stop printing the oldest
Albanian-language daily in the Serbian province.
	   Bujku is one of the three largest dailies in the ethnic-Albanian
majority province.
	   The authoritarian Serbian government, after cracking down
earlier this year on Serbian-language papers in the country, has
moved to suppress Albanian-language papers because of their support
for Kosovo's independence from Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant
republic. Bujku is the first Kosovo Albanian newspaper targeted.
	   Odalovic, the senior Kosovo official, accused the
independence-seeking rebels of trying to frighten the minority
Serbs into leaving Kosovo and create an ethnically pure Albanian
land. Ethnic Albanians make up some 90 percent of the population in
Kosovo, while the Serb population has decreased in the past
decades.
	   ``There can be only one state here, one authority, one police
and one army. There is no space for any paramilitary forces,'' said
Odalovic, referring to the ethnic Albanians' struggle to form their
own state in Kosovo since Serbia revoked their autonomy in 1989.
	   A Serb crackdown against KLA earlier this year claimed over
1,000 lives and left some 300,000 people homeless. Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic ended it in the face of the threat of
NATO airstrikes.
	   NATO has said it is ready to act in fighting in Kosovo flares up
again.
	   Yugoslavia's Serb-led government claims the ethnic Albanian
Kosovo Liberation Army is a terrorist organization which should be
branded as such by world leaders in order to restrict its support
from Albanian expatriate communities in Switzerland, Germany and
elsewhere.
	   Yugoslavia's foreign minister, Zivadin Jovanovic, claimed
Tuesday the rebels have carried out 470 attacks since the October
agreement, including the killing of ethnic Albanians loyal to the
government.

Villa stays ahead in wide open title race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The last Premier League game of 1998 was a
goal-less tie between the two favorites for the title, Chelsea and
Manchester United. That doesn't mean the second half of the
championship race is going to be a bore _ it should be anything
but.
	   If Chelsea's Tore Andre Flo and Gianfranco Zola had capitalized
on their chances, the Blues would have beaten the Reds 4-0 and
replaced Aston Villa at the top in one of the most open title races
in years.
	   The tie at Stamford Bridge means that Villa still leads Chelsea
by two points. Manchester United, two points further behind in
third place, remains well in contention to win its fifth title in
seven seasons.
	   Behind United on goal difference is defending champion Arsenal,
which appears to have recovered from its injury crisis and is well
placed to mount another challenge.
	   Leeds, holding steady at fifth, is another contender although
new manager David O'Leary fears that his young team is a little too
inexperienced to reach the top just yet.
	   Don't rule out Liverpool, which has won three games in a row
under French coach Gerard Houllier. Its last was a spectacular
turnaround from two goals down against Newcastle, winning 4-2 with
two strikes each by Michael Owen and KarlHeinz Riedle.
	   Liverpool, which had gone through its worst winless run for 44
years, is back up to seventh although it still has eight points to
make up on surprise leader Villa.
	   John Gregory's Villa soared to the top Sept. 12 and has proved
difficult to replace.
	   Chelsea, whose only league title triumph was in 1955, has twice
made it to No. 1 in the past two weeks on the back of 19 games
unbeaten but didn't stay there very long. Villa's players reacted
with winning performances to make sure they remained at the top at
the end of 1998 with 20 of the 38 Premier League games now behind
them.
	   Gregory puts some of his team's success down to the fact that he
is fielding an entirely English-born lineup with no problems with
language or adjusting to the cold, wet English climate.
	   Apart from Stan Collymore, who runs into discipinary trouble on
and off the field, Gregory has few big names on his team. But
younsters such as Lee Hendrie, 21, and Gareth Barry, 17, are rated
as future England stars.
	   ``We have won more games than anyone and, if we carry on doing
that, we have as good a chance as anyone,'' Gregory said.
	   ``The Premier League dictates that you have to play 38 matches
at high tempo. Whoever wins the title earns it. You are never given
anything on a plate.''
	   The feeling is that Villa, which last won the title 18 seasons
ago, won't last the pace, and bookmakers Ladbrokes haven't changed
their odds after the recent two rounds of matches.
	   They rate Chelsea and Manchester United the joint 7-4 favorites
to win the title with Arsenal third at 4-1 and Villa at 11-2.
Liverpool, which last won the league title in 1990, is rated a 20-1
shot compared with 33-1 three weeks ago while Leeds, titlist in
1992, is 25-1.
	   While Villa relies almost entirely on home grown talent, Chelsea
can field a cosmopolitan lineup of overseas stars while United,
Arsenal, Leeds and Liverpool each have a balance between the two.
	   Eight players from Chelsea, United and Arsenal were on the
French and Dutch squads that made the World Cup semifinal. Franck
Leboeuf and Marcel Desailly (Chelsea) and Patrick Vieira and
Emmanuel Petit (Arsenal) went on to lift the trophy in Paris as
France beat Brazil in the final.
	   The Premier League is on hold for two weeks while the clubs
enter the FA Cup at the third round stage this weekend.
	   That means the clubs can take their minds off the title race
until Jan. 9 when Villa goes to Middlesbrough, Chelsea visits
Newcastle, Arsenal hosts Liverpool and Leeds goes to Blackburn
Rovers.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey claimed victory Wednesday in Greek
Cypriots' decision to cancel deployment of Russian-made missiles on
Cyprus _ but warned it would use force to prevent their
installation on the Greek island of Crete.
	   Greek Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides announced the
cancellation of the planned deployment late Tuesday. He said he
would negotiate with Russian officials for the deployment of the
S-300 surface-to-air missiles on Crete, instead.
	   ``We would take all appropriate political and military means if
they were to be deployed in Crete,'' Turkish Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem told reporters Wednesday.
	   ``If there is a threat directed toward Turkey, then we will do
the necessary analysis and respond accordingly.''
	   The Mediterranean island of Cyprus is divided between two
hostile republics _ one Greek Cypriot, one Turkish Cypriot.
	   Turkey had threatened to use military strikes to block the
missiles' deployment on Cyprus ever since plans were announced two
years ago.
	   The United States and NATO also criticized the decision as
potentially leading to conflict between NATO members Turkey and
Greece.
	   There was no firm decision on what would happen to the missiles.
Some reports suggested the missiles would now be stored.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Vladimir Rakhmanin indicated Wednesday
that Moscow still expected to be paid for the missiles.
	   ``The Russian-Cypriot contact has an exclusively commercial
character. The Russian side will strictly fulfill this contract,''
Rakhmanin said in a statement. ``It is important that the
recipients of the complexes fulfill their primary obligations.''
	   ``Any possibility of changing the parameters of the contract is
a question for the orderer, the government of the Republic of
Cyprus, and the supplier, the state arms exporter
Rosvooruzheniye,'' he said.

Guinea takes businessman's dispute with Congo to UN court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Guinea has asked the World Court
to condemn the Democratic Republic of Congo for grave breaches of
international law for expelling a Guinean national from Congo, then
Zaire, in 1996 and stripping him off his assets.
	   The case concerns a businessman called Ahmadou Sadio Diallo who
had lived and worked in Congo for 32 years before being jailed for
two and a half months and deported from the country in February
1996, according to brief details of Guinea's unilateral application
released by the court on Wednesday.
	   Diallo also was ``divested from his important investments,
companies, bank accounts, movable and immovable properties,''
Guinea claims. Among companies owing him an undisclosed amount of
money are the Congolese branches of oil giants Mobil, Shell and
Fina, according to the claim which was filed Dec. 28.
	   No further details were immediately available.
	   Formally known as the International Court of Justice, the
Hague-based World Court is the United Nations' highest judicial
organ, dealing with disputes between nations. It relies on nations
to voluntarily comply with its rulings.
	   Congo did not immediately file a response to Guinea's
application to the court and no schedule has yet been set for the
proceedings.

Egypt, Israel and Palestinians to establish hi-tech park

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel, Eygpt and the Palestinian Authority
plan to establish a hi-tech industrial park on the edge of the Gaza
Strip, an Israeli government official said Wednesday.
	   In the beginning, organizers plan to build a hi-tech college to
be attended by Egyptian, Palestinian and Israeli students.
	   There are hopes the project will later entice large
international companies to set up shop on the grounds and provide
jobs for the students, said Shlomo Dror, a spokesman for the Israel
government's Palestinian affairs adviser.
	   The school is to open in about two years on the southern tip of
Gaza, on a patch of land shared by Israel, Egypt and the
Palestinians.
	   The project will be funded largely by private investment, and is
aimed at creating job opportunities, especially in the Palestinian
areas where unemployment runs as high as 30 percent.
	   Representatives from Egypt, Israel and the Palestinian Authority
met for the first time Tuesday to discuss the project that was
initiated by Israeli industrialist Steff Wertheimer.
	   Gaza already has one industrial park at the Karni crossing
between Israel and the coastal strip. However, Karni focuses on
manufacturing and offers mainly blue-collar jobs to Palestinians.

Missionaries: Ugandan rebels raid town, killing 3, kidnapping

<TEXT>
	   ROME, Italy (AP) _ Ugandan rebels raided a town in the north of
that country, killing three people, kidnapping up to 40 and
stealing supplies, the Italian missionary news service said
Wednesday.
	   The news service, Misna, cited missionary sources in the central
African country.
	   The Lord's Resistance Army carried out the attack on the town of
Morulem on Tuesday night, Misna said.
	   It sacked missionaries' buildings and the clinic of a
missionary-run lepers' hospital, the news service said.
	   Women and children were among the residents abducted, the news
service said.
	   While the adults may have been taken simply to carry the loot,
missionaries feared the young people had been taken to serve as
slaves, it said.
	   The Lord's Resistance Army is waging a 12-year-old insurgency in
northwestern Uganda. Its fighters frequently abduct children and
teen-agers to carry their goods, fight their skirmishes, and
provide them with sex.

Olympic debut proposed for mermaid mimics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The obscure sport of fin swimming _ in
which racers don a mermaid-like tail _ is being proposed to become
part of the Olympics, the organizers for the 2004 Summer Games said
Wednesday.
	   The final decision on including any new sports rests with the
International Olympic Committee.
	   Fin swimmers stick both feet in a single rubber-and-fiberglass
``mono fin'' up to 80 centimeters (32 inches) wide. They clasp
their hands together in front and propel through the water with
undulating whale-like thrusts of the fin.
	   World-class fin swimmers can move about 30 percent faster than
their conventional counterparts. Some fin swimmers use a snorkel,
but it was not clear if it would be used in possible Olympic
competition.
	   The sport is growing in nations such as Russia, China and
Australia, organizers said.
	   Athens already has proposed water skiing for 2004. A spokeswoman
for the organizing committee, Julie Velisaratou, said billiards and
karate also may be suggested.
	   Other sports waiting for the Olympic limelight include surfing,
ballroom dancing, acrobatics, roller skating and basque pelota, a
fast squash-like game in which contestants hurl the ball with large
curled scoops.
	   At the 2000 games in Sydney, Australia, taekwondo and the
grueling swim-cycling-running triathlon will be elevated to Olympic
status for the first time. In Atlanta in 1996, softball and beach
volleyball made their Olympic debut.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A gang of armed men killed three police officers
in Uzbekistan and then tried to flee into neighboring Turkmenistan,
killing three border officers who tried to stop them, a news agency
reported Wednesday.
	   One suspect was later arrested in Uzbekistan, and two other
suspects were identified but not captured, Interfax said, quoting
the Turkmen National Security Committee.
	   The presidents of the two Central Asian countries ordered the
creation of a joint police task force to investigate the crimes.
	   According to authorities, the first shooting occurred Tuesday
when Uzbek police stopped a group of armed men in the Khorezm
region of Uzbekistan, which lies on the Turkmen border.
	   After killing the three officers, the gunmen tried to enter
Turkmenistan at the Gazodzhak checkpoint. In the resulting clash,
two Turkmen border guards and one customs officer died, authorities
said.
	   It was not clear when the second shootout took place, or why the
men had been stopped by police in the first place.

	   German officials had expressed concern about the hostages,
especially a woman who reportedly was ill.
	   A Yemeni newspaper has identified them as Norbert Degen, Petra
Penglista, Rozwita Adlung and Inge Brunner. The embassy has not
confirmed the names.
	   The tribal leader said the health of 64-year-old Brunner, who
suffers from high blood pressure, was of concern.
	   But he said the hostages received medicine for Brunner along
with Christmas gifts of chocolates and cigarettes from the embassy.
	   Kidnappings occur frequently in Yemen, large parts of which are
controlled by armed tribesmen who do not hesitate to take the law
into their own hands to get their demands fulfilled. The hostages
are usually treated well and released unhurt.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian Interior Ministry logged more than
40,000 complaints of police brutality in 1998, and more than 5,000
led to disciplinary action against police, the government said
Wednesday.
	   Sergei Shadrin, deputy chief of the ministry's Internal Security
Department, said 2,800 cases of brutality were sent to prosecutors
and criminal proceedings were instituted in 1,347 cases, ITAR-Tass
reported.
	   The report did not say how many led to convictions.
	   Another top official, Vladimir Fyodorov of the road police, said
corruption remained a serious problem among police who patrol
Russia's roads. Most Russian motorists would agree.
	   He said there were more than 7,300 anti-corruption operations
launched against road police in 1998, leading to disciplinary
action against 2,944 officers and criminal procedings against 53.
	   Also, he said, 66 were punished for bribery and five for
extortion. ``We realize this is only the tip of the iceberg,''
Fyodorov said, according to ITAR-Tass.

Cypriots with Turkey through a special relationship,'' the Turkish
Cypriot news agency TAK quoted Denktash as saying. ``It appears
that the new government will remain loyal to these principles.''
	   Cyprus has been split in two since 1974, when Turkey sent in
troops after a coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
	   The Turkish Cypriots declared their own state in 1983, which is
recognized only by Turkey.
	   U.N. efforts to reunify the island have failed and the Turkish
Cypriots now insist on international recognition before talks can
resume.
	   Eroglu's center-right National Unity Party won 24 seats in the
Dec 6. elections. Akinci's Salvation party has seven seats in the
50-member Parliament. Akinci is to serve as deputy premier in the
11-member Cabinet.
	   Eroglu received 40 percent of the votes in the elections, seen
as voter approval for his hard-line stance on the future of his
republic.

Nine killed, hundreds forced to flee in clashes between rebels and

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Fighting this week between leftist
guerrillas and rival paramilitary groups in northern Colombia left
at least nine people dead and prompted hundreds to flee their
homes, authorities said Wednesday.
	   Officials found a trail of burned and dismembered bodies in El
Diamante, a village in Cordoba state 285 miles (460 kilometers)
northwest of Bogota. Leftist rebels battled militia members there
for two days beginning Monday.
	   Health officials in the nearby town of Tierralta said the dead
included a three-week-old baby hit in the head with a stray bullet,
a seven year-old girl stabbed in the stomach with a machete, and an
elderly woman. They also recovered the bodies of five men, many
with burns or mutilated limbs, and a dismembered head believed to
be that of a sixth man.
	   ``One would rather not believe that men are capable of this. It
was pure barbarity,'' Dr. Viviano Guerrero of the Tierralta Health
Department told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
	   Guerrero said rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, burned down houses and a health clinic. It was
unclear whether the dead were victims of the rebels or the
militias, he said.
	   Two soldiers were killed trying to prevent the FARC attack on
Tierralta, the army said Wednesday.
	   Rebels and the landowner-backed militias have battled for years
in the disputed region of Cordoba, a locus of rich farmland and a
key corridor for illegal arms trafficking from Central America and
the Caribbean.
	   In parallel fighting Monday and Tuesday in Cordoba, FARC rebels
reportedly attacked and overran a major paramilitary stronghold
known as Nudo del Paramillo. The militia base was a rearguard
retreat of top paramilitary leader Carlos Castano, whose death was
widely rumored in the local media Tuesday.
	   Castano's 4,000-member organization has denied the report, and
top FARC and army leaders said they had no information to believe
the 34-year-old paramilitary leader was dead.

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Four Germans taken captive by Yemeni
tribesmen on Dec. 7 were set free on Wednesday, Yemeni security
officials said.
	   They said the four _ three women and a man _ were in good
condition and were on their way to the Yemeni capital San`a. The
officials spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   There was no information on whether the government had agreed to
the kidnappers' demands for better public services.
	   The release of the Germans came a day after Yemeni security
forces confronted Islamic militants holding 16 Western hostages.
Four of the captives died in the melee.
	   Bani Dhabyan gunmen abducted the Germans on Dec. 7 in Marib
province, which is 170 kilometers (105 miles) southeast of San`a.
	   The Bani Dhabyan were pressing the government to provide more
schools, hospitals, telephone lines and roads for their region.
	   German officials had expressed concern about the hostages,
especially a woman who reportedly was ill.
	   A Yemeni newspaper has identified them as Norbert Degen, Petra
Penglista, Rozwita Adlung and Inge Brunner. The embassy has not
confirmed the names.
	   The tribal leader said the health of 64-year-old Brunner, who
suffers from high blood pressure, was of concern.
	   But he said the hostages received medicine for Brunner along
with Christmas gifts of chocolates and cigarettes from the embassy.
	   Kidnappings occur frequently in Yemen, large parts of which are
controlled by armed tribesmen who do not hesitate to take the law
into their own hands to get their demands fulfilled. The hostages
are usually treated well and released unhurt.

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Four Germans kidnapped by Yemeni tribesmen
were set free on Wednesday, three and a half weeks after they were
taken into captivity, Yemeni security officials said.
	   They said the four _ three women and a man _ were in good
condition and were on their way to the Yemeni capital San`a. The
officials spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   There was no information on whether the government had agreed to
the kidnappers' demands for better public services.
	   The release of the Germans came a day after Yemeni security
forces confronted Islamic militant tribesmen holding 16 Western
hostages. Four of the captives _ three Britons and an Australian _
died in the melee.
	   After the killings, German diplomats appealed to Yemeni
authorities not to attempt to rescue the four Germans who were held
by a different tribe in a different part of the country, Yemeni
officials said Wednesday.
	   Three Bani Dhabyan gunmen abducted the Germans on Dec. 7 in
Marib province, which is 170 kilometers (105 miles) southeast of
San`a. The Germans were believed to be en route to San`a after a
trip through central Yemen when they were taken.
	   The Bani Dhabyan pressed the government to provide more schools,
hospitals, telephone lines and roads for their region.
	   German officials had expressed concern about the hostages,
especially a woman who reportedly was ill.
	   A Yemeni newspaper identified them as Norbert Degen, Petra
Penglista, Rozwita Adlung and Inge Brunner. The embassy has not
confirmed the names.
	   They apparently were treated with care. They were allowed to
walk for about 45 minutes a day, but only accompanied by armed men.
And the tribesmen provided them at least once with a mobile phone
so they could call the German Embassy in San`a.
	   Tribal leaders said that the hostages received medicine for
Brunner, who is 64 and apparently suffers from high blood pressure,
along with Christmas gifts of chocolates and cigarettes from the
embassy.
	   Kidnappings occur frequently in Yemen, large parts of which are
controlled by armed tribesmen who do not hesitate to take the law
into their own hands to get their demands fulfilled. The hostages
are usually treated well and released unhurt.
	   In April, members of the same tribe freed British hostages after
the government promised to build more roads in the area and return
a four-wheel drive vehicle that was seized in March.

Miners suspend underground sit-in until the end March
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Miners from the Solidarity union on
Wednesday further suspended their protest and gave the union-rooted
government until the end of March to produce a bill guaranteeing
them early retirement privileges.
	   The protest that involved several hundred miners taking part in
underground sit-ins at some 50 mines in southern Poland was
originally suspended Dec. 23, after the government promised miners
would retain early retirement schemes.
	   Union leaders said the protest will continue under the form of
meetings and rallies. The sit-in could be resumed ``as soon as the
government tries to go back on its promises,'' said Henryk
Nakonieczny, head of miner's Solidarity.
	   Under an agreement reached last week, the government proposed
miners would receive so-called ``bridge'' pensions of 70 percent of
their monthly wages if they retire with 25 years of service before
the legal age. They would receive the regular full pension when
they reach the legal retirement age.
	   Miners want the provision guaranteed in a bill later next year
that will spell out details of retirement rules for miners and
workers employed in dangerous conditions.
	   On Tuesday, President Aleksander Kwasniewski signed into law the
new pension system, in line with Western standards, that sets
retirement age at 65 for men and 60 for women, but Nakonieczny said
it did not affect the miners, who trust the agreement with the
government.

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Four Germans kidnapped by Yemeni tribesmen
were set free on Wednesday, three and a half weeks after they were
taken into captivity, Yemeni security officials said.
	   They said the four _ three women and a man _ were in good
condition and were on their way to the Yemeni capital San`a. The
officials spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   There was no information on whether the government had agreed to
the kidnappers' demands for better public services.
	   The release of the Germans came a day after Yemeni security
forces confronted Islamic militant tribesmen holding other 16
Western hostages. Four of the captives _ three Britons and an
Australian _ died in the melee.
	   After the killings, German diplomats appealed to Yemeni
authorities not to attempt to rescue the four Germans who were held
by a different tribe in a different part of the country, Yemeni
officials said Wednesday.
	   Three Bani Dhabyan gunmen abducted the Germans on Dec. 7 in
Marib province, which is 170 kilometers (105 miles) southeast of
San`a. The Germans were believed to be en route to San`a after a
trip through central Yemen when they were taken.
	   The Bani Dhabyan pressed the government to provide more schools,
hospitals, telephone lines and roads for their region.
	   German officials had expressed concern about the hostages,
especially a woman who reportedly was ill.
	   A Yemeni newspaper identified them as Norbert Degen, Petra
Penglista, Rozwita Adlung and Inge Brunner. The embassy has not
confirmed the names.
	   They apparently were treated with care. They were allowed to
walk for about 45 minutes a day, but only accompanied by armed men.
And the tribesmen provided them at least once with a mobile phone
so they could call the German Embassy in San`a.
	   Tribal leaders said that the hostages received medicine for
Brunner, who is 64 and apparently suffers from high blood pressure,
along with Christmas gifts of chocolates and cigarettes from the
embassy.
	   Kidnappings occur frequently in Yemen, large parts of which are
controlled by armed tribesmen who do not hesitate to take the law
into their own hands to get their demands fulfilled. The hostages
are usually treated well and released unhurt.
	   In April, members of the same tribe freed British hostages after
the government promised to build more roads in the area and return
a four-wheel drive vehicle that was seized in March.

Missiles fired over southern 'no-fly' zone in Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: SUBS grafs 4-5 pvs, bgng, `President Clinton ...' with 4 grafs
to UPDATE with Clinton briefed, Yeltsin phone call; edits to
tighten, conform &QL; 
 &UR; By DEB RIECHMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. warplanes fired missiles and laser-guided
bombs on a defense site in southern Iraq early Wednesday after it
launched six to eight missiles at a British aircraft, government
officials said.
	   The U.S. and British planes returned to their bases safely,
Pentagon officials said, in what was the second American-Iraqi
missile exchange in a no-fly zone since Monday.
	   At the White House, a senior administration official said that
Iraq fired the surface-to-air missiles at the British aircraft.
U.S. aircraft responded by firing two missiles and several
laser-guided munitions at the Iraqi air defense station.
	   President Bill Clinton was briefed by his National Security
Council advisers before flying to a South Carolina resort to begin
a holiday vacation. His deputy national security team also was
meeting to discuss the incidents over Iraq, the White House said.
	   Before leaving, the president discussed Iraq with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin during a previously scheduled telephone
call and agreed not to allow their differences to disrupt
U.S.-Russian relations, said David Leavy, a White House spokesman.
	   The Russian government strongly criticized the U.S. and British
bombing of Iraq in mid-December, insisting there was no
justification for using force. Leavy said Yeltsin did not
specifically mention the no-fly clashes.
	   ``Our allied aircraft will continue to enforce the no-fly zones
vigorously,'' said Leavy. ``As the president has said, they are a
key element of our containment policy.''
	   Leavy said Wednesday's incident ``underscores the continued
threat that Saddam (Hussein) poses to the region. We will take the
necessary precautions to carry out our mission and to protect our
air crews.''
	   At the Pentagon, spokesman Col. Richard Bridges said 20 U.S.
fighter jets and electronic warfare planes and four British bombers
were patrolling the Iraqi skies when the incident occured, a normal
presence for a no-fly mission.
	   Asked if any Iraqi missiles came close to any Western aircraft,
Bridges said, ``I have no indication they were anywhere near
successful.'' He said the Iraqis often don't turn on targeting
radar until the last second _ making it almost impossible to score
a hit _ because the anti-aircraft site doesn't want to draw a
radar-seeking missile reponse.
	   ``I'm sure Saddam is hoping he's going to get lucky at some
point,'' Bridges said. ``We have robust rules of engagement that
allow us to defend ourselves adequately.''
	   For now, it appears that Iraq is simply taunting U.S. and
British warplanes in the no-fly zone by throwing up missiles as
part of a campaign to challenge the tight U.N. and American
controls on the country, according to foreign policy experts.
	   Although Iraq, which doesn't accept the legitimacy of the no-fly
zones, has claimed it is now operating aircraft in the off-limits
regions, Bridges said there have been no reported sightings of
Iraqi planes in the region in the past few days.
	   A British bomber first reported Iraqi missile launching at about
9:30 a.m. local time near Talil, Iraq.
	   ``They visually detected firing. They took evasive action to
avoid the missiles,'' said Maj. Joe LaMarca, a spokesman for the
U.S. Central Command, responsible for American forces in the
Persian Gulf, at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida. ``I
don't know for sure what they (the Iraqis) were firing at, but
common sense would tell you that they were firing at the (British)
aircraft.''
	   Two U.S. F-16 bombers patrolling the area responded and fired
two anti-radar missiles and a number of precision-guided bombs onto
the site at 10:15 a.m., a Pentagon spokesman said.
	   The aircraft safely departed the area about a half hour later.
	   A spokesman for the British Defense Ministry said: ``The firm
response to the latest Iraqi provocation is ample evidence of our
commitment'' to patrol the no-fly zone.
	   No activity was reported in the northern no-fly zone.
	   On Monday, U.S. warplanes exchanged missile fire with Iraqi air
defenses when the planes were fired upon by Iraqi surface-to-air
missiles. In Baghdad, the Iraqi military said Monday's U.S. attack
killed four Iraqi soldiers and injured seven others.

Pak turns into a tiger on American LPGA Tour

 &UR; EDS: Specifies that voting was among American sports

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ They have the same dynamic smile, the same knack
for winning a major championship in unforgettable fashion. They
both were trained in unorthodox manners by fathers obsessed with
them becoming a champion.
	   Se Ri Pak and Tiger Woods now share something else in common.
	   Pak, the South Korean rookie who won two majors and took women's
golf to its highest level of popularity in the United States in 20
years, on Tuesday was announced as The Associated Press Female
Athlete of the Year in a poll of American sports writers and
broadcasters in a close vote over Tennessee basketball star
Chamique Holdsclaw.
	   The award comes one year after Woods became the first golfer in
26 years to win the Male Athlete of the Year.
	   ``Nineteen-ninety-eight is very special for me,'' Pak said. ``I
cannot forget this season.''
	   Pak received 19 first-place votes and 156 points in voting by AP
U.S. member newspaper and broadcast outlets. Holdsclaw, the top
player on what many regard as the best American women's college
basketball team ever, got 142 points.
	   Tara Lipinski, who won the Olympic gold medal in figure skating,
was third with 105 points. Sprinter and long jumper Marion Jones,
undefeated in every event this year, was fourth with 101 points,
followed by U.S. Open tennis champion Lindsay Davenport.
	   Holdsclaw (27), Lipinksi (21) and Jones (24) all had more
first-place votes than Pak, but Pak was named on 85 of the 147
ballots, far more than anyone else.
	   Pak became the first golfer since Beth Daniel in 1990 to win
Female Athlete of the Year, and the first rookie golfer since Nancy
Lopez in 1978.
	   Not since Lopez won five straight tournaments and nine events in
her rookie season has women's golf exploded onto the front pages of
American newspapers.
	   ``What we could not have anticipated was the emergence of Se Ri
Pak,'' said U.S. LPGA commissioner Jim Ritts. ``It was one of those
stories that captured interest and imagination. It really elevated
our visibility.''
	   Pak didn't pick up a club until she was 14, but was trained like
few others.
	   While Earl Woods used to jingle coins in his pocket to teach his
son focus, Jun-Chul Pak adopted more bizarre methods. He made Pak
walk the stairs in their apartment forward and backward to build
strength in her legs.
	   He made her spend the night in a cemetery to help her conquer
fear. And he took her to dog fights to make her mentally tough.
	   ``People say I look focused,'' Pak said. ``Sometimes I don't
have nice face. Sometimes poker face.''

Russia faces default on Soviet-era debt payment
</HEADLINE>

crisis; ADDS 1 graf to UPDATE with government revenue figures.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With Russia effectively in default on a major
foreign debt, Western creditors were trying to decide Wednesday how
to deal with a country that's struggling to pay its bills.
	   Russia failed Tuesday to make a dlrs 363 million cash payment on
dlrs 26 billion worth of loans that Moscow must repay to the London
Club of commercial creditors.
	   Russian officials said that the country was technically not in
default because more than 70 percent of the debt holders had agreed
to accept new bonds instead of cash.
	   Russia's Vneshekonombank, the state-owned bank responsible for
repaying the debt, claimed it only needed the support of two-thirds
of creditors to make the payment in bonds.
	   But London Club members have indicated that 95 percent of debt
holders will need to approve the plan. Bank of America, the payment
agent for the London Club, was expected to make a statement on the
issue Wednesday.
	   If creditors want to formally declare Russia in default on the
debts, it would require a majority vote of the London Club members.
	   But such a move could only further complicate efforts to sort
out Russia's mounting debt problems, analysts said.
	   Russia now faces about dlrs 150 billion in foreign debts that it
must repay in coming years.
	   When the country's economic crisis hit in August, the government
also effectively defaulted on dlrs 40 billion worth of domestic
treasury bonds. The crisis was brought on by a complex web of
factors that included the decline in world oil prices and the Asian
economic collapse.
	   Russia is seeking to work out restructuring agreements with its
creditors, but the process has been moving slowly, while the
economy continues to crumble.
	   Most of Russia's foreign debt was inherited from the Soviet
Union, and those are considered the riskiest debts. Moscow has
tried to stay current on debt that was run up in the post-Soviet
period, and the country has continued paying interest on Eurobonds
issued after the Soviet breakup.
	   But if Russia misses too many loan repayments, then it's
unlikely to get new loans needed to help it through the current
crisis, which hit this past summer.
	   Without foreign aid, the government is likely to print a huge
amount of new cash, leading to the kind of high inflation that has
plagued Russia in the early 1990s.
	   Since the crisis hit in August, the Russian ruble has fallen
from 6 to U.S. dollar to 21. Inflation, which appeared under
control until the crisis hit, is expected to top 70 percent for the
year.
	   In one positive development, the government said Wednesday that
its revenues for November were up 24 percent from the previous
month and 13 percent from November 1997. The government has said
one of its main priorities is improving tax revenues.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with army report of five killed; Red Cross saying no

concerned about food shortages &QL; 
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Rebel forces Wednesday launched an
hour-long artillery bombardment against Huambo, the country's
second-largest city and a base for United Nations and aid agency
staff, according to reports.
	   Five civilians were killed and three were injured, the army
said.
	   Some shells landed in downtown areas of the central highland
city which lies about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of the
capital, Luanda, state radio RNA reported from Huambo.
	   The explosions reportedly began at noon and caused panic among
local people in the government-held city which the army is using as
a base to fly in reinforcements for fighting in surrounding areas.
	   Before the civil war restarted Dec. 4 Huambo had a population of
about 300,000, but tens of thousands of refugees fleeing fighting
in the countryside have converged on the city in recent weeks.
	   The United Nations and International Red Cross headquarters in
Luanda both said they had received no reports of injuries to their
staff in Huambo.
	   However, IRC spokeswoman Francoise Zambelini said a scheduled
aid flight to the city was canceled because the warring factions
did not provide guarantees of safe passage.
	   A cargo plane chartered by the United Nations crashed near
Huambo on Saturday with 14 people on board. The cause of the crash,
as the plane passed over the war zone, was not known.
	   Artillery shells also were landing sporadically in Kuito, 130
kilometers (80 miles) to the east of Huambo, which has been under a
rebel siege for more than two weeks, according to the city's Roman
Catholic Bishop.
	   Most of the shells were landing near the airport outside the
city and only a few people were injured, Bishop Jose Nambi said in
a telephone interview.
	   He said the food shortage in the town was ``very worrying.''
	   The United Nations observer mission, which is monitoring a 1994
peace accord that halted a two-decade civil war between the rebels
and the government, has been unable to stop the renewed fighting
which so far been concentrated in the central highlands.
	   The U.N. Security Council has blamed UNITA, a Portuguese acronym
for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, for
the return to war.
	   UNITA refused to yield control of areas under its control and
maintained a hidden army, according to the United Nations.
	   The country has been ravaged by conflict since gaining
independence from Portugal in 1975.

Mark McGwire: AP Male Athlete of the Year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Clarifies that voting was by America media outlets; TRIMS. &QL; 
 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mark McGwire's home runs did more than win games
for the St. Louis Cardinals. Those 70 big swings won back fans for
all of American baseball.
	   For setting a record that may outlast him, and for helping save
U.S. Major League Baseball, Big Mac was picked Monday as The
Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year in a voting by American
newspaper and broadcast outlets.
	   ``It's America's pastime. And if took one person to help get it
back on the map, and people say it's me, that's great,'' McGwire
said.
	   In a season considered by many to be the greatest ever, the
1.96-meter (6-foot-5) redhead stood tallest of them all. From his
grand slam on opening day to No. 70 on his final swing, McGwire
captivated the nation.
	   McGwire easily won the Male Athlete of the Year award with 332
points. Sosa was second with 177 in the annual voting by the AP's
U.S. member newspapers and broadcast outlets. Ten points are
allotted for every first-place vote, nine for second and so on.
	   Running back Terrell Davis of the Super Bowl champion Denver
Broncos was third with 63 points, Michael Jordan of the NBA
champion Chicago Bulls was next with 54, followed by Broncos
quarterback John Elway (50) and stock car racing driver Jeff Gordon
(42).
	   This marked the second straight time the AP's top male athlete
was the subject of the AP's Story of the Year. In 1997, Tiger Woods
won the individual award while his victory in the U.S. Masters
earned Story of the Year honors.
	   From the day he homered in the Cardinals' spring training opener
to the night he scooped up a foul ball as a guest in a front-row
box at the final game of the World Series, McGwire was the focus of
American Major League Baseball.
	   ``Americans love power,'' McGwire said. ``Big cars. Big trucks.
Big people. Baseball fans have always been drawn to the home run
and the guy throwing close to 100 mph (160 kph).''
	   McGwire finished with 147 RBIs and an NL-record 162 walks. He
led the majors in slugging percentage (.752) and on-base percentage
(.470) and batted .299.
	   Sosa, however, won the NL MVP award when the Cubs won the
wild-card spot while the Cardinals did not make the playoffs.

Eight members of Islamic group found dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Eight members of the Islamic Salvation
Army, which has laid down its arms, were found dead Wednesday,
victims of an attack by active Islamic militants, local residents
said.
	   The eight men were shot and their throats were slit in the
attack in Ouled Azza, near Ain Defla, 120 kilometers (75 miles)
southwest of Algiers. It wasn't immediately clear when the attack
took place.
	   The residents, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
victims were killed by the Armed Islamic Group, the most radical
rebel group in Algeria's seven-year insurgency.
	   The victims used to belong to the Armed Islamic Group, but
defected to the Islamic Salvation Army, prompting what appeared to
be a settling of scores, the residents said.
	   An estimated 75,000 people have been killed since the start of
Algeria's insurgency, triggered by an army decision to cancel
elections the Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win.
	   The Islamic Salvation Army is the military wing of the Islamic
Salvation Front, which reached a truce with the government in
October last year.

BAGHDAD: the Gulf.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Iraq has remained defiant. The Baghdad government announced
Tuesday that its aircraft were flying in the no-fly zones. And it
said anti-aircraft batteries remained ready to fire on allied
planes that enter Iraqi airspace.
	   However, Pentagon spokesman Col. Richard Bridges said Wednesday
there have been no reported sightings of Iraqi planes in the air in
the past few days.
	   Iraq's stance appeared aimed at building Arab support for its
plight following mid-December airstrikes by American and British
jets to punish the Baghdad regime for failing to cooperate with
U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   On Tuesday, Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan was asked by
Associated Press Television News whether Iraq was flying aircraft
in no-fly zones. He answered: ``We are doing it right now.''
	   ``Iraqi planes in effect are flying in a normal manner in Iraqi
airspace,'' he said.
	   Ramadan did not specify whether the aircraft were military or
civilian, but almost all of Iraq's passenger aircraft are either
out of the country or unusable. All aircraft in Iraq are owned by
the government.
	   France initially participated in patrolling the zones.
	   But Paris withdrew from northern zone patrols in 1996, and
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret confirmed Tuesday
that French planes stopped participating in patrols over southern
Iraq on Dec. 16, the first day of airstrikes.
	   Iraq has never recognized the zones, and Ramadan repeated the
government's view Tuesday.
	   ``The so-called air exclusion zones exist only in the sick
imagination of the British and American administrations,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A mob of 200 villagers, some armed
with machetes, tortured and killed seven Indonesian soldiers after
stopping a public bus. On Wednesday, rioters in the same area
attacked a police station and burned two police cars.
	   The violence in northwestern Aceh province was likely to raise
tensions in a region where the Indonesian military recently ended a
decade-long campaign against separatist rebels.
	   Officials suspect guerrilla followers were behind the slayings
of the soldiers on Tuesday.
	   More than 300 personnel of the police's special force of Brimob
have been mobilized to hunt the suspected guerillas who fled after
the attack, said Col. Djuharnus Wiradinata, chief of Aceh Police.
	   The official Antara news agency quoted Wiradinata as telling a
news conference in Aceh's capital of Banda Aceh on Wednesday that
one of the eight soldiers was found alive with wounds, while five
bodies of the seven were believed to have been dumped into a river.
	   Accused of widespread atrocities in Aceh, the military
apologized and withdrew some troops in a conciliatory gesture after
the resignation in May of former President Suharto. However,
resentment toward the military remains deep.
	   In Jakarta, armed forces chief Gen. Wiranto said the attack on
off-duty soldiers could jeopardize a plan to reduce the military
presence by entrusting community leaders with security.
	   ``The killing was a brutal action which can never be tolerated
by the armed forces,'' Wiranto said. ``This action could spoil the
wishes of the Aceh people to free the region of military
operations.''
	   The assailants forced the victims to get off a bus in the
village of Lhok Nibung that was heading to the nearby city of
Medan. Ten other soldiers managed to escape and reported to their
superiors, who dispatched hundreds of troops to search for the
killers.
	   Wiranto said eight soldiers were killed and that 25 people
suspected of provoking the mob attack were arrested.
	   In a separate incident in the nearby town of Lhokseumawe, a mob
of 500 people hurled stones at a police station after a dispute
between a policeman and a security guard at a neighboring building.
There were no reported injuries or arrests.
	   The mob also burned down three cars and four motorcycles during
the predawn assault, Wiradinata said.
	   According to Antara, the mob also tried to attack a nearby
military post but dispersed as soldiers at the post fired warning
shots.
	   Lhokseumawe, a center of Indonesia's oil and gas industry, was
hit by anti-military rioting in August and November.
	   Aceh, about 1,750 kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of Jakarta,
is a staunchly Muslim province where rebels have been fighting for
an Islamic state for decades.
	   The military has acknowledged that 760 people died in fighting
since the late 1980s, although human rights groups put the death
toll higher. Mass graves have been uncovered and some widows have
alleged they were raped by soldiers.
	   Separatist guerrilla movements also operate in the remote
province of Irian Jaya and the former Portuguese colony of East
Timor.

Yeltsin castigates Clinton for strikes on Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Boris Yeltsin listened to Bill Clinton's
arguments for military action against Iraq, but reiterated his
strong objections to U.S. and British raids in a telephone
conversation Wednesday.
	   ``The Russian president confirmed his firm assessment that the
Anglo-American action is unacceptable from the point of view of
international law, the United Nations Charter and the principles of
partnership and cooperation,'' Yeltsin's office said in a statement
released to the news media.
	   Yeltsin struck the same chord in his traditional New Year's
message to Clinton, saying that ``attempts to solve international
crises by force, especially circumventing the competent
international organizations, are unacceptable.''
	   Moscow condemned U.S. and British raids against Iraq earlier
this month in angry rhetoric eerily reminiscent of the Cold War era
and briefly recalled its ambassadors to Washington and London.
Russian officials have since softened their tone, stressing they
want to have good relations with the United States and Britain.
	   During their conversation Wednesday, the first since they met in
Moscow in September, Yeltsin and Clinton sought to mend ties
damaged by differences over Iraq. Both presidents spoke for ``the
preservation and development of the positive potential accumulated
in the Russian-American relations over the past years,'' the
Kremlin statement said.
	   They exchanged New Year greetings and noted the next year's
``importance for the preservation of atmosphere of trust and
further progress in relations between Russia and the United
States.''
	   In Washington, White House spokesman David Leavy said Clinton
and Yeltsin expressed their differences over Iraq but agreed not to
allow that to disrupt U.S.-Russian relations.
	   Leavy said Yeltsin did not specifically mention the incidents
Monday and today in which Iraqi air defense units have fired
missiles at U.S. and British aircraft patrolling ``no-fly'' zones
in northern and southern Iraq.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry expressed concern Wednesday about
missile exchanges and urged both sides to show restraint, stopping
short of outright condemnation of the U.S. and British action.
	   In the talk with Clinton, Yeltsin called for ``restoring the
unity of the U.N. Security Council and coming back on a peaceful
way of Iraqi settlement,'' the Kremlin said.
	   Moscow, which is owed billions of dollars by Iraq in Soviet-era
debts, has pushed for the early lifting of the U.N. sanctions
against Iraq while urging its long-time ally to comply with the
U.N. resolutions.
	   Leavy said that Yeltsin said he continues to support
ratification of the START II arms reduction treaty with the United
States, indefinitely put on hold by the Communist-dominated Russian
parliament after the strikes on Iraq. The Kremlin statement didn't
mention the issue.
	   The two leaders also discussed plans for Vice President Al Gore
to meet with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov in March and Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright to meet with Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov in Moscow in late January.

Mark McGwire: AP Male Athlete of the Year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS point system in fifth graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mark McGwire's home runs did more than win games
for the St. Louis Cardinals. Those 70 big swings won back fans for
all of American baseball.
	   For setting a record that may outlast him, and for helping save
U.S. Major League Baseball, Big Mac was picked Monday as The
Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year in a voting by American
newspaper and broadcast outlets.
	   ``It's America's pastime. And if took one person to help get it
back on the map, and people say it's me, that's great,'' McGwire
said.
	   In a season considered by many to be the greatest ever, the
1.96-meter (6-foot-5) redhead stood tallest of them all. From his
grand slam on opening day to No. 70 on his final swing, McGwire
captivated the nation.
	   McGwire easily won the Male Athlete of the Year award with 332
points. Sosa was second with 177 in the annual voting by the AP's
U.S. member newspapers and broadcast outlets. Three points are
allotted for every first-place vote, two for second and one for
third.
	   Running back Terrell Davis of the Super Bowl champion Denver
Broncos was third with 63 points, Michael Jordan of the NBA
champion Chicago Bulls was next with 54, followed by Broncos
quarterback John Elway (50) and stock car racing driver Jeff Gordon
(42).
	   This marked the second straight time the AP's top male athlete
was the subject of the AP's Story of the Year. In 1997, Tiger Woods
won the individual award while his victory in the U.S. Masters
earned Story of the Year honors.
	   From the day he homered in the Cardinals' spring training opener
to the night he scooped up a foul ball as a guest in a front-row
box at the final game of the World Series, McGwire was the focus of
American Major League Baseball.
	   ``Americans love power,'' McGwire said. ``Big cars. Big trucks.
Big people. Baseball fans have always been drawn to the home run
and the guy throwing close to 100 mph (160 kph).''
	   McGwire finished with 147 RBIs and an NL-record 162 walks. He
led the majors in slugging percentage (.752) and on-base percentage
(.470) and batted .299.
	   Sosa, however, won the NL MVP award when the Cubs won the
wild-card spot while the Cardinals did not make the playoffs.

BAGHDAD: the Gulf.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Iraq has remained defiant. The Baghdad government announced
Tuesday that its aircraft were flying in the no-fly zones. And it
said anti-aircraft batteries remained ready to fire on allied
planes that enter Iraqi airspace.
	   However, Pentagon spokesman Col. Richard Bridges said Wednesday
there have been no reported sightings of Iraqi planes in the air in
the past few days.
	   Iraq's stance appeared aimed at building Arab support for its
plight following mid-December airstrikes by American and British
jets to punish the Baghdad regime for failing to cooperate with
U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   On Tuesday, Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan was asked by
Associated Press Television News whether Iraq was flying aircraft
in no-fly zones. He answered: ``We are doing it right now.''
	   ``Iraqi planes in effect are flying in a normal manner in Iraqi
airspace,'' he said.
	   Ramadan did not specify whether the aircraft were military or
civilian, but almost all of Iraq's passenger aircraft are either
out of the country or unusable. All aircraft in Iraq are owned by
the government.
	   France initially participated in patrolling the zones.
	   But Paris withdrew from northern zone patrols in 1996, and
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret confirmed Tuesday
that French planes stopped participating in patrols over southern
Iraq on Dec. 16, the first day of airstrikes.
	   Ramadan on Tuesday reiterated the government's stance that it
does not recognize the zones.
	   ``The so-called air exclusion zones exist only in the sick
imagination of the British and American administrations,'' he said.

Olympic debut proposed for mermaid mimics

 &UR; EDS: REPEATING to CORRECT slug to conform to style. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The obscure sport of fin swimming _ in
which racers don a mermaid-like tail _ is being proposed to become
part of the Olympics, the organizers for the 2004 Summer Games said
Wednesday.
	   The final decision on including any new sports rests with the
International Olympic Committee.
	   Fin swimmers stick both feet in a single rubber-and-fiberglass
``mono fin'' up to 80 centimeters (32 inches) wide. They clasp
their hands together in front and propel through the water with
undulating whale-like thrusts of the fin.
	   World-class fin swimmers can move about 30 percent faster than
their conventional counterparts. Some fin swimmers use a snorkel,
but it was not clear if it would be used in possible Olympic
competition.
	   The sport is growing in nations such as Russia, China and
Australia, organizers said.
	   Athens already has proposed water skiing for 2004. A spokeswoman
for the organizing committee, Julie Velisaratou, said billiards and
karate also may be suggested.
	   Other sports waiting for the Olympic limelight include surfing,
ballroom dancing, acrobatics, roller skating and basque pelota, a
fast squash-like game in which contestants hurl the ball with large
curled scoops.
	   At the 2000 games in Sydney, Australia, taekwondo and the
grueling swim-cycling-running triathlon will be elevated to Olympic
status for the first time. In Atlanta in 1996, softball and beach
volleyball made their Olympic debut.

Missiles fired over southern 'no-fly' zone in Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Iraqi claim farmer killed, Western plane down,
Pentagon response &QL; 
 &UR; By DEB RIECHMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. warplanes fired missiles and laser-guided
bombs on a defense site in southern Iraq early Wednesday after it
launched six to eight missiles at a British aircraft, government
officials said.
	   The U.S. and British planes returned to their bases safely,
Pentagon officials said, in what was the second American-Iraqi
missile exchange in a no-fly zone since Monday.
	   At the White House, a senior administration official said that
Iraq fired the surface-to-air missiles at the British aircraft.
U.S. aircraft responded by firing two missiles and several
laser-guided munitions at the Iraqi air defense station.
	   Iraq said the U.S. attack killed a farmer and wounded two other
civilians in a village. The statement, carried by the official
Iraqi News Agency, made no mention of military casualties and
claimed that Iraq ``almost certainly shot down a Western plane.''
	   A Pentagon spokesman disputed the report, saying no Western
planes had been hit and that the American pilots reported striking
the anti-missile site, but no village.
	   ``We don't target farmers,'' Col. Richard Bridges said.

Judge's report says police firing on low caste Hindus unjustified
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ A report by a Bombay judge released
Wednesday criticized police for the shooting of 10 low-caste Hindus
killed during a protest last year.
	   As many as 32 others were injured when police opened fire in a
Bombay slum during a protest over the descreation of a low-caste
leader's statue.
	   ``The police firing was without warning, unjustified,
unwarranted and indiscriminate,'' Judge Sudhakar Gundewar said in
his report, which specifically blamed two police officers in the
shootings.
	   On July 11, 1997 a crowd of protesters stopped traffic and threw
stones when they discovered that a garland of shoes _ considered an
insult in India _ had been draped around the statue of their hero
Babasaheb Ambedkar.
	   Ambedkar is an icon for the lower castes. He helped write
India's constitution and was a leader of India's independence
struggle against British rule.
	   Police said they were forced to open fire when the mob
threatened to throw burning tires at nearby gas tankers. An
explosion would have killed many more, the police said.
	   The judge rejected the police explanation, saying they did not
make enough efforts to disperse the mob.
	   The government said one of the officers cited by the judge had
been suspended but that it had not decided on an action to be taken
against the second officer.
	   The judge began the inquiry in November last year and submitted
his report to the state government a couple of months ago, but it
was initially kept confidential to give officials time to respond.

French striker Dugarry turns down move to Juventus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Marseille striker Christophe Dugarry
said Wednesday he has decided to turn down a lucrative offer to
move to Italy's Juventus.
	   ``It's been a difficult decision to take,'' Dugarry, 26, told a
news conference. ``I want to stay because I feel good here. The
fans want me to stay, so I'm going to prolong this adventure with
them.''
	   Italian news reports said Juventus had offered dlrs 8 million
for Dugarry, who was a member of France's World Cup-winning squad,
and that a deal was imminent.
	   Juventus coach Marcello Lippi, who watched Dugarry score the
winning goal in a recent match against Lens, has been looking for a
replacement for long-term injury victim Alessandro Del Piero.
	   Dugarry said he spoke on the phone to Juventus' French star
Zinedine Zidane before making his mind up.
	   ``He said: stay at Marseille if that's what you want,'' Dugarry
said. ``Then he said he hoped I help win the French championship.''

Paraguay's Gamarra wins Player of Year award
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilians like to say they have
the world's best soccer players, but the top player in Brazil is
from Paraguay.
	   Paraguayan fullback Gamarra, the captain of Brazilian champion
Corinthians, was named the outstanding player of the year by the
Brazilian Soccer Confederation.
	   Gamarra, who is rumored to be headed for Paris Saint-Germain
next season, was awarded a trophy and a prize of 30,000 reals (dlrs
25,000). ``This is a tremendous honor for me,'' he said in a mix of
his native Spanish and Brazil's Portuguese.
	   Corinthians won a slew of honors, including best-disciplined
team and coach of the year for Wanderley Luxemburgo, who also
assumed the Brazilian national team duties in August.
	   The scoring title went to Santos striker Viola, who scored 21
goals. The league's goalkeeper award went to Andre of
Internacional, who received his first call to the national team in
1998.
	   The title of revelation of the year went to Fabio Junior, the
21-year-old striker of Cruzeiro, who also was selected for the
national team.
	   The national championship honorary all-star team was comprised
of Dida in goal; Arce, Gamarra, Cesar and Felipe on defense;
midfielders Vampeta, Djair, Jackson and Valdo; and Fabio Junior and
Viola as forwards.

South America's biggest city set for New Year's Eve tradition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ The cars, trucks and buses that
normally clog the streets of South America's biggest city will
vanish Thursday as thousands of athletes from around the world
compete in the traditional year-ending St. Silvester road race.
	   On Thursday, more than 12,000 athletes _ about 11,000 men and
1,000 women _ from some 15 countries will run in the 15-kilometer
(9.3 mile) route along the wide, skyscraper-lined avenues and
through the narrow, twisting streets of this city of 10 million.
	   Competing for a top prize of 10,000 reals (dlrs 8,350), women
athletes start the race at 3:15 p.m. (1715 GMT), and men set out at
5:00 p.m. (1900 GMT).
	   This year's field includes about 500 foreign runners, including
Kenyan Paul Tergat, the 1995 and 1996 St. Silvester champion.
	   Marcelo Eduardo Braga, one of the organizers of the event said
Tergat is one of the top favorites to win the men's division.
Others include Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa, who earlier this year
broke the marathon world record in Berlin; defending champion
Emerson Iser Bem, also of Brazil; and South Africa's Hendrick
Ramaala.
	   Other runners will come from Yugolsavia, Mexico, Colombia,
Ecuador, Chile, Argentina, Portugal, Uruguay, Paraguay, Peru and
Italy.
	   Tergat isn't as confident as some of his supporters.
	   ``I haven't run a race since September, so I can't promise
anything,'' he said.
	   Iser Bem, who has been preparing since October, says he isn't
necessarily looking for victory.
	   ``All I want to do is come in among the top five finishers,'' he
said.
	   In the women's category, Ecuador's Martha Tenorio, who won the
St. Silvester in 1987 and 1997 is among the favorites.
	   Three-time winner Maria del Carmen Diaz of Mexico and Brazil's
Viviany Anderson Oliveira also top the field.
	   ``I have come to win my third St. Silvester victory,'' Tenorio
said. ``This has been one my best years ever.''
	   ``I hope one day I will equal the record established by Rosa
Mota,'' she added, referring to the Portuguese who won the St.
Silvester every from 1981 to 1986.
	   The race is named after St. Silvester, the Roman Catholic saint
whose feast day is celebrated Dec. 31. It was first run in 1924,
started by Casper Libero, founder of the Gazeta Esportiva
newspaper, the event's main sponsor.

Iraq says U.S. attack kills farmer, injures two civilians

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq said Wednesday that U.S. aircraft fire
killed a farmer and wounded two other civilians in a village in
southern Iraq.
	   The American jets reportedly retaliated after an Iraqi
anti-aircraft battery fired on British planes patrolling a
``no-fly'' zone in the south.
	   The statement, carried by the official Iraqi News Agency, made
no mention of military casualties.
	   The report also claimed that Iraq ``almost certainly shot down
one of the planes.''
	   It was the second such claim in recent days, but officials at
the Pentagon said that all U.S. and British aircraft again returned
safely to their bases.
	   Washington officials said the U.S. warplanes fired missiles and
laser-guided bombs at an anti-aircraft battery after the Iraqis
fired missiles at British aircraft patrolling the southern no-fly
zone. Iraq has never recognized the zone.
	   It was the second American-Iraqi missile exchange in a no-fly
zone this week.
	   On Monday, U.S. warplanes fired missiles at an Iraqi air defense
post in the north after the Iraqis fired surface-to-air missiles at
the jets. Iraqi military officials said that four soldiers were
killed and seven injured.
	   Iraq had claimed to have downed a plane Monday, but was never
able to produce wreckage and the Western allies said they lost no
jets.
	   The northern no-fly zone was set up by the United States and its
allies in 1991 to protect Iraqi Kurds after a failed uprising
against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein following the Gulf War. The
southern zone was set up the following year to protect Iraqi Shiite
Muslims.
	   The zones are patrolled by British and American warplanes flying
from neighboring countries or from ships in the Gulf. Their mission
is to keep Iraqi planes out of the air.
	   On Wednesday, Iraq said its forces opened fire after ``the
criminals once again committed an aggression against the integrity
of our national airspace,'' INA said.
	   It said Iraqi troops fired ``a number of surface-to-air missiles
at one of these enemy formations'' and forced it to flee. It said
that a second group of aircraft approached about 45 minutes later
``and fired a number of cowardly missiles on a farming village.''
	   The statement carried by the news agency said a farmer was
killed and that his brother and a woman were wounded. A tractor was
destroyed, it added.
	   The Baghdad government announced Tuesday that its aircraft were
flying in the no-fly zones. And it said anti-aircraft batteries
remained ready to fire on allied planes that enter Iraqi airspace.
	   However, Pentagon spokesman Col. Richard Bridges said Wednesday
there have been no reported sightings of Iraqi planes in the air in
the past few days.
	   Iraq's stance appeared aimed at building Arab support for its
plight following mid-December airstrikes by American and British
jets to punish the Baghdad regime for failing to cooperate with
U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   On Tuesday, Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan was asked by
Associated Press Television News whether Iraq was flying aircraft
in no-fly zones. He answered: ``We are doing it right now.''
	   ``Iraqi planes in effect are flying in a normal manner in Iraqi
airspace,'' he said.
	   Iraq has never recognized the zones, and Ramadan repeated the
government's view Tuesday.
	   ``The so-called air exclusion zones exist only in the sick
imagination of the British and American administrations,'' he said.

IOC inquiry could take longer than expected
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The IOC may not complete its investigation into
alleged vote-buying during Salt Lake City's successful bid for the
2002 Winter Olympics as quickly as planned.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said two weeks ago he
wanted the inquiry wrapped up by the end of January and he called a
special meeting for Jan. 23-24 to act on the case.
	   But International Olympic Committee director general Francois
Carrard, coordinator of the investigation, said Wednesday the Salt
Lake inquiry may take more time.
	   ``I don't know whether we will have a final report on Jan. 23,''
he said in a telephone interview from IOC headquarters in Lausanne,
Switzerland. ``I'm sure there will be a progress report, but it may
not be the final stage.''
	   Samaranch was eager to get the case closed before the IOC's
world summit on drugs, scheduled for Feb. 2-4 in Lausanne. That
target may now be difficult to meet.
	   The IOC is looking into whether bribery or other impropriety
took place during the Salt Lake bid and, if so, what action to
take.
	   The investigative panel will meet in Lausanne on Jan. 23 and
report the following day to the full 11-member executive board.
	   The investigation is led by Dick Pound, an IOC vice president
from Canada. He was in Salt Lake City on Tuesday, reviewing
documents and interviewing individuals involved with the 2002 bid.
	   Salt Lake Olympic officials have admitted that 13 people,
including six relatives of IOC members, benefited from nearly dlrs
400,000 in scholarship funds. IOC members also were given thousands
of dollars worth of guns and skis, and some received free medical
treatments, including plastic surgery.
	   The IOC inquiry is one of four separate investigations into the
Salt Lake scandal. Also investigating are the Justice Department,
the U.S. Olympic Committee and the Salt Lake organizing committee's
ethics board.
	   Any IOC members found guilty of accepting bribes or engaging in
other misconduct face being ousted from the organization.
	   Under the IOC charter, a member can only be expelled by a
two-thirds majority vote from the general assembly. But officials
said the IOC leadership could pre-empt that by demanding the
members' resignation.
	   The IOC is also studying what measures could be taken against
Salt Lake officials. There is no provision in the Olympic charter
for sanctions against an organizing committee.
	   One Olympic official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
one possibility could be to impose a financial penalty for damages
_ with the money allocated to a special solidarity fund.
	   While the Salt Lake inquiry may not be finished by Jan. 23,
Carrard said it is likely the IOC will be in a position by then to
decide on changes to the bidding and selection process for Olympic
host cities.
	   Samaranch has suggested leaving the selection to the executive
board or other small group, effectively stripping the general
assembly (currently numbering 115) of its principal responsibility.
	   Changes could already be put in place for the 2006 Winter
Olympics, which are due to be awarded at the IOC session in Seoul,
South Korea, next June.
	   The 2006 candidates are Turin, Italy; Sion, Switzerland;
Helsinki, Finland; Zakopane, Poland; Klagenfurt, Austria, and
Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia.
	   Carrard said the leaders of the 2006 bid committees have been
invited to a meeting in Lausanne on Jan. 24 or Jan. 25 to discuss
the rules.
	   Samaranch has already said he plans to stop IOC members from
visiting candidate cities in a bid to limit the chances for
corruption.
	   Carrard said Samaranch had written to every IOC member
explaining that, ``We need to clean the house and take some steps
for the future.''
	   Meanwhile, Thomas Bach, a German executive board member who is
on the IOC panel investigating the Salt Lake case, said he was
shaken by what has been uncovered so far.
	   ``I believed in the integrity of the members, and when you then
hold documents that show the opposite, you are deeply affected,''
he said in an interview Wednesday in the Stuttgarter Zeitung daily.
	   ``If what is in the documents we have proves true, then it is a
serious situation that can lead to the expulsion of IOC members.''
	   Bach said the IOC must demand the same high ethical and moral
standards for its members as it does for athletes.
	   ``When a doped athlete is suspended, then an IOC member guilty
of serious wrongdoing must also be punished,'' he said.

Freed hostages say Yemeni troops started fatal shootout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADEN, Yemen (AP) _ The hostages were being led by their
kidnappers up the mountains to a hideout when shots rang out _
Yemeni soldiers sent to rescue the 16 Westerners had opened fire.
	   It was this shooting Tuesday in southern Yemen that triggered
the two-hour gun battle that killed four hostages, three Britons
and an Australian, two former hostages said Wednesday.
	   They said they were forced to stand with their hands in the air
to shield the gunmen. When the hostages staggered back two of them
were shot dead by their captors and the others cowered behind an
embankment, they said.
	   The account appeared to contradict a Yemeni government
statement, which said security forces opened fire ``after the
kidnappers had already started killing the hostages.''
	   The soldiers were only trying to ``prevent further killings and
to save the lives of the hostages,'' the statement said.
	   Eric Firkins and Brian Smith had a different tale to tell.
	   Firkins, 55, from Croydon, England, said the abductors armed
with assault rifles and grenade launchers were leading the hostages
into the mountains to a hideout. ``Then we heard the gunfire,'' he
said.
	   ``The army approached us and the nearer they got, the more tense
the situation in our group became,'' said Smith, 52, a postal
worker from Peterborough, England.
	   He said the shooting then started in earnest with bullets
whizzing over their heads and shells crashing against surrounding
mountains or exploding in the air.
	   He and Firkins were interviewed at a hotel in the southern port
of Aden, about a three-hour drive from the town of Mawdiyah where
the hostages were held captive for a while after being seized
nearby on Monday. Mawdiyah is 175 miles (286 kilometers) south of
the capital, San`a.
	   Firkins, a chemistry professor whose sandals were still dusty
from the trek, said the the kidnappers had divided the hostages _
12 Britons, two Americans and two Australians _ into two groups of
11 and five. He and Smith were in the larger group and they didn't
know how the other group came under attack.
	   ``We were in the middle of a battle. We weren't armed, with no
military knowledge,'' Smith said.
	   At one point, the abductors told them to stand in open ground
with their hands up. ``We stood very bravely and even held our
hands up. Thereafter we fell back and the army approached and then
there were the two killings,'' he said.
	   ``My colleagues and I and another woman fell behind an
embankment and we held each others' hands until the army got very
close to us and we could surrender ourselves,'' he said.
	   This was the first time Islamic extremists had abducted
foreigners.
	   In the past tribes people have kidnapped scores of foreigners to
win economic concessions from the government but have usually
treated the hostages well and released them unharmed. On Wednesday,
four Germans kidnapped by Yemeni tribesmen on Dec. 7 were set free
unharmed.
	   The Yemeni government statement said that unlike previous
kidnappings the latest tragedy had ``purely political motives.''
	   ``The kidnappers were terrorists .. and their aim was
martyrdom,'' it said.
	   Firkins said the kidnappers tried to take cover behind the
prisoners before killing two of them ``in revenge'' as they fled.
He said he saw one of the victims, a woman, being shot in the back
of her neck.
	   ``We were used as human shields by our abductors,'' Smith said.
	   Firkins said his worst experience during the shootout was when a
kidnapper pointed a gun at his chest. ``I said, `No, no, no,' ...
Miraculously, he (the gunman) went away ... the army was just too
close,'' he recounted.
	   The British Foreign Office confirmed three Britons were slain _
Ruth Williamson, 34, Margaret Whitehouse, 52, and Peter Rowe, a
60-year-old math lecturer from Durham University. The fourth person
killed was an Australian named Andrew Colin Thirsk, 35, of Sydney.
	   Yemen's Interior Ministry said its forces killed three of the
kidnapers and captured three others.
	   An American woman, who was not identified, was shot in the
pelvis and Rowe's wife, Claire Marston, was shot in the shoulder.
On Wednesday, Marston was awake after surgery in Aden and knew her
husband had been killed, British diplomat David Pearce said.
	   Marston is ``in a very bad way,'' he told reporters at
Al-Jamhouriya Hospital in Aden.
	   In San`a, Brig. Mohammad Saleh al-Turaiq, the chief of security
in Aden province, said Wednesday that the kidnappers were the first
to open fire.
	   He said one kidnapper, an Egyptian identified as Osama al-Masri,
started it. Egyptian security sources said the name was the alias
of a wanted Islamic extremist. They refused to give his real name.
	   The officials said the kidnappers belonged to Islamic Jihad, a
group of about 200 members based in a camp in south Yemen.
	   They had seized the hostages to demand the release of two of
their leaders and in protest against the recent U.S. and British
airstrikes against Iraq, officials said. Police had detained the
leaders in a crackdown on Islamic vigilantes.
	   The group has loose ties to radical Muslim groups elsewhere in
the Arab world. The common aim of these groups is to set up
theocratic rule in their countries, and many of their leaders had
fought against the Russian occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s.

Foreign Ministry official charged with spying for Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ A foreign ministry official who was
dismissed from his post in September has been charged with
espionage, the state prosecutor's office said Wednesday.
	   First Secretary Olli Mattila is suspected of handing over
confidential information to Russia, mainly business-related
documents regarding the European Union, said state prosecutor Jorma
Rautakoski.
	   There is no evidence Mattila received any money in return, he
said.
	   According to the prosecutor's office, Mattila is suspected of
delivering a few dozen documents during 1997 and 1998.
	   Olli Mattila's father, Olavi J. Mattila, a well-known politician
who was foreign minister in the early 1970s, has defended his son.
	   ``I'm not overly concerned about it. It was a question of
ordinary diplomatic contacts, which I believe is completely normal,
having been a diplomat myself,'' he said.
	   Even though the surrendered documents were not secret, charges
can be pursued if the information revealed in them could hurt
Finnish foreign relations, prosecutor Rautakoski said.
	   ``Someone in Mattila's position should know what kind of
information is appropriate to reveal,'' he said.
	   Two Russian diplomats who were involved in the case left the
country in September, said the foreign ministry. One of them was
expelled.
	   According to Security Police director Seppo Nevala, it is the
first time in Finland that a foreign ministry official is suspected
of espionage.
	   ``The case is particularly problematic because an intelligence
agency has broken into the core area of foreign policy
decision-making,'' he said earlier.
	   The maximum penalty for espionage in Finland is ten years
imprisonment.

Judge rules Reform Jewish conversions valid in Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Jerusalem judge ruled Wednesday that all
Reform and Conservative converts to Judaism must be recognized as
Jews in Israel, a decision sure to reverberate throughout the
Jewish world.
	   The ruling broke new ground by validating conversion by
non-Orthodox movements in Israel as well as abroad. Earlier Israeli
court rulings had recognized only the validity of non-Orthodox
conversions performed abroad.
	   The Interior Ministry said it would appeal Wednesday's ruling to
the Supreme Court.
	   Jerusalem District Court Judge Vardi Zyler ruled that the
converts, 22 Reform and one Conservative, must be listed in the
Israeli population registry as Jews.
	   Of the 23 converts, 13 were converted in Israel and the others
abroad.
	   Orthodox Jews, who claim a monopoly in Israel on Jewish
religious matters, rejected the ruling.
	   ``Allowing Reform rabbis to perform conversions is like allowing
garage mechanics to perform conversions, '' Rabbi Avraham Ravitz, a
leading Orthodox Jewish lawmaker, told Israel radio.
	   Another Orthodox legislator, Hanan Porat, chairman of the
Israeli parliament law committee, said he would draft a law to void
the judge's decision.
	   Reform Jewish leader Rabbi Uri Regev warned Orthodox Jewish
politicians not to try to overturn the ruling with legislation.
	   Regev, who called the ruling ``revolutionary,'' said that Jews
belonging to the Reform and Conservative movement in the United
States _ the largest Jewish community in the world, and where those
two movements predominate _ would regard a challenge as a
``personal insult'' and might stop backing Israel.
	   He said attempts by Orthodox parties to force their version of
Judaism on all of Israel are seen by American Jews as ``slapping
Reform and Conservative Judaism in the face, questioning their
integrity, questioning their Jewish identity.''
	   American Jews have contributed hundreds of millions of dollars
to Israel and are instrumental in promoting Israel's interests
before the American government.
	   In recent years, as the Orthodox Jews gain more power in Israel,
there have been signs of alienation. American Jews have been
earmarking a larger portion of their contributions for their own
communities instead of Israel.
	   ``The court ruled that Judaism does not have geographical
limitations,'' said Rabbi Amy Klein, director of overseas relations
for the Israel Religious Action Center of the Reform Jewish
movement.
	   Israel's Orthodox Jewish establishment rejects Reform and
Conservative Judaism because the liberal movements do not follow
the strict Jewish laws and interpretations that govern the lives of
Orthodox Jews.
	   Regev said Israel's society ``is at a crossroads.'' The people
and the courts are moving in the direction of ``a greater role for
democracy in public life, human rights and pluralism,'' accepting
streams of Judaism other than Orthodox, while Orthodox political
parties try to ``pull Israel back into the Middle Ages and impose a
theocratical state and society.''

 &UR; German foreign minister thanks Yemeni government, others for
hostages' release &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Foreign Minister Joschka Fisher on
Wednesday thanked the Yemeni government and others involved in
gaining the release of four German hostages, three and a half weeks
after they were kidnapped by tribesmen.
	   Fischer also said he was releaved to hear that the three women
and a man were ``in good condition considering the circumstances,''
and that they were being cared for at the German embassy in the
capital of San'a.
	   ``We have all worried and hoped for them and their families in
the last 24 days of the kidnapping, the longest hostage taking of
foreign tourists in Yemen,'' Fischer said.
	   After the attempt by Yemeni authorities on Tuesday to free a
group of 16 tourists in which three Britons and an Australian was
killed and several injured, President Roman Herzog sent a message
to his Yemeni counterpart to avoid any action that might endanger
the Germans.
	   Fischer's spokesman Martin Erdmann said the ministry does not
know exactly what led to the release of the hostages.
	   He said it was unclear if Yemeni officials met demands of the
tribe that had kidnapped the Germans, but that he could confirm
that Germany did not pay a ransom or promise other services.
	   German Ambassador to Yemen, Helga Graefin was originally
informed by the Yemeni interior and defense ministries that the
hostages had been freed, Erdmann said.

Iraq says U.S. attack kills farmer, injures two civilians
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq said Wednesday that U.S. aircraft fire
killed a farmer and wounded two other civilians in a village in
southern Iraq.
	   The American jets reportedly retaliated after an Iraqi
anti-aircraft battery fired on British planes patrolling a
``no-fly'' zone in the south.
	   The statement, carried by the official Iraqi News Agency, made
no mention of military casualties.
	   The report also claimed that Iraq ``almost certainly shot down
one of the planes.''
	   It was the second such claim in recent days, but officials at
the Pentagon said that all U.S. and British aircraft again returned
safely to their bases.
	   Washington officials said the U.S. warplanes fired missiles and
laser-guided bombs at an anti-aircraft battery after the Iraqis
fired missiles at British aircraft patrolling the southern no-fly
zone.
	   It was the second American-Iraqi missile exchange in a no-fly
zone this week.
	   On Monday, U.S. warplanes fired missiles at an Iraqi air defense
post in the north after the Iraqis fired surface-to-air missiles at
the jets. Iraqi military officials said that four soldiers were
killed and seven injured.
	   Iraq had claimed to have downed a plane Monday, but was never
able to produce wreckage and the Western allies said they lost no
jets.
	   The northern no-fly zone was set up by the United States and its
allies in 1991 to protect Iraqi Kurds after a failed uprising
against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein following the Gulf War. The
southern zone was set up the following year to protect Iraqi Shiite
Muslims.
	   The zones are patrolled by British and American warplanes flying
from neighboring countries or from ships in the Gulf. Their mission
is to keep Iraqi planes out of the air.
	   On Wednesday, Iraq said its forces opened fire after ``the
criminals once again committed an aggression against the integrity
of our national airspace,'' INA said.
	   It said Iraqi troops fired ``a number of surface-to-air missiles
at one of these enemy formations'' and forced it to flee. It said
that a second group of aircraft approached about 45 minutes later
``and fired a number of cowardly missiles on a farming village.''
	   The statement carried by the news agency said a farmer was
killed and that his brother and a woman were wounded. A tractor was
destroyed, it added.
	   The Baghdad government announced Tuesday that its aircraft were
flying in the no-fly zones. And it said anti-aircraft batteries
remained ready to fire on allied planes that enter Iraqi airspace.
	   However, Pentagon spokesman Col. Richard Bridges said Wednesday
there have been no reported sightings of Iraqi planes in the air in
the past few days.
	   Iraq's stance appeared aimed at building Arab support for its
plight following mid-December airstrikes by American and British
jets to punish the Baghdad regime for failing to cooperate with
U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   On Tuesday, Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan was asked by
Associated Press Television News whether Iraq was flying aircraft
in no-fly zones. He answered: ``We are doing it right now.''
	   ``Iraqi planes in effect are flying in a normal manner in Iraqi
airspace,'' he said.
	   Ramadan on Tuesday reiterated the government's stance that it
does not recognize the zones.
	   ``The so-called air exclusion zones exist only in the sick
imagination of the British and American administrations,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ A new study suggests doctors shouldn't be so quick
to blame the patient when attempts at lowering blood pressure fail.
	   The study of Veterans Administration clinics found that doctors
often fail to switch drugs or prescribe higher doses even when
their patients' blood pressure is clearly too high.
	   In these cases, the study found, poor access to care or
patients' unwillingness to take their medicine cannot completely
explain the failure to control blood pressure.
	   ``Physicians themselves must accept some responsibility for the
problem,'' the doctors wrote.
	   The study, directed by Dr. Dan R. Berlowitz of the VA hospital
in Bedford, Massachusetts, was published in Thursday's New England
Journal of Medicine.
	   The doctors examined the care of 800 men with high blood
pressure who were treated at five clinics for veterans in New
England over a two-year period. About 40 percent of them had blood
pressure that was above 160 over 90, despite making an average of
more than six visits a year for hypertension.
	   The doctors found that the men's medication was increased on
just under 7 percent of the visits.
	   The doctors also frequently failed to try different treatments.

Rebels continue to push toward Freetown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Rebels fighters advancing toward
Sierra Leone's capital have captured the central town of Lunsar, a
junction point on the road to Freetown.
	   Defense officials who spoke on condition of anonymity on
Wednesday said troops assigned to Sierra Leone's West African
defense force had withdrawn from Lunsar, about 65 kilometers (40
miles) east of Freetown by road.
	   Missionaries in Lunsar said the West African force, known as
ECOMOG, had been unable to repel the rebel attack, the Italian
missionary news service, Misna, reported from Rome.
	   There were also unconfirmed reports of fighting near Port Loko,
the next major community toward Freetown.
	   The rebel Revolutionary United Front began an offensive more
than a week ago to recapture ground lost to ECOMOG. The insurgent
force, marked by brutal tactics, has swept through several
important towns in the east and north of the country.
	   The key central town of Makeni fell to the rebels over the
weekend.
	   The surprisingly swift advances toward Freetown come as the
rebels say they are preparing for a final assault on the capital.
	   On Tuesday, a top rebel commander said his forces would begin
attacking Freetown before the weekend if the government fails to
agree to immediate talks.
	   The West African intervention force, led by Nigerian troops, has
shifted the focus of its operations in Sierra Leone toward
defending Freetown.
	   ECOMOG troops were hailed as heroes in February when they drove
the rebels and an allied military junta from power. The coalition
defense force successfully battled the rebels away from the city
and helped restore the country's elected President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah.
	   Kabbah was deposed in a military coup in May 1997, but returned
to power in March of this year after ECOMOG ousted the junta led by
Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma.
	   Koroma's regime was denounced as brutal, while its RUF rebel
allies have been accused a widespread atrocities in the
countryside. Countless villagers have been maimed, tortured or
murdered by the rebels, relief workers and missionaries say.
	   The rebels have demanded Kabbah resign and are calling for
mediation with the government through the Organization of African
Unity.
	   Although they lack popular support, the Revolutionary United
Front have mounted a surprisingly successful resurgence after they
suffered heavy loses to the Nigerian-led defense force earlier in
the year.
	   Sierra Leonean government officials say the rebels are being
aided by neighboring Liberia and mercenaries from Burkina Faso.
	   Liberia has repeatedly denied the charge.

Freed hostages say Yemeni troops started fatal shootout

<TEXT>
	   ADEN, Yemen (AP) _ The hostages were being led by their
kidnappers up the mountains to a hideout when shots rang out _
Yemeni soldiers sent to rescue the 16 Westerners had opened fire.
	   It was this shooting Tuesday in southern Yemen that triggered
the two-hour gun battle that killed four hostages, three Britons
and an Australian, two former hostages said Wednesday.
	   They said they were forced to stand with their hands in the air
to shield the gunmen. When the hostages staggered back two of them
were shot dead by their captors and the others cowered behind an
embankment, they said.
	   The account appeared to contradict a Yemeni government
statement, which said security forces opened fire ``after the
kidnappers had already started killing the hostages.'' The soldiers
were only trying to ``prevent further killings and to save the
lives of the hostages,'' the statement said.
	   Three kidnappers were killed and three captured, the statement
said.
	   The kidnappers, from Yemen-based group of about 200 members
called Islamic Jihad, had demanded the release from prison of two
of the group's leaders and were protesting the recent U.S.-British
airstrikes against Iraq, Yemeni security officials said. The group
has loose ties to Muslim groups elsewhere in the Arab world, which
are dedicated to setting up theocratic rule in their country.
	   Accounts of the shootings from surviving hostages Eric Firkins
and Brian Smith were at odds with the government version.
	   Firkins, 55, from Croydon, England, said the abductors armed
with assault rifles and grenade launchers were leading the hostages
into the mountains to a hideout. ``Then we heard the gunfire,'' he
said.
	   ``The army approached us and the nearer they got, the more tense
the situation in our group became,'' said Smith, 52, a postal
worker from Peterborough, England.
	   He said the shooting then started in earnest with bullets
whizzing over their heads and shells crashing against surrounding
mountains or exploding in the air.
	   He and Firkins were interviewed at a hotel in the southern port
of Aden, about a three-hour drive from the town of Mawdiyah where
the hostages were held captive for a while after being seized
nearby on Monday. Mawdiyah is 175 miles (286 kilometers) south of
the capital, San`a.
	   Firkins, a chemistry professor whose sandals were still dusty
from the trek, said the kidnappers had divided the hostages _ 12
Britons, two Americans and two Australians _ into two groups of 11
and five. He and Smith were in the larger group and they didn't
know how the other group came under attack.
	   ``We were in the middle of a battle. We weren't armed, with no
military knowledge,'' Smith said.
	   At one point, the abductors told them to stand in open ground
with their hands up. ``We stood very bravely and even held our
hands up. Thereafter we fell back and the army approached and then
there were the two killings,'' he said.
	   ``My colleagues and I and another woman fell behind an
embankment and we held each others' hands until the army got very
close to us and we could surrender ourselves,'' he said.
	   This was the first time Islamic extremists had abducted
foreigners.
	   In the past tribes people have kidnapped scores of foreigners to
win economic concessions from the government but have usually
treated the hostages well and released them unharmed.
	   In a separate development Wednesday, four Germans kidnapped by
Yemeni tribesmen on Dec. 7 were set free unharmed.
	   The Yemeni government statement said that unlike previous
kidnappings the latest tragedy had ``purely political motives.''
	   ``The kidnappers were terrorists .. and their aim was
martyrdom,'' it said.
	   Firkins said the kidnappers tried to take cover behind the
prisoners before killing two of them ``in revenge'' as they fled.
He said he saw one of the victims, a woman, being shot in the back
of her neck.
	   ``We were used as human shields by our abductors,'' Smith said.
	   Firkins said his worst experience during the shootout was when a
kidnapper pointed a gun at his chest. ``I said, `No, no, no,' ...
Miraculously, he (the gunman) went away ... the army was just too
close,'' he recounted.
	   The British Foreign Office confirmed three Britons were slain _
Ruth Williamson, 34, Margaret Whitehouse, 52, and Peter Rowe, a
60-year-old math lecturer from Durham University. The fourth person
killed was an Australian named Andrew Colin Thirsk, 35, of Sydney.
	   An American woman, who was not identified, was shot in the
pelvis and Rowe's wife, Claire Marston, was shot in the shoulder.
On Wednesday, Marston was awake after surgery in Aden and knew her
husband had been killed, British diplomat David Pearce said.
	   Marston is ``in a very bad way,'' he told reporters at
Al-Jamhouriya Hospital in Aden.
	   In San`a, Brig. Mohammad Saleh al-Turaiq, the chief of security
in Aden province, said Wednesday that the kidnappers were the first
to open fire.
	   He said one kidnapper, an Egyptian identified as Osama al-Masri,
started it. Egyptian security sources said the name was the alias
of a wanted Islamic extremist. They refused to give his real name.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey claimed victory Wednesday in Greek
Cypriots' decision to cancel deployment of Russian-made missiles on
the divided island of Cyprus.
	   It warned it would use force to block an alternative proposal to
put the missiles on the Greek island of Crete.
	   Greek Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides announced Tuesday that
he was calling off the deployment of Russian-made S-300
surface-to-air missiles. Clerides said he would negotiate with
Russian officials to put the missiles on the nearby island of Crete
instead.
	   ``We would take all appropriate political and military means if
they were to be deployed in Crete,'' Turkish Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem told reporters Wednesday.
	   ``If there is a threat directed toward Turkey, then we will do
the necessary analysis and respond accordingly.''
	   The Mediterranean island of Cyprus is divided between two
hostile republics _ one Greek Cypriot, one Turkish Cypriot.
	   Turkey had threatened to use force to block the missiles'
deployment on Cyprus ever since plans for them were announced two
years ago. The United States and NATO also criticized the decision,
fearning new conflict between NATO members and rivals Turkey and
Greece.
	   On Wednesday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was among world
leaders welcoming Greek Cypriots' tension-easing decision.
	   Annan called it a ``tangible, positive response'' to Security
Council requests that all sides avoid building up military forces
on the island, a spokesman said.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Vladimir Rakhmanin indicated Wednesday
that Moscow still expected to be paid for the missiles.
	   ``The Russian-Cypriot contact has an exclusively commercial
character. The Russian side will strictly fulfill this contract,''
Rakhmanin said in a statement. ``It is important that the
recipients of the complexes fulfill their primary obligations.''
	   ``Any possibility of changing the parameters of the contract is
a question for the orderer, the government of the Republic of
Cyprus, and the supplier, the state arms exporter
Rosvooruzheniye,'' he said.
	   Greece had pressed Greek Cyprus to shift the missiles to Crete
as a way to avoid a military showdown with Turkey.
	   Greek officials feared that a costly increase of its military
presence in Cyprus _ under a defense pact _ could set back
austerity measures aimed at qualifying Greece for the European
Union's single currency group.
	   Athens also worries that escalating tensions on the divided
island could weaken Cyprus' bid to join the European Union.
	   Cem said Crete was an unacceptable option because it would
intensify tensions between Greece and Turkey and entail the
presence of Russian military officials on NATO territory.
	   ``We will watch the developments carefully and continue to take
every kind of measure possible,'' Cem said. ``They should not think
that Turkey will sit around with its arms crossed.''
	   Cyprus has been divided since since 1974, when Turkey sent in
troops after a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   ``They cannot find a place for the missiles,'' Turkish daily
Radikal quoted Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin as saying.
``This is Turkey's victory.''
	   ``Turkey did not want the missiles in Cyprus, so it's an
achievement that they are not going there,'' said Ilter Turan,
professor of political science at Istanbul's Bilgi University.
``It's a victory for common sense since it should reduce tensions
in the region.''
	   In Greek Cyprus, the ministers of defense and education
announced they would resign to protest their government's
calling-off of the deployment.

Elderly woman accompanied son on fast-food holdups
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ A heroin addict who held up fast-food
joints to feed his habit had an unlikely accomplice -- his
76-year-old mother, who says she went along to look after him.
	   Police in Barcelona arrested the duo Sunday after the
42-year-old man robbed a sandwich shop at gunpoint and attempted a
slow getaway on foot with his mother, news reports say.
	   The woman confessed to accompanying him on several such holdups
``so he would not do anything bad,'' the newspaper El Pais
reported.
	   In Sunday's incident, the two had a meal in a fast-food
restaurant, after which the woman waited outside while her son
robbed it with the aid of a silver .38-caliber Smith and Wesson
pistol.
	   The woman told police that in the past she had gone by herself
to rough neighborhoods to buy heroin for her son.
	   After Sunday's arrest the judge assigned to the case released
the woman so she can continue to take care of her invalid husband.
Her son remains jailed awaiting trial.
	   Officials did not give the name of the woman or her son.

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Fighting this week between leftist
guerrillas and rival paramilitary groups in northern Colombia left
at least nine people dead and prompted hundreds to flee their
homes, authorities said Wednesday.
	   Officials found a trail of burned and dismembered bodies in El
Diamante, a village in Cordoba state 285 miles (460 kilometers)
northwest of Bogota. Leftist rebels battled militia members there
for two days beginning Monday.
	   Health officials in the nearby town of Tierralta said the dead
included a three-week-old baby hit in the head with a stray bullet,
a seven year-old girl stabbed in the stomach with a machete, and an
elderly woman. They also recovered the bodies of five men, many
with burns or mutilated limbs, and a dismembered head believed to
be that of a sixth man.
	   ``One would rather not believe that men are capable of this. It
was pure barbarity,'' Dr. Viviano Guerrero of the Tierralta Health
Department told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
	   Guerrero said rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, burned down houses and a health clinic. It was
unclear whether the dead were victims of the rebels or the
militias, he said.
	   In addition, two soldiers were killed trying to prevent a
separate rebel attack on Tierralta, the army said Wednesday.

Two Cabinet ministers to resign over missile row
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY ALEX EFTY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The ministers of defense and education
will resign to protest the government's cancellation of a plan to
deploy Russian missiles in Cyprus, an official said Wednesday.
	   President Glafcos Clerides' decision Tuesday on the missiles has
drawn criticism both from opposition parties and members of his
right wing Democratic Rally party, which rules in coalition with
the Socialist Party.
	   Defense Minister Yiannakis Omirou and Education Minister
Lycourgos Kappas _ the only socialists in the 11-member Cabinet _
will submit their resignations Saturday, said leader of the
Socialist Party, Vassos Lyssarides.
	   He said the party's political bureau had agreed to the
resignations.
	   The resignation of the two ministers will embarrass Clerides but
will not affect his government because under the presidential
system he can remain in power until the end of his five-year term
in 2003.
	   Clerides' decision followed pressure from the United States and
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization after Turkey threatened to
use force to prevent the deployment of the S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles in Cyprus.
	   Greece, which has a joint defense agreement with Cyprus, also
opposed the deployment, to avoid a likely clash with fellow NATO
ally Turkey.
	   ``The cancellation will prove damaging to both Cyprus and Greece
as their joint defense policy will now become a satellite of
Turkish threats and foreign pressures,'' Lyssarides said.
	   Greece and Cyprus said they agreed to have the missiles deployed
instead on the Greek island of Crete.
	   But Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said Wednesday that his
country would take ``appropriate political and military means'' to
prevent their deployment in Crete.
	   Greek opposition parties also attacked Greek Prime Minister
Costas Simitis for backing down on earlier promises to help Cyprus
if it were attacked by Turkey over the missile deployment.
	   The government suffered ``a heavy defeat on a serious issue,''
charged Costas Caramanlis, leader of New Democracy, the main
opposition party in Greece.
	   Athens newspapers also charged that concessions had been made
without Athens or Nicosia getting anything in return. ``Washington
decides and Simitis carries out the orders, that is the principle
of our foreign policy,'' charged the conservative Eleftheros Typos.

Cuba honors guerrillas who fought with Che Guevara
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Wednesday ceremony &QL;

 &UR; By JOSE LUIS MAGANA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTA CLARA, Cuba (AP) _ The remains of 10 guerrilla fighters
who fell alongside Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara in Bolivia, including
the German woman known as Tania, were interred with military honors
Wednesday in this central Cuban city.
	   They died 31 years ago in a failed attempt to spread an armed
Marxist revolution across the Americas _ an effort that even Cuba
today has renounced.
	   But Comandante Ramiro Valdez, a former aide to Guevara, insisted
that they remained an example for those struggling against ``the
Yankee enemy'' and U.S. domination of the hemisphere.
	   ``Epochs may change. Conditions and methods also change,'' he
said, addressing the memorial service beneath a towering statue of
Guevara. ``(But) the objectives for which they battled continue to
be an objective and an aspiration for the Latin American people.''
	   ``U.S. imperialism today aspires with more force than ever,'' he
declared, saying that caused the backwardness and division of Latin
America and ensured that ``the market with its blind laws dictates
the economy and life of each country.''
	   The ceremony coincided with the 40th anniversary of Guevara's
greatest military triumph, the capture of Santa Clara, which sealed
the downfall of dictator Fulgencio Bastista and the triumph of
Fidel Castro's guerrilla forces on Jan. 1, 1959.
	   Chief honors were given to Haydee Tamara Bunke, the guerrilla
known by the nom de guerre of Tania, whose life has fascinated many
sympathizers of the Cuban revolution. Her nickname was adopted by
newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst when she briefly joined the
radical Symbionese Liberation Army that had kidnapped her in
Berkeley, California, in 1974.
	   Bunke's life also was driven by the great ideological struggles
of the 20th century.
	   She was born in 1937 in Argentina to German parents who had fled
Adolf Hitler's Nazi state. Her father was a Communist, her mother a
Jew.
	   The family returned to the new Communist East German state after
the war and Bunke eventually became a translator. She met Guevara
there when he was on a trade mission in 1960 and became fascinated
with the Argentine physician's goal of spreading socialism
throughout South America.
	   She came to Cuba, worked in government offices, and then was
sent to Bolivia on an undercover mission to help prepare the way
for Guevara's guerrilla struggle there. She eventually joined his
fighters and was killed as the band was defeated in late 1967. Her
remains were found in Bolivia in September.
	   Now, nine years after Communism fell in East Germany, her
remains have been enshrined alongside those of Guevara and his
rebel comrades at a memorial in Santa Clara. Guevara's remains were
interred here last year.
	   On Tuesday, thousands of residents of Santa Clara filed past
coffins displayed at a museum on the city's main square.
	   Vice President Raul Castro presided over Wednesday's internment,
which included a solemn military parade of the small caskets draped
with Cuban and Bolivian flags.

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Rebel forces Wednesday launched an
hour-long artillery bombardment of Huambo, the country's
second-largest city and a base for U.N. and aid agency staff,
according to reports.
	   Five civilians were killed and three were injured, the army
said.
	   Some shells landed in downtown areas of the central highland
city which lies about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of the
capital, Luanda, state radio RNA reported from Huambo.
	   The explosions reportedly began at noon and caused panic among
local people in the government-held city which the army is using as
a base to fly in reinforcements for fighting in surrounding areas.
	   Before the civil war restarted Dec. 4 Huambo had a population of
about 300,000, but tens of thousands of refugees fleeing fighting
in the countryside have converged on the city in recent weeks.
	   The U.N. and International Red Cross headquarters in Luanda both
said they had received no reports of injuries to their staff in
Huambo.
	   However, IRC spokeswoman Francoise Zambelini said a scheduled
aid flight to the city was canceled because the warring factions
did not provide guarantees of safe passage.
	   A cargo plane chartered by the United Nations crashed near
Huambo on Saturday with 14 people on board. The cause of the crash,
as the plane passed over the war zone, was not known.
	   Artillery shells also were landing sporadically in Kuito, 130
kilometers (80 miles) to the east of Huambo, which has been under a
rebel siege for more than two weeks, according to the city's Roman
Catholic Bishop.
	   Most of the shells were landing near the airport outside the
city and only a few people were injured, Bishop Jose Nambi said in
a telephone interview.
	   He said the food shortage in the town was ``very worrying.''
	   The United Nations observer mission, which is monitoring a 1994
peace accord that halted a two-decade civil war between the rebels
and the government, has been unable to stop the renewed fighting
which so far been concentrated in the central highlands.
	   The U.N. Security Council has blamed UNITA, a Portuguese acronym
for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, for
the return to war.
	   UNITA refused to yield control of areas under its control and
maintained a hidden army, according to the United Nations.
	   The country has been ravaged by conflict since gaining
independence from Portugal in 1975.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Foreign Minister Joschka Fisher on
Wednesday thanked the Yemeni government and others involved in
gaining the release of four German hostages, three and a half weeks
after they were kidnapped by tribesmen.
	   Fischer also said he was releaved to hear that the three women
and a man were ``in good condition considering the circumstances,''
and that they were in the care of German embassy personnel and
expected to arrive in the capital of San'a about 10 p.m. (2000
GMT).
	   ``We have all worried and hoped for them and their families in

foreign tourists in Yemen,'' Fischer said.
	   After the attempt by Yemeni authorities on Tuesday to free a
group of 16 tourists in which three Britons and an Australian was
killed and several injured, President Roman Herzog sent a message
to his Yemeni counterpart to avoid any action that might endanger
the Germans.
	   Fischer's spokesman Martin Erdmann said the ministry does not
know exactly what led to the release of the hostages.
	   He said it was unclear if Yemeni officials met demands of the
tribe that had kidnapped the Germans, but that he could confirm
that Germany did not pay a ransom or promise other services.
	   German Ambassador to Yemen, Helga Graefin Strachwitz, was
originally informed by the Yemeni interior and defense ministries
that the hostages had been freed, Erdmann said.

Thursday, 80 percent of the people in Georgia's capital can expect

Judge rules Reform Jewish conversions valid in Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Jerusalem judge ruled Wednesday that all
Reform and Conservative converts to Judaism must be recognized as
Jews in Israel, a decision sure to reverberate throughout the
Jewish world.
	   The ruling broke new ground by validating conversion by
non-Orthodox movements in Israel as well as abroad. Earlier Israeli
court rulings had recognized only the validity of non-Orthodox
conversions performed abroad.
	   The Interior Ministry said it would appeal Wednesday's ruling to
the Supreme Court.
	   Jerusalem District Court Judge Vardi Zyler ruled that the
converts named in the case, 22 Reform and one Conservative, must be
listed in the Israeli population registry as Jews.
	   Of the 23 converts, 13 were converted in Israel and the others
abroad.
	   Orthodox Jews, who claim a monopoly in Israel on Jewish
religious matters, rejected the ruling.
	   ``Allowing Reform rabbis to perform conversions is like allowing
garage mechanics to perform conversions, '' Rabbi Avraham Ravitz, a
leading Orthodox Jewish lawmaker, told Israel radio.
	   Another Orthodox legislator, Hanan Porat, chairman of the
Israeli parliament law committee, said he would draft a law to void
the judge's decision.
	   Reform Jewish leader Rabbi Uri Regev warned Orthodox Jewish
politicians not to try to overturn the ruling with legislation.
	   Regev, who called the ruling ``revolutionary,'' said that Jews
belonging to the Reform and Conservative movement in the United
States _ the largest Jewish community in the world, and where those
two movements predominate _ would regard a challenge as a
``personal insult'' and might stop backing Israel.
	   He said attempts by Orthodox parties to force their version of
Judaism on all of Israel are seen by American Jews as ``slapping
Reform and Conservative Judaism in the face, questioning their
integrity, questioning their Jewish identity.''
	   American Jews have contributed hundreds of millions of dollars
to Israel and are instrumental in promoting Israel's interests
before the American government.
	   In recent years, as the Orthodox Jews gain more power in Israel,
there have been signs of alienation. American Jews have been
earmarking a larger portion of their contributions for their own
communities instead of Israel.
	   ``The court ruled that Judaism does not have geographical
limitations,'' said Rabbi Amy Klein, director of overseas relations
for the Israel Religious Action Center of the Reform Jewish
movement.
	   Israel's Orthodox Jewish establishment rejects Reform and
Conservative Judaism because the liberal movements do not follow
the strict Jewish laws and interpretations that govern the lives of
Orthodox Jews.
	   Regev said Israel's society ``is at a crossroads.'' The people
and the courts are moving in the direction of ``a greater role for
democracy in public life, human rights and pluralism,'' accepting
streams of Judaism other than Orthodox, while Orthodox political
parties try to ``pull Israel back into the Middle Ages and impose a
theocratical state and society.''

In new Israeli politics, style comes before substance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ With its customary horse-trading and dirty
back-room deals, Israeli politics was never for the squeamish.
	   But the new political style emerging in the campaign for the May
17 election is putting off even the most cynical voters.
	   In a dizzying merry-go-round and with nary a word about
substance, politicians are jumping from party to party in hopes of
latching on to the candidate with the best chances of becoming
prime minister. One party reportedly plans to rank its candidates
based on who scores highest in the polls. Stories about politics
read like gossip columns, with detailed accounts of secret
assignations between party bosses and would-be defectors.
	   ``There is no more ideology,'' complained Benny Piro, a
60-year-old Jerusalem building supervisor, as he and other voters
wearily started the countdown to the end of the 138-day campaign.
	   Israel's two living former prime ministers, Shimon Peres and
Yitzhak Shamir, became so dismayed this week that they set aside
their lifelong rivalry to join forces in protest.
	   The two elder statesmen and veteran wheeler-dealers blamed the
party-hopping and apparent lack of convictions on changes in
Israel's electoral system, first applied in 1996.
	   Voters now cast two ballots, one for prime minister and a second
for a party. In earlier Knessets, the party leader backed by a
majority in parliament was tagged prime minister.
	   Peres, an architect of the territories-for-peace Oslo accords,
and Shamir, a lifelong opponent of territorial concessions to the
Arabs, say the new method has led to a proliferation of small
factions and emphasizes the candidates' style over their beliefs.
	   Shamir told The Associated Press that ``if there is something I
could do, it would be to change this trend so that people focus
more on issues and less on egotism.''
	   The ideological gaps between Israel's two political camps have
already narrowed and are now often indistinguishable.
	   While the argument once raged over whether to strike a
land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians, the debate now centers
on how much West Bank land to hand over and who will get a better
agreement on the borders of a future Palestinian state.
	   The Likud party was forced to dismantle the main plank of its
platform _ keeping all of the biblical Land of Israel _ when
Benjamin Netanyahu, a Likud prime minister, agreed in October to
give up a sizable chunk of the West Bank.
	   ``Everybody is for peace, more or less,'' said political
scientist Gideon Doron. ``On the entire political map, there are
not many differences.''
	   So when a weakened Netanyahu was forced to agree last week to
early elections, politicians seeking a leader that will help them
survive into the next Knesset were less concerned about ideology
and more attentive to polls.
	   Communications Minister Limor Livnat is said to be considering
an alliance with the dark horse candidate, ex-army chief Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak, who according to some polls is favored to become
Israel's next leader.
	   Lipkin-Shahak supports the Mideast peace agreements, while
Livnat voted against the Wye River accord in the Cabinet.
	   The former army chief is also drawing supporters from Labor,
including Peres' former right-hand man, Uri Savir.
	   David Levy, a Likud stalwart and former foreign minister, is
negotiating an alliance with Labor Party leader Ehud Barak. Levy
had been a symbol of the resentment of Jews of Middle Eastern
background against the Labor establishment _ long dominated by
European Jews.
	   There are already signs that the campaign will focus on personal
attacks.
	   A Barak supporter filed suit against Netanyahu for allegedly
ordering a dlrs 500 bottle of wine at taxpayers' expense, while a
right-wing activist published a newspaper ad accusing Lipkin-Shahak
of dodging responsibility for a 1997 helicopter crash in which 73
soldiers died.
	   With four and a half months of campaigning still ahead of them,
many voters are disenchanted.
	   ``People are apathetic already,'' said Shimon Yoav, 43, who owns
a news stand in Jerusalem. ``The war is between the politicians,
not the citizens.''
	   Summed up Haaretz commentator Gideon Samet: ``The contest ... is
already emerging as the most corrupt in our history.''

Kwasniewski: Poland will be ready for NATO in April
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ President Aleksander Kwasniewski said
Wednesday that Poland's smooth access to NATO will be ``our great
trump card in negotiations with the European Union.''
	   In an interview for the Polish News Agency PAP, Kwasniewski said
he hopes Poland will make a huge effort and will be ready to fully
join NATO in April, when the Western military alliance celebrates
it's 50th anniversary.
	   Joining the alliance smoothly ``will show that Poland is
credible, that it is a country that takes its obligations
seriously,'' Kwasniewski said.
	   Poland, along with the Czech Republic and Hungary is to join the
EU early next century. The three former Warsaw Pact countries are
invited to join NATO, a Cold War-era foe, during the organization's
summit next year.
	   Kwasniewski said he sees no threats to Poland's access to NATO,
but that intensive effort is required at this stage, to meet all
the requirements.
	   ``Extending the time of Poland's access to NATO would be a
political defeat, that Poland cannot afford. Even worse, if it
turned out we are not a serious ally,'' he said.
	   In a move to mend Polish-Russian ties, strained over Poland's
access to NATO, Kwasniewski repeated an invitation to Russia's
President Boris Yeltsin to visit Poland ``the sooner the better.''
No date has been set yet, he said.
	   Yeltsin's visit scheduled for December was canceled, due to his
ill health.
	   Kwasniewski said the decision last week by Yeltsin and Belarus
President Alexander Lukashenka to join the two countries resulted
``more from weakness than from the strength of the two countries.''
	   ``I think President Yeltsin and President Lukashenka need it to
improve their public image,'' he said.

	   MULCHAND, India (AP) _ With a dozen churches in ruins, Christian
congregations in western India are canceling New Year prayers this
year, fearful of provoking more violence from radical Hindus on an
anti-missionary crusade.
	   And for the first time since the recent attacks began on
Christmas Day, a Hindu temple was reported damaged in one of the
villages, police said.
	   The animosity has polarized Hindu and Christian villagers in the
dry hills of Gujarat.
	   The troubles also are rebounding against the governing Hindu
nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, facing demands to protect the
Christian minority from its affiliated Hindu parties, and pressure
from its hardcore supporters to act against what they call the
induced conversions of poor Hindus to Christianity.
	   In the latest incident Wednesday, one chapel was burned down in
Madalbari in southern Gujarat.
	   Police said a Hindu temple was damaged in Nadhakhadi village a
day after Christmas. They blamed delay in taking note of the
incident on remoteness of the village. Details were not immediately
available.
	   The Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or World Hindu Council, which has
been blamed for many of the attacks, said in a memorandum to the
president that Christians were targeting Hindu temples because they
were unable to convert all the tribespeople to their religion,
Press Trust of India news agency reported.
	   Since Friday, 75 people have been arrested and 18 churches,
prayer halls or Christian schools have been attacked by mobs
wielding axes, iron bars, hammers and stones.
	   In Mulchand, a village of just 500 people, gold and silver
Christmas tinsel hangs from the charred mud-tiled roof of the
Protestant church. Flags of saffron, an auspicious color in
Hinduism, fly from many of the thatched huts where Hindus live.
	   ``We usually have a big New Year service just like the Christmas
service. This year we're afraid to pray publicly,'' said Avinash
Prabhakar. About one-fourth of the people are Christians in
Mulchand, a farming village 130 kilometers (80 miles) from the
nearest city, Surat.
	   Harish Armali, a Hindu, said the damage to Mulchand is deep and
permanent. ``There will be no peace now. We cannot be together
after this, our ties are severed,'' said Armali, who said Christian
schools required pupils to read from the Bible.
	   The small chapel in nearby Jamalpada was one of the first
sanctuaries stormed. Bamboo poles prop up the wooden beams of the
skeletal frame, and smashed tiles litter the ground. The only wall
left standing is adorned with a paper crucifix _ once the backdrop
of the altar.
	   Hansa Parmar, 10, saw a mob hurling stones at an empty Christian
boarding school. ``I first thought it was raining stones. Then I
got very scared of their shouting. Why do they want to chase us
away?''
	   The recent troubles began Christmas Day when Hindus attending a
rally hurled insults at Christian women returning from a prayer
meeting in the town of Ahwa. Stones quickly began flying in both
directions.
	   An anti-missionary call was taken up at a convention of the
extremist VHP. On Sunday, VHP leader Ashok Singhal accused
missionaries of converting gullible, illiterate tribespeople with
promises of jobs or financial gain.
	   Singhal aroused a storm of protest when he denounced the late
Mother Teresa and said the Nobel prize awarded this year to
economist to Indian-born Amartya Sen year was part of a conspiracy
to justify Christian education in India.
	   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, whose Bharatiya Janata
Party shares an ideological parent with the VHP, described as
unfortunate the statements of some VHP leaders. ``We consider all
world as a family,'' he said. Some newspapers spoke Wednesday of an
emerging rift between the BJP and its more hard-line support
groups.
	   Fear of missionaries is deeply embedded in India, and
anti-missionary actions flare up periodically. The conversion of
Hindus is seen as a continuing legacy of British colonial rule.
	   Missionaries are most active among rural indigenous tribes and
low caste Hindus. Christians are 2.5 percent of India's population
of nearly 1 billion.
	   Some priests, speaking on condition on anonymity, said many
conversions do take place in remote villages, but they denied
resorting to bribes or inducements.
	   In Mulchand, Nanubhai Zhugrabhoy said some people turned to
Christianity after they were cured of debilitating diseases, from
tuberculosis to alcoholism.
	   Preetesh Rangdeve, 20, whose father converted to Christianity
years ago, said missionaries had helped low caste Hindus with
education and employment. ``Now the people who neglected villagers
for years are telling them to come back and become Hindus,'' he
said.
	   Economic and social interests are also at stake, because upper
caste Hindus fear they will lose the advantage they have over the
illiterate lower castes, say some missionaries.
	   ``They are not attacking us for our religion. They are against
us because we educated the lower castes. This is a caste war,''
said the Rev. Oscar Barreto, a Roman Catholic priest.

Russia's top banker attacks corruption probe as unfounded
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's top banker chastised police and
prosecutors Wednesday for smearing the bank's reputation by making
what he said were unfounded corruption allegations against its top
officials.
	   Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko was responding to a
statement from Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin, who said Tuesday
that police and prosecutors were probing the activities of the
Central Bank because of suspicions that its leadership may have
misappropriated up to dlrs 1 billion.
	   Stepashin didn't mention any names or provide further details.
	   ``There are no facts whatsoever to back those vague
statements,'' Gerashchenko said in a live interview on the ORT
television station. ``It's an attempt to discredit not only the
Central Bank, but also undermine the government's efforts to
stabilize the economic situation.''
	   The Central Bank has played a key role in the government's
efforts to contain the economic crisis, supporting the embattled
ruble and propping up the ailing banks.
	   During the past few months, the prosecutor's office also accused
bank officials of spending resources on ambitious construction
projects and high salaries instead of using them to ensure
stability of the currency and financial markets.
	   No charges have been brought.
	   Gerashchenko acknowledged that there had been some
irregularities in the bank's activities. He specifically cited the
use of credit cards on business trips by Central Bank officials.
``There is no corruption or thievery here,'' he said.
	   He blamed police and prosecutors for the failure to clearly put
forward their accusations. ``It's incorrect to make such statements
without providing any concrete facts,'' Gerashchenko said.
	   ``It's either incompetence or a premeditated action, and I'm
afraid it's the second,'' he said without elaboration.
	   Gerashchenko, the former Soviet chief banker, served as Russia's
Central Bank chief since the start of free-market reforms in 1992
until he was fired by President Boris Yeltsin in the fall of 1994
over a sharp drop of the national currency.
	   Yeltsin re-appointed Gerashchenko in September at the same time
he named Yevgeny Primakov as Russia's new prime minister. Both
quickly won parliament's approval and enjoy broad support among
lawmakers.
	   Gerashchenko's predecessor, Sergei Dubinin, who was ousted in
August over the government's decision to devalue the ruble and
default on some debts, also denied any wrongdoing in an interview
Tuesday.

 &UR; Formula One owner Frank Williams knighted in Honors List; awards
for Hamed and trainer Ingle &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Frank Williams, who guided the Williams Formula
One auto racing team to nine manufacturers titles, has been
knighted in the New Year's Honors' List.
	   Confined to a wheelchair after a motor accident in Monte Carlo
12 years ago, Williams has been in charge of the team while drivers
such as Nelson Piquet, Alain Prost, Nigel Mansell, Damon Hill and
Jacques Villeneuve all won the world championship.
	   World featherweight champion Naseem Hamed and his trainer,
Brendan Ingle, are both awarded the MBE. The honors come only weeks
after they had an acriminonious split over the trainer's
publication of a book in which he accused the fighter of being
motivated by money.
	   Unbeaten in 31 fights, Hamed is the WBO champion. Ingle gets his
award for services to disadvantaged young people and to boxing.
	   England soccer star Stuart Pearce, who missed a penalty during a
World Cup shootout in 1990 but made up for it by scoring in another
in '98, gets the MBE. Now in his 16th season, 36-year-old Pearce is
playing for Newcastle.
	   Denise Lewis, who won the European and Commonwealth heptathlon
gold medals during 1998, is awarded the MBE while Craig Reedie,
chairman of the British Olympics Association, receives a CBE.
	   Long serving cricketer Angus Fraser has been awarded the MBE for
being England's best fast bowler of his generation. Fraser was one
of the stars of England's series victory over South Africa and was
on the team that unexpectedly triumphed on Tuesday in the fourth
test against Australia at Melbourne.

Milosevic: 1999 should bring about political solution for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In a New Year's message broadcast
Wednesday on Serbia's state-run television, Yugoslav president
Slobodan Milosevic said that he expected 1999 to bring about a
political solution for Kosovo.
	   Milosevic's end-of-the-year message, read on prime-time evening
news on Serbian Television, envisaged a ``multi-ethnic Kosovo,
based on the principles of equality for all.''
	   ``No one must be favorized _ not the Serbs, but not the
Albanians either,'' the message said..
	   The message summarized 1998 as particularly difficult since
``pressures'' on the country were ``strongest ever.'' But these
pressures ``united all citizens and parties in a determination to
defend ... the country's integrity,'' said the statement.
	   Milosevic said any future efforts to bring about independence
for the Albanian-majority province of Kosovo will ``come up against
the will of the people'' of Yugoslavia.

Russia erodes currency reserves to pay debt; still faces default
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has dipped deeply into its hard currency
reserves in the past three weeks to pay its foreign debts, the
Central Bank chairman said Wednesday.
	   Despite that, the country effectively defaulted on a major debt
Tuesday, and Western creditors were meeting in London to decide
what to do about it.
	   Viktor Gerashchenko, the Central Bank chairman, said in a live
television interview that the bank's hard currency reserves were
down to dlrs 11 billion, about dlrs 1 billion less than on Dec. 11.
	   ``The Central Bank had to pay off the government debts to avoid
default,'' he said.
	   Nevertheless, Russia failed Tuesday to make a dlrs 363 million
cash payment on dlrs 26 billion worth of loans that Moscow must
repay to the London Club of commercial creditors.
	   Russian officials said that the country was technically not in
default because more than 70 percent of the debt holders had agreed
to accept new bonds instead of cash.
	   Russia's Vneshekonombank, the state-owned bank responsible for
repaying the debt, claimed it only needed the support of two-thirds
of creditors to make the payment in bonds.
	   But London Club members have indicated that 95 percent of debt
holders will need to approve the plan. Bank of America, the payment
agent for the London Club, was expected to make a statement on the
issue, but had not done so by Wednesday evening.
	   If creditors want to formally declare Russia in default on the
debts, it would require a majority vote of the London Club members.
	   But such a move could only further complicate efforts to sort
out Russia's mounting debt problems, analysts said.
	   Russia now faces about dlrs 150 billion in foreign debts that it
must repay in coming years.
	   When the country's economic crisis hit in August, the government
also effectively defaulted on dlrs 40 billion worth of domestic
treasury bonds. The crisis was brought on by a complex web of
factors that included the decline in world oil prices and the Asian
economic collapse.
	   Russia is seeking to work out restructuring agreements with its
creditors, but the process has been moving slowly, while the
economy continues to crumble.
	   Most of Russia's foreign debt was inherited from the Soviet
Union, and those are considered the riskiest debts. Moscow has
tried to stay current on debt that was run up in the post-Soviet
period, and the country has continued paying interest on Eurobonds
issued after the Soviet breakup.
	   But if Russia misses too many loan repayments, then it's
unlikely to get new loans needed to help it through the current
crisis, which hit this past summer.
	   Since the crisis hit in August, the Russian ruble has fallen
from 6 to U.S. dollar to 21. Inflation, which appeared under
control until the crisis hit, is expected to top 70 percent for the
year.
	   In one positive development, the government said Wednesday that
its revenues for November were up 24 percent from the previous
month and 13 percent from November 1997. The government has said
one of its main priorities is improving tax revenues.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ With its customary horse-trading and dirty
back-room deals, Israeli politics was never for the squeamish.
	   But the new political style emerging in the campaign for the May
17 election is putting off even the most cynical voters.
	   In a dizzying merry-go-round and with nary a word about
substance, politicians are jumping from party to party in hopes of
latching on to the candidate with the best chances of becoming
prime minister. One party reportedly plans to rank its candidates
based on who scores highest in the polls. Stories about politics
read like gossip columns, with detailed accounts of secret
assignations between party bosses and would-be defectors.
	   ``There is no more ideology,'' complained Benny Piro, a
60-year-old Jerusalem building supervisor, as he and other voters
wearily started the countdown to the end of the 138-day campaign.
	   Israel's two living former prime ministers, Shimon Peres and
Yitzhak Shamir, became so dismayed this week that they set aside
their lifelong rivalry to join forces in protest.
	   The two elder statesmen and veteran wheeler-dealers blamed the
party-hopping and apparent lack of convictions on changes in
Israel's electoral system, first applied in 1996.
	   Voters now cast two ballots, one for prime minister and a second
for a party. In earlier Knessets, the party leader backed by a
majority in parliament was tagged prime minister.
	   Peres, an architect of the territories-for-peace Oslo accords,
and Shamir, a lifelong opponent of territorial concessions to the
Arabs, say the new method has led to a proliferation of small
factions and emphasizes the candidates' style over their beliefs.
	   Shamir told The Associated Press that ``if there is something I
could do, it would be to change this trend so that people focus
more on issues and less on egotism.''
	   The ideological gaps between Israel's two political camps have
already narrowed and are now often indistinguishable.
	   While the argument once raged over whether to strike a
land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians, the debate now centers
on how much West Bank land to hand over and who will get a better
agreement on the borders of a future Palestinian state.
	   The Likud party was forced to dismantle the main plank of its
platform _ keeping all of the biblical Land of Israel _ when
Benjamin Netanyahu, a Likud prime minister, agreed in October to
give up a sizable chunk of the West Bank.
	   ``Everybody is for peace, more or less,'' said political
scientist Gideon Doron. ``On the entire political map, there are
not many differences.''
	   So when a weakened Netanyahu was forced to agree last week to
early elections, politicians seeking a leader that will help them
survive into the next Knesset were less concerned about ideology
and more attentive to polls.
	   Communications Minister Limor Livnat is said to be considering
an alliance with the dark horse candidate, ex-army chief Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak, who according to some polls is favored to become
Israel's next leader.
	   Lipkin-Shahak supports the Mideast peace agreements, while
Livnat voted against the Wye River accord in the Cabinet.
	   The former army chief is also drawing supporters from Labor,
including Peres' former right-hand man, Uri Savir.
	   David Levy, a Likud stalwart and former foreign minister, is
negotiating an alliance with Labor Party leader Ehud Barak. Levy
had been a symbol of the resentment of Jews of Middle Eastern
background against the Labor establishment _ long dominated by
European Jews.
	   Levy said the old distinctions were no longer relevant.
	   ``In Israel we've always lived with symbols _ left, right _ but
times have changed, and we're still stuck with them,'' he told
Israel television on Wednesday.

Year's attacks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Police arrested the leader of a violent
Islamic group, foiling a string of planned attacks on bars and
discos across Turkey on New Year's Eve, news reports said
Wednesday.
	   Riot police arrested Salih Izzet Erdis, leader of the outlawed
Great Eastern Islamic Raiders' Front, on Tuesday at a house in
Istanbul where he was in hiding, Turkey's Anatolia news agency
said.
	   Authorities had learned the group was plotting to bomb places
where alcohol is consumed, private Star television said.
	   Star said the group had planned New Year's Eve bombings in
Istanbul, the Aegean port city of Izmir, the Mediterranean city of
Antalya and the popular Aegean resort town of Bodrum.
	   Erdis is better known in the Islamic world as Salih
Mirzabeyoglu. His group, the bloodiest of the fundamentalist
Islamic movements in Turkey, has claimed responsibility for a
number of attacks on left-wing targets and Western-oriented
secularists.
	   Following Erdis' capture, police increased security in big
cities for the holiday.
	   Many Turks in this predominantly Muslim country celebrate the
New Year in Western fashion, giving gifts and throwing dinners and
parties.
	   Drinking alcohol is forbidden under most interpretations of
Islamic doctrine. Islamic circles are particularly sensitive about
the consumption of alcohol when the New Year coincides with the
holy Muslim month of Ramadan, which requires dawn-to-dusk
abstinence from all food, drink, sex and smoking.

Yugoslavia seeks to have Kosovo rebels declared terrorists

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Milosevic's New Year message; trims.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo was reported quiet Wednesday,
but a top government official in the ethnic Albanian majority
province warned a new offensive was possible anytime authorities
deemed it necessary.
	   Yugoslavia's president was more conciliatory, telling citizens
he expected 1999 to bring about a political solution for the
province that would result in a ``multiethnic Kosovo, based on the
principles of equality for all.''
	   ``No one must be favored _ not the Serbs, but not the Albanians
either,'' said a year-end message from President Slobodan
Milosevic, read on state television.
	   But he again ruled out independence for Kosovo, an ethnic
Albanian-majority province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic, as saying any efforts to secede would ``come up against
the will of the people'' of Yugoslavia.
	   In Pristina, Veljko Odalovic, the province's leading official,
accused the Kosovo Liberation Army of taking advantage of an
October truce to take positions abandoned by withdrawing Serbian
police and Yugoslav army.
	   ``We have to defend our state, its integrity and people ... with
or without the international community,'' said Odalovic in an
interview with the Belgrade daily Glas. ``There will be problems,
but we will punish the last terrorist.''
	   Odalovic's comments heightened concerns that the October truce,
mediated by American diplomats, could collapse altogether.
	   Four days of fierce fighting last week in northern Kosovo
claimed at least 15 lives and sent thousands fleeing. Ethnic
Albanian sources reported that the body of an elderly ethnic
Albanian was found Wednesday near Lapastica, 30 kilometers (20
miles) north of Pristina, and that he was presumably killed during
last week's clashes.
	   Serb officials accuse the KLA of triggering the clashes by
attacking police and army units. Yugoslavia, formed of Serbia and
Montenegro, on Tuesday urged the United Nations to declare the KLA
a terrorist organization and crack down on their support network
abroad.
	   The guerillas assert they are only responding to attacks on
them. They received a psychological boost on Wednesday, when an
alliance of radical Kosovo Albanian parties expressed full support
Wednesday for the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   ``The Kosovo Liberation Army is the central national, political
and moral force,'' said Rexhep Qosja, the leader of six parties and
political groups of ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province.
	   The alliance is a rival of the main ethnic Albanian leader,
Ibrahim Rugova, despite their common ultimate goal of an
independent Kosovo. Though most Kosovo Albanians still support
Rugova, the statement was symbolically important to the KLA, which
is at odds with the Rugova camp.
	   Kosovo's Serb-Albanian struggle continued Wednesday despite the
lack of reported violence, with a state-run printing house in
Kosovo serving notice it would stop printing the oldest
Albanian-language daily in the Serbian province.
	   Bujku is one of the three largest dailies in the ethnic-Albanian
majority province.
	   The authoritarian Serbian government, after cracking down
earlier this year on Serbian-language papers in the country, has
moved to suppress Albanian-language papers because of their support
for Kosovo's independence from Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant
republic. Bujku is the first Kosovo Albanian newspaper targeted.
	   Odalovic, the senior Kosovo official, accused the
independence-seeking rebels of trying to frighten the minority
Serbs into leaving Kosovo and create an ethnically pure Albanian
land. Ethnic Albanians make up some 90 percent of the population in
Kosovo, while the Serb population has decreased in the past
decades.
	   ``There can be only one state here, one authority, one police
and one army. There is no space for any paramilitary forces,'' said
Odalovic, referring to the ethnic Albanians' struggle to form their
own state in Kosovo since Serbia revoked their autonomy in 1989.
	   A Serb crackdown against KLA earlier this year claimed over
1,000 lives and left some 300,000 people homeless. Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic ended it in the face of the threat of
NATO airstrikes.
	   NATO has said it is ready to act in fighting in Kosovo flares up
again.

Israeli soldier killed by `friendly fire' in Lebanon

 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli army launched an inquiry Wednesday
into a `friendly fire' incident that killed one Israeli soldier and
wounded two others in South Lebanon.
	   Israel television said the inquiry will look into claims that
soldiers in the unit had complained earlier that their commander
was incompetent, Israel TV reported.
	   The Israeli army spokesman's office confirmed that there was an
inquiry, but would not elaborate.
	   An Israeli army unit set out on patrol in Israel's self-declared
security zone on Wednesday, but split into two parts when a platoon
commander made a navigation error, said Brig. Gen. Effi Eitam, an
army commander in the area.
	   ``The rear unit separated from the front forces and mistakenly
thought they were terrorists. The rear force opened fire on the
front force ... and as a result of this, people were hurt,'' Eitam
said.
	   Eitam said the rear unit had requested and received permission
from the base commander to open fire.
	   The dead soldier was identified as Staff Sgt. Ohad Zach, 19,
from the northern village of Nofit.
	   Army inquiries into ``friendly fire'' incidents are routine.
	   Israel has occupied the zone since 1985 to prevent cross-border
guerrilla attacks. With casualties rising, public pressure has been
mounting to withdraw Israel's 2,000 soldiers from Lebanon.
	   Zach's mother told Israel radio that army commanders had ignored
warnings from soldiers that there were problems with path-finding
and orientation within the unit.
	   ``If soldiers warn about a problem, they know what they're
saying, and commanders have to pay attention,'' she said. ``The
front shot the back, the back shot the front, and Ohad is no
more.''
	   David Bar-Illan, a senior aide to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, said Zach's death, the 24th Israeli casualty in
Lebanon this year, did not affect the ongoing Cabinet debate over
withdrawing.
	   ``It does not change the need for safety of the people in the
Galilee,'' Bar-Illan said, referring to the section of northern
Israel that the occupied zone is designed to protect.
	   Bar-Illan denied that Israel is losing its edge in southern
Lebanon.
	   ``One soldier killed by friendly fire, if that was indeed the
case, doesn't indicate anything except that in one incident it was
a case of negligence,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Wednesday's shooting was the second case of casualties from
``friendly fire'' this month. Zach was buried Wednesday.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Rebel forces in Congo are gaining ground in some
central and northern sections of the central African country,
retaking a town near the northern border, Italy's missionary news
service said Wednesday.
	   The town of Dingila fell Monday, Misna news service said,
quoting missionary sources in Congo. Dingila is about 400
kilometers (250 miles) northeast of the city of Kisangani, Congo's
third-largest city.
	   The biggest advances are being made in Orientale province, which
includes Kisangani, and the central province of Kasai, the

Israeli soldier killed by friendly fire in Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli army launched an inquiry Wednesday
into a friendly fire incident that killed one Israeli soldier and
wounded two others in South Lebanon.
	   Israel television said the inquiry will look into claims that
soldiers in the unit had complained earlier that their commander
was incompetent, Israel TV reported. The Israeli army spokesman's
office confirmed that there was an inquiry, but would not
elaborate.
	   An Israeli army unit set out on patrol in Israel's self-declared
security zone on Wednesday, but split into two parts when a platoon
commander made a navigation error, said Brig. Gen. Effi Eitam, an
army commander in the area.
	   ``The rear unit separated from the front forces and mistakenly
thought they were terrorists. The rear force opened fire on the
front force ... and as a result of this, people were hurt,'' Eitam
said.
	   Eitam said the rear unit had requested and received permission
from the base commander to open fire.
	   The dead soldier was identified as Staff Sgt. Ohad Zach, 19,
from the northern village of Nofit.
	   Army inquiries into friendly fire incidents are routine.
	   Israel has occupied the zone since 1985 to prevent cross-border
guerrilla attacks. With casualties rising, public pressure has been
mounting to withdraw Israel's 2,000 soldiers from Lebanon.
	   Zach's mother told Israel radio that army commanders had ignored
warnings from soldiers that there were problems with path-finding
and orientation within the unit.
	   ``If soldiers warn about a problem, they know what they're
saying, and commanders have to pay attention,'' she said. ``The
front shot the back, the back shot the front, and Ohad is no
more.''
	   David Bar-Illan, a senior aide to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, said Zach's death, the 24th Israeli casualty in
Lebanon this year, did not affect the ongoing Cabinet debate over
withdrawing.
	   ``It does not change the need for safety of the people in the
Galilee,'' Bar-Illan said, referring to the section of northern
Israel that the occupied zone is designed to protect.
	   Bar-Illan denied that Israel is losing its edge in southern
Lebanon.
	   ``One soldier killed by friendly fire, if that was indeed the
case, doesn't indicate anything except that in one incident it was
a case of negligence,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Wednesday's shooting was the second case of casualties from
``friendly fire'' this month. Zach was buried Wednesday.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Avoiding a crisis with just 36 hours to
spare, Mexican legislators ended weeks of deadlock and reached a
compromise Wednesday on the 1999 budget.
	   The Mexican government had faced the prospect of beginning the
new year without a budget _ an unprecedented event in Mexican
history. Officials didn't know if they'd be able to keep the
government operating without a budget.
	   Legislators were stalled over a dlrs 2.86 billion shortfall,
largely the result of falling oil prices. Oil makes up about a
third of the Mexican government's revenue.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo had proposed a series of tax
increases, including a 15 percent telephone usage surcharge on top
of the current 15 percent sales tax. Opposition parties, who have a
majority in the lower house of Congress, opposed the plan, as did
businesses and civic groups.
	   Legislators said compromise worked out Wednesday makes up for
the budget shortfall by including at least dlrs 1.4 billion in
spending cuts, a higher corporate income tax rate than Zedillo had
proposed and higher diesel prices charged by the state-owned oil
monopoly.
	   It also calls for higher tariffs on goods from countries with
which Mexico doesn't have free trade agreements. Those tariffs
presumably wouldn't affect the United States, Canada or much of
Latin America.
	   The lower house was to consider the revenues part of the budget
later Wednesday. It would then need approval in the Senate, which
is controlled by the governing party. The lower house would then
consider the spending part of the budget, which does not need
Senate approval.
	   The agreement was worked out largely between legislators of
Zedillo's Institutional Revolutionary Party and the right-center
National Action Party, which has about a quarter of the seats in
the lower House. The other major opposition party, Democratic
Revolution, strongly opposed Zedillo's plan.
	   For most of its 69-year history, the governing party, known as
the PRI, was able to dictate its will in Congress. But it lost its
majority in the lower house in elections last year _ after PRI
legislators raised the sales tax to 15 percent from 10 percent in
1995.
	   But the opposition has failed to vote as a solid bloc.
Legislators from National Action and the PRI approved the 1998
budget over the objections of Democratic Revolution.

Italian ski great performs farewell race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SESTRIERE, Italy (AP) _ Italian ski great Alberto Tomba kissed
his fans goodbye in an emotional farewell race at his favorite
course Wednesday night, showing he still could act successfully on
the Alpine circuit.
	   The 32-year-old Italian ace, who announced his retirement last
October, finished ahead of world champion Michael Von Gruenigen and
other World Cup stars in a short three-run giant slalom exhibition
under floodlight, carrying away thousands of fans who dared a foggy
and snowy night to attend Tomba's very last race.
	   Tomba joked about a possible comeback at the 1999 World
Championships in Vail, Colo., saying ``may be.'' But he quickly
added that he had other plans than skiing in his future.
	   ``It's over for me, on skis,'' he said. ``I gave a lot, perhaps
too much ... I no longer have motivations. I won everything ....
After 15 years on the World Cup circuit I was really sick.''
	   The skier from Bologna, internationally known as ``La Bomba''
(the Bomb) because of his powerful style between the slalom gates,
recently started an acting career playing the role of a special
corps policeman nicknamed Alex the Ram.
	   Tomba threw kisses to his supporters, shook hands and was
carried shoulder-on by his past rivals after he placed third,
behind Paul Accola and Patrick Holzer, in the exhibition through 20
gates.
	   Tomba clocked the fastest time in the first run but finished
third overall, 0.12 behind the Swiss winner, who pocketed a first
prize of dlrs 28,000.
	   Von Gruenigen, who won the world giant slalom title at Sestriere
in 1997, finished behind Tomba by one hundredth of a second.
	   Slovenian Jure Kosir placed fifth.
	   ``I never doubted about Tomba. He still is great. You can't
forget skiing in a few months,'' Kosir said.
	   Tomba, who won the first of 50 World Cup races in this Italian
resort in 1987, had contested his last World Cup slalom in Crans
Montana last March when he capped his sensational career with a
victory.
	   ``They let the grand dad make the podium for the last time,''
Tomba said smiling at the finish line before being mobbed by fans
who chanted his name and played horns.
	   ``I made wonders in the first run, despite cramps and untested
skis. I was tense because so many people had come here to celebrate
me.''
	   Tomba said he only trained three days for his farewell race, at
the site where he won six World Cup races between 1987 and 1995.
	   ``I was busy playing Alex. It's a difficult job. But I enjoyed
shooting love scenes,'' Tomba said.
	   Gustav Thoeni, Tomba's former personal coach, said ``Alberto
proved he still is one of the best world skiers.''
	   ``However he already gave a lot, and deserves to retire,''
Thoeni said.
	   The three-time Olympic champion, who captured as many headlines
for his antics as for his skiing talent, already was much regretted
by his fans and by the ski industry, a few months after his
retirement.
	   ``We no longer enjoy ski races without Alberto,'' read a large
stripe at the finish line.

Bogus anglers nabbed in hashish seizure in Spain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MALAGA, Spain (AP) _ Police who smelled a rat when they saw two
men fishing with no reels or line found more than a ton of hashish
hidden nearby.
	   The two fake anglers were arrested Wednesday on a cliff
overlooking the Mediterranean near the town of Lagos in southern
Malaga province, the state news agency Efe reported.
	   The men, who had fishing rods with no reels or line, were
apparently guarding a drug shipment hidden at the foot of the
cliff. Police found 37 bails containing a total of 1,200 kilos
(2,640 pounds) of hashish.
	   Firemen used ropes and pulleys to retrieve the drugs.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq said Wednesday that fire from
``enemy'' aircraft killed a farmer and wounded two other civilians
in a village in southern Iraq.
	   Officials in Washington said U.S. warplanes fired missiles and
laser-guided bombs at an anti-aircraft battery after the Iraqis
fired missiles at British aircraft patrolling the southern no-fly
zone. Iraq has never recognized the zone.
	   The Iraqi statement, carried by the official Iraqi News Agency,
made no mention of military casualties.
	   The report also claimed that Iraq ``almost certainly shot down
one of the planes.'' The statement only referred to ``enemy''
aircraft and did not specify whether they were American or British.
	   It was the second such claim in recent days, but officials at
the Pentagon said that all U.S. and British aircraft again returned
safely to their bases.

Ingush leader: North Ossetia dragging its feet on refugee
</HEADLINE>
admissions &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A leader of the Caucasus republic of Ingushetia
accused neighboring North Ossetia on Wednesday of preventing Ingush
refugees from returning to their homes, a news agency said.
	   ``The leadership of North Ossetia ... is artificially creating
obstacles to the return of Ingushis deported from North Ossetia,''
Ingush Vice Premier Akhmet Malsagov said, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   The Ossetian-Ingush conflict goes back to a 1944 decision by
Soviet dictator Josef Stalin to deport the entire Ingush nation for
collaborating with the Nazis during World War II.
	   When the Ingush were permitted to return to the Caucasus in
1957, they found their homes inhabited by Ossetians. Ever since,
both groups have claimed territory that is now part of North
Ossetia.
	   Malsagov charged that only 835 families, or 3,353 people, had
been allowed to return to their homes this year, and about 5,000
people over the last six years.
	   The two Russian regions fought a brief territorial and ethnic
war in 1992, and sporadic violence has continued. Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov convened a meeting of the leaders of the
two republics in September in an effort to calm tensions.

Italy's leaders uphold `no' vote on flood gate project for Venice _
</HEADLINE>
for now &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's top environment and culture officials said
`no' Wednesday to a proposal to build giant flood gates between
Venice and the Adriatic, upholding the ruling of a
government-appointed environmental panel.
	   The project could be revived only if _ and only after _
authorities tried a series of other measures to restore Venice's
lagoon, Environment Minister Edo Ronchi said in a joint decree with
Culture Minister Giovanna Melandri.
	   The project would have placed 30-meter-high (98 feet) barriers
on the seabed at three entrances to the lagoon. When flooding
threatened, the barriers would jut up 2 meters (6 feet) to block
the waves.
	   Backers said the gates were the only sure way to save Venice
from increasing flooding, which threatens the city's treasures and
its tourism. High water hit St. Mark's Square and other low-lying
areas a record 101 times in 1996.
	   Opponents _ including the government-appointed panel that said
no on Dec. 10 _ said the gates risked making the lagoon a turgid
pool, cut off from the sea. They urged standby measures such as
raising foundations and pavements.
	   Italy had spent dlrs 150 million and years of planning on the
project, making killing it a painful decision.
	   ``A typical Italian `no.' No one ever has the courage to say
`no,'' said Giancarlo Galan, president of the regional council of
Veneto, which includes Venice.
	   ``In short, it's a decision not to save Venice, at least not for
now _ that is to say not for the next five, 10 or 32 years, or for
the next five, 10 or 200 scientific studies.''
	   Venice Mayor Massimo Cacciari urged every level of government to
get to work now on projects to safeguard both Venice and its
lagoon.
	   With Wednesday's decree, Cacciari said, ``comes an obligation of
the government to make up for lost time.''

<TEXT>
	   ADEN, Yemen (AP) _ The hostages were being led by their
kidnappers up the mountains to a hideout when shots rang out _
Yemeni soldiers sent to rescue the 16 Westerners had opened fire.
	   It was this shooting Tuesday in southern Yemen that triggered
the two-hour gun battle that killed four hostages, three Britons
and an Australian, two former hostages said Wednesday.
	   They said they were forced to stand with their hands in the air
to shield the gunmen. When the hostages staggered back two of them
were shot dead by their captors and the others cowered behind an
embankment, they said.
	   The account appeared to contradict a Yemeni government
statement, which said security forces opened fire ``after the
kidnappers had already started killing the hostages.''
	   The soldiers were only trying to ``prevent further killings and
to save the lives of the hostages,'' the statement said.
	   In a letter to British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Yemen's Prime
Minister Abdel Karim al-Iryani repeated that version of events and
conveyed his condolences to the victims' families.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With full-scale war returning to Angola
and the downing of a U.N.-chartered plane there, the United Nations
must soon decide whether it's safe to keep observers in the former
Portuguese colony.
	   A U.N. pullout _ which is near complete in another revived
African war zone, Sierra Leone _ could signal to Angola that the
United Nations has at least temporarily given up on implementing
the 1994 peace accord it brokered to end Angola's 20-year civil
war.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan has until Jan. 15 to decide on
options, and U.N. diplomats say he may recommend the Security
Council consider withdrawing the 1,016 troops of the U.N. Observer
Mission in Angola, known as MONUA.
	   U.N. officials and the council frequently have to make such
decisions, weighing the benefits of staying in war zones to help
civilians when they most need it against the potential risks to
U.N. personnel.
	   For the past four months, there has been no U.N. international
presence in Afghanistan because of security concerns.
	   But in Angola, where the United Nations has invested a decade of
peacekeeping and millions of dollars to end a onetime Cold War
conflict, the stakes of a pullout are especially high.
	   ``Our conviction is after all these years, MONUA cannot withdraw
completely and leave the Angolans to themselves,'' Portugal's U.N.
ambassador Antonio Monteiro said in an interview. ``I think MONUA
shall be there and trying in every occasion to help and to show the
Angolans that war leads nowhere.''
	   Security concerns, however, are increasing daily: in addition to
Saturday's crash of the U.N.-chartered cargo plane with 14 people
on board, rebels launched an hour-long artillery bombardment
Wednesday against Huambo, the country's second-largest city and a
base for U.N. and aid agency staff.
	   Already, the International Committee of the Red Cross _ usually
among the last to leave _ has relocated most of its international
staff to the capital Luanda.
	   ``You can only have peacekeeping when you have peace to keep,''
noted U.N. spokesman Manoel de Almeida E Silva, echoing a phrase
familiar in U.N. halls.
	   The United Nations first sent peacekeepers to Angola in 1989 to
monitor the withdrawal of Cuban soldiers backing the government in
the civil war that erupted soon after Angola gained its
independence from Portugal in 1975.
	   A 34-nation U.N. observer team replaced the peacekeepers in July
1997 to implement of the 1994 U.N.-mediated peace accord that ended
the war. Security Council members Portugal, the United States and
Russia were designated to oversee the progress.
	   Over the past few months, however, the accord has disintegrated
as fighting resumed. The opposition UNITA movement has violated
U.N. demands by refusing to disarm and hand over land it controls.
The government, meanwhile, has severed all contact with UNITA
leader Jonas Savimbi and threatened to expel U.N. personnel if they
meet with him.
	   Annan first threatened a withdrawal in September, warning in a
report to the Security Council that the U.N. mission might have to
close down by February if both sides didn't make progress on the
peace process.
	   The current mandate of the force expires Feb. 26, and already
the government has indicated it doesn't want observers in Angola
beyond then, U.N. diplomats said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Some diplomats say the government wants the United Nations to
leave because it thinks it can finally crush UNITA militarily and
has no need for U.N. mediation to form a joint government with
Savimbi.
	   With that in mind, many would argue that now is precisely the
time to remain engaged in Angola to halt the spread of fighting and
care for its victims.
	   ``We are willing. The question is are we able,'' said the Red
Cross' Walter Fullemann.

Turkey threatens to maintain pressure over Russian missiles

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Greek defense minister challenging Turkish

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey claimed victory Wednesday in Greek
Cypriots' decision to cancel deployment of Russian-made missiles on
the divided island of Cyprus.
	   It warned it would use force to block an alternative proposal to
put the missiles on the Greek island of Crete _ which drew new
threats in response from Greece.
	   Greek Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides announced Tuesday that
he was calling off the deployment of Russian-made S-300
surface-to-air missiles on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus,
which is divided between two hostile Greek and Turkish republics.
	   Clerides said he would negotiate with Russian officials to put
the missiles on the nearby island of Crete instead.
	   ``We would take all appropriate political and military means if
they were to be deployed in Crete,'' Turkish Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem told reporters Wednesday.
	   ``If there is a threat directed toward Turkey, then we will do
the necessary analysis and respond accordingly.''
	   Greece's defense minister, Akis Tzochatzopoulos, said the
Turkish reaction confirmed that ``Turkey is a menacing factor in
our region.''
	   ``Turkey's threats will never create difficulties for Greece,''
Tzochatzopoulos told a news conference in Tirana, Albania on
Tuesday. ``We will find the neccesary force for its threats.''
	   Tzochatzopoulos contended that the possible deployment of the
missiles in Greece was nothing for Turkey and Turkish Cypriots to
worry about. ``Even the deployment in Cyprus has not been a
threat,'' he said.
	   Turkey had threatened to use force to block the missiles'
deployment on Cyprus ever since plans for them were announced two
years ago. The United States and NATO also criticized the
deployment, fearing new conflict between NATO members and rivals
Turkey and Greece.
	   On Wednesday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was among world
leaders welcoming Greek Cypriots' tension-easing decision.
	   Annan called it a ``tangible, positive response'' to Security
Council requests that all sides avoid building up military forces
on the island, a spokesman said.
	   Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin indicated
Wednesday that Moscow still expected to be paid for the missiles.

Italian ski great performs farewell race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SESTRIERE, Italy (AP) _ Italian ski great Alberto Tomba kissed
his fans goodbye in an emotional farewell race at his favorite
course Wednesday night, showing he still had what it takes on the
Alpine circuit.
	   The 32-year-old Italian ace, who announced his retirement last
October, finished ahead of world champion Michael Von Gruenigen and
other World Cup stars in a short three-run giant slalom exhibition
under floodlight, carrying away thousands of fans who dared a foggy
and snowy night to attend Tomba's last race.
	   Tomba joked about a possible comeback at the 1999 World
Championships in Vail, Colorado, saying ``maybe.'' But he quickly
added that he had plans other than skiing in his future.
	   ``It's over for me, on skis,'' he said. ``I gave a lot, perhaps
too much ... I no longer have motivations. I won everything ....
After 15 years on the World Cup circuit I was really sick.''
	   The skier from Bologna, internationally known as ``La Bomba''
(the Bomb) because of his powerful style between the slalom gates,
recently started an acting career playing the role of a special
corps policeman nicknamed Alex the Ram.
	   Tomba threw kisses to his supporters, shook hands and was
carried shoulder-on by his past rivals after he placed third,
behind Paul Accola and Patrick Holzer, in the exhibition through 20
gates.
	   Tomba clocked the fastest time in the first run but finished
third overall, 0.12 behind the Swiss winner, who pocketed a first
prize of dlrs 28,000.
	   Von Gruenigen, who won the world giant slalom title at Sestriere
in 1997, finished behind Tomba by one hundredth of a second.
	   Slovenian Jure Kosir placed fifth.
	   Tomba, who won the first of 50 World Cup races in this Italian
resort in 1987, had contested his last World Cup slalom in Crans
Montana last March when he capped his sensational career with a
victory.
	   ``They let the granddad make the podium for the last time,''
Tomba said smiling at the finish line before being mobbed by fans
who chanted his name and played horns.
	   ``I made wonders in the first run, despite cramps and untested
skis. I was tense because so many people had come here to celebrate
me.''
	   Tomba said he only trained three days for his farewell race, at
the site where he won six World Cup races between 1987 and 1995.

	   ADEN, Yemen (AP) _ The hostages were being led by their
kidnappers up the mountains to a hideout when shots rang out _
Yemeni soldiers sent to rescue the 16 Westerners had opened fire.
	   It was this shooting Tuesday in southern Yemen that triggered
the two-hour gun battle that killed four hostages, three Britons
and an Australian, two former hostages said Wednesday.
	   They said they were forced to stand with their hands in the air
to shield the gunmen. When the hostages staggered back two of them
were shot dead by their captors and the others cowered behind an
embankment, they said.
	   The account appeared to contradict a Yemeni government
statement, which said security forces opened fire ``after the
kidnappers had already started killing the hostages.''
	   The soldiers were only trying to ``prevent further killings and
to save the lives of the hostages,'' the statement said.
	   In a letter to British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Yemen's Prime
Minister Abdel Karim al-Iryani repeated that version of events and
conveyed his condolences to the victims' families.

	   MALAGA, Spain (AP) _ Police who smelled a rat when they saw two
men fishing with no reels or line found more than a ton of hashish
hidden nearby.
	   The two fake anglers were arrested Tuesday on a cliff
overlooking the Mediterranean near the town of Lagos in southern
Malaga province, the state news agency Efe reported.
	   The men, who had fishing rods with no reels or line, were
apparently guarding a drug shipment hidden at the foot of the
cliff. Police found 37 bails containing a total of 1,200 kilos
(2,640 pounds) of hashish.
	   Firemen used ropes and pulleys to retrieve the drugs.

 &UR; British knighthoods and honors for Northern Ireland peacemakers &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain marked the new year by giving some of its
highest honors to former Prime Minister John Major and the ``three
wise men'' who led Northern Ireland's peace negotiations to
settlement in April.
	   American former Sen. George Mitchell, the chief negotiator,
becomes an honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British
Empire, one of the highest honors Britain can bestow.
	   Finnish former Prime Minister Harri Holkeri becomes an honorary
Knight Commander of the Order of British Empire _ one rank lower
than Mitchell's. Because they are not British subjects, neither
could be called Sir.
	   Canadian Gen. John de Chastelain , who was co-chairman of the
peace talks, is made a Companion of Honor, a very prestigious order
limited to 65 people at any time.
	   The same honor goes to Major, who laid the groundwork for the
talks while he was in office and continued to work for peace after
the 1997 elections in which he was ousted by Prime Minister Tony
Blair's Labor Party.
	   ``The prime minister has always acknowledged the work his
predecessor did in Northern Ireland and in having the vision to
start the peace process. It is entirely right that he should be
honored for the very important role he played,'' said a spokesman
for the vacationing Blair.
	   Mitchell said he was glad the other peacemakers had been honored
too.
	   ``It's a great honor and I'm especially pleased that my friend
and colleague Prime Mininster Harri Hokeri will be recognized as
well. Both he and Gen. Chastelain deserve more credit than they've
received for their effort on Northern Ireland.''
	   Recipients of the annual New Year's Honors are selected by the
government and Queen Elizabeth II bestows the honors. In the case
of foreign recipients, like Mitchell, Holkeri and de Chastelain,
the honorees are notified of their awards by the Foreign Office and
the honors are usually bestowed by the British ambassador in their
country.
	   The New Year's Honors List of 1,000 names of the famous and the
humble singles out for commendation many who played roles in the
turning point in Northern Ireland's history.
	   The government offered honors to individuals in Northern
Ireland's ``nationalist'' community who seek to break ties with
Britain, but the honors were declined, the government said.
	   ``We completely understand that,'' a Downing Street spokesman
said.
	   He would not say who they were or to which parties they
belonged, but added that ``the individuals concerned were those who
worked hardest for the victory of peace over violence in Northern
Ireland.''
	   ``We have drawn attention to the fact that some nationalists
have turned down honors because we did not want the people of
Northern Ireland to think that only one side had been honored for
their role in the peace process.''
	   There were honors, too, for police, medical staff and local
officials in Omagh, Northern Ireland, for their work after the Aug.
15 bomb that killed 29 people and wounded 370.
	   There is also a knighthood for Ronnie Flanagan, the chief
constable of Northern Ireland's Royal Ulster Constabulary.
	   Gareth Peirce, a lawyer who helped win the release in 1989 of
the Irish ``Guildford Four'' who were wrongly convicted of Irish
Republican Army offenses, gets a CBE, of Commander of the Order of
British Empire.
	   Honors were distributed to people in all walks of life.
	   Actor Nigel Hawthorne, who played the king in ``The Madness of
King George,'' becomes a knight _ just like Sir Humphrey Appleby,
the character he played in the popular television series ``Yes,
Minister.''
	   Robert Carlyle, who has acieved recent fame in the movies
``Trainspotting'' and ``The Full Monty,'' is made an OBE, or
Officer of the Order of British Empire _ one notch below the CBE
award.
	   Pop music veterans Tom Jones and Dusty Springfield also get
OBEs, and actor Roger Moore gets a CBE for his work on behalf of
UNICEF, the United Nations children's fund.
	   Actress and comedian Maureen Lipmann, one of Britain's most
popular television and stage performers, wins a CBE.
	   Conductor Andrew Davis received a knighthood, and playwright
Ronald Harwood _ author of ``The Dresser'' and ``Poison Pen,'' gets
a CBE.
	   Duncan Kenworthy, producer of the hit movie ``Four Weddings and
a Funeral,'' also receives an OBE.

Four people killed and three injured in avalanche on Scottish

mountain &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: AMs: RECASTS and UPDATES with quotes from victims' families &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FORT WILLIAM, Scotland (AP) _ Four climbers were killed in an
avalanche on a Scottish mountain while they were ``living life to
the full and doing what they enjoyed most,'' their parents said
Wednesday.
	   Three of their fellow hikers survived the avalanche after being
rescued after being trapped for 16 hours under tons of snow on the
4,000-foot (1219-meter) Aonoch Mor peak near Ben Nevis in the
Scottish Highlands. Doctors and mountain rescue leaders said it was
amazing they stayed alive for so long in subzero temperatures.
	   The avalanche struck on Tuesday just an hour after the group,
six scout members and their instructor, had begun a two-day winter
climbing skills course.
	   They were reported missing at 2230 GMT Tuesday when they did not
return from the day's climb. Royal Air Force mountain rescue teams
immediately began a search. Gale force winds forced a helicopter to
abandon rescue attempts, but ground crews found the group at 0120
GMT Wednesday, a police spokesman said.
	   ``Rescuers spotted one of the survivors whose top half was
showing, but it took another two hours to dig everyone else out,''
said police inspector Charles Ross. ``It is amazing that anyone
survived in the circumstances. They were all experienced climbers
who were members of some kind of organization and had decided they
wanted to get some winter conditions experience.''
	   Steven Newton, 24; Sarah Finch, 25, and instructor Roger Wild,
were carried off the mountain one at a time, and taken to Belford
Hospital in Fort William, where they were being treated for
hypothermia.
	   The bodies of Emma Ray, 29; Paul Hopkins, 28; Matthew Lewis, 28,
and Ian Edwards, 30, were recovered Wednesday.
	   Lewis' father, Bill, said his son was a recently qualified
accountant.
	   ``We were not there to make a judgment on whether they should
have heeded weather warnings,'' he said. ``Until we can control the
weather, we can't do much about such a thing as this.''
	   ``Matthew was very keen to get the experience the trip offered
and he put a lot of effort into going. I'm concerned they might
have been overkeen on the day,'' he said.
	   Mrs. Lewis said her thoughts were now with the survivors.
	   ``They must have been through a dreadful trauma, being buried
alive for 16 hours,'' she said. ``They've got to live with that the
rest of their lives, seeing their friends die.''
	   ``Who knows, they may never get over that,'' she said.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ With its customary horse-trading and dirty
back-room deals, Israeli politics was never for the squeamish.
	   But the new political style emerging in the campaign for the May
17 election is putting off even the most cynical voters.
	   In a dizzying merry-go-round and with nary a word about
substance, politicians are jumping from party to party in hopes of
latching on to the candidate with the best chances of becoming
prime minister. One party reportedly plans to rank its candidates
based on who scores highest in the polls. Stories about politics
read like gossip columns, with detailed accounts of secret
assignations between party bosses and would-be defectors.
	   ``There is no more ideology,'' complained Benny Piro, a
60-year-old Jerusalem building supervisor, as he and other voters
wearily started the countdown to the end of the 138-day campaign.
	   Israel's two living former prime ministers, Shimon Peres and
Yitzhak Shamir, became so dismayed this week that they set aside
their lifelong rivalry to join forces in protest.
	   The two elder statesmen and veteran wheeler-dealers blamed the
party-hopping and apparent lack of convictions on changes in
Israel's electoral system, first applied in 1996.
	   Voters now cast two ballots, one for prime minister and a second
for a party. In earlier Knessets, the party leader backed by a
majority in parliament was tagged prime minister.
	   Peres, an architect of the territories-for-peace Oslo accords,
and Shamir, a lifelong opponent of territorial concessions to the
Arabs, say the new method has led to a proliferation of small
factions and emphasizes the candidates' style over their beliefs.
	   Shamir told The Associated Press that ``if there is something I
could do, it would be to change this trend so that people focus
more on issues and less on egotism.''
	   The ideological gaps between Israel's two political camps have
already narrowed and are now often indistinguishable.
	   While the argument once raged over whether to strike a
land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians, the debate now centers
on how much West Bank land to hand over and who will get a better
agreement on the borders of a future Palestinian state.
	   The Likud party was forced to dismantle the main plank of its
platform _ keeping all of the biblical Land of Israel _ when
Benjamin Netanyahu, a Likud prime minister, agreed in October to
give up a sizable chunk of the West Bank.
	   ``Everybody is for peace, more or less,'' said political
scientist Gideon Doron. ``On the entire political map, there are
not many differences.''
	   So when a weakened Netanyahu was forced to agree last week to
early elections, politicians seeking a leader that will help them
survive into the next Knesset were less concerned about ideology
and more attentive to polls.
	   Communications Minister Limor Livnat is said to be considering
an alliance with the dark horse candidate, ex-army chief Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak, who according to some polls is favored to become
Israel's next leader.
	   Lipkin-Shahak supports the Mideast peace agreements, while
Livnat strongly opposed the Wye River accord, and abstained when it
came to a Cabinet vote.

Israel delays two flights from Palestinian airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli security officials delayed two planes
from taking off from the Palestinian airport on Wednesday, the
latest tensions in a rare area of Israeli-Palestinian cooperation.
	   A plane bound for Amman, Jordan was delayed for two hours over
an Israeli demand that Palestinian officials inspect the luggage of
a Palestinian passenger, Israel radio reported. The plane left with
the passenger aboard, but without his luggage.
	   Israeli officials also delayed a plane making a stopover from
Saudi Arabia to Cairo, it said. Israeli airport security officials
were not available for comment.
	   Abdel Razek Yehia, a Palestinian official who helped negotiate
the airport's opening, confirmed the delays. He said such
differences did not undermine the peace process.
	   ``Every day we have differences,'' he told The Associated Press.
``We are all doing all our best to continue the peace process.''
	   The airport's opening last month, stipulated by the accords
brokered by U.S. President Bill Clinton at Wye River, Maryland in
October, was hailed by Palestinians as a milestone toward
independence and statehood.
	   Israel retains security control over flights arriving at Gaza
International Airport, and Palestinian security officials consult
with their Israeli counterparts.
	   Earlier this week, Israel threatened to close down the Gaza
airport when Palestinian airport workers refused to allow Israeli
security officials to check the identity of passengers who arrived
on an Egyptian plane, most of whom worked for the Palestinian
Authority.
	   Palestinian officials said that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and his entourage were aboard the plane in question, and that
exempted the plane from Israeli security checks.
	   Since Wye, Israel has accused the Palestinians of failing to
contain anti-Israel violence, and has frozen the accords. The
Palestinians, in turn, accuse Israel of reneging on an agreement to
release Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities.

 &UR; British knighthoods and honors for Northern Ireland peacemakers
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; ADDS comment from Holkeri in graf 9; no uppick

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain is giving some of its highest honors to
former Prime Minister John Major and the ``three wise men'' who led
Northern Ireland's peace negotiations to settlement in April.
	   American former Sen. George Mitchell, the chief negotiator,
becomes an honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British
Empire, one of the highest honors Britain can bestow. The honors
were announced Thursday.
	   Finnish former Prime Minister Harri Holkeri becomes an honorary
Knight Commander of the Order of British Empire _ one rank lower
than Mitchell's. Because they are not British subjects, neither
could be called Sir.
	   Canadian Gen. John de Chastelain , who was co-chairman of the
peace talks, is made a Companion of Honor, a very prestigious order
limited to 65 people at any time.
	   The same honor goes to Major, who laid the groundwork for the
talks while he was in office and continued to work for peace after
the 1997 elections in which he was ousted by Prime Minister Tony
Blair's Labor Party.
	   ``The prime minister has always acknowledged the work his
predecessor did in Northern Ireland and in having the vision to
start the peace process. It is entirely right that he should be
honored for the very important role he played,'' said a spokesman
for the vacationing Blair.
	   Mitchell said he was glad the other peacemakers had been honored
too.
	   ``It's a great honor and I'm especially pleased that my friend
and colleague Prime Mininster Harri Holkeri will be recognized as
well. Both he and Gen. Chastelain deserve more credit than they've
received for their effort on Northern Ireland.''
	   Holkeri said he considers the honor one for Finland, not him
personally.
	   ``When the honor is given to me, it is given to the Finnish
attitude and the Finnish desire to work with the international
community,'' he said. ``It is by chance that it was I who became
involved in the peace process.''
	   Recipients of the annual New Year's Honors are selected by the
government and Queen Elizabeth II bestows the honors. In the case
of foreign recipients, like Mitchell, Holkeri and de Chastelain,
the honorees are notified of their awards by the Foreign Office and
the honors are usually bestowed by the British ambassador in their
country.
	   The New Year's Honors List of 1,000 names of the famous and the
humble singles out for commendation many who played roles in the
turning point in Northern Ireland's history.
	   The government offered honors to individuals in Northern
Ireland's ``nationalist'' community who seek to break ties with
Britain, but the honors were declined, the government said.
	   ``We completely understand that,'' a Downing Street spokesman
said.
	   He would not say who they were or to which parties they
belonged, but added that ``the individuals concerned were those who
worked hardest for the victory of peace over violence in Northern
Ireland.''
	   ``We have drawn attention to the fact that some nationalists
have turned down honors because we did not want the people of
Northern Ireland to think that only one side had been honored for
their role in the peace process.''
	   There were honors, too, for police, medical staff and local
officials in Omagh, Northern Ireland, for their work after the Aug.
15 bomb that killed 29 people and wounded 370.
	   There is also a knighthood for Ronnie Flanagan, the chief
constable of Northern Ireland's Royal Ulster Constabulary.
	   Gareth Peirce, a lawyer who helped win the release in 1989 of
the Irish ``Guildford Four'' who were wrongly convicted of Irish
Republican Army offenses, gets a CBE, of Commander of the Order of
British Empire.
	   Honors were distributed to people in all walks of life.
	   Actor Nigel Hawthorne, who played the king in ``The Madness of
King George,'' becomes a knight _ just like Sir Humphrey Appleby,
the character he played in the popular television series ``Yes,
Minister.''
	   Robert Carlyle, who has acieved recent fame in the movies
``Trainspotting'' and ``The Full Monty,'' is made an OBE, or
Officer of the Order of British Empire _ one notch below the CBE
award.
	   Pop music veterans Tom Jones and Dusty Springfield also get
OBEs, and actor Roger Moore gets a CBE for his work on behalf of
UNICEF, the United Nations children's fund.
	   Actress and comedian Maureen Lipmann, one of Britain's most
popular television and stage performers, wins a CBE.
	   Conductor Andrew Davis received a knighthood, and playwright
Ronald Harwood _ author of ``The Dresser'' and ``Poison Pen,'' gets
a CBE.
	   Duncan Kenworthy, producer of the hit movie ``Four Weddings and
a Funeral,'' also receives an OBE.

Man described as pervert arrested childrens' murders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Authorities have arrested a man in
connection with what they described as a ``psychotic, sexual
maniac'' in connection with the murders of dozens of children whose
remains were found last month.
	   ``We may be looking at one of those responsible in the case of
the disappearances and deaths of the children of Pereira,'' Pedro
Gonzalez, chief investigator of the federal prosecutor's office
told a news conference on Wednesday.
	   The skeletons and decomposing corpses of 25 children were
discovered in November at the bottom of a ravine and scattered
about a city lot in the state capital, located 110 miles (175
kilometers) west of Bogota.
	   Gonzalez identified the man captured Dec. 16, in Pereira by two
names, Pedro Pablo Ramirez or Carlos Alberto Arboleda, and
described him as a prior sexual offender.
	   Investigators have linked the man to at least two killing of
children in Pereira, and possibly those of three other children,
Gonzalez said. ``We can't attribute all of the cases to this
person, and we have to continue the investigation,'' he said.
	   Investigators had ruled out early theories that the murders were
the work of a satanic cult or linked to the sale of organs.
	   ``It was a depraved, psychotic, sexual maniac who does these
things because he has sexual abnormalities,'' said Gonzalez.

IOC VP meets with Salt Lake officials
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KIMBERLEY MURPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ International Olympic Committee vice
president Richard Pound said he came to get a first-hand look at
the evidence surrounding purported bribes of Salt Lake Olympic
officials.
	   ``I've seen summaries of what they had,'' Pound told the Deseret
News on Wednesday. ``That's one thing, but it's not as useful as
seeing what the actual records look like.''
	   Pound completed a two-day visit Wednesday and then left town
without issuing a statement on information concerning the bid
process that brought the 2002 Olympic Winter Games to Utah. He was
looking for information to be included in an IOC report on the
matter.
	   The commission Pound heads was expected to submit a report to
the IOC executive board on Jan. 24 at Lausanne, Switzerland. But
IOC director general Francois Carrard, coordinator of the
investigation, said Wednesday the Salt Lake inquiry may take more
time.
	   ``I don't know whether we will have a final report on Jan. 23,''
he said in a telephone interview from IOC headquarters. ``I'm sure
there will be a progress report, but it may not be the final
stage.''
	   Meanwhile, a former employee of the Salt Lake bid committee said
Wednesday that members of the Olympic family openly accepted gifts
for years.
	   Salt Lake Olympic officials have admitted having a dlrs 400,000
scholarship fund that benefited 13 recipients, including six
relatives of IOC members. IOC members also were given thousands of
dollars worth of guns and skis and some received free medical
treatments, including plastic surgery.
	   Robert Hunter, who worked as the Salt Lake bid committee's head
of communications for two years and with the Salt Lake Organizing
Committee for another two before leaving last June, told the
Standard-Examiner of Ogden that such gift-giving seemed to be
common practice.
	   ``Just about all IOC members came here and they've all benefited
from gifts that exceeded whatever the rule was,'' said Hunter, who
added that he saw nothing wrong with the practice. ``All of our
guests were treated very, very well.''
	   ``You do it and it's fun and out of it you see people come
together,'' he said. ``But there was never any clandestine plan and
everybody saw what we were doing for years.''
	   Shelley Thomas, SLOC senior vice president of communications,
said she wasn't part of Pound's information-gathering session and
didn't know who was interviewed by the Canadian executive. She also
said Pound, a lawyer from Montreal, would make no additional
statements.
	   In the interview with the Deseret News, Pound said he wanted to
hear SLOC's side of the story and planned to conduct interviews
before leaving Wednesday afternoon.
	   ``One of the things we're going to have to do is get
explanations for some of the things we've found,'' Pound said. ``We
do have to be careful we don't `Ready, aim, fire.'''
	   He said that while SLOC officials were being cooperative, some
of the documents he wanted to review were not available.
	   ``It was kind of a rush job for them,'' Pound said. ``I haven't
got it all. So far, what they've found seems to support their
general recollections.''
	   Thomas said Pound spent most of the day on Wednesday in a
conference room and did not break for lunch. She did not know what
materials or documents Pound was reviewing, but noted that
employees were asked to retrieve bid documents.
	   ``All we're doing is answering requests and answering fully any
questions,'' Thomas said Wednesday. ``He is keeping his own
schedule.''
	   Frank Zang, SLOC director of communications, said a lawyer from
the Los Angeles law firm of O'Melveny and Myers, which the IOC
panel has hired to represent it in the investigation, also was
present at Salt Lake Olympic offices on Wednesday.
	   The IOC inquiry is one of four into the Salt Lake bid. Also
investigating are the Justice Department, the U.S. Olympic
Committee and the Salt Lake organizing committee's ethics board.
	   A U.S. Olympic Committee panel headed by former Maine Sen.
George Mitchell began its investigation on Tuesday in Washington,
D.C., and is planning to issue its report to the USOC by Feb. 28.

	   A summary of news from The Associated Press. Some items have
moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f'' category
codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. missiles blasted an Iraqi anti-aircraft
site after Iraq fired Wednesday on British patrols of a no-fly
zone, the U.S. government announced. Iraq said the attack killed a
farmer and wounded two other civilians, although a U.S. official
questioned that claim. Meanwhile, the Pentagon said it is going
ahead with a draw-down of forces from the Gulf despite the second
try in three days by Iraq to shoot down Western jets. After the
attack, the Pentagon said it would continue with a reduction of
troops, aircraft and ships in the Gulf that took part in a
mid-December attack on Iraq. The USS Enterprise carrier group is
set to depart for the Mediterranean by week's end. (US-IRAQ)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Technology deals with China, including use of
Chinese missiles to launch U.S. satellites, have harmed national
security, a U.S. legislative committee concluded unanimously
Wednesday in a report critical of dealings over two decades.
``These transfers are not limited to missile (and) satellite
technology, but cover militarily significant technology,'' said
Rep. Christopher Cox, chairman of a special House committee
investigating military and commercial deals with China. The report,
approved by the House committee in a closed-door session, was not
released because much of it is classified. The select committee of
five Republicans and four Democrats began with an inquiry into
President Bill Clinton's administration's satellite export dealings
with China and whether the administration's actions compromised
security or were influenced by campaign contributions. (US-CONGRESS
CHINA)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ With its customary horse-trading and dirty
back-room deals, Israeli politics was never for the squeamish. But
the new political style emerging in the campaign for the May 17
election is putting off even the most cynical voters. In a dizzying
merry-go-round and with nary a word about substance, politicians
are jumping from party to party in hopes of latching on to the
candidate with the best chances of becoming prime minister. One
party reportedly plans to rank its candidates based on who scores
highest in the polls. Stories about politics read like gossip
columns, with detailed accounts of secret assignations between
party bosses and would-be defectors. ``There is no more ideology,''
complained Benny Piro, a 60-year-old Jerusalem building supervisor,
as he and other voters wearily started the countdown to the end of
the 138-day campaign. (ISRAEL-NEW POLITICS)
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Rebel forces on Wednesday launched an
hour-long artillery bombardment of Huambo, the country's
second-largest city and a base for U.N. and aid agency staff,
according to reports. Five civilians were killed and three were
injured, the army said. Some shells landed in downtown areas of the
central highland city which lies about 500 kilometers (300 miles)
southeast of the capital, Luanda, state radio RNA reported from
Huambo. The explosions reportedly began at noon and caused panic
among local people in the government-held city which the army is
using as a base to fly in reinforcements for fighting in
surrounding areas. Before the civil war restarted Dec. 4 Huambo had
a population of about 300,000, but tens of thousands of refugees
fleeing fighting in the countryside have converged on the city in
recent weeks. The U.N. and International Committee of the Red Cross
headquarters in Luanda both said they had received no reports of
injuries to their staff in Huambo. (ANGOLA)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Senate's Republican and Democratic leaders
on Wednesday discussed presenting to their colleagues a plan to
start a trial of President Bill Clinton and permit a censure vote
if conviction appeared unlikely. Friends of Kenneth Starr also
signaled the prosecutor might consider a deal. A Senate leadership
source, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said there was no
firm agreement between Majority Leader Trent Lott and Democratic
leader Tom Daschle, but both appeared amenable to presenting the
idea to their colleagues when the new Congress is sworn in on Jan.
6. The two leaders previously discussed a tentative trial schedule
that would begin evidence presentations Jan. 11 and wrap up by
month's end. Chief Justice William Rehnquist would preside and
House prosecutors would present the charges that the president
committed perjury before a grand jury and obstructed justice.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Blue-chip stocks pulled back Wednesday, halting
the Dow's eight-session winning streak, but smaller-company shares
perked up as Wall Street remained mired in a pre-New Year's
slumber. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 46.34 points _ or
0.5 percent _ to 9,274.64, almost exactly 100 points below the Nov.
23 record of 9,374.27. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Europe's dream of monetary union
becomes reality Thursday when 11 nations irrevocably lock their
currencies together to form the euro and create an economic giant
whose boundaries stretch from beyond the Arctic Circle to the
shores of the Mediterranean. The euro's birth is being hailed as a
historic turning point in international finance and is arguably the
greatest single step in the drive to create a united Europe from
the ruins of World War II. On what Europeans are calling ``E-day,''
economic and finance ministers from the 11 nations will huddle at
European Union headquarters to agree the rates at which German
marks, French francs and the rest are absorbed into euro. (THE
EURO)
	   PARIS (AP) _ Wim Duisenberg, the head of the new European
Central Bank, said in an interview published Wednesday that he
won't step down after completing half his term as earlier agreed.
``I had hoped you wouldn't ask me that question. The answer is
no,'' Duisenberg told the Le Monde daily, which had asked him if he
would step down after four years on the job. Duisenberg was named
this spring as head of the new European Central Bank, which will
govern the policies of the euro, the new single currency which goes
into effect Jan. 1. France surprised its euro partners by proposing
its central banker, Jean-Claude Trichet, at the last minute for the
job Duisenberg was expected to secure easily. (FRANCE-EURO)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A key measure of future economic activity rose
sharply in November as the stock market boomed, exceeding
expectations and providing signs of optimism for the U.S. economy
heading into 1999. The Conference Board, a private research group,
reported Wednesday its Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose
0.6 percent to 106.3, up from an adjusted level of 105.7 in
October. Economists had projected a smaller gain. With the
economy's long expansion generally expected to slow next year, the
leading index offered a burst of optimism for the new year. The
index is designed to forecast economic activity six to nine months
in advance. Economists said the leading index reading was
encouraging but does not alter their forecasts for a slowdown in
economic growth next year. (US-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has dipped deeply into its hard currency
reserves in the past three weeks to pay its foreign debts, the
Central Bank chairman said Wednesday. Despite that, the country
effectively defaulted on a major debt Tuesday, and Western
creditors were meeting in London to decide what to do about it.
Viktor Gerashchenko, the Central Bank chairman, said in a live
television interview that the bank's hard currency reserves were
down to dlrs 11 billion, about dlrs 1 billion less than on Dec. 11.
``The Central Bank had to pay off the government debts to avoid
default,'' he said. Nevertheless, Russia failed Tuesday to make a
dlrs 363 million cash payment on dlrs 26 billion worth of loans
that Moscow must repay to the London Club of commercial creditors.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ British Petroleum Co. and Amoco Corp. said
they will complete their dlrs 53 billion merger Thursday, after
winning regulatory approval from the Federal Trade Commission. The
FTC said Wednesday it voted 4-0 to approve the deal after the
companies agreed to address antitrust concerns by selling 134
gasoline stations and nine petroleum terminals in the United
States. They also agreed to give owners of more than 1,600 gasoline
stations in 30 cities permission to end their contracts. FTC
Chairman Robert Pitofsky said the agency was satisfied that ``the
operations of these two companies rarely overlap in a way that
threatens competition.'' Formal FTC approval becomes final after a
60-day comment period. (US-BP-AMOCO MERGER)
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Avoiding a crisis with just 36 hours to
spare, Mexican legislators ended weeks of deadlock and reached a
compromise Wednesday on the 1999 budget. The Mexican government had
faced the prospect of beginning the new year without a budget _ an
unprecedented event in Mexican history. Officials didn't know if
they'd be able to keep the government operating without a budget.
Legislators were stalled over a dlrs 2.86 billion shortfall,
largely the result of falling oil prices. Oil makes up about a
third of the Mexican government's revenue. (MEXICO-BUDGET)

	   NUREMBERG, Germany (AP) _ German actress Elke Sommer won the
latest round Wednesday in a long-running dispute with Zsa Zsa Gabor
and her German husband, Prince Frederic von Anhalt.
	   A Bavarian court rejected an appeal from the prince, who had
been ordered by a lower court to stop telling people that Ms.
Sommer had once called all German men ``pigs.''
	   But since Ms. Sommer could not definitively prove that she had
not made the statement, the court did not order von Anhalt to make
a full retraction.
	   The three have been fighting for years. According to Ms. Sommer,
there has been bad blood ever since she said Ms. Gabor had a big
rear end.
	   In 1992, a Los Angeles jury ordered the Hungarian-born Ms. Gabor
and von Anhalt, her eighth husband, to pay Ms. Sommer dlrs 2.5
million for describing her as a haggard Hollywood has-been.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   ST. PAUL, Minnesota (AP) _ Having a former Navy special forces
commando as Minnesota's governor-elect seems to have had a powerful
effect on military recruiting in the state.
	   On Dec. 10, the Minnesota National Guard mailed 62,000 brochures
featuring a snapshot of Gov.-elect Jesse Ventura to high school
juniors. Recruiters have gotten more than twice as many replies as
usual.
	   ``He is someone people can recognize and become interested in,
and if he can help us recruit people into the National Guard,
that's great,'' said Maj. Kevin Gutknecht, a National Guard
spokesman.
	   Ventura, 47, a former professional wrestler, joined the Navy in
1969 and became a member of a SEAL underwater demolition team,
serving in the Vietnam War.
	   Since his election as governor, other state agencies and
organizations have asked him whether they could use him in their
advertisements.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ A heroin addict who held up fast-food
joints to feed his habit had an unlikely accomplice -- his
76-year-old mother, who says she went along to look after him.
	   Police in Barcelona arrested the duo Sunday after the
42-year-old man robbed a sandwich shop at gunpoint and attempted a
slow getaway on foot with his mother, news reports say.
	   The woman confessed to accompanying him on several such holdups
``so he would not do anything bad,'' the newspaper El Pais
reported.
	   In Sunday's incident, the two had a meal in a fast-food
restaurant, after which the woman waited outside while her son
robbed it with the aid of a .38-caliber Smith and Wesson pistol.
	   The woman told police that in the past she had gone by herself
to rough neighborhoods to buy heroin for her son.
	   Officials did not identify the woman or her son.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A man who coaxed thousands of dollars
out of Romanian companies by evoking the name of a hero of the 1989
revolution has been arrested for suspected fraud, police said
Wednesday.
	   Catalin Alistar, 23, has been obtaining money and free services
for two years from companies that thought they were dealing with
the ``Gavroche'' of revolution fame, officer Mariana Apostol said.
	   The real Gavroche is Florin Vieru. Only a child during the
events that toppled communism, Vieru marched on the streets of the
capital waving a revolutionary flag. His picture appeared in the
media worldwide. He is now a taxi driver.
	   Alistar used to call managers of different companies pretending
to be a state secretary and saying someone nicknamed Gavroche would
come on his behalf to collect.
	   He has admitted misleading even the Moldovan Interior Ministry,
which arranged for his accommodations and gave him presents during
a visit last year.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   MALAGA, Spain (AP) _ Police who smelled a rat when they saw two
men fishing with no reels or line found more than a ton of hashish
hidden nearby.
	   The two fake anglers were arrested Tuesday on a cliff
overlooking the Mediterranean near the town of Lagos in southern
Malaga province, the state news agency Efe reported.
	   The men, who had fishing rods with no reels or line, were
apparently guarding a drug shipment hidden at the foot of the
cliff. Police found 37 bails containing a total of 1,200 kilos
(2,640 pounds) of hashish.
	   Firemen used ropes and pulleys to retrieve the drugs.

	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ A video camera stolen from members
of the English cricket supporters' Barmy Army has been recovered by
detectives at a pawn shop and was returned Thursday to its grateful
owner.
	   The camera, which contained footage of the English cricket fans
following their team all over the world, was stolen from a
Melbourne hotel where the four fans were staying.
	   They were in Melbourne for the fourth cricket test between
England and Australia.
	   The camera was recovered by Dealers Squad detectives at a pawn
shop on Tuesday. A detective saw the camera in a bag, checked the
film and recognized the Barmy Army t-shirts with their distinctive
Union Jacks. (djp)

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Prosecutors have charged a fourth
man in an alleged fraud scheme in Puerto Rico following Hurricane
Georges, the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Juan said Wednesday.
	   Prosecutors claim Marcos Gonzalez Reyes worked with another
contractor, Jose Orlando Figueroa, to inflate reports of debris
left by the hurricane.
	   The fraudulent reports were submitted the Federal Emergency
Management Agency in order to get more disaster funds for the city
of Toa Alta, prosecutors say.
	   They also allege he prepared blank documents and work reports
for a city worker to fill out and submit to the agency.
	   Gonzalez Reyes faces a maximum of 10 years in jail, a dlrs
250,000 fine and three years of probation on a charge of conspiring
to defraud the United States.
	   Figueroa and Toa Alta Mayor Angel Rodriguez were charged in
November with exaggerating hurricane damage and demanding dlrs 2.5
million in bribes from a Mississippi-based company, JESCO, in
exchange for a contract to collect debris.
	   Rodriguez and Figueroa have pleaded innocent to conspiracy,
extortion and bribery indictments.
	   Another contractor, Luis A. Rodriguez Sierra, was charged Dec.
15 with inflating damage estimates.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Inmates who held 19 hostages at gunpoint
after a failed Christmas Day escape attempt had bought their
weapons from a guard, officials said.
	   The guard, identified as Rodolfo Sanchez Morales, sold three
pistols, a rifle and a hand grenade, to the inmates at the
Reclusorio Sur prison for dlrs 4,500, the Mexico City attorney
general's office said in a statement Tuesday.
	   A prisoner, Carlos Angel Ferrat Garcia, said they had bought the
weapons in October, the statement said.
	   Sanchez Morales has been ordered under house arrest. Another
guard is under investigation.
	   Five inmates held the hostages for more than 20 hours after the
escape failed. No one was seriously injured. Officials previously
said four inmates had been involved in the hostage-taking.
	   ___
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Venezuelan President-elect Hugo Chavez
exchanged pleasantries with a senior U.S. official Wednesday in
what appeared to be an attempt by Washington to ease tensions with
the former coup leader, barred from the United States until last
week.
	   Assistant secretary of state for InterAmerican affairs Peter
Romero told reporters after meeting Chavez in Caracas that the
United States intends ``to be partners in every sense'' with
Venezuela.
	   Chavez, who tried to overthrow Venezuela's government in a
bloody 1992 coup attempt, won a landslide victory in Dec. 6
elections and will be sworn in as president on Feb. 2.
	   After their meeting, Chavez said the two countries will seek to
bolster bilateral efforts to fight corruption and drug trafficking.
	   Last week, Washington reversed its policy of denying Chavez a
visa. The new leader is expected to visit the United States in
early 1999.
	   The United States and Venezuela recently completed negotiations
on a bilateral treaty to avoid double taxation and are currently
trying to devise a treaty to protect investments.
	   Venezuela's is the No. 1 exporter of oil to the United States.
	   ___
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ The Brazilian government announced a
series of measures Wednesday intended to shore-up the country's
fiscal situation and meet savings goals established in an agreement
with the International Monetary Fund.
	   The measures, which are expected to yield 5.4 billion reals
(dlrs 4.5 billion) next year, will eliminate interest deductions on
certain corporate taxes, speed up payment for recently privatized
telephone companies and raise a financial transactions tax by 0.38
percentage points.
	   The measures were needed to compensate for the revenues lost
after Congress failed to pass the CPMF, a tax on all banking
transactions, and other key points of the fiscal stabilization plan
released last October. The ministry estimates those losses at 6.7
billion reals (dlrs 5.5 billion) in 1999.
	   Another 1.3 billion reals (dlrs 1.08 billion) in budget cuts
will be announced at a later date.
	   In October, the government announced plans to save the 28
billion reals (dlrs 23.3 billion) from next year's budget. The plan
formed the basis of an agreement for an IMF-lead bailout package
worth dlrs 41.5 billion, of which about 9 billion has been released
so far.
	   ___
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ A local newspaper is accusing
Grenada's government of corruption, saying an audit shows kickbacks
and conflicts of interest in public construction projects.
	   In this week's edition, the independent Grenada Today claims the
government gave contracts to allies of Prime Minister Keith
Mitchell and that one senator is renting a house to contractors
working on government projects at a hugely inflated price.
	   It also accuses the Carnival and Cultural Development Committee
of arranging kickbacks on contracts.
	   Prime Minister Keith Mitchell has denied all of the accusations.
	   ``The NNP and its agents have turned out to be the most corrupt
government to hold the reigns of power in Grenada since the return
of democratic government in 1984,'' the newspaper said.
	   An audit by KPMG Peat Marwick showed overspending and violations
of public bid procedures, but did not touch upon questions of
wrongdoing.

	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Guyana said Wednesday it is waiting
for an explanation from Venezuela before complaining to United
Nations supervisors about an alleged overflight by warplanes along
a disputed border.
	   The United Nations is overseeing efforts to resolve a
100-year-old border dispute in that area. Guyanese Foreign Minister
Clement Rohee said he wants to talk to Venezuelan officials about
the alleged violation on Dec. 24 before complaining to the
international body.
	   ``We are not on a war footing and we would prefer always to work
through the diplomatic channels,'' Rohee said. ``I don't think we
need to rush to the United Nations with very limited information.''
	   The Guyanese army reported last week that two military jets flew
over northwestern Guyana without permission.
	   Venezuela has not responded to the charges. On Wednesday,
officials at the Venezuelan foreign affairs department left work
early because of the New Year's holiday and could not be reached
for comment.
	   Venezuela claims two-thirds of Guyana, a country rich in timber,
minerals, gold and oil. Guyana also has a running territorial
dispute with Suriname, its neighbor to the east.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Europe's dream of monetary union
becomes reality Thursday when 11 nations irrevocably lock their
currencies together to form the euro and create an economic giant
whose boundaries stretch from beyond the Arctic Circle to the
shores of the Mediterranean.
	   The euro's birth is being hailed as a historic turning point in
international finance and is arguably the greatest single step in
the drive to create a united Europe from the ruins of World War II.
	   On what Europeans are calling ``E-day,'' economic and finance
ministers from the 11 nations will huddle at European Union
headquarters to agree to the rates at which German marks, French
francs and the rest are absorbed into euro.
	   There will be solemn speeches and champagne, then schoolchildren
will release thousands of blue balloons bearing the ``e'' symbol
which may soon become as familiar as the dollar sign.
	   The euro will formally come into existence at midnight on New
Year's Eve. It will be worth about dlrs 1.17.
	   As the euro-balloons float into the skies above Brussels,
employees at banks, stock exchanges and other financial
institutions around Europe will start a race-against-time to adapt
computer systems and convert countless financial holdings _ from
Dutch government bonds, to Italian shares and Finnish bank accounts
_ into euros before markets reopen Monday after the long holiday
weekend.
	   ``It is a major logistical effort. We have catering facilities.
We have booked hundreds of hotel rooms. We have hired mini buses,''
said Vendeline Von Bredow, euro project manager at Merrill Lynch.
	   After Thursday, the old currencies will no longer be traded in
foreign exchange markets around the world. Stocks and bonds will be
quoted in euros. The euro will increasingly be used for bank
transactions, business deals and public finances.
	   The European Central Bank will set a common interest rate of 3
percent for all 11 nations. For the first time in decades the U.S.
dollar will have a rival as the world's reference currency.
	   Euro cash will only be issued to replace the old coins and
banknotes in early 2002. Until then, the euro will only be used for
non-cash transactions.
	   Consumers will see prices marked in euros making it easier to
shop across frontiers and they'll be able to buy in euros using
checks or credit cards. But they'll still have to change money for
cross-border cash purchases.
	   Citizens will start to see euro figures alongside national
currencies on pay checks, phone bills and bank statements. On
Wednesday, winners of the French and Irish national lotteries will
have their prizes announced in euros.
	   French Riviera flower sellers, Belgian supermarkets and trendy
Viennese cafes where among businesses who jumped the gun and began
posting euro prices before the official launch.
	   In the Eurotempo store selling souvenirs in the shadow of the
EU's Brussels headquarters, there was a brisk trade in pocket
calculators programed to convert to and from euros.
	   ``It's a real success, people have been buying up dozens at a
time to offer as gifts,'' said sales assistant Isabel Fernandez.
The store's shelves also contained neckties and alarm clocks
adorned with the euro symbol, and chocolate euro coins.
	   Plans to forge a common European currency date back to the
1960s, but only after then German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and late
French President Francois Mitterrand threw their weight behind the
project in the late 1980s did Economic and Monetary Union, or EMU,
take flight.
	   Supporters say euro-zone's 290 million people will give European
companies a huge, secure home market like that of their American
rivals. Exchange-rate costs and currency fluctuations within the
euro zone will disappear.
	   Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium,
Austria, Portugal, Finland, Ireland and Luxembourg will join the
euro, hoping their combined economic weight will give Europe a
greater voice in world affairs.
	   For some, the price to pay was too great.
	   Britain, Denmark and Sweden opted out of the euro because of
public anxiety that dropping the national currency means giving up
too much independence. Greece failed to meet economic conditions
for joining but hopes to be in by 2001.

Angolan rebels bombard second-largest city

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Rebels in Angola bombarded the country's
second-largest city for an hour Wednesday, killing five people and
injuring three others, the army said.
	   Artillery shells landed in downtown areas of the central
highland city of Huambo, about 300 miles (480 kilometers) southeast
of the capital, Luanda, state radio RNA reported from Huambo.
	   The explosions reportedly began at noon and caused panic among
residents in the government-held city, which the army is using as a
base to fly in reinforcements for fighting in surrounding areas.
The city is also a base for United Nations and aid agency staff.
	   Before the civil war restarted Dec. 4, Huambo had a population
of about 300,000, but tens of thousands of refugees fleeing
fighting in the countryside have converged on the city in recent
weeks.
	   President Jose Eduardo dos Santos ruled out talks with the rebel
group UNITA on ending the fighting, and said rebel leader Jonas
Savimbi was a liar for not complying with a 1994 peace pact.
	   Dos Santos said in a speech broadcast on state radio RNA late
Tuesday that the army had given ``the correct response'' to UNITA's
failure to heed the terms of the United Nations-brokered peace
accord.
	   The United Nations and the International Committee of the Red
Cross headquarters in Luanda said there were no reports of injuries
to staff in Huambo.
	   However, Red Cross spokeswoman Francoise Zambelini said a
scheduled aid flight to the city was canceled because the warring
factions didn't guarantee safe passage.
	   With fighting having resumed between the Angolan government and
UNITA rebels, the United Nations is faced with the decision of
whether to pull out some 1,000 troops in a force overseeing a 1994
peace treaty between the two sides.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan has until Jan. 15 to decide, and
U.N. diplomats say he may recommend the Security Council consider
withdrawing the U.N. Observer Mission.
	   A cargo plane crashed near Huambo on Saturday with eight U.N.
peacekeepers and six others on board. The cause of the crash, as
the plane passed over the war zone, is not yet known.
	   Meanwhile, artillery shells also were landing sporadically in
Kuito, 80 miles (130 kilometers) east of Huambo, which has been
under a rebel siege for more than two weeks, said the city's Roman
Catholic Bishop, Jose Nambi. Most shells targeted Kuito's airport.
	   The U.N. Security Council has blamed UNITA, a Portuguese acronym
for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, for
the return to war.
	   UNITA refused to yield control of areas under its control and
maintained a hidden army, according to the United Nations. The
fighting renewed when the government tried to take the strongholds
by force and was beaten back.
	   Dos Santos indicated that he will not yield to international
pressure to call off the army offensive against rebel strongholds
in the central highlands which began Dec. 4.
	   The government ``will never again accept the demands from
outside the country to give ... one more chance to the liars who
have demonstrated that they are unable to accept differences of
opinion within the framework of peace and democracy,'' he said.
	   The country has been ravaged by conflict since gaining
independence from Portugal in 1975. A 1991 peace deal collapsed the
following year when UNITA rejected its defeat in the country's
first democratic elections.

	   ALICE SPRINGS, Australia (AP) _ Engineers made final adjustments
Thursday to a massive, experimental balloon designed to carry three
men to record heights and hopefully nonstop around the world.
	   After delays caused by bad weather and equipment delivery
problems, the spaceship-like capsule which Denver real estate
magnate Dave Liniger and two copilots plan to fly at the edge of
space was lifted free of the earth by a crane for weight and safety
checks.
	   Engineers and scientists worked late into Wednesday night after
a weight distribution problem was found in the six steel cables
which will connect the giant and super-fragile balloon canopy with
the capsule upon which the pilots' lives will depend.
	   Some of the cables were overstressed and others were slack and
not taking enough weight.
	   Dan Pedersen, the former U.S. Navy captain and test fighter
pilot who is Liniger's mission control director, said after more
tests that the problem could be solved by modifying the capsule.
	   A 12-inch goanna _ the Aboriginal word for a type of lizard
considered good eating _ scrambled across the concrete driveway
outside the garage-like Australian Balloon Launch Center Wednesday
as more than 60 people continued final preparations for the Team
Re/Max International bid to be the first to fly around the world in
a balloon.
	   Temperatures soared to almost 100 F (38 Celsius) as winds strong
enough to make a launch too dangerous continued to buffet the
desert launch zone near the Outback town of Alice Springs.
	   Team members packaged the food and water the pilots will take,
and electronics panels were screwed together and installed.
	   The team's own forecasters say weather conditions are looking
good for a dawn takeoff on New Year's Day local time (1930 GMT Dec.
31). If the forecast changes, the launch could be delayed further.
	   Until launch, the team were ``checking and rechecking every
circuit, every life support component,'' of the capsule, the
balloon and the radio guidance systems which will remain on the
ground, Liniger said.
	   The Re/Max pilots _ Liniger, Albuquerque, New Mexico, journalist
Bob Martin and Australian balloonist John Wallington _ expect to
succeed with other attempts have failed by flying just this side of
space, where weather is not expected to be a factor.
	   The 7-ft. by 8-ft. (2.1-meter by 2.4-meter) capsule will hang
below a balloon made of lunchwrap-thin polyethylene plastic that
when fully inflated is 460 feet (138 meters) in diameter and 700
feet (210 meters) high _ large enough to envelope the Houston
Astrodome or two 747 jet liners nose-to-nose.
	   They will rise 1,000 feet (300 meters) a minute during takeoff,
expanding the balloon on the way up with 170,000 cubic ft. (5,100
cubic meters) of helium, rising into the stratosphere to a cruising
altitude of 130,000 feet (39,000 meters), or about 24 miles (39
kilometers) above sea level.
	   That's higher than any manned balloon flight before.
	   ``There's no question that it's more dangerous than the other
missions,'' Liniger said, comparing his first attempt to the more
than a dozen others which have previously failed, using more
conventional balloons at altitudes not exceeding 40,000 feet
(12,000 meters).
	   ``The other people, if they get in trouble they can slowly go
down and sit down in the ocean. If we get into trouble, we're 25
miles (40 kilometers) up.''

Institute on 1956 uprising latest victim of Hungary budget cuts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEX BANDY &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ He took on the communist regime in open
debate and got jailed for his views. Now, Andras B. Hegedues' hopes
for detailing Hungary's 1956 revolution against the Soviets may
fall victim to politics in the democratic era.
	   Despite the protests of international researchers and others,
new Prime Minister Viktor Orban has axed the budget of a well-known
institute devoted to researching the 1956 Hungarian revolution.
	   Founded in 1990 after the collapse of Hungary's communist
government, the 1956 Institute is still working to reveal hidden
truths about events the communists vilified for decades.
	   ``We had no hint of trouble ahead, much less any decent
consultation,'' said Hegedues, the institute's executive director
and a former leader of the Petoefi Circle, which organized the
first free debates east of the Iron Curtain in 1956.
	   The government's proposed 1999 budget initially included 73
million forints (dlrs 365,000) for the institute. But a decision
was made to cut it to 6 million forints (dlrs 30,000), which could
prove the institute's death knell.
	   The institute's goal is to publicize the truth about the
uprising against communist rule which exploded in Budapest in
October 1956. The Soviets, fearful the unrest could spread
throughout Eastern Europe, launched a massive attack on Budapest on
Nov. 4, 1956, using tens of thousands of troops and more than 2,000
tanks.
	   About 200,000 Hungarians fled the country. Thousands of others
were arrested, including Premier Imre Nagy who was executed in
1958.
	   Szilard Sasvari, head of the House cultural committee and a
founding member of Orban's party, denies any political motivation
behind the funding decision despite strong appearances to the
contrary. He said this week it was made because ``they are not
alone in researching the 1956 events.''
	   ``There will be a new foundation and they can participate in
competitions for project funding,'' he said.
	   He also said an audit of the institute's finances turned up
irregularities, without elaborating.
	   But Hegedues denies that, saying a government audit cleared the
institute of wrongdoing. He and others suggest another motive:
co-director Gyoergy Litvan is on the National Steering Committee of
the liberal opposition party, the Alliance of Free Democrats.
	   ``The institute ought to be judged on the basis of its work,
which include 57 volumes on various aspects and personalities of
the revolt,'' he said.
	   Letters of support have poured in since word of the funding cut
got out, among them such internationally recognized names as
British author Timothy Garton-Ash, American Kremlinologist Charles
Gati and Joachim Gauck, in charge of East German secret police
archives.
	   But the effort may be in vain. Sasvari said most of the money
originally earmarked for the institute will go toward funding a new
agency to be organized by historians Gyula Teller and Maria Schmidt
_ both advisers to Orban.

Man described as sexual maniac arrested in childrens' murders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs, CORRECTS prosecutors possibly linking to three
sted four possible other victims &QL; 
 &UR; By JARED KOTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Authorities have arrested a man they
describe as a ``psychotic, sexual maniac'' in connection with the
murders of dozens of children whose remains were found last month.
	   ``We may be looking at one of those responsible in the case of
the disappearances and deaths of the children of Pereira,'' Pedro
Gonzalez, chief investigator of the federal prosecutor's office
told a news conference on Wednesday.
	   The skeletons and decomposing corpses of 25 children were
discovered at the bottom of a ravine and scattered about an
overgrown city lot in the Pereira, a state capital located 110
miles (175 kilometers) west of Bogota.
	   The oldest of the victims was 16 and at least half were 10 or
younger. Their bodies were sighted in two searches after workers
spotted what they thought were animal bones in the ravine, and
after a child stumbled on a skull in the empty lot.
	   Gonzalez identified the man captured Dec. 16 in Pereira by two
names, Pedro Pablo Ramirez and Carlos Alberto Arboleda, and said he
had previously been imprisoned for sexual crimes.
	   Officials described the man as short and dark, with green eyes,
brown hair and poor teeth. They said he works as a street vendor,
selling hot food, honey, fruit and bracelets.
	   Investigators have linked the man to the killings of at least
three children in Pereira, and possibly three other children in the
nearby city of Armenia, Gonzalez said.
	   They were ruling out theories floated originally that the
murders were the work of a satanic cult or linked to the
trafficking of organs. ``It was a depraved, psychotic, sexual
maniac who does these things because he has sexual abnormalities,''
said Gonzalez.
	   The capture was said to be part of a broad probe into 80 similar
murders committed in the past few years in Pereira and other cities
in western and southern Colombia. ``We can't attribute all of the
cases to this person, and we have to continue the investigation,''
said Gonzalez.

The Euro: What will it be worth? How will it be used?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With The-Euro &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Some common questions and answers about the euro:
	   Q. How much will a euro be worth?
	   A. The exact value of the euro will be set Jan. 1. It is
expected to be slightly stronger than the dollar, around dlrs 1.10
to dlrs 1.20 to a euro.
	   Q. What will happen when the euro is launched?
	   A. The euro becomes the official currency in the 11 nations.
That means stock exchanges will trade in euros and large businesses
will keep track of finances in the euro. However, euro notes and
coins won't enter circulation until 2002. To ease the transition,
bank customers can keep accounts in euros _ alongside national
currencies _ starting Jan. 1.
	   Q. Will travelers from outside the 11-nation euro bloc need
euros notes, coins or travelers' checks after Jan. 1?
	   A. No. Euro notes and coins won't be available until 2002. For
now, the local currency is still good. Travelers checks will be
available in euros, but aren't a must.
	   Q. Will there be any effect on the dollar?
	   A. That's not yet known. No sudden challenge is expected
although the euro eventually could challenge the dollar as the
international currency of choice.
	   Q. Who outside the 11 countries will be affected?
	   A. Managers at firms that buy or sell in Europe or have
subsidiaries there.
	   Q. What are the advantages for business of the euro?
	   A. The size of the new currency bloc _ with 290 million
inhabitants _ will provide a stable economic and business
environment. Businesses will save money; the costs of changing
currencies from country to country will be sharply reduced.
Comparing prices will be quicker and interest rates will stabilize.
All this will make long-term planning easier.
	   Q. What are the advantages for ordinary consumers?
	   A. Residents of the euro countries also will benefit from it
being easier to compare prices across borders, and they won't have
to change money within the bloc. Tourists, too, can avoid costly
commissions as they move across Europe.
	   Q. Why did the countries choose to give up their national
currencies?
	   A. The original idea was developed shortly after the end of
World War II. The goal was to link Europe so closely that another
war would be impossible. Political union proved too difficult, with
countries refusing to give up national sovereignty. Economic union,
as symbolized by the common currency, remains a feasible goal.

Broncos and zebras dominate NFL '98

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ If the American National Football League named
its seasons after animals, 1998 would be the season of the Bronco
and the zebra.
	   With a Falcon and a Cardinal flying overhead and a Viking ready
to pounce on all of them.
	   The Denver Broncos started the year by finally winning a Super
Bowl, beating Green Bay 31-24 in San Diego to give John Elway his
first NFL title in his 15th season and ending a streak of 13
consecutive victories by NFC teams.
	   They continued it by winning their first three regular-season
games before being upset 20-16 by the New York Giants. That came a
week before what was supposed to be a confrontation with Miami,
which in 1972 was the only unbeaten franchise for a whole season in
NFL history.
	   The Broncos lost that, too, handing over the mantle of the NFL's
strongest team to the Minnesota Vikings, led by rookie wide
receiver Randy Moss and recycled quarterback Randall Cunningham,
moved to the top of the NFC. They lost only once, at Tampa, winning
15, and ending the season with an NFL record 556 points, an average
of almost 35 a game.
	   On the final Sunday, the Arizona Cardinals achieved something
they hadn't done since 1982, when they played in St. Louis. They
made the playoffs at 9-7, winning seven of their games by three
points or less, including a 16-13 victory over San Diego on the
final Sunday in which the Chargers tied the game with 16 seconds
left and the Cardinals won it on a 52-yard field goal by Chris
Jacke as time ran out.
	   But for a few weeks in November and December, the Broncos and
Vikings (and, of course, the Cardinals) were overshadowed by the
officials, those guys in the zebra-striped shirts whose mistakes
played a major part in deciding three games.
	   The first came on Thanksgiving during the coin toss to start
overtime in the Steelers-Lions game.
	   Jerome Bettis of the Steelers said he called ``tails.'' Referee
Phil Luckett said he heard ``heads-tails'' and went with ``heads''
when the coin came up ``tails.'' So Detroit got the ball and drove
for the winning field goal without Pittsburgh ever getting the
ball.
	   The second came four days later, when the officials made what
the league conceded were two bad calls that gave New England a
victory over Buffalo.
	   The third mistake came a week later, when the officials gave the
New York Jets a 32-31 victory over Seattle by ruling Vinny
Testaverde over the goal line. Replays showed he wasn't and Earnie
Frantz, who made the TD call, later acknowledged that he mistook
Testaverde's white helmet for the brown ball.
	   As a result, the NFL floated the idea of instant replay for the
playoffs, a good public relations move that was shot down by its
rule-making competition committee by a 7-1 vote. The committee,
however, did vote 6-1 with one ``maybe'' vote to bring it back at
the league meetings in March.
	   As the playoffs began, Minnesota (15-1) and Denver (14-2), held
home field for the playoffs.
	   But while the Vikings were a heavy favorite to represent the NFC
in the Super Bowl, the hot team in the AFC was the Jets, led by
Testaverde, who finally fulfilled the promise he was supposed to
show when he was the No. 1 overall pick in the draft.
	   New York, 1-15 two years ago, entered the postseason on a
six-game winning streak that gave them a 12-4 season under Bill
Parcells, who could become the first coach ever to take three
different teams to a Super Bowl. Like the Broncos and Vikings, the
Jets had a first-round bye along with Atlanta, which finished 14-2
and won the NFC West for the first time since 1980.
	   The Falcons, who were led by running back Jamal Anderson and a
revived defense, finished the season without coach Dan Reeves, who
underwent quadruple heart bypass surgery on Dec. 15, got out of the
hospital three days later, then went back in. Despite that, he was
in the locker room before the final game, a 38-16 victory over
Miami.
	   The day after the season ended, five coaches were fired within a
few hours of one another _ Ray Rhodes of Philadelphia (3-13), Dave
Wannstedt of Chicago (4-12), Dennis Erickson of Seattle (8-8), Dom
Capers of Carolina (4-12), and Ted Marchibroda of Baltimore (6-10).
	   San Francisco's Steve Young, Buffalo's Doug Flutie, Testaverde
and Cunningham all were part of what came to be known as the Year
of the Ancient quarterback, a list that also includes long-time
standbys John Elway of Denver and Dan Marino of Miami. All are 36
or over.
	   Terrell Davis of Denver made life easy for Elway. He became only
the fourth back in NFL history to run for more than 2,000 yards,
finishing with 2,008, 97 short Eric Dickerson's NFL record of
2,105.
	   Moss was clearly the rookie star, although running back Fred
Taylor of Jacksonville and quarterback Peyton Manning of
Indianapolis made claims. Manning, the first pick in the draft, was
shaky at the start, strong at the end, setting a rookie record with
28 touchdown passes.
	   But Ryan Leaf, the second overall pick, wasn't as successful _
either on or off the field.
	   He was benched at midseason after a series of off-field
misadventures, including a tiff with a reporter and late-night
spree in Spokane, Washington, where he bragged ``I could buy you
all.''
	   Leaf was no bargain on the field. He threw just two touchdown
passes, had 15 interceptions and a league-low quarterback rating of
39.0, just about the minimum any QB can have.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Avoiding a crisis with just 36 hours to
spare, Mexican legislators ended weeks of deadlock and reached a
compromise Wednesday on the 1999 budget.
	   The Mexican government had faced the prospect of beginning the
new year without a budget _ an unprecedented event in Mexican
history. Officials didn't know if they'd be able to keep the
government operating without a budget.
	   Legislators were stalled over a dlrs 2.86 billion shortfall,
largely the result of falling oil prices. Oil makes up about a
third of the Mexican government's revenue.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo had proposed a series of tax
increases, including a 15 percent telephone usage surcharge on top
of the current 15 percent sales tax. Opposition parties, who have a
majority in the lower house of Congress, opposed the plan, as did
businesses and civic groups.
	   Legislators said compromise worked out Wednesday makes up for
the budget shortfall by including at least dlrs 1.4 billion in
spending cuts, a higher corporate income tax rate than Zedillo had
proposed and higher diesel prices charged by the state-owned oil
monopoly.
	   It also calls for higher tariffs on goods from countries with
which Mexico doesn't have free trade agreements. Those tariffs
presumably wouldn't affect the United States, Canada or much of
Latin America.
	   The lower house was to consider the revenues part of the budget
later Wednesday. It would then need approval in the Senate, which
is controlled by the governing party. The lower house would then
consider the spending part of the budget, which does not need
Senate approval.
	   The agreement was worked out largely between legislators of
Zedillo's Institutional Revolutionary Party and the right-center
National Action Party, which has about a quarter of the seats in
the lower House. The other major opposition party, Democratic
Revolution, strongly opposed Zedillo's plan.
	   For most of its 69-year history, the governing party, known as
the PRI, was able to dictate its will in Congress. But it lost its
majority in the lower house in elections last year _ after PRI
legislators raised the sales tax to 15 percent from 10 percent in
1995.
	   But the opposition has failed to vote as a solid bloc.
Legislators from National Action and the PRI approved the 1999
budget over the objections of Democratic Revolution.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Europe's dream of monetary union
becomes reality Thursday when 11 nations irrevocably lock their
currencies together to form the euro and create an economic giant
whose boundaries stretch from beyond the Arctic Circle to the
shores of the Mediterranean.
	   The euro's birth is being hailed as a historic turning point in
international finance and is arguably the greatest single step in
the drive to create a united Europe from the ruins of World War II.
	   On what Europeans are calling ``E-day,'' economic and finance
ministers from the 11 nations will huddle at European Union
headquarters to agree to the rates at which German marks, French
francs and the rest are absorbed into euro.
	   There will be solemn speeches and champagne, then schoolchildren
will release thousands of blue balloons bearing the ``e'' symbol
which may soon become as familiar as the dollar sign.
	   The euro will formally come into existence at midnight on New
Year's Eve. It will be worth about dlrs 1.17.
	   As the euro-balloons float into the skies above Brussels,
employees at banks, stock exchanges and other financial
institutions around Europe will start a race-against-time to adapt
computer systems and convert countless financial holdings _ from
Dutch government bonds, to Italian shares and Finnish bank accounts
_ into euros before markets reopen Monday after the long holiday
weekend.
	   ``It is a major logistical effort. We have catering facilities.
We have booked hundreds of hotel rooms. We have hired mini buses,''
said Vendeline Von Bredow, euro project manager at Merrill Lynch.
	   After Thursday, the old currencies will no longer be traded in
foreign exchange markets around the world. Stocks and bonds will be
quoted in euros. The euro will increasingly be used for bank
transactions, business deals and public finances.
	   The European Central Bank will set a common interest rate of 3
percent for all 11 nations. For the first time in decades the U.S.
dollar will have a rival as the world's reference currency.
	   Euro cash will only be issued to replace the old coins and
banknotes in early 2002. Until then, the euro will only be used for
non-cash transactions.
	   Consumers will see prices marked in euros making it easier to
shop across frontiers and they'll be able to buy in euros using
checks or credit cards. But they'll still have to change money for
cross-border cash purchases.
	   Citizens will start to see euro figures alongside national
currencies on pay checks, phone bills and bank statements. On
Wednesday, winners of the French and Irish national lotteries will
have their prizes announced in euros.
	   French Riviera flower sellers, Belgian supermarkets and trendy
Viennese cafes where among businesses who jumped the gun and began
posting euro prices before the official launch.
	   In the Eurotempo store selling souvenirs in the shadow of the
EU's Brussels headquarters, there was a brisk trade in pocket
calculators programed to convert to and from euros.
	   ``It's a real success, people have been buying up dozens at a
time to offer as gifts,'' said sales assistant Isabel Fernandez.
The store's shelves also contained neckties and alarm clocks
adorned with the euro symbol, and chocolate euro coins.
	   Plans to forge a common European currency date back to the
1960s, but only after then German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and late
French President Francois Mitterrand threw their weight behind the
project in the late 1980s did Economic and Monetary Union, or EMU,
take flight.
	   Supporters say euro-zone's 290 million people will give European
companies a huge, secure home market like that of their American
rivals. Exchange-rate costs and currency fluctuations within the
euro zone will disappear.
	   Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium,
Austria, Portugal, Finland, Ireland and Luxembourg will join the
euro, hoping their combined economic weight will give Europe a
greater voice in world affairs.
	   For some, the price to pay was too great.
	   Britain, Denmark and Sweden opted out of the euro because of
public anxiety that dropping the national currency means giving up
too much independence. Greece failed to meet economic conditions
for joining but hopes to be in by 2001.

Hunter: Players to make their ``final'' offer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix slug &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ U.S. National Basketball Association players
plan to make their own ``final'' offer, hoping to end a 6-month
labor dispute that threatens to scuttle the entire season of play.
	   ``I have called David Stern and requested an opportunity to
present it to the owners' labor committee as soon as they're
available, and certainly before the Jan. 7 date that Stern has set
as the owners' deadline,'' union director Billy Hunter said on
Wednesday, refering to the league commissioner.
	   Union president Patrick Ewing said the new proposal should be
ready before Friday.
	   Stern said Monday that if the players brought him something new,
he'd present it to his negotiating committee. The lockout is
essentially a strike by the owners, who are angered over the high
cost of players' salaries.
	   In Houston, a federal court judge rejected an injunction sought
by Nick Van Exel, Marcus Camby and Reggie Slater for unconditional
letters of clearance from the NBA and USA Basketball. The three
want to play the rest of the season in Europe _ even if the lockout
ends.
	   U.S. District Judge Sim Lake told the plaintiffs they could
submit their dispute to an arbitrator, and agent James Bryant said
he would do so.
	   It was not immediately clear where or when such a case would be
arbitrated.
	   Ewing, meanwhile, said the owners' ``final'' offer _ which the
commissioner presented earlier this week _ would not be put to a
vote of the general membership unless a majority asked for it.
	   So far, only a handful of players, including Jayson Williams and
Kevin Willis, has openly called for a chance to vote.
	   ``If the majority of the players call up and say they want a
vote, then we're bound to vote,'' Ewing said. ``But yesterday we
had a conference call and we put the question to them if they want
a vote. And as of today, no one has called to demand that we put it
to a vote.''
	   Negotiating committee member Jim McIlvaine told players they
could call him at home if they wanted to express their concerns
privately and anonymously; no one did.
	   ``The committee's job is to do the will of the majority of the
players. If we get indications that they would like some proposal
voted on, we'd have to follow through on it,'' McIlvaine said.
``But reading about it in the paper or hearing it from an agent
doesn't cut it for me. I need to hear it from the players.''
	   The commissioner sent each player a copy of a letter he wrote to
Hunter asking for a vote.
	   ``While it is your prerogative to reject our proposal, the
consequences of that decision will be so catastrophic to your
members that simple fairness suggests they be given a chance to be
heard,'' Stern wrote. ``Accordingly, we request and strongly urge
that you put the NBA's final offer to a vote of the entire union
membership.''

NBA players lose bid to play in Europe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ A U.S. federal judge Wednesday refused to grant a
temporary restraining order to allow three National Basketball
Association players to play the rest of the season in Europe.
	   Nick Van Exel of the Denver Nuggets, Marcus Camby of the New
York Knicks and Reggie Slater of the Toronto Raptors had sued the
NBA and USA Basketball, accusing both entities failing to provide
them with unconditional letters of clearance that would allow them
to finish the season in Europe even if the lockout ended.
	   After a 3 1/2-hour hearing, U.S. District Judge Simeon Lake
rejected the players' bid but said they were entitled to
arbitration.
	   Agent James Bryant said the players would pursue arbitration,
but it was not immediately clear where or when such a hearing would
take place.
	   ``We welcome the opportunity,'' said Bryant, who represents all
three players. ``The problem has been until now there has been no
remedy anywhere. It's a victory to have the opportunity to present
that.''
	   Last week, a state court judge refused to grant the players an
injunction.
	   The case was moved to federal court after USA Basketball argued
the lawsuit raised issues covered by federal labor laws.
	   Jeffrey Mishkin, chief legal officer for the NBA, praised the
judge's decision and said the players had ``no basis at all for
this lawsuit.''
	   ``We have said repeatedly that NBA players are free during the
lockout to pursue other employment,'' Mishkin said. ``But if and
when the lockout ends, they are required to fulfill the remaining
terms of their existing NBA contracts.''
	   American players cannot play overseas without clearance from USA
Basketball, the governing body for basketball in the United States.
The organization and the NBA have said players may work overseas as
long as they adhere to their NBA contracts should the lockout end.
	   In their lawsuit, Van Exel, Camby and Slater argued that the
organizations were illegally placing conditions on them. They also
insisted that no European teams would hire them if there was a
possibility they might have to leave to return to the NBA.
	   All three players have one year left on their NBA contracts. The
athletes had said an immediate injunction was necessary because
European teams do not permit players to be added to the playoff
roster after a cutoff date that is rapidly approaching.
	   The NBA lockout has been in effect for almost six months, and
the first three months of the season have already been scrapped.
	   Commissioner David Stern says he'll recommend the entire season
be scrubbed if there's no agreement with players by Jan. 7. Union
director Billy Hunter told players Wednesday that a new offer will
soon be given to the owners.

Member of ice trek falls ill, delays progress

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ A member of Peter Hillary's
Antarctic ice trek team has fallen ill, but supporters said
Thursday the trio will press on with their attempt to ski to the
South Pole.
	   Jon Muir is laid up in the team's tent with suspected food
poisoning, although the team hopes he'll recover within 24 hours,
Hillary's wife Yvonne told The Associated Press.
	   ``I'm hopeful Jon's sickness will pass quickly,'' she said.
``The crucial thing is for them to be on the road again, since food
(supply level) is a factor now.''
	   New Zealander Hillary and Muir and Eric Phillips, both from
Australia, left Scott Base on Nov. 4 to cross country ski to the
South Pole, retracing the 3,000-kilometer (1,875-mile) route of
English explorer Robert Falcon Scott in 1911.
	   Scott's ill-fated expedition made it to the pole, only to die of
starvation on their return a few kilometers (miles) short of help.
	   If successful, the trip led by Hillary _ the son of the first
man to climb Mt. Everest, Sir Edmund Hillary _ will be the longest
ice trek without outside assistance of this century.
	   Too long a delay could force them to scrap the attempt because
their only supplies are what they can fit on sleds that they
brought with them.
	   Phillips reportedly said Wednesday that Muir's illness was a
blow to morale because of concerns he may be too weak to haul his
huge sled on the final 415 kilometers (260 miles) to the South
Pole.
	   ``We cannot go on at the moment because Jon is vomiting and has
a severe headache,'' Phillips told the New Zealand's Herald
newspaper.
	   The team now has to average 22 kilometers (13 miles) a day to
reach the South Pole on their current supplies.
	   The trio has completed just 75 kilometers (47 miles) in the past
eight days, with progress slowed by two blizzards.
	   Yvonne Hillary said she was ``feeling stressed'' about the
trio's slow progress but that they would continue as soon as Muir
is able.
	   ``Oh, there's no possibility of them turning back. They have to
get to the pole, there's no choice for them now but to get to the
pole,'' she said.

Peruvian shamans say Clinton to survive scandal

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton will survive the
sex scandal hounding him and serve out his full term, Andean
soothsayers predicted Wednesday.
	   The shamans, descendants of the mighty Inca empire that once
ruled Peru, said they based their predictions on visions brought on
by drinking a brew made from a jungle vine, a hallucinogen they say
has curative, religious and extrasensory powers.
	   ``Clinton will survive, but Monica (Lewinsky) will suffer
because she writes a book and the truth of it will be challenged,''
said Juan Osco, 45, after he spat a herb mixture over photos of
Clinton, Lewinsky and other famous figures.
	   The ceremony involving eight soothsayers atop a hill overlooking
Lima takes place each year to bless the new year and appease the
god Apu, who they say inhabits the hill.
	   Shamans are common and respected in Peru, with many poor
families who cannot afford modern medicine relying on them for
their health care. They carry on the tradition of Peru's Indian
cultures.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The ``Battle of the Aged'' between George
Foreman and Larry Holmes is still on as scheduled.
	   Promoter Roger Levitt said Wednesday there is no truth to recent
speculation that the Jan. 23 heavyweight fight will be canceled.
	   ``The fight is definitely going to go on,'' Levitt said from his
New York office. ``All of the financial arrangements that need to
be put in place will be done so.''
	   Levitt said the letters of credit, which guarantee the fighters
will receive their share of the purse, must be in order by the
close of business on Thursday.
	   He is optimistic he'll meet the deadline, going as far as making
final travel plans for the fighters.
	   The status of the fight became unclear when one of Levitt's
largest financial backers pulled out about two weeks ago. A
replacement was found earlier this week.
	   ``We informed both boxers and their advisers of our situation
and they were very understanding,'' Levitt said. ``We are doing
everything we can to rectify the situation and this whole scenario
will be tied up by the end of Thursday.''
	   Foreman, who turns 50 on Jan. 10, is to receive dlrs 10 million
for the fight, which will be held at the Houston Astrodome. The
49-year-old Holmes will get dlrs 4 million.
	   Levitt has already given Foreman a dlrs 1 million deposit and
Holmes dlrs 400,000 _ both are nonrefundable.
	   Holmes, who last fought in July 1997, was in Texas on Monday to
obtain his license. Because he is older than 36 he must be approved
by boxing authorities.
	   Foreman's last bout was in November 97.
	   The bout will be carried on pay-per-view cable television.
	   ``Despite all the rumors, we have been assured everything is
moving forward and the fight will go on,'' said Rebecca Kramer, a
spokesman for Viewer's Choice, which will offer the fight telecast.
``There's no truth to the reports that the event has been
canceled.''

Ground-pounding experiment hitching ride on Mars lander

<TEXT>
	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP) _ An unusually risky
ground-pounding experiment is hitching a ride on NASA's next
spacecraft to Mars.
	   Aboard the Mars Polar Lander, due to lift off Jan. 3 and arrive
at the red planet next December, are two probes designed to slam
into the Martian surface between 400 mph (640 kph) and 500 mph (800
kph) and, if they survive, burrow 3 feet (one meter) deep.
	   It is the first attempt by NASA to crash-land a spacecraft on
another planet with the intent of penetrating its surface and
sending back radio signals.
	   The trick is getting the probes to withstand the impact,
estimated at up to 60,000 times the force of Earth's gravity.
	   To come up with a durable design, project manager Sarah Gavit
and her team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
California, hurled sample probes from planes and shot them out of a
cannon into the ground.
	   They settled on a probe the size of a cantaloupe that is
enclosed in a thermal protective shell the size of a basketball.
Total weight: 8 pounds (3.6 kilograms).
	   The silicon carbide aeroshell is meant to shatter on impact,
with the probe inside separating into two parts connected by a
ribbonlike cable.
	   One part, made of aluminum and magnesium, is supposed to remain
on the surface of Mars to serve as a radio-relay station. The
other, a 4-inch-long (10-centimeter-long), 1 1-2 -inch-wide
(3.8-centimeter-wide), bullet-shaped tube, hopefully will penetrate
as deep as 3 feet (one meter).
	   This stainless steel and tungsten tube contains a miniature
drill that will be propelled out the side to collect bits of soil.
The dirt will fall into a small cup that will be sealed and then
heated, turning any water ice into vapor that would flow into a
chamber containing a laser and mirrors.
	   The laser will emit a beam of light. Scientists will know
whether water vapor is present if any of that light is absorbed.
	   At the same time, temperature sensors will measure the rate at
which each penetrating tube cools after plunging into the ground.
That will allow scientists to determine how fast heat dissipates in
the soil.
	   If all goes well _ a big if _ the probes could collect and send
data for one to three days, the expected lifetime of their tiny
lithium batteries.
	   Almost everything in the probes had to be developed from
scratch.
	   ``Either there was nothing out there small enough, or nothing
that was packaged to survive the kind of forces we're going into,''
says Gavit.
	   In 1996, the Russians used different designs and technologies
for a much larger pair of soil-penetrating probes that were to have
drilled 20 feet (6 meters) beneath the Martian surface. The
spacecraft on which they were launched, unfortunately, never made
it out of Earth orbit _ it came crashing down through the
atmosphere shortly after liftoff.
	   Even with the best design, which engineers believe they have
after three years of testing, luck will play an inordinately large
role when the probes divebomb into Mars near the South Pole on Dec.
3, 1999.
	   They are supposed to peel away from the Mars Polar Lander five
minutes before the lander enters the planet's upper atmosphere.
They should hit the Martian surface a minute before the
three-legged lander plops down some 60 miles (100 kilometers) away,
where it will shovel up dirt for analysis.
	   If the probes hit a small rock or the side of a rock, that's OK
as long as they penetrate. ``But if we go splat right in the middle
of a big one, we're history,'' Gavit says.
	   The terrain near the planet's unexplored South Pole shouldn't be
as rocky as the spot where NASA's Mars Pathfinder bounced down on
July 4, 1997.
	   Just as bad would be landing in soft, fluffy layers of dust.
``The whole thing could be buried,'' Gavit says, preventing radio
signals from getting out.
	   Another problem is if a big gust of wind tilts the probes the
wrong way just before they hit. If the angle at which they descend
is too great, the probes will skip along the surface like pebbles
on a pond.
	   If Gavit and her team get even one radio signal back, they'll be
thrilled _ that means at least part of their package survived and
most of the technologies were demonstrated.
	   Those in charge of the program put the chance of success at
better than 50-50 _ maybe.
	   That's why two probes are flying _ to double the odds.
	   That's also why the dlrs 29 million experiment is part of NASA's
New Millennium program to test revolutionary new, high-risk
technologies.
	   The first New Millennium project is Deep Space 1, launched in
October. The spacecraft is en route to an asteroid, its ion
propulsion engine working well after a sluggish start.
	   The two penetrating probes on the Mars Polar Lander constitute
Deep Space 2.
	   ``It's meant to be pushing the boundaries of what we think is
possible,'' says Carl Pilcher, NASA's science director for solar
system exploration.
	   The science goal _ hunting for water in the Martian soil _ is
secondary to proving the technology works, notes Richard Zurek,
project scientist.
	   ``The idea is to demonstrate just how small you can get these
devices,'' Zurek says, ``with the idea if they're small enough,
then you can send many of them.''
	   Imagine a string of mini weather stations on Mars, for instance,
or a chain of seismographs to register Marsquakes.
	   ``There's a whole area of science, of understanding the planet,
that you could do if you could put down a network of instruments,''
Zurek says.
	   Gavit gets excited just thinking about the earthly spinoffs of
smashproof materials and electronics.
	   Imagine a remote control or tape recorder that didn't break when
it fell on the floor. Or how about indestructible toys? Now that
would be a breakthrough, Gavit says, laughing.

	   NASA is holding a contest to name the twin soil-penetrating
probes to be launched Jan. 3 aboard the Mars Polar Lander.
	   The probes, formally known as Deep Space 2, can be named after
people, places or things from history, mythology or fiction. The
only catch: NASA wants the two names to relate to one another and
the people they're named after must be dead.
	   The names of explorers or pioneers are welcome, the names of
super heroes are not. So forget Batman and Robin.
	   Entries must be accompanied by an essay of no more than 100
words explaining why the names were chosen. The deadline is April
30, 1999.
	   Entry rules and forms are available at this Internet address:

Case Western's 8-ton telescope goes online
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMY BETH GRAVES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Those with a favorite spot in space can now
capture that image by accessing and operating an 8-ton robotic
telescope.
	   On Dec. 15, Case Western Reserve University's telescope went
online, allowing amateur and professional astronomers to ask for
specific images of celestial bodies.
	   ``To our knowledge, it's the only one the general public will
have access to. There were others, but they are no longer online,''
said Earle Luck, chairman of the school's astronomy department.
	   Astronomers can have free access to the telescope by filling out
a form on the university's Web site. They must provide the name of
the celestial body, exposure time and if they want colored filters
to be used. After the pictures are taken at the Nassau Astronomical
Station, they are automatically sent via e-mail to those who
requested them.
	   No images of the moon or sun are allowed because they are too
bright and can damage the telescope. The equipment can focus on
faraway stars but isn't designed yet to take snapshots of planets
or comets.
	   Processing requests can take anywhere from days to months,
depending on how many people ask for images and how difficult they
are to obtain, according to directions on the Web site. Fifteen
percent of the observing time will be devoted to the public, 20
percent to secondary schools and the rest is for Case Western
faculty and students, Luck said.
	   The 36-inch (91-centimeter) telescope sat idle for more than a
decade before Luck came up with the idea three years ago for its
current use. The astronomy department spent more than dlrs 200,000,
some from private donors, to modernize it and get the computer
system running.
	   When all goes well, teachers will be able to introduce their
students to the mysteries of the universe through the telescope and
not just through books, Luck said.
	   But the location of the observatory could affect how many
requests are processed. The telescope is perched high on a hill in
Geauga County just east of Chardon, a traditional snowbelt area.
	   The telescope starts operating after an outside camera indicates
that it has kept the North Star in sight for 30 minutes straight,
meaning the weather is clear. The weather is monitored every two
minutes because humidity, rain, snow, extreme cold or winds of 40
mph can damage the telescope's mirrors.
	   It has an electronic device to melt snow automatically.
	   Next year, Luck plans to add a spectograph, which measures the
speed, temperature and chemical combustion of stars.

Luck, hunch about ancient Roman port led to oldest church
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY190 &QL; 
 &UR; By JOE WHEELAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RALEIGH, North Carolina (AP) _ It was an astonishing piece of
luck. Following a hunch, Professor Thomas Parker went looking for
an ancient Roman trading port and dug up what may be the oldest
known Christian church.
	   Other structures converted to churches are older than the
two-story mud-brick building that Parker found in Aqaba, Jordan, a
Red Sea resort city 210 miles (340 kilometers) south of Amman.
Parker's discovery, however, is the oldest building known to exist
that was erected solely as a Christian worshipping place, he said.
	   Built around 290 or 300 A.D. by early Christians, the church
somehow survived the ``Great Persecution,'' when the Roman Emperor
Diocletian ordered churches razed and Christians tortured between
303 and 311. The church may have been spared because it lay on the
empire's southeastern periphery, Parker said. It was destroyed by a
cataclysmic earthquake in 363 and buried by the desert.
	   Parker, 48, on the North Carolina State University history
faculty since 1980, became interested in Aqaba and its predecessor,
the ancient Roman port of Aila, when he shifted his scholarly
research from Roman military history to Roman economy. He found
himself in the middle of a debate about how big a role trade
played.
	   ``We didn't go to Aqaba to find the oldest church in the world,
but to find evidence of Roman economic activity,'' he said. ``The
discovery of the church was an unexpected bonus.''
	   Ancient historical texts suggested Aila's likely location in
present-day Aqaba, which lies at the head of the Gulf of Aqaba, an
arm of the Red Sea. Parker and his wife walked the area in 1993
after examining old British Royal Air Force aerial photos. They
found pottery shards that encouraged them to return in 1994.
	   That year, he and his 50-person expedition found Aila in the
middle of a thriving port city that was undergoing a construction
boom.
	   ``It was serendipity that we started when we did,'' Parker said
of the expedition's timing. ``We could have lost a major historic
site.''
	   ``Looking back, it was an incredible crap shoot,'' he added.
	   Upon returning with another expedition in 1996, Parker found the
first evidence of the buried church, but he was cautious initially.
Only when his crew last summer excavated the apse on the eastern
end of the building did he become confident enough to consider
announcing his findings. ``It was the last piece of the puzzle that
told me we had a persuasive case,'' he said.
	   ``It wasn't until we had the complete plan, the complete
chronological sequence before I started sticking my neck out,''
Parker said.
	   The church, 28 yards by 16 yards (26 meters by 15 meters) and
with five aisles, wasn't especially large or ornate. ``There were
no beautiful accoutrements, no marble, as in the later churches. It
was a very functional church for a middling-sized congregation'' of
no more than a few hundred, he said.
	   He said four lines of evidence support his belief the church was
Christian and dated to 290 or 300.
	   _It is oriented to the East, as were all early churches.
	   _It was laid out in a basilica plan, with a nave, apse, chancel
and aisles.
	   _There is an adjacent cemetery. One of the 25 graves exhumed
yielded an arm of a brass cross.
	   _It was illuminated with glass oil lamps filled with olive oil,
which were not found in residences of that time. The lamps, pottery
and chandeliers all conform to a construction date of about 300
A.D., he said.
	   ``I don't see what else it could be,'' he concluded.
	   Seven stone risers from a staircase indicate the church had a
second story, Parker said.
	   About 100 coins from the 4th century were found scattered about
a small room, near a charred box, possibly a collection box that
burned when the earthquake destroyed the church, Parker said.
	   He plans to return with another team in 2000 and spend the
interim year sifting through the three tons of artifacts that he
brought back.
	   Parker said additional digging may yield firmer evidence of the
church's construction date. For example, black-and-red paint flecks
on bits of excavated plaster provide hope a better fresco might be
found in still-buried parts of the church.
	   He said Aqaba, Jordan's only major port, is fast becoming a
major tourist attraction and a major hotel building program is in
progress. Jordanian officials were quick to grasp that the ruins he
is excavating will only draw more tourists and have cooperated in
preserving the site.
	   ``If we can show off the oldest church in the world, it would
enhance the economy, it would perform a cultural service and
fulfill an economic need,'' Parker said.
	   Sawsan Fakhiri, director of the Aqaba Antiquities Department,
earlier said the ruins very likely are remains of a church built in
the late 3rd century, but said more study is needed. Other
historians have reacted with similar restraint, with some holding
out for an inscription or artifacts firmly placing the structure in
the 3rd century.
	   Older churches than the one in Aila exist, but they all were
homes converted to that purpose. One in Dura Luropos in Syria dates
to about 230 A.D., said Parker. It went out of use when Persians
captured the city in 256.
	   After Diocletian's anti-Christian crusade, it wasn't long before
the Roman Empire became Christian and more churches went up,
sanctioned by the imperial government.
	   Constantine, the first Christian emperor, gained control of both
halves of the empire in 324, and his mother, Helena, embarked on a
church-building campaign the next year. Some of the most famous
structures from that era remain open today _ for example, the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem and the Church of the
Nativity in Bethlehem.

Possible hiding place of Parkinson's disease gene found
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Scientists may have found the hiding place of a
third gene that causes an inherited form of Parkinson's disease.
	   By studying six generations of a large Iowa-based family, the
scientists found evidence that such a gene lurks in a particular
region of chromosome 4. They haven't identified the gene.
	   The vast majority of Parkinson's disease strikes sporadically
rather than being inherited. But researchers hope that learning
about the inherited form will shed light on the sporadic type,
perhaps leading to new treatments.
	   Scientists have identified one flawed gene that causes inherited
Parkinson's and found evidence for where a second might be.
	   The new work is reported by scientists at the Mayo Clinic
Jacksonville in Florida and elsewhere in the January 1999 issue of
the journal Human Molecular Genetics.

 &UR; Scientists isolate gene that can disrupt sex behavior in flies
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Scientists have isolated a gene that disrupts
sexual behavior in fruit flies when it's damaged. Further work
might lead to a pest-control weapon that makes insects sterile.
	   Mutations in the gene, called ``dissatisfaction,'' prevent
females from laying eggs. But they also make females avoid sex
partners and fight them off if they attempt to mate. Males with a
defective gene court other males as well as females, and mate
poorly because they have trouble bending their abdomens properly to
copulate.
	   Scientists haven't found a human version of the gene, but
there's a lot more human DNA to look at, said Michael McKeown of
the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. He and colleagues report
the gene isolation in the December issue of the journal Neuron.
	   They found that in fruit flies called Drosophila, the gene is
activated in only a tiny fraction of brain cells.

 &UR; Parasite is wiping out rainbow trout in the United States
	   DECKERS, Colorado _ A parasite is wiping out rainbow trout in
Colorado, Montana, Wyoming and Idaho.
	   The parasite is carried by a worm and causes whirling disease,
which makes fingerling trout spin in circles until they die.
	   Over the past few years, the disease has infected a number of
prize rainbow trout streams in the West, including the Madison, the
Yellowstone, the South Platte and even the Blackfoot, which was
celebrated in the book and the movie ``A River Runs Through It.''
	   German brown, cutthroat, brook and lake trout are less
susceptible to the disease and are replacing the rainbow trout in
many rivers.
	   As a result, some sportsmen say the disease hasn't really hurt
trout fishing so much as forced them to adapt their flies and their
fishing times to catch different species.
	   However, many fishermen prefer rainbow trout because they're
more spectacular to catch.
	   The rainbow is more active than other trout, and thus more fun
to fight. It is also more colorful, with its speckled hues
shimmering in the sun as it leaps. Many fishermen also say it
tastes better than other trout.
	   Biologists warn they have no cure and very little to offer in
the way of hope.
	   Only one drug, fumagillin, has shown any promise, and it's
impossible to get enough of it into an infected river to do any
good. The biologists say the best solution is to cleanse and
modernize hatcheries.
	   They say fishermen can prevent the spread of the parasite by
cleaning all equipment with chlorine after fishing in diseased
waters, washing debris from boats and not throwing fish remains
into the water.
	   ``I don't know if we'll ever be able to eradicate it. The best
we can do is learn to control it,'' said Ken Peters, a biologist
for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Bozeman, Montana.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Roy Jones likes Ricky Frazier. That's why Jones
says he is giving the moonlighting New York City policeman a shot
at his WBC and WBA light heavyweight crowns next month.
	   ``Anytime you see a good opponent, you like to give him a
chance. I don't mind if my kids looked up at him,'' Jones said of
Frazier, who has patrolled the streets of Harlem for the last 16
years.
	   But Jones says that he will not that get in his way when he
fights the 39-year-old Frazier on Jan. 9 at the Civic Center in his
hometown of Penscola, Fla.
	   ``He is a southpaw with a pistol. I think I can manage that. I
don't intend on getting beat for some more years,'' said Jones, who
is 39-1 with 32 knockouts. ``I feel that I am enjoying myself in
the ring again and I'm getting back to being the old Roy Jones.''
	   After losing a controversial decision which cost him a gold
medal in the 1988 Olympics, Jones took it out on the pros, winning
middleweight and super middleweight titles to go with his light
heavyweight title.
	   ``I worked hard for everything and I earned that,'' he said.
``I'm glad that I am the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world
because that was my goal after being robbed in the Olympics.''
	   Frazier is getting his first breakthrough fight and still can't
quite believe it is happening.
	   ``I learned not to believe. Being a cop, I don't believe that
much as well,'' said Frazier, who is 16-3-1 with seven KOs. ``I'm
just training as hard as I can but there is still one part of me
that feels like something is going to happen.''

Khmer Rouge leaders enjoy VIP treatment as UN probes possible trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS FONTAINE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ As two Khmer Rouge leaders left the
capital on Thursday for a seaside vacation, the United Nations
human rights officer for Cambodia said work will proceed at the
U.N. to explore bringing those responsible for genocide to justice.
	   After basking in VIP treatment and luxury accommodations in
Phnom Penh for the past two days, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea began
a tour of the country that they helped turn into a vast slave-labor
camp when the Khmer Rouge held power from 1975-79.
	   The two drove with their families in luxury vehicles to the
seaside resort town of Sihanoukville, the first leg of a tour that
will take them to the ancient Angkor temple complex and their home
provinces.
	   The two guerrilla chiefs, who share blame for the deaths of up
to 2 million Cambodians during the Khmer Rouge reign, emerged from
hiding last week and sealed a defection deal with Prime Minister
Hun Sen that included assurances they would not face trial.
	   The deal, which contradicted earlier pronouncements by Hun Sen
that remaining Khmer Rouge leaders would stand trial if captured,
has shaken hopes that the architects of the murderous experiment
will ever face justice.
	   At the request of Cambodia's leaders, the United Nations sent a
trio of legal experts to Cambodia last month to assess existing
evidence against senior Khmer Rouge members and offer
recommendations for a tribunal.
	   ``The defection of Noun Chea and Khieu Samphan does not change
the plans,'' said Thomas Hammarberg, the U.N. rights officer for
Cambodia, from his home in Sweden. ``We intend to present their
recommendations as soon as possible to the government and hope for
a constructive discussion.''
	   King Norodom Sihanouk, who initially voiced support for Hun
Sen's defection deal, said Tuesday he would not provide amnesties
for Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea because of the ``undeniable
discontent'' of a majority of Cambodians in seeing the bloodstained
leaders go free.
	   Hun Sen has since been silent on the issue, but as Cambodia's
most powerful man he can easily put pressure his nation's pliant
court's to ensure there is no Cambodian trial for the Khmer Rouge.
	   Hopes for a tribunal now seem to rest solely with the U.N.,
which could pass resolutions to try the Khmer Rouge in an
international court for crimes against humanity.
	   Sihanouk appeared to voice his support for that option Tuesday
when he said the international community had ``the perfect right to
take up the case of genocide in Cambodia'' because of the nature of
the Khmer Rouge crimes.
	   Several possibilities for a trial are being considered by the
U.N. team, according to Hammarberg, who said it was necessary to
send a message to future generations in Cambodia that atrocities
cannot go unpunished.
	   ``Considering the scale and the brutality of the Khmer Rouge
crimes, genuine healing in Cambodia will be extremely difficult
without a justice process,'' he said.

Indonesian military predicts more unrest in 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Crime rose 10 percent in economically
battered Indonesia in 1998, and the government expects more unrest
in the year ahead, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Military officials, whose resources have been stretched by riots
and protests, predicted that clashes between rival political groups
will escalate ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for June.
	   However, they said any political unrest is unlikely to reach the
scale of street violence in May that helped oust former President
Suharto after 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   Some 1,200 people died in several days of riots in Jakarta, the
Indonesian capital, and many shops and homes in other major cities
were also burned and looted.
	   ``We'll experience an increasing trend of unrest in 1999,'' The
Jakarta Post quoted Zaini Azhar Maulani, chief of military
intelligence, as saying in yearend remarks Wednesday.
	   ``But now there is only a small group of people that are
described as anarchic who still want a change in the state
leadership,'' he said.
	   Student protesters have staged sometimes violent demonstrations
against the government of President B.J. Habibie, Suharto's
successor, to protest the pace and scope of political reforms. They
also want Suharto to be put on trial on corruption charges.
	   However, most student rallies have been smaller than those that
preceded the fall of Suharto.
	   There have also been incidents of church- and mosque-burnings as
religious and ethnic tensions in predominately Muslim Indonesia
rise. The economy remains mired in its worst crisis in three
decades, leading to higher unemployment and crime rates.
	   Authorities recorded 157,180 crimes across the archipelago
nation of 200 million people in 1998, 10 percent higher than the
previous year, said national police chief Lt. Gen. Roesmanhadi. The
crimes included armed robbery and vehicle theft.
	   ``The greater incidence of crimes this year is closely related
to the prolonged economic crisis and the social and political
tension here,'' the Post quoted him as saying.
	   The figures excluded looting, arson and other crimes tied to the
frequent riots that erupted across Indonesia in 1998.

Taiwan's main opposition might change independence stance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNIE HUANG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ It was a thrilling moment for many
Taiwanese when the main opposition party risked China's wrath and
adopted a platform calling for formal independence from the
mainland back in 1988.
	   Today, the thrill has been replaced by a deep soul-searching.
After its recent election setback, the Democratic Progressive Party
faces calls for changing the sacrosanct platform, if not scrapping
it entirely.
	   The reason: Beijing claims sovereignty over the island and
threatens to invade if Taiwan ever declares independence, and few
foreign countries, if any, would likely intervene in a war over
Taiwan.
	   Over a decade's time, more voters have awakened to that reality,
and more DPP politicians realize formal independence may be nothing
but wishful thinking that ends up costing them the votes of people
who are scared of the consequences of a declaration of
independence.
	   If the DPP sticks to a dream that can't be realized, the party
could see more voters flee to the ruling Nationalist Party, which
increasingly has become viewed as a stabilizing force because of
its moderate stance on China relations.
	   The Nationalists badly beat the DPP in Dec. 5 legislative
elections, and voters chose Nationalist challenger Ma Ying-jeou to
replace the DPP's top politician, Chen Shui-bian, as mayor of the
capital city of Taipei.
	   The defeat left the DPP reeling and has focused attention on
whether the independence platform might be changed. Top DPP
politicians will hold an unprecedented televised debate on the
issue Sunday, no doubt to be followed by months of public and
private talks before the platform comes up for formal discussion at
the party congress in May.
	   Shen Fu-hsiung is among several DPP lawmakers proposing to amend
the independence platform and to subject any declaration of
independence to constitutional changes rather than a vote by the
public.
	   ``Our stance is not fundamentally different from that of
President Lee Teng-hui. But one is seen as safe and the other
dangerous,'' Shen said Sunday in an interview with The Associated
Press.
	   Lee has called Taiwan and China separate but equal, though he
favors eventual reunification.
	   ``Many people believe we will make the announcement of
independence once we are in power so they do what they can to
prevent such a disaster,'' Shen said.
	   But he insisted the DPP would not make such a provocative move,
now that Taiwan has already been turned into what he calls a de
facto sovereign state. Lee was elected as its first president by
popular vote in 1996 after he was appointed to a term by a
rubberstamp National Assembly.
	   ``Is there one country in the world which elects its own
president and yet it is not a sovereign state?'' Shen asked. ``We
elected a president without declaring independence, and China found
no excuse to attack us.''
	   Despite its territorial claims, China test-fired missiles off
the Taiwanese coast during the presidential election campaign but
did not follow through on threats to invade the island.
	   ``When you have been estranged from your wife for 50 years, you
don't have to go to your rooftop to announce you are living with
another woman,'' Shen said.
	   Chiang Kai-shek's Chinese Nationalists retreated to Taiwan in
1949 after losing a civil war to Mao Tse-tung's communist forces.
The Nationalists clung to their claim as sole legitimate rulers of
all of China _ and for years anyone advocating independence faced
charges of subversion _ but the hard lines were dropped during the
past decade of democratization.
	   This leaves many Taiwanese favoring the status quo. But while
shifting away from the independence claim might help DPP
politicians win popular support, the party's hard-liners would be
furious.
	   Two years ago, former DPP chairman Hsu Hsin-liang said no
declaration of independence was necessary because Taiwan was
already sovereign. He was viciously attacked, even manhandled, by
party activists.
	   The current DPP chairman, Lin Yih-hsiung, has ordered a policy
review but refrained from calling for a change, underscoring the
party's divide.
	   With a presidential election just 15 months away, lingering
impressions that the DPP is reckless toward China relations do not
bode well for the party.
	   A Chinese semi-official body handling exchanges with Taiwan has
made opposing Taiwanese independence its top priority next year.
	   ``The mainland does not intend to impose its system and
lifestyle on Taiwan,'' said Tang Shubei, a senior official of the
Association for Relations across the Taiwan Strait. But Taiwanese
``cannot use any referendum to decide the future of Taiwan nor can
they separate Taiwan from Chinese territory. This is our main
concern.''
	   A more pragmatic attitude toward China is also needed, some say.
	   ``Voters question our ability to handle relations with China,
not just our stance,'' said Sisy Chen, a top aide to Hsu, the
former DPP chairman. ``We need to review our entire policy, our
attitude, whether we still want to stage a demonstration next time
China sends a delegate here.''

Vietnam GDP grows at 5.8 percent in 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam's economy grew by 5.8 percent in
1998, its lowest increase in recent years, according to preliminary
data Thursday from the General Statistical Office.
	   Vietnam's gross domestic product _ the measure of all goods and
services produced within its borders _ fell short of government
forecasts as the country was hit hard by Asia's economic crisis.
	   Declines in exports to the rest of Asia and investment from the
region slowed Vietnam's economy, which had grown by 8.3 percent
last year and more than 9 percent in 1996.
	   The government originally had estimated GDP growth for 1998 at 9
percent but slashed that to 6 percent in July, along with most
other economic indicators.
	   According to Thursday's figures, agricultural production grew by
2.8 percent in 1998, while industrial production growth stood at
10.9 percent and services at 4.2 percent.
	   The foreign investment sector of the economy posted the highest
growth of 18.2 percent _ although that still was lower that 1997's
figure _ while the state sector grew by 5.7 percent and the private
sector 7 percent.
	   Vietnamese leaders have predicted that 1999 would be an even
more difficult and challenging year for their country, one of the
region's poorest.
	   The National Assembly last month set the GDP growth target at 5
percent to 6 percent. The government stressed the target was only a
goal, not a figure that must be achieved, as was the case before
Vietnam began switching from a central command economy to a market
economy a decade ago.

Myanmar ethnic rebels burn speed pills, pledge to fight drugs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Shan rebels from Myanmar burned 300,000
amphetamine pills and a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of heroin in an
attempt to prove they are drug fighters not traffickers, local
papers reported on Thursday.
	   The Shan are one of several ethnic groups that have been
fighting for autonomy from the government of Myanmar, also known as
Burma, for decades.
	   Their troops are bracing for a massive assault by Myanmar's army
that Thai intelligence officials have said is imminent, and they
are attempting to improve their image to gain more support.
	   Historically, the Shan have received little support in their
struggle from the international community because of their
reputation as opium and heroin traffickers.
	   Myanmar is the world's largest producer of opium, the raw
material for heroin.
	   Various Shan leaders have through the years offered to destroy
the entire opium crop in exchange for cash and support for their
independence struggle from the United States government, which has
always refused the offer.
	   ``The drugs problem cannot be resolved without resolving the
ethnic conflict,'' Yawd Serk, commander of the Shan State Army, was
quoted as saying in Thursday's Bangkok Post newspaper.
	   The speed pills and heroin were seized from dealers from the
Kachin, another ethnic group, Shan fighters said.
	   Several ethnic groups have used money from drug trafficking to
fund their insurgency movements.
	   Low-level Myanmar army officers in the border areas have also
been implicated in the trade.
	   While the leaders of Myanmar's military government have not been
implicated in drug trafficking, they have allowed former top
traffickers such as Khun Sa to live in Yangon and invest in
businesses there, leaving them open to charges of helping the
dealers launder their money.
	   The United States imposed economic sanctions on Myanmar in 1997
for the military government's repression against the democracy
movement but also for failing to fight the drug trade.

Report: Nikko, Tokyo-Mitsubishi to negotiate tie-up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In a move likely to repair strained relations
between two Japanese financial giants, Nikko Securities Co. and the
Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi Ltd. will start negotiating a broad
business tie-up early next year, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The news comes less than six months after Citigroup Inc., a
major U.S. financial services group, bought a quarter stake in
Nikko, pushing Tokyo-Mitsubishi out of the top shareholder
position.
	   Nikko's potential tie-up with Tokyo-Mitsubishi would cover the
sale of Mitsubishi group financial products such as mutual funds
via Nikko's extensive retail network, cooperation in the pension
asset management business and joint development of new financial
products, the Sankei Shimbun reported.
	   Because of the New Year's holidays, officials from both Nikko
and Tokyo-Mitsubishi were unavailable to confirm the report.
	   Tokyo-Mitsubishi has reportedly opposed the link between Nikko
and Citigroup, in which the firms will offer investment services to
corporate customers through their newly-formed securities company,
Nikko Salomon Smith Barney Ltd.

Chinese premier urges quality construction for mammoth dam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Premier Zhu Rongji has ordered the builders of
the Three Gorges dam to ensure that the huge hydroelectric project
does not result in disaster due to poor engineering, state-run
media reported Thursday.
	   ``The responsibility on your shoulders is heavier than a
mountain. Any carelessness or negligence will bring disaster to our
future generations and cause irretrievable losses,'' Zhu said while
recently touring the construction site along the Yangtze River, in
central China.
	   Zhu's remarks, printed by the state-run Xinhua News Agency and
major newspapers, were the first explicit official expression of
concern about the project, whose critics say will cause massive
environmental damage while doing little to control flooding along
the volatile river.
	   When necessary, China plans to invite top international
engineering companies to inspect the dam and monitor the quality of
its construction, the reports cited Zhu as saying.
	   ``A strict engineering quality monitoring system must be
introduced into the Three Gorges Project,'' he said.
	   The dlrs 25 billion dam, east of the central city of Chongqing,
is intended to control flooding along the Yangtze and supply much
needed power for economic development. Reports by experts who have
toured the region say the endeavor has been plagued by widespread
popular resistance and corruption.
	   Earlier this week, the government launched a campaign to
emphasize better quality construction and curb rampant graft that
has contributed to numerous building, road and bridge collapses.
	   The drive is intended both to boost safety and to prevent waste
and embezzlement of the billions of dollars China is devoting to
construction of such basic infrastructure to help boost the
economy.
	   Zhu also said there was a need to improve management of funds
intended for the Three Gorges project and to ensure a successful
relocation of the 1.2 million people who will be displaced by the
dam.
	   ``We must establish a strict auditing system and increase
transparency in the use of funds to make sure that not a penny of
project funds is misused or diverted,'' Xinhua quoted Zhu as
saying.
