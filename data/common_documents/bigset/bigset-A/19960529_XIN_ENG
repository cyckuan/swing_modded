JERUSALEM, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli soldiers stationed in
 south Lebanon, Judea, Samaria and the Gaza Strip cast their
ballots today, a day ahead of the officially scheduled general
elections.
</P>
<P>
About 500 polling stations opened at 7 a.m. local time (04:00
GMT) today in Israeli military bases and front positions under the
supervision of the Elections Procedure Committee.
</P>
<P>
In the Israeli-Lebanese border, 14 polling boothes were also
set up to enable the soldiers crossing the border to vote.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers based inside the country and in the Golan Heights
will go to the polls Wednesday with the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
The General Staff of the Israeli army today issued an order to
demand the commanders ensure every soldier to vote, "even if it
means halting training or any other activity."
</P>
<P>
Some units readjusted their schedules to organize the
management and security of the voting stations, and provide
soldiers with election information.
</P>
<P>
Like any other voter, every soldier was required to produce
the civilian indentity (ID) card, or other identity documents,
before being given two envelopes, one for electing the prime
minister and another for the party. Strict procedures were
imposed in order to ensure any soldier not to vote twice.
</P>
<P>
The supervising officers put the two envelopes into a third
envelope and sealed it with the ID number of the voter, which will
be checked in the national registration order.
</P>
<P>
All the polling boothes will be closed at 10 p.m. on Wednesday
and the balloting boxes are to be brought early Thursday morning
by helicopters to the counting tables in the Knesset (Israel's
parliament).
</P>
<P>
However, the soldiers are not the first Israelis to cast votes
in the first direct election of the prime minister and
Knesset. Israeli diplomats and emissaries based abroad and the
seamen on shipping vessels already began voting on May 16.

<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- An emergency meeting has been held
by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC)
to discuss measures to keep "foreign garbage" from entering China.
</P>
<P>
The meeting called on foreign trade departments in the country
to attach great importance to imported "foreign garbage", take
measures to control the import of waste and used materials, and
absolutely prevent the inflow of "foreign garbage" into China
through foreign trade channels.
</P>
<P>
A MOFTEC official urged foreign trade and economic departments
and enterprises with import and export autonomy to clearly
understand the relevant laws, regulations and systems concerning
the import of waste and used materials.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC announced a series of measures at the meeting, which
spells out their action plan.
</P>
<P>
All departments concerned should make a thorough
self-examination and extensive checks of all signed contracts
concerning the import of waste and used materials and delivered
goods.
</P>
<P>
They should properly handle all items regarded as "foreign
garbage" in line with relevant laws and regulations; take
emergency measures to dispose of those goods on the way to China;
closely examine those which have not been loaded; and expose those
people who have purposefully deceived the parties on the Chinese
side and demand compensation from them.
</P>
<P>
From now on, any imports of waste and used material should be
put under a strict licensing process, and no such contract can be
signed without official approval. The credibility of foreign
exporters should be closely checked, with all the quality
indicators for imported materials unambiguously explained in the
contract.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, imported materials should be accompanied by
examination certificates issued by the authoritative organs, and
the on-the-spot checks will be required for technically qualified
importers.

leather, textile and footwear exports were blamed for the
lackluster increase in production.
</P>
<P>
As a result, light industrial output, expressed as a percentage
of the manufacturing sector's gross production, fell from 34.1
percent in 1990 to 23.9 last year, continuing the trend of an
ever-widening gap in growth between heavy and light industries.
</P>
<P>
Light industry factory shipments increased a meager 0.4-percent
due to a 6.8-percent fall in exports, while heavy industry posted
a wholesome overall growth of 12.6 percent on the strength of a
28.4-percent rise in exports and a 19.7-percent increase in
domestic sales.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing production capacity increased 9.3 percent thanks
to a 23.3-percent rise in capital investments in 1994, and
factories also operated at an average 82.5 percent of capacity
last year.
</P>
<P>
After industrial production increased nearly 12 percent last
year, inventory also jumped 14.9 percent, the highest since the
19.1 percent recorded in 1991.

<HEADLINE> (Urgent)India's Deve Gowda to Claim to Premiership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 28 (Xinhua) - H.D. Deve Gowda, the leader of
India's left-wing United Front alliance, was to meet President
Shankar Dayal Sharma later today to make preparations for the
forming of a new government, according to a presidential palace
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Deve Gowda's meeting with Sharma was fixed for 7 p.m. (1330
GMT), the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister of India's first Hindu nationalist
government resigned today, and H.D. Deve Gowda, the leader of the
13-group United Front, was invited to form India's second
government in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time that India's traditionally powerless
groups have a major role in running the country.
</P>
<P>
India's political scene was thrown into turmoil earlier this
month when no single party won a majority in monthlong
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The top vote-getter was the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata
Party, and 13 days ago, its leader, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, was
appointed prime minister. But many lawmakers accused the Hindu
nationalists of being anti-Muslim, and the party never found
enough centrist and leftist allies in parliament to form a
majority.
</P>
<P>
Today, hours before the party was expected to lose a
no-confidence motion in parliament, Vajpayee resigned, bringing
down the shortest-lived government in the history of independent
India.
</P>
<P>
The United Front controls 177 seats in Parliament's 545-seat
lower house. The Congress Party has 136 seats.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent of India's 920 million people are Hindus,
and 12 percent are Muslims, the nation's largest minority.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Students of Zimbabwe's National
University of Science and Technology (NUST) and the opposition
Zimbabwe Congress Party (ZCP) today condemned the continuous use
of firearms by police to apprehend suspects in crowded streets.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the shooting in Bulawayo, the country's second
largest city on Monday of a civilian by police,
NUST
Student Representative Council President Tammy Zhou said the
officers involved should be punished. The civilian was shot by
police trying to stop an emergency taxi driver who was on their
list of wanted suspects.
</P>
<P>
Police shooting of suspects has in the past been criticized by
human rights groups and other civic organizations, particularly
after last November's death of two men and injury of a woman in
Harare.
</P>
<P>
The deaths, which police described as accidental, led to a
massive demonstration which turned violent, resulting in the
destruction and looting of property worthy over 200,000 US
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, both Home Affairs Minister Dumiso Dabengwa and Police
Commissioner Augustine Chihuri have exonerated the force for
using live bullets when ''circumstances demand''.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Hits 40-Day High, Stocks Rebound in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar hit a 40-day high of
108.60 yen in Tokyo today under the continuing influence at
subsided expectations of higher Japanese interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The dollar went above the 108 yen line for the first time since
April 18.
</P>
<P>
An unconfirmed report that the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea is fully prepared to invade the Republic of Korea also
contributed to the U.S. currency's further advance.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was quoted at 108.60-63 yen at 5 p.m., up from
108.17-20 yen at 9 a.m. It was changed hands between 107.90 yen
and 108.60 yen during the day session.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the dollar's strength against the yen caused market
players to buy shares on the stock market, prompting stock prices
to bounce back strongly.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed at
21,944.53, 1.13 percent up from 244.77 points at Monday's close.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Inflation Rate in April Lowest Since </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's annual
inflation rate fell to 5.5 percent in April from 6.3 percent in
March and recorded the lowest since 5.1 percent in June 1972,
Central Statistical Services (CSS) said today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Pretoria, the CSS said the consumer
price index from March to April showed a month-on-month increase
of 0.6 percent compared with March's 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The monthly rise of 0.6 percent was caused by increases in the
price indices of clothing and footwear, housing, medical care and
health expenses, transport, and all other items, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, from March to April food prices decreased by 0.1
percent. The annual rate of increase in the food price index for
April was 1.9 percent, which was 1.4 percent lower than the
corresponding rate of 3.3 percent for March.
</P>
<P>
However, the monthly increase of 0.8 percent in the price
index for all items excluding food was mainly caused by increases
in the price indices for non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages,
cigarettes and tobacco, clothing and footwear, and housing, added
the statement.

<HEADLINE> Third World Urged To Address Media Imperialism </HEADLINE>

<P>
LAGOS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has called on third world
countries to use the platform of the Non-Aligned Movement to
address the issue of media imperialism by the western world.
</P>
<P>
This has become imperative in the face of the orchestrated
campaigns of calumny against third world countries, said Nigerian
Minister of the Federal Capital Territory Jeremiah Useni
yesterday at a cocktail party for delegates to the on-going 13th
Inter-Governmental Council on Information and Communication for
non-aligned countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the News Agency of Nigeria today, the minister
specially urged members of the movement to pool their resources
and resist efforts by the west to retard their growth.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Information and Culture Walter Ofonagoro also
restated Nigeria's determination to resist "imperialist
propaganda and smear campaign", adding that these were part of a
deliberate effort to suppress emerging developing countries that
were seen as a threat to their economic dominance.

<HEADLINE> Strong Consumer spending Recovery Forecast in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Consumer spending in Britain is set
to grow strongly in the next three years, providing the best
retailing climate since the late 1980s, retail specialists say in
a report published today.
</P>
<P>
High street spending will be driven by falling unemployment,
now standing at 2.18 million, as well as low interest rates and
boosts to personal income from tax cuts and cash windfalls such as
maturing Tessas (Tax-Exempt Special Savings Accounts), according
to the retail consultants Verdict.
</P>
<P>
The coming general election will mean that growth will not be
dampened by government actions, says Verdict, and they may even be
some small stimulus.
</P>
<P>
"This will lead to a sustained recovery in the housing market,
always an absolute prerequisite of an upturn in Britain's consumer
economy," it says in its latest report.
</P>
<P>
It expects retail spending to rise 25.3 percent to 201 billion
pounds (302 billion US dollars) during the five years to 2000,
with volumes, which exclude inflation, rising 13.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the report says that there will be no return to the heady
1980s credit-driven economic surge and notes that the upturn will
give way to less buoyant conditions in 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
Electrical retailing will see the strongest growth, with
surging sales of computers, software, and games. Long- depressed
areas such as furnitures will benefit from the housing market
revival, but the mature grocery market and clothing will lose
their share of retail spending.

<HEADLINE> UK Left Tories Urge Major to End Beef War with Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Divisions within the British
Conservative party have once more surfaced as the left-wingers
pressed Prime Minister John Major to abandon his policy of
non-cooperation with the European Union over the current beef
crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports here today, the left wing of the
Conservative party warned Major Monday night that he had to stop
his beef war with Europe "at the earliest possible opportunity" or
face desertions from the Tory ranks.
</P>
<P>
Within the cabinet, pro-European ministers are also expected to
urge the embattled prime minister to restore normal relations with
the EU next week, when they hope the EU will lift its worldwide
ban on British beef derivative products, such as gelatine, tallow
and semen.
</P>
<P>
However this campaign has certainly deepened divisions over
Europe within the depressed party as Tory Eurosceptics rally
Monday to urge Major to use Britain's veto at all possible EU
meetings until a lifting of the ban on British beef is in sight.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Britain has blocked a dozen EU decisions in Brussels
in the biggest offensive since Major announced his policy of
non-cooperation on May 21.
</P>
<P>
The decisions included those Britain has been demanding to ease
the bureaucracy hammering small businesses.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Office has also wielded the axe on nine EU measures
involving cooperation over the Third World development.
</P>
<P>
But these steps taken by the British government so far has not
yielded any fruits as Roger Freeman, a government minister for
deregulation in charge of the campaign to press the EU to drop its
ban on British beef, warned today that the beef war would last up
to six years.
</P>
<P>
John Redwood, last summer's beaten leadership challenger and a
kfkfxkvvkfkvkkkk
Banner-bearer of the Eurosceptics, urged Major to stand firm.
</P>
<P>
But some government ministers and senior Conservatives
sympathetic to the EU are reported to have been increasingly
concerned by the influence of Redwood and other Europsceptics on
government policy.
</P>
<P>
One minister was quoted by Financial Times newspaper as saying
that a number of ministers "are very disturbed" by the Eurosceptic
drift in the policy on Europe.
</P>
<P>
Other ministers described Major's policy of non-cooperation
with Europe as an "ineffective and potentially humiliating bluff".
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, a leftwing Conservative member of parliament
George Walden threatened to resign the party wing over the
government's "silly and cynical" approach to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Tory strategists feared that more left wingers would follow the
suit of Walden because the government's majority in the House of
Commons has been reduced to only one.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian cabinet today endorsed
two draft laws aimed at privatize the information sector in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Marwan Muasher told reporters after the
meeting that the two new laws, which will be presented to the
Lower House of Parliament for approval, will provide Jordan News
Agency and Jordan Radio and TV Corporation with financial and

<P>
The cabinet also started debating the press draft law and was

</P>
<P>
The minister added that Jordan's information policy will no
more be the responsibility of the Ministry of Information or the
government, but will be the responsibility of the two
institutions' administrative boards.
</P>
<P>
The two laws are seen here as the first step of what the new
government called the information reform, which will finally lead
to the dismissal of the Information Ministry and the privatization
of the present officially-owned information institutions.

(by Hu Xinrong)
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Namibian Minister
for Prisons and Correctional Services Marco Hausiku has commended
Tanzanian prisons for its mass production which reduces
government's burden to feed prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here today, the Namibian
minister praised the Tanzanian department of prisons for their
efforts to use human resources in economic activities.
</P>
<P>
During his five-day visit to Tanzania, Hausiku visited Iringa,
Morogoro and Mbeya regions where he saw prisoners fully engaged
in economic activities like agriculture, animal keeping and
carpentry.
</P>
<P>
The minister accompanied by five senior prisons officers of
Namibia said the aim of their visit to Tanzania was to learn how
Tanzanian prisons operate.
</P>
<P>
"Namibia is still in need of technical assistance from
Tanzania in running its prisons," said the minister, adding that
Tanzania has more expertise and experience in human resources
utilization.
</P>
<P>
"The use of prisoners in economic activities will reduce
government expenditure in feeding prisoners," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Namibia got independence in 1990 and it has embarked on
reconstructing and reforming including the prisons.

According to the document, the Cabinet is considering launching
a "Smoke-free Schools" campaign in which schools can receive a
special award.
</P>
<P>
The tobacco industry has meanwhile undertaken to stop targeting
its advertising at young people.
</P>
<P>
If more than 25 percent of the visitors at an event are
expected to be young people, there will be no sponsorship or
advertising for tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, posters will no longer be placed at locations
which attract large numbers of young people, such as in cinemas
and in the vicinity of schools.
</P>
<P>
The industry will set up a body in the near future charged with
the preventive testing of tobacco advertising.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet is also seeking to bring a single age limit for the
sale of harmful stimulants.
</P>
<P>
Like the sale of spirits and soft drugs, the sale of tobacco
would then also be subject to a minimum age limit of 18.
</P>
<P>
The vending machine industry will be given the opportunity to
develop a technical alternative which will make it possible in due
course to prevent those below the age limit from obtaining
cigarettes from these machine.
</P>
<P>
A smoking ban has applied since 1990 in around 75,000 public
spaces.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring of compliance with this ban is to be improved,
and the possibility of obtaining specific exemption is to be
scrapped.
</P>
<P>
Smoking bans are also to be introduced in subsidised art and
cultural centres.

</P>
<P>
Gaddafi, who arrived in Cairo on May 24 for a visit to Egypt,

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Deports Illegal Mozambican Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has deported
more than 1600 illegal Mozambican immigrants to their home
country for the past few weeks, the Department of Home Affairs
said today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Pretoria, a department spokesman
said: "We have a train running to Mozambique every week,
returning an average of 500 illegal immigrants at a time
depending on the numbers which have to be repatriated."
</P>
<P>
The repatriation is being done in terms of a long-standing
policy, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The department denied reports that South Africa "dumped" 1000
repatriates in Mozambique last week, saying an orderly process
was being followed to return such aliens to their home country.
</P>
<P>
Radio Mozambique said on Monday that a South African train
dumped 1000 Mozambicans in their home country's border town of
Ressano Garcia after rounding them up for being illegal in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
High unemployment in Mozambique has driven thousands of
Mozambicans across the border in search of jobs in South Africa,
where police have been accusing illegal Mozambican immigrants of
involvement in crime.
</P>
<P>
Forced repatriation has for some months been the focus of
bilateral discussions between South Africa and Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, President Nelson Mandela agreed to order a
suspension of forced repatriations of illegal immigrants in a meeting
with his Mozambican counterpart Joaquim Chissano.
</P>
<P>
The issue was also raised in Maputo earlier this month at the
first meeting of the permanent joint commission for cooperation
between the two neighbouring southern African countries.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique is calling on South Africa to limit the deportation
of its citizens to 100 at a time. It also asked South Africa to
give at least three days' notice of repatriation dates and
numbers.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Economic forecasters said
here today that the U.S. economy appears safe from recession at
least through next year and inflation would remain in check.
</P>
<P>
The consensus of the 38 professional forecasters surveyed by
the U.S. National Association of Business Economists predicted
that the U.S. economy measured by the gross domestic product (GDP)
would grow 2.2 percent this year following an increase of 2
percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. economy would decelerate slightly to 2.1 percent in
1997, according to the survey conducted earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
In their examination of economic growth, the forecasters
expected that GDP in the country would grow at an annual rate of 3
percent in the current quarter, up from 2.8 percent in the first
three months, but slow to 2.2 percent in the final six months.
</P>
<P>
Many economists said target of the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
for economic growth is between 2 percent and 2.5 percent--a rate
they believe would sustain the five-year-old expansion without
heating inflation.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the forecasters contended that spotty signs
of rising prices were temporary and inflation would remain in
check, while the low unemployment rate would be little changed.
</P>
<P>
The consensus forecast called for the unemployment rate to
remain unchanged at 5.6 percent this year and rising slightly to
5.7 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
On the monetary policy of the Fed, a separate survey of 143
association members found only 20 percent expected Fed
policy-makers to cut short-term interest rates in the next six
months to stimulate economic growth. Sixty-eight percent predicted
no change and 10 percent expected a tighter monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
The survey found the forecasters expected the U.S. inflation
would grow to 2.9 percent this year and 3 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The survey panel members expected that much of the recent hike
in inflation rates--caused by rising oil and grain prices-- will
be reversed over the remainder of this year and next year," the
survey summary said.

WASHINGTON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Police departments may use their
share of funds from confiscated property to pay salaries of
replacements for officers assigned to federal task forces, the
U.S. Treasury Department said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers estimated the
change, effective immediately, could provide an estimated 75
million dollars a year.
</P>

"It means more money for more cops on the streets," he said in
a telephone conference call with Los Angeles area police
officials. "It will add up enough to make a real difference in the
crime effort."
</P>
<P>
The funds are the result of seizure and forfeiture of property
acquired by criminals through illegal activities. They are shared
equally by the federal, state and local law enforcement agencies
participating in the task forces.
</P>
<P>
Until now, Treasury permitted use of the funds for equipment,
training and other activities, but not to replace officers
assigned to task forces.

NAIROBI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is
optimistic that this year's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will
improve by 5.5 per cent compared with that of 1995.

</P>
<P>
The GDP in real terms improved by 4.9 per cent in 1995

National Independence Party (UNIP) Kenneth Kaunda today vowed to
fight the newly-signed constitution amendment bill (new
constitution) because "it is discriminatory".
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally here, Kaunda said, "the constitution is an
apartheid constitution that grades the citizens and it can not be
accepted."
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, also former Republican President, said UNIP would
carry out peaceful "war" to struggle for what he termed as "the
second independence" in bringing about a constitution which would
be non-discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
He denied allegations of advocating violence. "I am a non-
violent freedom fighter and the second war against the present
government will demand the people to take a positive role of
taking self-pain to achieve the result, but I can not rule out
the use of other means," he noted.
</P>
<P>
President Frederick Chiluba signed the constitution amendment
bill today and therefore, the new constitution came into
immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
One clause in the constitution stipulates that only second
generation zambians are qualified for standing as presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
According to the new constitution, Kaunda is barred from
contesting presidency in elections because his parents are
malawians. enditem

<HEADLINE> London, Dublin Fail to Reach Agreement on Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Britain and Ireland failed today to
reach agreement on arms decommissioning by rival paramilitary
groups in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and Irish Foreign
Minister Dick Spring held three-hour talks in Dublin, but they
failed to resolve their differences on this issue ahead of the
planned all-party talks on June 10, according to reports from the
capital of the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers conceded that there was still a lot to be
done on this matter, but they played down the speculation of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The two sides vowed to open all-party talks on the future of
Northern Ireland in time on June 10, and "nothing is going to
deter us from that," said Mayhew after today's talks.
</P>
<P>
Spring was quoted as saying that he had a satisfactory meeting
with Mayhew and they were making progress on arms decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers decided to meet again next week.
</P>
<P>
With important issues to be resolved in the run-up to all-party
talks, Irish Prime Minister John Bruton indicated this afternoon
that he was willing to meet his British counterpart, John Major,
face-to-face if needed and at short notice.
</P>
<P>
Both governments know that resolving the issue of arms
decommissioning could play a crucial part in ensuring that
all-party talks are as inclusive and meaningful as hoped for.
</P>
<P>
The Unionists in Northern Ireland in favor of British rule over
the crisis-laden province want disarmament as the first item on
the agenda of all-party talks.
</P>
<P>
But Republicans in favor of reunification of the whole island
of Ireland stress that disarmament should be discussed when
political talks on settlement of the conflict in Ulster has made
significant progress.
</P>
<P>
BBC TV held this evening that a summit between Major and Bruton
would be needed to break the deadlock.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Shipowners Protest High Port Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Shipowners and operators in Nigeria
today voiced their protest against the country's import duty
report charges and port tariff, describing them as ''too high.''
</P>
<P>
They said that on average, they have to make seven different
payments on a bill of landing before they could clear a
container, including import duty bill, surcharge, value added
tax, service charge and others.
</P>
<P>
The exorbitant charges at the seaports have led to a lull in
port activities as most shipowners and operators now divert their
goods to neighboring countries, they said.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that Nigeria is losing an estimated 769 million
US dollars revenue on tanker freight because of the diversion of
vessels to neighboring ports.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian Institute of Shipping, which represents
shipowners and operators of the country, has urged the Nigerian
ports PLC to review its tariff to make it more attractive for
ship operators and stop the diversion.
</P>
<P>
It will help accelerate the development of the maritime
indusrry, the institute said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Chairman of Negotiations Presents Draft Nuclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A complete draft nuclear test ban
treaty was presented today at the Geneva-based Conference on
Disarmament (CD) as the test ban negotiations which have been
going on over the last two years are entering the final stage.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands chairman of the negotiations, Jaap Ramaker,
told a news conference after he presented the draft text to the CD
meeting this afternoon that the draft "intends to stimulate the
negotiations and offer the negotiating countries the opportunities
to reach final agreement by the end of June."
</P>
<P>
He said the new draft text was largely based on the current
negotiating document, the so-called "rolling text," and was "a
balance between what is desirable and what is attainable."
</P>
<P>
Admitting that not everybody would be satisfied, Ramaker said,
"there are still a few weeks of very hard work before us."
</P>
<P>
According to Ramaker, the draft treaty includes a prohibition
of all nuclear weapon test explosions and all other nuclear
explosions as proposed by the Australian delegation.
</P>
<P>
To verify compliance with the future treaty, a worldwide
network of monitoring stations will be established which applies
the four monitoring technologies -- seismic, radionuclide,
hydroacoustic and infrasound. To process all the data coming from
these stations, an international data center will also be set up.
</P>
<P>
The draft treaty furthermore provides for an on-site inspection
regime that intends to balance the need for swift and effective
inspections with the national security concerns of States Parties.
</P>
<P>
According to Ramaker, this balance could include the
possibility to use technical information coming from sources other
than the treaty's international monitoring system as the basis for
an inspection request and the provision that any inspection
request be approved by a simple majority by the Executive Council
of the future treaty organization.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the entry into force of the treaty, the draft text
introduces the concept that the 37 states, on whose territory
stations from the primary seismic monitoring network or
radionuclide laboratories are located, must have ratified the
treaty for it to enter into force.
</P>
<P>
By adopting this formula, the draft text wants to make sure
that the five declared nuclear weapons states, namely the United
States, Russia, France, Britain and China, and all the so-called
nuclear threshold countries like India, Pakistan and Israel are on
board before the treaty's entry into force, experts said.
</P>
<P>
According to Ramaker, the negotiating parties had been asked to
forward the draft text to their capitals for further instructions.
At the meantime, the chairman would conduct informal consultations
with all parties next week in Geneva to explain the thinkings
behind his draft treaty.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Investors Shift to Riskier Mutual Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 29 (Xinhua) -- American investors are pouring
cash into mutual funds that invest in stocks, with more people
steering growing amounts of that new money to the riskiest type of
funds.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the New York Times, there is a move
back toward what is called a more aggressive growth funds, which
offer investors the highest potential rewards but come with a
greater degree of volatility and risk of loss.
</P>
<P>
The Investment Company Institute, a mutual fund trade group,
reported that aggressive growth stock funds took in more than
one-third of the 20.6 billion U.S. dollars of net inflows recorded
by domestic stock funds in April.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, it said, the group took in 29 percent of the 17.5
billion U.S. dollars that flowed to domestic stock funds in March,
and 27 percent of the total net inflows in January, when domestic
stock funds took in a record 20.9 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
So far in May, the trend has continued, and perhaps
accelerated, according to AMG Data Services, a California based
company that monitors the changes of mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that stock funds of all types, including those
that invest assets overseas, recorded net inflows of 26.3 billion
U.S. dollars in April, up from 20.5 billion U.S. dollars in March
but below January's record 28.9 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The paper also reported that bond funds, by contrast, recorded
net inflows of 518 million in April, down from 1.8 billion U.S.
dollars in March and their lowest since last December.

<HEADLINE> China to Revise Law On Mineral Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- China's State Council today adopted
in principle a draft revision of a law governing mineral resources,
which will be submitted to the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress for examination.
</P>
<P>
The Law on Mineral Resources went into effect in 1986 but some
of its clauses have become outdated with the on-going
establishment of a market economy.
</P>
<P>
One of the changes is related to the approving of
privately-owned mining companies and foreign investments in the
field of mineral resources, and the right to impose administrative
punishments for infringements.
</P>
<P>
The State Council also decided today to make regulations on
film management.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the draft film regulations stresses that
making, importing, exporting, distributing and showing films must
be in line with serving the people and socialism.
</P>
<P>
The film regulations clarify arrangements on the issue of
licenses and the protection of intellectual property rights.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Parliamentary Speaker
Ahmad Al-Saadoun today called on his country to freeze or severe
altogether relations with Libya to protest Libyan leader Muammar
Gaddafi's statements against Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The speaker's remarks came in response to Gaddafi's statements
made in Cairo, Egypt, Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
While addressing teachers and students at Cairo University,
Gaddafi, who arrived in Egypt on May 24 for a visit, was
reported to have claimed that Kuwait should not have been declared
an independent state as long as it was unable to defend itself.
</P>
<P>
Saadoun told the local Kuwaiti News Agency that reaction to
Gaddafi's statements "should not be dealt with through routine
diplomatic measures, but through a decisive and firm action that
should either freeze relations or sever them altogether."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait immediately voiced its resentment and condemnation
Tuesday night over Gaddafi's remarks, saying the remarks were
damaging its independence and sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Becomes World's Most Competitive Country: WEF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Singapore becomes the most
competitive country in the world in 1996, followed by Hong Kong
and New Zealand, said a competitiveness report published today by
the World Economic Forum (WEF).
</P>
<P>
The United States comes in the fourth, followed by Luxembourg,
Switzerland, Norway, Canada, Taiwan of China and Malaysia, on the
WEF list of competitiveness -- the ability of a country or region
to achieve sustained high rate of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Among the top 10, five are small, open economies practising low
tax rates, with New Zealand being the new star thanks to a decade
of structural and policy reforms, concluded the report which used
new measuring approaches highlighting an economy's institutions
and strategies.
</P>
<P>
"In our meaning, an economy is 'internationally competitive' if
its institutions and policies will support sustained and rapid
economic growth," said U.S. professor Jeffery Sachs, chief advisor
of the report.
</P>
<P>
The WEF said its approach excluded the element of domestic
economic strength while putting in new variables such as the index
of real exchange rate misalignment in assessing a country's
prospects for economic growth in the next five to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Eight factors were considered in the new approach: the openness
of economy, the role of government budget and regulation,
development of financial markets, labor market flexibility, the
quality of infrastructure, technology, business management, as
well as the quality of judicial and political institutions.
</P>
<P>
The report said the U.S. falls below the front-runners chiefly
due to its high government spending and taxation, while Japan
stood at 13th mainly as a result of its continuous closure to
international trade and finance as well as fiscal problems.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) is further down on the list, Britain
ranks 15th after Denmark. Germany, the economic powerhouse of EU,
comes in 22nd, before France but after Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Like many other EU countries, Germany suffers from the heavy
fiscal burden of social welfare system, government problems and
poor labor market flexibility.
</P>
<P>
China ranks 36th. The report said China enjoys an economic
growth dividend because of its initial low level of income, and
like many of today's reformers including Russia, India and Brazil,
China is still in relatively early stage of achieving competitive
policies and institutions.
</P>
<P>
Among the developing countries, Thailand comes in the 14th
place on the list, while Chile is the highest ranking developing
country outside Asia, in the 18th place.
</P>
<P>
Russia is the least competitive of all the 49 countries and
regions included in this study based on 155 latest quantitative
and survey data, due to poor performance in almost all factors
concerned.
</P>
<P>
On top of the competitiveness rankings, the WEF report this
year for the first time introduces a market growth index, designed
to help guide investment of companies.
</P>
<P>
It lists the United States, Japan, Germany, China, Britain,
France, Canada, South Korea, India and Taiwan as the world's top
10 most attractive markets.
</P>
<P>
Global Competitiveness Report was first launched by the WEF in
1979. It had since co-worked with the Institute for Management,
Development (IMD) in Lausanne on seven reports. The WEF parted
with the IMD this year for differences over how the report should
evolve.
</P>
<P>
In the IMD's 1996 competitiveness report, the top 15 countries
are: the United States, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, Denmark,
Norway, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Germany, New
Zealand, Canada, Chile, Sweden and Finland.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Praises China's Contribution to Children's Welfare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior United Nations Children's
Fund official today praised China for its remarkable achievements
in children's welfare.
</P>
<P>
A. H. M. Farook, UNICEF's operations Area Officer for China and
Mongolia said that China, a leading developing country in the
world, "can be very proud to tell the whole world what can be done
with limited resources to help its children to grow healthily and
happily."
</P>
<P>
China's child population accounts for one-fifth of the world's
total.
</P>
<P>
"The reason behind the tremendous achievement is China's long
tradition of caring for children both at home and in the society,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"What's more is that Chinese people have always been given
special attention to children who are in special need."
</P>
<P>
The UN official made the remarks when addressing a group of 50
children and staff from the Beijing Children's Welfare Home at the
Shangri-la Hotel, Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-foreign joint venture hotel invited the orphans to
share snacks, sing, dance and play games at a park inside the
hotel for a "Share the Sunshine" party, as a prelude to
celebrations to mark the forthcoming Children's Day.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Children's Welfare Home, set up soon after New China
was founded in 1949, has currently more than 400 children.
</P>
<P>
A leading official of the welfare institution said that the
children live a happy life and that the agency spends 400-500 yuan
a month for an average orphan. An average Chinese employee earned
440 yuan a month during the first quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
Gu Xiaojin, deputy secretary general of the China Youth
Development Foundation (CYDF), said that besides the government,
people from all walks of life have contributed to the welfare of
the Chinese children.
</P>
<P>
She said that CYDF initiated the Project Hope in 1989, which
calls on people across the country to donate money to help poor
children to continue their schooling.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, she said, CYDF had collected nearly
700 million yuan in donations, which has funded the establishment
of 2074 Hope primary schools and enabled more than 1.25 million
dropouts to return to school classrooms.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A decisive goal from Naoki Soma
helped Japan come from two goals down to beat Mexico 3-2 and take
the three national Kirin Cup in Fukuoka on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Kashima Antlers striker beat two defenders and rounded
goalkeeper Jorge Campos before firing home in the 82nd minute.
</P>
<P>
Mexico went 2-0 up in the opening 16 minutes. First Joaquin Del
Olmo scored with a diving header from a Ramon Ramirez free
kick. Then Ricardo Pelaez finished off a three-man move involving
Del Olmo and Luis Garcia.
</P>
<P>
Despite intense Mexican pressure, Japan pulled one back in the
36th minute through Hiroaki Morishima and they equalised just
after the start of the second half.
</P>
<P>
Campos, who now plays with the Los Angeles Galaxy, dived to
punch a Morishima shot, but Kazuyoshi Miura fired the ball onto
the left post and then beat a Mexican defender to get the rebound
into the net.
</P>
<P>
The Mexicans fought hard for a win that would have given them
the Kirin Cup, ahead of the home side and Yugoslavia. But Soma's
goal gave Japan their second win in the tournament and their third
Kirin title.
</P>
<P>
Mexico and Yugoslavia, who drew 0-0, both finished with one
draw and one defeat but Mexico took second spot on goal
difference.

<HEADLINE> China to Transform 40,000 Packaging Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- China is set to be wrapped up in a
large-scale technical transformation of its 40,000 packaging
enterprises in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The '96 World Packaging Conference opened in Beijing today with
an official from the China Packaging Technology Association saying
that China suffers huge losses each year from poor packaging.
</P>
<P>
China plans a full scale upgrade of its packaging industry in
the coming years, supported by foreign funds and technology.
</P>
<P>
The official said that with the rapid development of food,
cosmetics, toy, medicine, textile, ceramics and chemical
industries, and the processing of agricultural and side-line
products, and especially with the sharp rise in their output and
exports, even stricter requirements are being placed on the
packaging industry.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, China will introduce advanced equipment,
high-grade materials, funds and new technologies to upgrade the
industry.
</P>
<P>
"It is a rare opportunity for overseas investors to explore the
Chinese market and make their fortunes during the period," he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China's packaging industry packs
industrial and agricultural products worth three trillion yuan
(about 361 billion US dollars) and export commodities worth 100
billion US dollars per year.
</P>
<P>
Its output value soared to 114.5 billion yuan in 1995 from 7.2
billion yuan in 1980. And its 1995 output value accounted for
1.85 percent of China's total industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years China's packaging industry spent one
billion US dollars on equipment imports, and invested 40 billion
yuan in fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
China's packaging industry is expected to yield an output value
between 211 billion yuan and 220.4 billion yuan at the year 2000
with an annual growth rate of 13-14 percent.
</P>
<P>
Raul C. Hernandez, chairman of the World Packaging Organization
(WPO), spoke highly of China's booming packaging industry in an
exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China's packaging industry should make
greater efforts to gain a foothold in world markets.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that WPO, founded in 1968, has organized
a global meeting in China. The event has attracted 680 firms from
52 countries across the world.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Policy-Makers Confused over Ties with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The local press today said Iranian
foreign policy-makers are obviously confused in choosing a policy
line toward the most populous Islamic country of Egypt in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Kazim Khansari, director of the Arab Middle East and
North Africa department in the Foreign Ministry, denied his
remarks made in Damascus in regard to relations between Iran and
Egypt, the local press reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official also rejected reports by the Egyptian
Middle East News Agency and the German Koln Radio in which he was
quoted as saying that Tehran would like to raise its ties with
Cairo in all fields, including the political and economic sectors.
</P>
<P>
With regard to improvement of relations between Iran and Egypt,
Khansari told Iran's official news agency IRNA that he had merely
said that since Iran and Egypt enjoy good cooperation with each
other at international forums, they should also try to expand
their cooperation and improve their economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Observers here note that the latest statement by the Iranian
Foreign Ministry official could be interpreted as an official
retreat from his previous stance toward Egypt under the
tremendous pressure from Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
The statement also reflects the contradiction or difference
between Khamenei and moderate President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani,
who declared that Iran had decided to improve its relations with
Egypt in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Within two months, President Rafsanjani twice called for
improvement of relations between the two Islamic countries. He
said, "Our ties with Egypt is not good enough at present. We are
planning to improve our ties economically, culturally and
politically."
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani's statement seems to anger Iranian Supreme Leader
Ali Khamenei whose speeches have been hostile and often insulting
to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei and his supporters, including the hardline Iranian
newspapers, oppose the establishment of close ties with Egypt
because of its good relations with Israel.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 29 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province,
one of the country's most vigorous coastal economies today
defended its protection system on intellectual property rights,
and slammed charges from United State.
</P>
<P>
An official with the province's IPR working conference office
described US complaints as "groundless charges.",
</P>
<P>
He said that the province has realized a remarkable progress in
IPR protection in recent years and had taken a series of severe
measures against copyright pirates.
</P>
<P>
A statistics report in Guangzhou shows that between last
September and March, the province inspected nearly 30,000 shops
and companies, seized more than 1.38 million items of pirated
video and audio products, and shut down more than 1,000 businesses
tied up with IPR infringements.
</P>
<P>
A number of markets involved in illegal trade of video and
audio products were deprived of business licenses. And the
province's 1,829 public laser disc (LD) booths, where LDs were
publicly shown for profits, were shut down together with four
local plants accused of pirate LD production.
</P>
<P>
In Shenzhen, the first special economic zone of China, police
seized nearly 100,000 fake CDs, VCD and CD-ROMs on January 19 at
an underground CD factory.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jiakun, director of the province's social culture
management office said that an IPR protection system has been
basically established to cover the whole province.
</P>
<P>
Since last year laser disc manufacturing licenses were
re-registered during a province-wide rectification drive, and IPR
supervisors were nominated in all these plants.
</P>
<P>
In addition, an association for software copyrights protection
was launched in the province, and an all-round investigation of
illegal trade of audio and video product licenses was launched early
this year.

<HEADLINE> College Graduate's Employment Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The General Office of State Council
has issued a circular urging the country to pay close attention to
the employment of this summer's college graduates.
</P>
<P>
The circular calls for the employment of college graduates to
be guaranteed, and that bottlenecks in job seeking by students
should be quickly eased by governments at all levels.
</P>
<P>
The circular says all the college students sponsored by the
state should be ensured job opportunities after graduation.
</P>
<P>
China launched an overall reform in its college education
system in 1992, lowering state sponsorship for freshers ( first
year students), and gradually raising annual education fees.
</P>
<P>
The State Council encouraged local governments to solve
employment problems for graduates by "administrative means" if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
Local governments are forbidden from charging extra fees on
graduates whose jobs are arranged by the state.
</P>
<P>
The circular said that orderly job seeking should be ensured,
and any allegations of favoritism will be investigated and
severely dealt with.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the political and ideological education of graduates
should be also strengthened, the circular noted.
</P>
<P>
China's college graduates usually leave campus in June and
begin work in July and August.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Shuttle Endeavour Returns From 10-Day Voyage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. space shuttle Endeavour
returned to Earth this morning after a successful 10-day voyage
highlighted by the release of two experimental satellites.
</P>
<P>
Although ground fog and low-level clouds had threatened to
delay the touchdown, the shuttle safely landed at 7:09 a.m. EDT,
right on time as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The six crew rocketed into orbit on May 19 and a day later
released a satellite that carried an inflatable antenna. Once free
of Endeavour and filled with nitrogen gas, the antenna was blown
up to the size of a tennis court.
</P>
<P>
NASA is interested in inflatable antennas because they would be
lighter, more reliable and less expensive to launch than the
common mechanical crafts.
</P>
<P>
After an hour of measurements, the antenna was separated from
the satellite which was retrieved on May 21. The antenna burned up
when it re-enter the atmosphere one day later.
</P>
<P>
The crew released the other satellite one May 22, which is
designed to test whether spacecraft can fly straight using their
mass and Earth's magnetic field instead of jet thrusters.
</P>
<P>
Astronauts caught up with the 80-pound satellite three times
over the following five days to measure its stability from within
600 meters.
</P>
<P>
The astronauts also finished more than two dozen technology and
biomedical experiments, including work with thousands of embryonic
sea urchins, starfish and blue clams.

<P>
PARIS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen-year-old Martin Hingis of
Switzerland defeated German Petra Bergerow Wednesday, becoming the
first player to enter the third round of the French Open tennis
championships.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss, seeded 15th, outplayed her German counterpart with
an identical 7-5, 7-5 and eased into the third round in Paris for
the second time of her young career.
</P>
<P>
Hingis upset top seed Steffi Graf in the quarter-finals of this
month's Italian Open in Rome.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Swedish veteran Mats Wilander went down to American
Todd Martin 6-4, 7-6, 6-2 in the men's singles.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Sweden, becoming the youngest men's winner here
in 1982, could not find his old form in Wednesday's match and was
just too slow comparing to his U.S. rival, who reached the third
round for the third consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
Mary Pierce of France struggled to beat Madagascar's Dally
Randriantefy 6-3, 2-6, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
After winning the first set 6-3, Pierce, the Australian Open
winner in 1995, made many unforced errors and sent a couple of
balls into the stands in anger.
</P>
<P>
She lost the second set and again looked in trouble in the
start of the third. But she finally held on and sealed the hard
match in just under two hours. Endtiem

<HEADLINE> Somali Warlord Aidid Captures Small Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Militiamen supporting Somali
warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid captured an aircraft with the pilot
and two Somali passengers in the remote town of Huddor, 450 Km
northwest of the capital two days ago, local radio reported
today.
</P>
<P>
According to Radio South Mogadishu supporting General Aidid,
the case of the plane is under investigation while the Australian
pilot is being questioned by General Aidid's militia officials in
South Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The radio, quoting spokesman of General Aidid, accused the
plane of making an unauthorized landing at Huddor Airstrip.
Sources close to General Aidid also indicated the plane will as
well be accused of supplying medicine and weapons to the
opposition guerilla fighters known as the Rahanwein Resistance
Army (RRA) based in the central town of Beletuien where the plane
is believed to have flown from.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft chartered from the neighboring country of Kenya
is the kind of those small planes that is usually hired by the
Somalis to transport the green narcotic leaves of Khat and
passengers.
</P>
<P>
Such small aircraft are similarly used by the international
relief agencies for the delivery of the limited humanitarian
assistance to the vulnerable Somalis.
</P>
<P>
However, independent sources indicate that the plane has
transported and delivered Khat to Beletuein and on its way back
to Nairobi had faced a technical problem which forced it to land
at the nearest airstrip which happened to be Huddor.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that both the pilot and plane will be fined and
released since reports indicated that an underground negotiations
are currently continuing between General Aidid's men and some
members from the agency that owns the plane over the safe release
of both pilot and plane.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Thailand Agree to Establish Closer Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Thailand today
agreed to promote their cordial bilateral relations and strengthen
their economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a dinner in honor of Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-Archa, who arrived here today for a two-day official visit,
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said he was deeply
convinced that the depth of mutual understanding and trust between
Malaysia and Thailand had significantly contributed to the overall
atmosphere of peace and cooperation in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, Mahathir said Malaysia and Thailand can do more to
increase direct investment, an area of weakness in bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
He said Thai direct investments in Malaysia last year amounted
to only 552 million Malaysian Ringgit (about 220.8 million US
dollars), while the Malaysian investment in Thailand had been
equally unimpressive. But he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
He urged Malaysian and Thai investors to explore new investment
and joint-venture opportunities, either in the domestic market or
in third countries, particularly in manufacturing, transportation
and communication sectors.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malaysia welcomes Bangkok's initiative to forge
land communication links between Thailand and the countries of
Indochina, which will bring the region closer and also enable
Malaysia to gain access to these countries.
</P>
<P>
"I see similar motivation when Thailand agreed with Malaysia to
promote the idea of a growth triangle involving northwest
Malaysia, southern Thailand and northern Sumatra (IMT-GT),"
Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
Banharn said in his speech that Thailand and Malaysia should
promote even closer cooperation as this was important for the
future prosperity and well-being of the peoples of Malaysia and
Thailand and the stability and durable security of the region.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the two countries must not let minor issues
that may arise to distract their close ties, but he did not say
what issues existing distracted them from their cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Push Safety Nets on Excise Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
continue to push for the incorporation of safety nets,
particularly the indexation of tax rates with inflation, into the
compromise formula on excise tax.
</P>
<P>
Finance Undersecretary Milwida Guevarra said today that the
compromise formula approved by the lower house on Tuesday has pro
ad valorem provisions.
</P>
<P>
The compromise formula, according to Guevarra, will in the long
run result in an ad valorem system due to the absence of an
indexation provision that will allow the specific tax to increase
with inflation.
</P>
<P>
According to the house version, the government would impose
both the specific and ad valorem taxes while firms would pay
either the specific or ad valorem tax depending on the volume of
revenues. The specific tax would serve as the floor tax.
</P>
<P>
However, Guevarra warned that without the provision to allow
the specific tax rates to go up as prices move up, the specific
tax would be easily surpassed in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo said that once
the excise tax issue is finally resolved by Congress, it can move
more quickly on the other tax component of the comprehensive tax
reform package.
</P>
<P>
Revenues from the excise tax comprise some 50 percent of the
reform package.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Peres Casts Votes in Tel Aviv, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEL AVIV, May 29 (Xinhua) -- In a relaxed atmosphere in
striking contrast with the heated campaign across the country for
the general elections, Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres today
cast his ballot here and pledged to make more efforts to bolster
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In what he described as the "most crucial elections" in the
Israeli history, Peres voted for both the prime minister and
the knesset (parliament) at Arazim primary school, situated on
Levyatan Street in northern Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Peres, looking sanguine and in high spirit, entered the polling
station set up in a sports room of the school under tight security
at 10:05 a.m. local time (07:05 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The incumbent prime minister, who was greeted warmly by a
four-member staff at the registration table, wrote his votes in
secret behind a U-shaped screen.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law of the country stipulates that "the Knesset shall
be elected by general, national, direct, equal, secret and
proportional elections."
</P>
<P>
Peres, in black western suit, walked steadily toward the box
and stood for a while to allow the press to film and take pictures
of him. Then, he cast his ballots -- yellow for the prime minister
and white for parliament -- into the box amid exploding flash-guns
of the Israeli and foreign photographers and cameramen.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who has made enormous efforts in the
peace-making with the Arab countries, said after casting his
vote:"I think this is a historic decision, I hope the nation
chooses the parth to peace."
</P>
<P>
On the prospect of the new Middle East which he has advocated,
Peres said that the Middle East will turn from war to peace, from
the old politics of hatred to the new call for economic
development.
</P>
<P>
"We live in an age ... for economy, for science, for education,
for freedom. There are no borders," he noted, saying that the old
borders lose their significance in the age of missiles and
non-conventional weapons, if strategically speaking.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that a turn will be made from a world of
animosity and dangers to a world of global market and open
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"Science doesn't have frontiers, technology doesn't have
frontiers, missiles don't have frontiers, -- a world doesn't have
frontiers, it's really an open world," he said, describing the
future he has adamantly called for.
</P>
<P>
Peres praised U.S. President Bill Clinton as "a real friend of
the Israeli people," saying that there are two roads, of which one
is correct.
</P>
<P>
He implied that the U.S. is supporting his policy, especially
in regard to the ongoing peace march in the region, which also has
due influence over the political set-up across the world,
including the upcoming U.S. general elections to be held later
this year.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question raised by Xinhua on how long it will
take for Israel to reach an agreement with Syria and Lebanon if he
is elected, Peres said he did not know the duration "because it
does not depend only upon us, it also depends on Syria, and the
Syrians are not known for their quickness."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether there are some people in the Labor Party who feel
depressed with the election campaign, Peres said jokingly that
probably some people in the media feel depressed.
</P>
<P>
Peres heads the Labor Party in a close race with the Likud bloc
led by his arch rival Benjamin Netanyahu, who cast his ballot in
Jerusalem today.
</P>
<P>
Posters and banners put up in support of Peres or Netanyahu
were seen on buildings in both Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and on many
hill slopes on both sides of the 62-kilometer highway between the
two cities.
</P>
<P>
Peres stayed in the polling station for 15 minutes. Before he
left, he asked the reporters: "Did you vote?" It triggered
laughters from the journalists, both Israeli and foreign.
</P>
<P>
Some 26,000 police and soldiers were deployed throughout Israel
on the election day amid persistent warnings that Islamic militants
would try to disrupt the vote with terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
Troop reinforcements were sent to roadblocks to enforce a tight
blockade of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Israel's 3,933,250 eligible voters can, for the first time,
cast a separate vote for prime minister in addition to their vote
for a party in the 120-member Knesset.
</P>
<P>
There are 7,021 polling stations operating for
the general elections, including 6,900 in Israel and 121 abroad
for Israeli diplomatic missions and shipping vessels. The
balloting is scheduled to be concluded at 10:00 p.m. (19:00 GMT)
today.

the Tide Festival at the Qiantang River in Zhejiang Province; and,
</P>
<P>
-- Held in Winter will be Harbin's Ice and Snow Festival and
Guangzhou's Flower Market.
</P>
<P>
According to He, the Organizing Committee for Visit China '97
has been set up, with Vice-Premier Qian Qichen as honorary
chairman, and He himself as chairman.
</P>
<P>
Bao Peide, first deputy director of the committee and deputy
director-general of the Civil Aviation Administration of China
(CAAC), noted at today's conference that civil aviation is closely
bound up with tourism, and that CAAC will support the effort of
CNTA.
</P>
<P>
He said that a total of 89 new air routes, including 80
domestic and nine international routes, will be established this
year. In the meantime, 27 airplanes will be added to the fleet.
</P>
<P>
Bao announced that air fees for domestic travellers will not be
raised next year.
</P>
<P>
The cost of domestic flights for foreign tourists organized by
travel services will be cut by 20 percent in the brisk season, and 30
percent in the slack season, he said.

</P>
<P>
In 1995 over 46 million international tourists arrived in
China, generating about 8.73 billion US dollars of foreign
exchange revenue.
</P>
<P>
As a result, China became the world's 5th largest tourist
destination, and the tourism revenue rose to ninth ranking in the
world.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Accused of Siding With Somali Factional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Somali faction leader Ali Mahdi
Mohamed today made a strong accusation against the government of
Malaysia for siding with his rival, Mohamed Farah Aidid.
</P>
<P>
A press statement issued by Ali Mahdi's Somali Salvation
Alliance (SSA) said the support of the Malaysian government to
General Aidid is popularly a rejection and indignation to the
general interersts of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The statement described the role of the Malaysian government
towards Somalia's affairs as uneven approach and unbalanced
treacherous attitude. SSA called upon the Malaysian government
not to be mislead by what they called the mischievous games of a
clique of renegades and civil war mongers.
</P>
<P>
The statement warned that Malaysia's involvement in Somali
affairs will affect negatively the future relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi Mohamed said any investment and economic aid from
Malaysia will be welcomed by his faction if it only contributes
to the reconstruction and the recovery of Somalia, any deviation
from this line is " an open support to the perpetuation of civil
war and waste of public money on destructive purposes," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
SSA urged the government of Malaysia to take part in the
re-establishment of a government of a national unity as a result
of a genuine national reconciliation process. SSA said that any
action contrary to the spirit of promoting such reconciliation
process will be "unacceptable and will meet stiff resistance from
the Somali people".
</P>
<P>
the strong condemnation by SSA came after a three member
delegation from the Malaysian government made pledges of
technical and economical support to the socalled government of
General Aidid. The Malaysian assistance will include the
construction of a commercial bank and a telecommunication center
for General Aidid in south mogadishu, according to Aidid's radio
in south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time a Malaysian delegation visits south
Mogadishu this year. In January, a high level delegation from the
Malaysian government visited Mogadishu and held talks with
General Aidid's administration.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta Calls for End to Anti-personnel Landmines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas here today called for an end to the use of anti-personnel
landmines, saying Southeast Asia has experienced its cruelty,
especially during the Cambodian conflict in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
Opening a regional seminar on international humanitarian law,
he said, "We saw how the use of such mines has killed or maimed
the large percentage of the non-combatant population."
</P>
<P>
More than 110 million active anti-personnel landmines are
scattered in 64 countries today, and more than 25 countries are in
crisis because of these landmines, officials at the seminar said.
</P>
<P>
They said, every month more than 2,000 people are killed or
maimed by anti-personnel landmine explosions.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar is co-sponsored by the Indonesian Foreign
Affairs Ministry, the International Committee of the Red Cross and
the Red Crescent (ICRC) and the Indonesian Red Cross Society
(PMI).
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia strongly supports mine clearance efforts in affected
states which will have to be pursued for many decades. Indonesia
will also undertake efforts to strengthen international
cooperation and assistance in this regard," Alatas noted.
</P>
<P>
On the international humanitarian law, he said it is important
mainly because armed conflicts within states have increased at an
alarming rate in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
"Although wars between or among states have sharply declined,
wars within states are increasing," he added.
</P>
<P>
Thus the international humanitarian law is badly needed as it
limits the use of force in armed conflicts and protect the people
in the process, he said.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Appeals to Gaddafi Not to Expel More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today appealed to visiting Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi not to
expel more Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after his talks with Gaddafi, Mubarak
said, "I hope that my brother Col. Gaddafi will reconsider the
decision to return the Palestinians so that the issue will not be
complicated further."
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi told the press conference that he would soon deport
thousands of Palestinians to get them "closer to their homeland."
</P>
<P>
"By doing this, we are expressing our belief that the
Palestinian issue has been resolved and the Palestinians have
national authority, a president, a land and flag," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Mubarak told reporters that he believes the Palestinian
issue has not been completely resolved.
</P>
<P>
Libya last year expelled 2,000 Palestinians, and hundreds of
them have been stranded in a no man's land on the Egyptian-Libyan
border. Gaddafi later halted the expulsions after protests from
Arab countries and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
</P>
<P>
But Gaddafi, who arrived in Egypt Friday, did not say today
when he would resume the deportations.
</P>
<P>
He also urged all Arab countries to let the Palestinian
refugees return home.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that the issue of Jerusalem could not be solved
unilaterally, but has to be solved through negotiations between
the Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want Jerusalem to be the capital of their
future independent Palestinian state, but Israel has said that
Jerusalem would remain the Jewish state's united and eternal
capital though Prime Minister Shimon Peres has agreed to negotiate
the issue in the Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
On the Libya-West crisis over the Lockerbie issue, Mubarak
expressed hope that a solution which would satisfy all parties can
be reached following the American presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi, who ends his visit to Egypt today, had to travel to
Egypt by land because of a U.N. ban on air travel in or out of
Libya.
</P>
<P>
Libya is seeking an end to the U.N. air, arms and diplomatic
embargo imposed after the country refused to hand over two Libyan
nationals suspected of bombing a Pan Am passenger plane over
Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. A total of 270 people were killed in
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
The talks held between Gaddafi and Mubarak during the visit are
believed to have also dealt with the U.S. allegation that Libya is
building an underground chemical weapons plant.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, in an interview with the London newspaper Financial
Times Tuesday, rejected the U.S. charges, saying that he sent
Egyptian inspectors to the site at Tarhunah, 65 kilometers
southeast of Tripoli and they found nothing.
</P>
<P>
"There is no chemical installation for the time being and there
is no activity there," Mubarak said in the interview. Libya says
that the site is part of an irrigation project aimed at bringing
water from aquifers in the south to cities on the Mediterranean
coast.

the head-line Likud party, said that people have to choose "the
future bright with hope, peace and security and the present offers
little hope, peace and security."

President Ezer Weizman also voted in Jerusalem. He said that
Israel and Arabs are committeed to the peace process and, if there
are ups and downs, the process will continue.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Lawmaker-Elect Indicted for Election Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean Supreme Public
Prosecutor's Office today indicted a lawmaker-elect from the main
opposition party National Congress for New Politics (NCNP) without
physical detention on election fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
Lee Ki-moon, elected from Inchon City, was charged with
electioneering before legally allowed and buying votes by
distributing about 60,000 U.S. dollars to voters during campaign
for the National Assembly elections in April.
</P>
<P>
Lee is the sixth successful candidate in the general elections
who has been indicted for campaign violations.
</P>
<P>
The other five, who were also indicted without physical
detention, include two lawmakers-elect of the ruling New Korea
Party (NKP).
</P>
<P>
The prosecution will soon indict without detention another
lawmaker-elect of the ruling NKP, Kim Il-yoon, who allegedly
distributed some 40,000 U.S. dollars in gifts and money to voters.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Kim will be the seventh and the last
lawmaker-elect to be indicted for election fraud.
</P>
<P>
In April's elections, the ruling NKP headed by President Kim
Young-sam won 139 seats, 11 short of a simple majority in the
299-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
But the party later induced opposition and independent
lawmakers-elect to join it to secure 151 seats -- more than half
of the total parliamentary seats.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Clark Development Corp. (CDC)
will raise one billion US dollars via issuance of asset-backed
securities to partly fund the integrated development of the former
US military air base.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by CDC President Romeo David today when the
Philippine firm signed a contract with US-based engineering firm
Louis Barger International Inc. for the development of a
masterplan for the CDC's 29,000 hectare sub-zone.
</P>
<P>
He said that the fund will bankroll the development of the
airport just in case the Asia's emerging Dragon Corp. of the six
Chinese-Filipino tycoons back out from their commitment.
</P>
<P>
Within three to five years, the CDC hopes to generate 500
million US dollars through their asset certificates.
</P>
<P>
He noted that four American firms have been committed to
investing 200 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> HK Dollar Debt Market Expects Robust in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The growth of the Hong Kong
dollar debt market will accelerate in the coming years, according
to Hong Kong Bank's monthly Economic Report.
</P>
<P>
Initial figures show that activity on the Hong Kong dollar debt
market remained robust in 1996 because of increased expectations
that interest rates will bottom out during the year, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The prospects are better than at any previous time although it
may take several years before the local debt market matures, it
said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the introduction of the Mandatory Provident Fund
(MPF), the region's infrastructure financing requirements, the
H-bond market for the Chinese mainland companies, and the proposed
mortgage corporation will all play a part in the demand and supply
of Hong Kong dollar debt instruments in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Total issues amounted to 15.9 billion HK dollars (2.05 billion
US dollars) in the first quarter this year, it said.
</P>
<P>
Although the growth momentum of Hong Kong's debt market slowed
slightly in 1995, the volume of Hong Kong dollar debt issues was
still substantial in 1995 when compared with previous years.
</P>
<P>
Private sector debt issues of Hong Kong dollar debt securities
amounted to 61 billion HK dollars (7.87 billion US dollars) in
1995, compared with 66 billion HK dollars (8.51 billion US
dollars) in 1994, according to Hong Kong Monetary Authorities.
</P>
<P>
Public sector debt issues were boosted by the issue of the
7-year Exchange Fund notes in late 1995. The first issue of the
notes extended the local benchmark yield curve further, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The successful launch of Hong Kong dollar debt issues by the
Chinese mainland entities recently has also paved the way for the
establishment of the H-bond market.
</P>
<P>
The Mandatory Provident Fund scheme will provide about 30 to 40
billion HK dollars (3.87 to 5.16 billion US dollars) in new debt
issues every year.

<HEADLINE> JLG Experts Hold 8th Meeting on HK Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Experts on the Sino-British Joint
Liaison Group (JLG) today began their eighth meeting on Hong
Kong's budget for the transition period.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing before the two-day meeting, Chinese
representative Chen Zuo'er said that on the basis of the consensus
reached by the two sides at the previous meetings, the Chinese
experts will take into account the British side's difficulties in
the process of budget drafting.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Chen said, there will be no difficulties for the two
sides to cooperate in the joint drafting of the 1997-98 budget.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the wish that today's meeting would be a good
start.
</P>
<P>
On the project of Western Corridor Railway, Chen said that the
Chinese side has always supported the construction of the railway,
for it will benefit Hong Kong's development, especially the
development in the northwestern part of the New Territories.
</P>
<P>
He said that last year, the Chinese side suggested its British
counterpart put the issue on the agenda of JLG experts meetings
for the project will mainly be carried out after July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the British side had not briefed the Chinese
side on the project until the end of February.
</P>
<P>
At the one-hour briefing, the British side claimed the
construction work of the railway will begin in 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the following three months, the Chinese side received
nothing of the related materials on the project, he added.
</P>
<P>
But according to a local media report, a Hong Kong government
official said Tuesday that the project would start in early 1997,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"How can the British Hong Kong government start the project in
early 1997 without consultation with the Chinese side?" he
queried.
</P>
<P>
Chen urged the British side to put the issue to the JLG for
discussion and said that without consensus reached by the two
sides on the project, the British Hong Kong government should not
approve any contract on the project.

<HEADLINE> China Promotes Mild Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- China's savings deposits by urban
dwellers have continued to rise in the wake of cuts in interests
rates.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China (PBC), China's administrative bank,
decided to cancel deposits with inflation subsidies in April, and
a month later they cut down interest rates for deposits and loans.
</P>
<P>
Despite the increase in deposits, China has seen a decline in
fixed deposits and increase in current deposits, according to
sources from the PBC.
</P>
<P>
The ups and downs of deposits have triggered concerns by many
economists about whether China's recent move to mildly stimulate
economic growth will result in a new round of inflation.
</P>
<P>
Many financial experts in Beijing shared the view that interest
rates, as the indirect means of economic adjustment, will be
flexibly readjusted to match the national economic situation. The
move, they hold, will gradually be accepted by the general
public. In this way, interest rates can be an economic indicator
which can mirror China's economic performance and tendency.
</P>
<P>
China must maintain a relatively fast economic development
speed so that it can bring its debt-ridden state-owned enterprises
out of red and provide more job opportunities for workers, said an
expert.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Statistical Bureau, China put in 6,000
billion yuan in fixed assets investment in the five years from
1991 to 1995, about 2.1 times of that in the previous five
years. The move has greatly improved the country's infrastructure,
which has, for years, hampered China's fast economic growth. The
good agricultural harvest last year will also help with this
year's economic performance.
</P>
<P>
A joint study by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and
State Statistical Bureau says that China's national economy will
maintain an appropriate growth this year. This year's domestic
gross product will jump by around ten percent, more or less the
same with that of last year, the study shows.
</P>
<P>
But economists also warned that the Chinese government should
increase loans to those state-owned enterprises whose products
sell well and ensure capital supply to the basic industries such
as agriculture and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
As China will put inflation control as a priority in its macro
economic control task in the coming five years, its economic
growth will see a mild, gradual and steady development. Therefore,
each adjustment will not be big in scale, said a top financial
expert.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Medics have been winning the battle
to help local people in northwest China's Gansu Province shake off
the suffering and misery brought on by endemic diseases.
</P>
<P>
The number of patients with endemic diseases has dropped from
more than 1.5 million to 800,000 at present, thanks to prevention
and treatment measures adopted over the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent of 86 counties of the under-developed
Gansu Province bore the brunt of attacks of endemic diseases, such
as iodine deficiency (idd) and fluorine poisoning, in the past
decades.
</P>
<P>
The province economy was hindered as a result by serious
shortages of labor and an increasing poor population.
</P>
<P>
In order to control Kaschin-Beck disease, which causes severe
limb deformities, and Keshan disease, causing heart impairment and
even death, the local government provided salt with rich content
of vital minerals to high-risk areas.
</P>
<P>
So far there are few Kaschin-Beck cases among Gansu children
under the age of 12, according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
By the use of iodine-rich pills and iodized salt among
residents, the number of patients with iodine deficiency disease
has dropped from 850,000 in the 1970s to 130,000 nowadays.
</P>
<P>
Purification facilities have been used in nearly 1,000 villages
of 700,000 people, which helps decrease the levels of fluorine in
drinking water, preventing fluorine poisoning.
</P>
<P>
Other kinds of endemic diseases, such as leprosy, have also
been controlled in recent years.

</P>
<P>
EU diplomats in Dar Es Salaam insisted that they have their
own evidence to prove human rights violations in Zanzibar.
</P>

EU diplomats said, "whatever goes on in the isles will
definitely affect the union government," emphasising that the EU
recognizes Zanzibar to be an integral part of the United Republic

<HEADLINE> China to Provide Scientific Training For 200 Million Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The China Association for Science
and Technology today announced its plan to train 200 million rural
residents in science and technology in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
"We will co-operate with all relevant departments, such as
agricultural and educational departments, the Youth League and the
Women's Federation, to achieve this goal within the Ninth
Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) period," an official with the
association said.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, he noted, over 200 million farmers have
received training in science and technology from science
associations and departments for the promotion of agricultural
sciences across the country.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Guangya, chairman of the China Association for Science and
Technology, said that, with the assistance of various science
groups and scientists' associations, a network for the spreading
of science and technology widely in the rural areas has come into
existence, which is based on science associations and federations
at county or township level.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years science associations at all levels have
taught one or two items of practical technology to some 3.15
million rural households, among which 1.92 million have shaken off
poverty, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that to enhance the capabilities of officials
at grassroots levels, his association has worked with government
organizations throughout the country in training officials in
practical technology.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the China Farmers' Correspondence University for
Agricultural Science and Technology is now playing a significant
role in the teaching of practical technology in rural areas, with
27 branches at provincial level and more than 1,000 at city and
county levels, he pointed out.

JOHANNESBURG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The long-awaiting local
government elections in Western Cape started this morning
incident-free in all the poll stations throughout the province.
</P>
<P>
About 1.3 million registered voters will go to the polling
stations to cast their ballots in the first non-racial local

due to the ward boundary disputes among the main political

</P>
<P>
Despite some early morning hitches which delayed the opening
of the polling booths in some areas, the elections were
proceeding steadily but slowly by mid-morning Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Problems appeared included lack of voters' rolls or ballot
papers, and wrong papers had been delivered to some polling
stations.

<HEADLINE> Current World Situation Conducive to China's Development: Qian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The current world situation has
provided a rare opportunity for China to speed up its economic
development, Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the fifth national congress of the China Association
for Science and Technology in Beijing, Qian said that around the
turn of the century, the world economy is entering into a fairly
long period marked by relatively stable growth.
</P>
<P>
"This situation is conducive to the growth of economies in
various countries. It has also provided a rare opportunity for
China to fulfil its Ninth Five-Year Plan and attain its long-range
objective for the year 2010," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the ongoing congress will
certainly facilitate the implementation of the strategy of
"invigorating China through science and education and enable
China's scientific and technological undertaking to become even
more prosperous."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, he outlined the salient characteristics of the
current international situation.
</P>
<P>
"The transition from an old pattern in international relations
to a new pattern has not yet been completed," he said.
</P>
<P>
The momentum of relaxation is growing further, but there are
still many unstable and uncertain factors in the world, he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Qian, the international situation can be
summarized as "no major wars being fought with minor conflicts
constantly emerging". "The overall situation is relative
relaxation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the tendency of multipolarization in the world is
further developing, and the new outline of new world pattern of
"one superpower, multipowers" is tending to be clear, the
vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
Competition with cooperation, friction with compromise,
respecting each other, while restricting each other, have become
the leading characteristics of relations between big powers, Qian
said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the role of economic factors in international
relations has become increasingly outstanding. The more the
economy develops, the more it is dependent on science and
technology, he added.
</P>
<P>
All countries, particularly the major powers, are launching
all-out competition in comprehensive national strengths between
each other, with their economies as a core and science and
technology as a guiding factor, the vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
The status and future of all the countries in the next century
will be decided, to a large extent, by the outcome of that
competition, he concluded.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier called on Chinese scientific workers to take
the advantage of the favorable domestic and international
situation and make their due contributions.
</P>
<P>
Qian also briefed about 1,000 delegates about Sino-Russian
relations, Sino-US relations, the issues of Taiwan and Hong Kong
and President Jiang Zemin's recent visit to six African countries.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was presided over by Zhu Guangya, president of the
China Association for Science and Technology.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- East Asia and the Pacific Region
will attract one fifth of total tourist arrivals worldwide by the
year 2010 to become the most visited destination second to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the "Asia-Bound" Travel Congress here today, Antonio
Enriquez Savignac, secretary-general of the World Tourism
Organization (WTO), said tourist arrivals in the region are
expected to grow by 7.6 percent annually between 1990 and 2010,
the fastest among major destinations in the world.
</P>
<P>
Tourist arrivals in East Asia and the Pacific region reached 84
million in 1995, ranking third after Europe and Americas. The WTO
chief predicted that the arrivals would surge to 229 million in
2010.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote speech titled "World Trends in the Tourism
Industry", Savignac said that Asia-Pacific countries will continue
the strong performance achieved over the last decade into the next
century.
</P>

He contributed the consistent tourism growth to the economic
importance of the East Asia and the Pacific region, effective
promotion by airlines and travel agencies, more disposable income
and more leisure time.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Locals of the ethnic Miao group
living in exotic mountain villages in southwest China's Guizhou
Province benefit economically from tourism as a growing number of
tourists are flocking to treat themselves to unique folklore
culture.
</P>
<P>
Hospitality has made the Langdeshang Village in southeastern
Guizhou, where 140 Miao families live in compact community , a hot
tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the small village received more than 20,000 Chinese
and overseas tourists who were said to be intoxicated with the
sweet locally-made rice wine and the equally sweet songs and
dances of the Miao girls and boys.
</P>
<P>
Tourism brought about 300,000 yuan (36,1400 US dollars) of
income to the village with a population of over 600, enabling the
originally poor villagers to buy such luxuries as camera and
television sets.
</P>
<P>
Tourism has actually become a pillar economy of the whole
Miao-Dong Autonomous Prefecture in Guizhou, according to Pan
Xinxiong, director of the Tourism Bureau of the prefecture.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture has opened 39 scenic and folklore spots to
overseas tourists, catering to over 200,000 Chinese and some
13,000 overseas tourists last year.

<HEADLINE> Peres, Netanyahu Cast Ballots in Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel's prime ministerial
candidates Shimon Peres and Benjamin Netanyahu both expressed
confidence of scoring a win after casting their ballots this
morning in an election that will determine the course of the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a historic decision. I hope the nation chooses
the path to peace," said Peres at a polling station in the Tel
Aviv suburb of Ramat Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Pre-election polls indicated Peres' challenger Benjamin
Netanyahu, chairman of the hard-line Likud party, has narrowed the
gap to a virtue tie with Peres since the two held a televised
debate on Sunday. Peres was said to have a 5 percent lead before
the debate.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was equally upbeat about his win after receiving some
leading ultra-Orthodox rabbis' blessings and support.
</P>
<P>
"I had moments of hesitation, but I will tell you who I voted
for. I voted for Netanyahu," said the Likud party leader this
morning after casting his ballot near his Jerusalem home.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the concern that peacemaking would stop if he was
elected, Netanyahu said: "I think all the interlocutors in the
Arab world can be our partners in peace on this basis,
reciprocity ... security."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is slightly ahead among the 3.4 million Jewish
voters, but a strong turnout among Israel's 540,000 Arab voters
could turn the tide for Peres and his Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
This year's elections are considered as the most important in
Israel's 48-year-old history. For the first time, Israel's over
3.93 million eligible voters will cast a separate ballot for the
prime minister in addition to the vote for a party in the
120-member Knesset, or parliament.

SEOUL, May 29 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's current account deficit
in April reached 2.21 billion U.S. dollars, the highest monthly
deficit since 1950, according to the Bank of Korea here today.
</P>
<P>
The figure brings the total for the first four months of the
year to 6.56 billion dollars, up 53.6 percent from the same period
last year. The four-month deficit surpassed this year's target of

<P>
The current account comprises trade in goods and services as
well as investment income and government payments.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's trade deficit in April soared to a record high of
1.51 billion dollars as a result of faster import increase in the
month, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
April's invisible trade, such as insurance, travel and
transport, incurred a deficit of 580 million dollars. The balance
of unrequited transfers, including remittances of school tuition,

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel's new prime minister will
be elected in today's general elections, for the first time by
separate direct ballot.
</P>
<P>
The law for direct election of the prime minister, which was
aimed at giving more power to the premier, was passed by the
parliament in 1992.
</P>
<P>
In previous elections, the leader of a party which won the
general elections automatically became the country's prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
The candidates for the premiership in today's elections were
nominated by a party, or parties, with at least 10 seats in the
outgoing Knesset (parliament), or by 50,000 enfranchised
persons. The candidate must be a citizen at least 30 years of age,
and head his/her party's list of candidates for the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
If the outgoing prime minister has served for seven consecutive
years, he/she may not stand for re-election.
</P>
<P>
The results of the elections shall be published within 14 days
from the election day. The candidate who receives more than half
of the valid votes is elected prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Should no candidate receive more than half the valid votes,
run-off elections will be held between the two front-runners after
the publication of the election results.
</P>
<P>
In the run-off race, the candidate receiving the largest number
of valid votes will become prime minister.

JOHANNESBURG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela will
step in the rising tensions between labor and business, hoping to
lessen public mud-slinging and bring ties between the two sectors
back on track, a local daily "the Star" reported today.
</P>
<P>
There has been widespread concern over the damage the rift
between labor and business could cause to the economy and foreign
investors' perceptions of South Africa, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The tense relations between labor and business got worsened as
the two sectors clashed with each other over the issues such as
privatization and bank rate hike.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, concerned about rising tensions between the two
sectors, has asked for a meeting with the Congress of South
African Trade Unions (COSATU) to discuss the restructuring of
state assets, Presidential Spokesman Parks Mankahlana said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mankahlana said the union federation has accepted the offer,
and a date for the meeting is expected soon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General
Cyril Ramaphosa said yesterday that the labor-business conflict
was manifesting itself in many other ways and is becoming a
conflict between employers and their workers in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
Ramaphosa said he believed that the differences between
business and labor could be resolved, saying all that needed is
to sit down across the table and discuss the areas of difference.
</P>
<P>
"The public squabbles between labor and business are not
furthering the country in any way. We need to get these two
sectors to put the interests of the country first," he added.
</P>
<P>
With regard to privatization to which COSATU is strongly
opposed, Ramaphosa said the ANC and the government supported "a
reduction of the public sector in areas where such a move would
increase efficiency and promote affirmation action."

<HEADLINE> Archeologists Discover 7,000-Year-Old Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
discovered a ruined village on the banks of the Yellow River that
dates back 7,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The site was first noticed when workers were building a major
water-control facility in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in
north China.
</P>
<P>
According to a study which has just been completed, the village
belongs to the Yangshao Culture, a representative of Neolithic Age
culture in central and north China.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists found that the villagers lived in huts built over
pits. They also found some wall bricks with pottery rings, which
are believed to be the oldest room ornaments ever discovered.
</P>
<P>
Near the village the archeologists also discovered tombs,
remains of ancient cities, parts of the Great Wall and temples,
dating from the Neolithic Age to the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
Researchers said that the discoveries may offer clues to the
origin and evolution of different ethnic groups in the country, as
well as the relations between China's central region and its
frontiers.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Britain Not to Follow U.S.' Anti-Iran Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- An official daily here today called
on Britain not to follow the anti-Iran policy of the United
States, saying that it would not be in the interest of London.
</P>
<P>
The English daily Tehran Times rejected the statement by
Nicholas Soames, British Minister of State for the Armed Forces,
who said that Iran "appears hostile to the stability of the
region."
</P>
<P>
It fell short of clarifying when and where the British official
made the remarks.
</P>
<P>
With strong background of the Foreign Ministry, the daily
noted in its editorial that historically, the United Kingdom has
not been very friendly with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
"At a time when all members of the European Union
unequivocally stress Iran's crucial role in maintaining peace and
regional security, Soames, whose obedience to Washington is
crystal clear, repeats what the U.S. has been baselessly alleging
over the past years," it said.
</P>
<P>
The paper stressed that Britain had better not follow the way
the Americans have chosen. The hostile attitude is not in
London's interest.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the U.S. and Iran have been hostile since
Washington severed ties with Iran in 1979, after militants stormed
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 American hostages for 444
days.
</P>
<P>
Last June, U.S. President Bill Clinton banned U.S. companies
from investing in Iran or doing business with Iranian
companies. The move tightened a U.S. trade embargo imposed on Iran
shortly after its 1979 Islamic revolution.

<P>
HOHHOT, May 29 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States have
reached agreement to jointly develop solar and wind energy in the
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Pang Shuqin, an official of the regional office in charge of
new energy, said that the two countries will invest in a
wind-driven, solar power grid specially-designed for farms in
remote areas.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that the annual wind power potential in Inner
Mongolia, a renowned pastoral area in China, equals the amount of
energy generated by 332 million tons of standard coal, and
accounts for 20 percent of China's total wind power resources.
</P>
<P>
Pang noted that the first construction phase of the grid will
include 150 households, and each will be supplied with 400 to 450
watts of electricity.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost 500,000 US dollars, which will be shared
equally by the two investors.
</P>
<P>
The project will be implemented this year after the plan is
approved by government departments of the two countries.

Chinese honorary President (1893-1981).
</P>
<P>
Soong was the widow of famous Chinese revolutionary Dr. Sun
Yat-sen, who led the overthrow of the last feudal dynasty, the

China (1912-1949).
</P>
<P>
Li Chuwen, vice-president of the China Welfare Institute
founded by Soong in 1938 in Hong Kong, said at the forum that to

to China's reform, as well as the unification of the motherland
and world peace.
</P>
<P>
Huang Hua, president of the China Welfare Institute, sent a
written speech to the forum, which was held by his institute,
Shanghai Society of Soong Ching Ling Studies, and the Management
Committee of Former Residences of Sun and Soong in Shanghai.

Shanghai and Soong's friends, praised her as a great soldier of
patriotism, nationalism, internationalism, and communism
throughout her life.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Guerrillas Attack Israel-Backed Militia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Guerrillas of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, announced that they
carried out a bombing attack at a patrol of the Israeli-backed
South Lebanon Army militia this morning, causing heavy casualties.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio confirmed the attack in the Israeli
self-proclaimed "security zone" in southern Lebanon, noting that
two militiamen were killed by the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Israeli security sources in the area as saying that
the SLA militia and Israeli forces opened fire at the guerrillas
who launched the attack.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Islamic Resistance, the military wing of
Hezbollah, said that one group of its fighters detonated an
explosive device at 7:25 a.m. local time (04:25 GMT) today when a
SLA patrol was passing on the road between the villages of Deir
Seriyan and Alman in Marjayoun area in the occupied border strip.
</P>
<P>
The militant Shiite organization added that several elements
of the SLA patrol were killed or wounded.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese police sources in the south reported that the Israeli
artillery in the buffer zone shelled the Litani river basin in
southern Lebanon since 10:00 a.m. (07:00 GMT), causing no
casualties.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes flew reconnaissance missions over Nabatiyeh
and Saida, and even rushed to the sky over the capital around
11:10 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
Today's attack at the Israeli occupied buffer zone in southern
Lebanon came when Israelis began voting in a crucial national
election to show their choice between Shimon Peres, the incumbent
Israeli prime minister, and his rightwing challenger Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
It is commonly believed that the election will determine the
course of the Middle East peace process when it is entering a
crucial phase.
</P>
<P>
Southern Lebanon, the last active battlefront of the
Arab-Israeli conflict, had witnessed a relative calm in the past
10 days.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Lebanon reached a cease-fire understanding on April
26, which ended 16 days of Israeli military strikes in southern
Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Experts Call For Yangtze Nuclear Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts have proposed
building an inland nuclear power plant on the banks of the
country's mighty Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
They want the plant to be located in Maozishan, in the eastern
province of Jiangxi, starting up during 2001-2005.
</P>
<P>
Planned capacity for the project, with four generating units,
will total four million kw.
</P>
<P>
Experts have suggested building two generating units in the
Tenth Five-Year Plan Period (2001-2005) as the first stage of the
project.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary feasibility study report on the construction of
the plant has recently passed the appraisal of experts from the
China National Nuclear Industry Corporation, the Ministry
of Power Industry and other relevant authorities.
</P>
<P>
The site is located in Pengze County in Jiujiang Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the county is an ideal place for a nuclear
power plant. It has convenient traffic facilities with the
Beijing-Kowloon railway running across it. As the site is on the
Yangtze River, the plant will have sufficient water supplies for
cooling purposes. And few people will have to be resettled as the
county is sparsely populated.
</P>
<P>
The county, in between the East China Power Grid and Central
China Power Grid, is a gateway for power transmission from the
Gezhouba Power Station and the future Three Gorges Power Station
to the eastern part of the country.

<HEADLINE> Iran Worries about U.S. Relay Station in Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran today publicly expressed its
concern regarding the construction of a Voice of America Radio
relay station in Kuwait, an official press said here today.
</P>
<P>
Iran's concern was voiced by Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas
Maleki in a report carried in today's Persian-language daily
Iran. He had expressed Iran's concern during his recent visit to
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Maleki said that Iran's political, economic and cultural ties
with Kuwait are close, and that is why Kuwait should not do
anything that would weaken these ties.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official asked the Kuwait authorities to take the
necessary steps to alleviate Iran's concern about the
construction of VOA relay.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti authorities try to justify his country's decision
on the construction of the station on the grounds that it would be
involved in the propagation of news and information in the region
and it is not intended to be used against Iran.
</P>
<P>
According to Iranian sources, Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani and Majlis (parliament) Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri
have already voiced similar sentiments while meeting with visit
Kuwait officials in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
There was rumor spreading in Tehran that the United States will
use its relay station in Kuwait to beam special Persian language
programs to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has termed the use of
satellite television as one of the biggest instruments of the
American cultural imperialism.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei has openly supported the ban of satellite dish in the
country and repeatedly called on the society to observe the
Islamic value against Western cultural invasion.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Combined efforts of the Chinese
Academy of Agricultural Sciences and southwest China's Guizhou
Province will aid agricultural development in that poor
mountainous region.
</P>
<P>
Lu Feijie, President of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural
Sciences, and Chen Shineng, Governor of Guizhou Province, recently
signed a joint agreement involving 29 major agricultural
development projects.
</P>
<P>
These high-technology, high-profit endeavors include the
promotion of grain and vegetable production, planting fruit trees,
supporting animal husbandry, and providing meteorological
services, as well as support in other areas.
</P>
<P>
Mountainous areas account for 97 percent of Guizhou's land,
resulting in limited agricultural development in the province for
many years. To date, 8 million people in Guizhou are underfed and
poorly clothed.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1995, the province recorded a population of 35
million.
</P>
<P>
In late April, the CAAS sent 16 experts to 10 counties to
research options for growing vegetables, flowers, tobacco and
oranges, and for meteorological services and animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
The experts said that because Guizhou has rich natural
resources such as water, forests and minerals, conditions are
favorable within the province for farming, and the potential for
development exists with the help of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The CAAS has named Guizhou one of its centers for agricultural
science research.

YINCHUAN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Remains of buildings and shards of
porcelain dating from the Western Xia Dynasty (1038-1227) have
been found in this capital of northwest China's Ningxia Hui

Chinese archeologists say that the relics will contribute to

<HEADLINE> Planning Urged in Yangtze River Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official wants to
better coordinate efforts to develop the Yangtze River economic
belt.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jinhua, Minister in charge of the State Planning
Commission, said this after ten days of study in Sichuan and Hubei
provinces along the Yangtze River, the longest in the country.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this area along the Yangtze River will be the key
region for economic development in the next five to ten years,
perhaps longer.
</P>
<P>
Since the concept of economic development was introduced, the
eight provinces and cities in the region have made significant
progress toward organization, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He said there had been a "lack of planning and coordination"
and that any improvements had been scattered.
</P>
<P>
He noted that duplication of industrial plants and scattered
investments have hindered the economic development along the river.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the country will design policies regarding
financing, taxes, investments and the use of overseas funds to
encourage the coordination of development along the belt.
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials will meet to form plans that could
accelerate the economic development of area, Chen said.

<HEADLINE> China's Rural Economy Well Under Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- China's rural economy is running
smoothly with a bumper harvest being expected this summer, and the
country's food supply well secured.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the Ministry of Agriculture,
there will be a good harvest for grain this summer, as long as the
wheat planting areas of northern China are free of serious natural
disasters in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
Though a drought and rainy weather attacked the north and south
this spring, the growing of summer grain and oil-bearing crops was
protected, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He added that this year will see the second record output for
oil-bearing crops.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the coming harvest to the country's abundant
supplies of aids to boost production ranging from chemical
fertilizers to plastic sheets, and to increased financial input in
the sector. As a result the area under improved crop varieties was
expanded, and farmers began to apply more agricultural technology
to grain production than ever before.
</P>
<P>
Planting areas for paddy fields, wheat and maize were expanded
across the country.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a steady growth in rural economy, Chinese people had
a more enriched food supply this year. In the first quarter, the
country produced 146 million pigs and 1.57 billion domestic fowl,
up 13.7 percent and 21.3 percent, respectively, over the
corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
There was also a combined output of 12.85 million tons of meat,
beef and mutton, 13.5 percen higher than the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the January-April period, the fruit production generated a
year-on-year increase of 16.1 percent, hitting 5.24 million
tons. And it is estimated that the area under vegetables this year
will climb to 9.3 million hectares, 467,000 ha more than last year.
</P>
<P>
A galloping growth was also maintained in the country's rural
industry since the start of this year. During the first four
months, China's township enterprises turned out an increase of
225.3 billion yuan in output value, up almost 30 percent over the
same period of 1995. The sales volume stood at 934.3 billion
yuan, which is an year-on-year increment of 33.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
A statistics report released by the State Statistics Bureau
shows that the farmers' income reached 553 yuan in the first
quarter, realizing an increase of 12 percent at last year's
prices.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Tourism authorities in southwest
China's Tibet Autonomous Region are working hard to improve the
management and development of tourism in the area.
</P>
<P>
A quality inspection office was formed in August, 1995, by the
regional tourism bureau in Tibet to better serve domestic and
overseas visitors. It is the first office of its kind in Tibet to
enforce  tourism laws and regulations, and handle tourists'
complaints.
</P>
<P>
This year, the regional tourism bureau plans to employ more
quality inspectors. It also has arranged for "complaint"
telephones to be placed in tourism zones, airports, hotels,
shopping centers and railway stations, so that tourists may
register complaints about services. The telephones will be
operable in Tibetan language, Chinese and English.
</P>
<P>
Local tourism authorities have also drafted regulations that
would oversee services in hotels, travel agencies, dining halls,
and other places open to tourists.
</P>
<P>
To protect the safety of overseas tourists, local tourism
authorities have also urged all tourism departments, travel
agencies, tourism hotels, bus companies and tourism spots to
report within 24 hours any accidents involving overseas visitors.

items, 6,552 publications, 200 mine fuses, 582,000 U.S. dollars
and 229,000 Chinese yuan.
</P>
<P>
Most of these cases were discovered at northern or southwestern
border gates and in big cities.
</P>
<P>
The customs service expects to collect 18,000 billion
Vietnamese dong ( equals to 1.6 billion U.S. dollars) in
import-export taxes in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of this year, the official said, the
service collected 4,400 billion dong ( equals to 400 million
U.S. dollars) in import-export taxes, an increase of 25 percent
over the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Strengthen Trade with Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR RE SALAAM, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania and Russia have
decided to strengthen their historical relationship by increasing
trade through their National Chambers of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
This was resolved here on Tuesday between Dr. David Mwaibula,
President of Tanzania Chamber of Commerce, Industries and
Agriculture (TCCIA) and the Ambassador of the Russian Federation,
Kenesh Kulmatov.
</P>
<P>
"We want to start effective communication and trade links
between our two chambers so that we may shape up our long time
political relationship into a trading one," the Russian
ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
He added such relationship is important at this time because
the two countries have similarities in the on-going structural
adjustment and liberalization of trade affairs.
</P>
<P>
"We want to have very special trade links between investors
and businessmen of our two countries and be able to participate
in the global market together as old friends and partners," he
further said.
</P>
<P>
TCCIA President Mwaibula said the discussions were in a very
preliminary stage but very crucial for Tanzania's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Russia like Tanzania, has decided to let the
private sector play a big role in the economic development of the
country and thus the two has something in common to discuss.
</P>
<P>
"Our two national chambers are going to organize a business
and investors meeting and discussion so that we may compete
fairly and equally as business partners," Mwaibula explained.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania would take advantage of Russia's technology
in mining, infrastructure, telecommunication and roads which are
all important to the country's economic efforts.
</P>
<P>
Mwaibula was elected last Friday to lead a committee which
would prepare modalities for the establishment of trade links
between Tanzania and Europe.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Police Increases Reward to Informers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Zambian police have increased the
reward from 2 million Kwacha (1,666 U.S. Dollars) to ten million
Kwacha for any information that will lead to the arrest of
members of the Black Mamba, a secret anti-government group.
</P>
<P>
Police Inspector-General Francis Ndhlovu announced on Tuesday
that the new offer is meant to encourage the public to come
forward with the information because the members of the group
obviously live within the community.
</P>
<P>
He said though police have received information on the Black
Mamba, more information is needed to enable a crackdown on the
suspects.
</P>
<P>
A fortnight ago, the Black Mamba claimed responsibility for a
bomb blast that caused damage to the State House brick wall
fence.
</P>
<P>
Last week the group caused panic at Lusaka's hotel
Intercontinental when one of its members phoned that a bomb had
been planted in the premises.
</P>
<P>
The secret group has demanded the government withdraw the
amended constitution which bars former president Kenneth Kaunda
from contesting presidency in this year's general elections.

<HEADLINE> Peres, Netanyahu Both Confident of Victory ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel's prime ministerial
candidates Shimon Peres and Benjamin Netanyahu both expressed
confidence of scoring a win on the eve of the most important
elections in the 48-year history of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
"I trust reality more than I trust the polls, and reality is
much more optimistic and determined than the polls which, more
than anything else, reflected the caution of the pollsters," said
Peres, the incumbent prime minister, Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Pre-election polls indicated Peres' challenger Benjamin
Netanyahu, chairman of the hard-line Likud party, has narrowed the
gap to a virtue tie with Peres since the two held a televised
debate on Sunday. Peres was said to have a 5 percent lead before
the debate.
</P>
<P>
"We've won a victory already, the most important one, in our
struggle against terrorism. Dealing with that worried me more than
the campaign, which was the most complicated we've had yet. It was
an election campaign against Katyushas and suicide bombers," said
Peres.
</P>
<P>
Peres was referring to his success in preventing further
terrorist attacks since March after four Islamic suicide bombers
killed 58 people, and the cease-fire reached after Israel launched
in April a massive military operation against Hezbollah militants
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The terrorist attacks erased Peres' previous double-digit lead
over his Likud challenger Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was equally upbeat about his win after receiving many
leading ultra-Orthodox rabbis' blessings and support at the last
moment.
</P>
<P>
"I had moments of hesitation, but I will tell you who I voted
for. I voted for Netanyahu," said the Likud party leader this
morning after casting his ballot near his Jerusalem home.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is slightly ahead among the 3.4 million Jewish
voters, but a strong turnout among Israel's 540,000 Arab voters
could turn the tide for Peres and his Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the last day of hectic electioneering, Netanyahu
visited Shas' 106-year-old Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri who told him
"tomorrow you will be prime minister." Then he went to the Western
Wall to pray for success before flying to Likud branch in
Ashkelon, where he was greeted with "here comes the new premier."
</P>
<P>
However, the Labor camp fired its last salvos of charges
against Likud for inciting racism and disseminating fear. Labor
blasted Likud for employing members of Habad, a nonpartisan body,
to spread rumors of terrorist attacks on election day to sway the
vote in favor of Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The Habad's slogan of "Only Netanyahu -- it's good for the
Jews" aroused strong controversy, but Likud denied any connection
with Habad's campaigning.
</P>
<P>
This year's elections are considered as the most important in
Israel's history, as the voters will directly choose the prime
minister for the first time. The two prime ministerial candidates
hold opposite positions on the future of the nation and the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton called on Tuesday
the Israeli people to continue the peace process. "We believe
that, ultimately, it's the only way to bring peace and security,"
Clinton said, adding the U.S. will share the risks of security
with Israelis when they seek peace.

<HEADLINE> Ramaphosa Supports Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- African National Congress
(ANC) Secretary General and Constitutional Assembly Chairman
Cyril Ramaphosa came out in favor of privatization of parastatals
Tuesday, a local daily "the Citizen" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the annual banquet of the South African Chamber of
Business (SACOB) last night in Johannesburg, Ramaphosa said the
economy required a restructuring of state assets.
</P>
<P>
This applied to instances where restructuring would increase
efficiency, promote affirmative action and empower the
historically disadvantaged, while protecting the consumer and
safeguarding jobs.
</P>
<P>
Ramaphosa, who is to quit parliament and ANC Secretary General
to take up a senior position in the private sector, said the
struggle for democracy in South Africa is not merely the purchase
of white interests by blacks, but to ensure a growing economy.
</P>
<P>
Describing SACOB as the voice of business in South Africa,
Ramaphosa said he would not be moving into the private sector "if
I did not feel there was a bright future for the South African
economy."
</P>
<P>
"I am looking forward to being part of the effort to make
South Africa a prosperous nation," he told the gathering, which
included the country's top business people, cabinet ministers and
senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
The struggle for democracy would continue until each person
could read and write, each child had health-care, every family a
home and every adult a job, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that South Africa needed a commitment
from business to build the nation, assist in economic
empowerment, implement sound and efficient affirmation action
programs and assist in job creation.
</P>
<P>
"Unless business puts its full weight behind the new South
Africa, there is little hope that our young democracy will
survive and there is little hope for our economy to achieve the
heights it is capable of," he said.
</P>
<P>
While referring to the worsening relations between business
and labor over issues such as privatization, Ramaphosa said a new
approach is needed in the relationship between the two sectors.
</P>
<P>
"As we approach the 21st century, we need to develop a new
paradigm for business and labor," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Rural people in China are enjoying
stable social order feel and more secure, thanks to the
governments tough measures against crime.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion was drawn by the Central Committee for
Comprehensive Management of Public Security, which dispatched
investigation groups last month to the municipality of Beijing,
the two autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia and Ningxia, and
eight provinces including Heilongjiang, Shanxi, and Jiangsu.
</P>
<P>
The groups conducted unscheduled visits to rural households,
carried out sample surveys and organized meetings to grasp a
picture of local public security.
</P>
<P>
The committee attributed the better social order to the
responsibility system linking local government leaders with their
local public security situations, as well as to a strengthened
network at grassroot levels engaged in maintaining a secure social
order.
</P>
<P>
However, the committee said that China's public security
situation has not developed evenly and disparity exists in
different places.
</P>
<P>
The committee called for continued and untiring efforts towards
a safer society.

<HEADLINE> Social Security System Introduced in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A social security system has been
introduced jointly by the government, employers and employees in
this largest manufacturing and commercial center in China.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Civil Affairs
said that the system is designed to ensure the basic daily needs
of low-income people, according to the financial capability of the
society.
</P>
<P>
The official said that essential components of the social
security system are a system of insurance for the unemployed and a
system of insurance for old-age pensions.
</P>
<P>
The two insurance systems each have a coverage of 90 percent,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Involved in the insurance for old-age pensions are 28,000
enterprises and institutions, 4.3 million in-service workers and
1.8 million pensioners, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the system of insurance for old-age pensions, an employer
pays 25.5 percent of a worker's wages or salary as insurance and a
worker pays four percent of his wages or salary as insurance.
</P>
<P>
The official said that 13,000 enterprises, or 95 percent of the
total in Shanghai, are involved in the insurance for the employed.
</P>
<P>
A number of companies and institutions have set up funds
totaling 500 million yuan to aid the poor, he said.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Shanghai Charity Fund has raised 60 million
yuan from all parts of the country. It has provided allowances to
1,000 childless old people, financed the training of 1,000
handicapped and jobless workers and provided scholarship to 1,000
students in primary and middle schools and universities.

<HEADLINE> Burgeoning Region Aims More investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to a flourishing financial
environment aimed at attracting foreign investors, seven foreign
firms have joined the Haicang investment region this year.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen from more than 10 countries and areas, including
the US, Britain, Hong Kong and Taiwan, have poured a total of 1.2
billion US dollars into Haicang since the investment region was
organized, said Liu Chengye, deputy mayor of Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
Haicang is located near Xiamen, one of leading economic regions
in Fujian province. There are currently 52 foreign-funded firms in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The money has been invested in quick-earning industries such as
electronics, and also the agriculture industry.
</P>
<P>
Also, 82 companies and firms from domestic regions have fueled
about 20 billion yuan (240 million US dollars) into Haicang.
</P>
<P>
The port city is said to have favorable communication systems,
and a high-speed railway linking Xiamen, Zhanzhou and Quanzhou,
all economically-booming port cities along the coast of Fujian,
near Haicang. Additionally, the Gaoqi International Airport is ten
km from the area.
</P>
<P>
Formed in 1989, the investment region is divided into four
sectors: Haicang port sector, Xinyang industrial sector, south
industrial sector and Haicang new urban sector. The Xiamen
government expects the region to become the city's leading port,
and new industrial and urban area in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen has put 3.7 billion yuan into the investment region to
improve its infrastructure. The region has seen 53 km of highways
extending inside and outside the area, the construction of a
water-supply plant and a power plant, and several new ports.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Hundred of people were left
homeless after at least 54 houses were set ablaze when rebels of
the Lord's Resistant Army (LRA) raided several villages a few
kilometers north of Gulu town, northern Uganda, over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today said after the raids, the rebels
summoned people who live near the Gulu Fort Patiko road and
addressed them, urging them to move away from along the main
roads to at least 5 kms inland, claiming that they would soon
launch an offensive on Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF).
</P>
<P>
The rebels said they were to use heavy weapons which are
likely to affect people by the roadside.

<HEADLINE> Geological Environment Well Protected in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Geological environment of the Tibet
Plateau, reputed as the last "pure soil" on the Earth, is well
protected, while potential geological disasters are effectively
monitored and prevented, according to the relevant department of
the autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
With a complicated geological structure, the Tibetan Plateau is
located on one of China's four major earthquake belts, with high
occurrence of landslides, mud-rock flows, avalanches and floods.
</P>
<P>
A source with the environmental department of the autonomous
region said that due to fast population growth and economic
development in the region, the geological environment in Tibet is
bearing much more pressure.
</P>
<P>
The situation could be worsened by overexploitation of
underground water and heat, as well as the growth of the mining
industry, which would lead to soil erosion, land desertification,
and avalanches and landslides, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, he said, local geologists have studied
a vast area of some 63,000 sq km, in which 254 potential dangers
were detected, as well as the geological situation along 354 km of
roads frequently hit by disasters.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of the study, two of the three county towns under
the direct threat of geological disasters have been moved to other
places, while the other one is choosing a new site," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the Geological Department of Tibet set up a special
center in this capital of the autonomous region, for the survey of
underground water resources and the supervision of the exploration
work, he added.
</P>
<P>
"It now has 67 monitoring facilities in Lhasa alone, nine of
which are included in the national network, while 15,255 items of
data for underground water quality were acquired through some
9,000 tests and analyses over the past five years," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Strict rules have also been worked out by local environmental
departments, he said, to prevent the mining industry from seeking
development at the expense of the environment.
</P>
<P>
"The large-scale inspection on the implementation of
environmental protection laws during 1993 and 1995 successfully
brought rampant exploration of mineral resources to a halt," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Everest Day Observed in Nepal with Environmental </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Nepal observed Everest day today
to commemorate the first human scaling of the world's highest
mountain 43 years ago while concern arose over the environmental
deterioration in the Himalayan region due to increasing
mountaineering activities.
</P>
<P>
Mt. Everest, or Sagarmatha in Nepalese, was conquered for the
first time by Nepali climber Tenzing Norgey Sherpa and New
Zealander Edmund Hillary on May 29, 1953.
</P>
<P>
The 8,848-meter summit of Mt. Everest lies on the border
between Nepal and its northern neighbor China, where people call
it qomalangma.
</P>
<P>
History told that human efforts to conquer Mt. Everest could
date back to 1921 but only 32 years later the endeavor came to
fruition when the two record makers succeeded in their attempt
from the Nepali side.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that during the past 43 years some 400
climbers from different countries had reached the summit more than
600 times from both sides. Some of the summitters conquered it
more than once.
</P>
<P>
Nepali mountaineer Ang Rita Sherpa last week broke his own
record of the number of climbing Mt. Everest. The 48-year-old
owner of a Kathmandu trekking agency, nicknamed "Snow Leopard",
had reached the world's highest summit for 10 times since 1983 and
he never used oxygen support during his climbing attempts.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, an Italian scaled the mount alone without oxygen
setting a new record of solo conquer.
</P>
<P>
Over 30 women had also left their marks on the world's highest
peak, among them Junko Tabei of Japan was the pioneer who climbed
successfully in May, 1975.
</P>
<P>
Records show some 150 mountaineers lost their lives on Mt.
Everest since 1921.
</P>
<P>
This year 57 climbers so far had reached the summit as 14
expeditions were permitted to climb Mt. Everest from the Nepali
side from early this month. Six summitter were reported dead
during their descents from the peak due to bad weather.
</P>
<P>
The increasing mountaineering activities had caused concern
among the public over the worsening situation of pollution in
Nepal's Himalayan region. It was reported garbage heaps left by
mountaineering teams were growing bigger in the area.
</P>
<P>
In response to public concern, the Nepali Tourism ministry has
given priority to pollution control in the Himalayan region in its
mountaineering policy with some strict measures against waste
leaving. Different local and international expedition teams were
also involved in clean-up efforts in the region.

<HEADLINE> Whitewater Defendants Convicted of Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton's
former business partners in the failed Whitewater real estate
venture were convicted of fraud on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A jury of nine women and three man found businessman James
McDougal guilty on 18 of 19 counts and his ex-wife Susan on all
four counts presented against her.
</P>
<P>
The McDougals were partners of the president and the first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Whitewater project.
</P>
<P>
Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker, who was not involved in the
project, was convicted of two of seven counts related to the
mid-1980s fraud scheme.
</P>
<P>
Hours later, Tucker, who succeeded Clinton as governor,
announced he would resign July 15 to work on his appeals.
</P>
<P>
The jury, in the first trial to emerge from the investigation
into the Arkansas venture, deliberated eight days before
convicting all three defendants, media reports from Little Rock,
Arkansas, said.
</P>
<P>
At the White House, Clinton said he feels sorry "on a personal
level" for his three Arkansas friends.
</P>
<P>
Tucker and James McDougal were convicted of conspiring to
arrange nearly 3 million dollars in loans from two federally
backed banks, including the McDougals' Madison Guaranty Savings
and Loan, via fraudulent appraisals, and using the money for
certain business expenses and other improper purposes.
</P>
<P>
Susan McDougal was convicted of fraud, misapplication of funds
and other charges for illegally benefiting from a 300,000 loan
made in the 1986.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution's chief witness, former banker David Hale,
claimed two years ago that Clinton pressured him to make the loan
to Susan McDougal in the mid-1980s when Clinton was governor. An
FBI agent testified that nearly 50,000 dollars of the loan went
improperly to Whitewater transactions.
</P>
<P>
In videotaped testimony played earlier this month for the jury,
Clinton denied exerting any such pressure and said he never talked
to Hale about money and didn't know about the Whitewater
transactions the FBI agent mentioned.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, White House lawyer Mark Fabiani said Clinton
"had nothing to do with the allegations."
</P>
<P>
James McDougal, 55, could get 84 years in prison and 4.5
million dollars in fine. His 41-year-old ex-wife faces as much as
17 years behind bars and a 1-million-dollar fine. Tucker, 52,
could get up to 10 years in prison and a 500,000-dollar fine. A
sentencing date was not immediately set.
</P>
<P>
Hale pleaded guilty earlier this year to defrauding the Small
Business Administration through his lending company, Capital
Management Services Inc., and was sentenced to more than two years
in jail.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers to Grow Vegetables in Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A group of 36 Chinese farmers from
Huangmei County in central China's Hubei Province, flew to Ukraine
earlier this month to carry out vegetable-growing contracts,
blazing a new trail for farmers here to become prosperous.
</P>
<P>
"It is an unprecedented venture for Chinese farmers", said
local officials.
</P>
<P>
These pioneers are from Xumi Village, a densely-populated rural
area short of farmland. However, the village has got rich through
multiple economic operations, with annual average per capita
income hitting 2,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
But a more ambitious economic target has made farmers here eye
international markets.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the concerned departments, the village
succeeded in contracting 60 ha of farmland for vegetable growing
on a farm near Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, with a term of one
year.
</P>
<P>
"This effort will bring our village a net profit of one million
yuan, and each farmer working there is expected to gain an annual
average income of over 12,000 yuan," revealed the head of the
village.
</P>
<P>
He added that the prospects for vegetable production and
marketing in Ukraine are encouraging. Surveys show that cabbages
are likely to be sold at a price equivalent to two US dollars per
kg there.
</P>
<P>
To make the effort more effective, the village has engaged a
senior agronomist and an interpreter from Hubei University and got
ready fine seeds of seven kinds of vegetables, including
cucumbers, corianders, hot peppers and cauliflowers.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Israeli General Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel is holding general
elections today to elect the country's 14th Knesset (parliament)
and new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The framework of the Israeli electoral system is defined in
Article 4 of the Basic Law, which reads: "the Knesset shall be
elected by general, national, direct, equal, secret and
proportional elections in accordance with the Knesset Election
Law."
</P>
<P>
Every Israeli citizen aged 18 or older has the right to vote,
and every citizen aged 21 or older is eligible for election to the
Knesset. The president, state comptroller, judges and senior
public officials, as well as high ranking military officers, may
not stand for election to the Knesset unless they have resigned
their position at least 100 days before the elections.
</P>
<P>
The entire country constitutes a single electoral constituency.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset is elected directly by the voters, not through a
body of electors.
</P>
<P>
All voters are equal in weight and all votes are by secret
ballots.
</P>
<P>
The 120 Knesset seats are assigned in proportion to each
party's percentage of the total national votes.
</P>
<P>
The Central Election Committee, which is headed by a
justice of the Supreme Court and includes representatives of the
parties holding seats in the Knesset, is responsible for
conducting and supervising the elections.
</P>
<P>
The election day is a holiday in order to enable all to
participate. Soldiers on active duty vote in special polling
stations in their units. Special voting arrangements are also
made for prison inmates, as well as for those who are confined to
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Israeli law does not provide for absentee ballots, and
therefore voting takes place only on Israeli soil. The sole
exemptions are Israeli citizens serving on Israeli ships and in
Israeli embassies and consulates abroad.

<HEADLINE> NPC Vice-Chairman Meets European Parliament Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese legislator said
here today that there exist more common grounds than differences
between China and the European Union (EU), and the two sides
should seek common interests while preserving divergences to push
bilateral ties to a new stage.
</P>
<P>
Tian Jiyun, vice-chairman of China's National People's Congress
(NPC) Standing Committee, made the remarks in a meeting with a
16-member delegation from the European Parliament here today.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, headed by Stefano Deluca, is here to discuss
relations between the EU and China.
</P>
<P>
Tian said that China and the (EU) states enjoy a favorable
relationship, and the economic and trade ties between the two
sides have also witnessed fast growth in recent years. He
mentioned the fact that the EU is now China's third-largest
trading partner.
</P>
<P>
The frequent exchange of visits between China's NPC and the
parliaments of the EU countries has helped to increase mutual
understanding and friendship as well as to promote bilateral
relations in all fields, Tian noted.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China and the EU countries share common
interests on many issues while they have some divergences. The two
sides should seek more common grounds and expand their
co-operation, which conforms to the global trend as well as the
interests of all nations, the vice-chairman added.
</P>
<P>
Tian expressed his hope that the European visitors would travel
to more places in China so as to get better acquainted with the
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Deluca told Tian that the current China trip by the delegation,
which is made up of members from all kinds of political parties of
European countries, aims at enhancing mutual understanding. The
delegation has been much impressed by China's great achievements
in its legal system construction, he said.
</P>
<P>
The delegation arrived in China on Sunday at the invitation of
the China-European Parliament Friendship Group of the NPC.

<HEADLINE> Safer Blood Substitute in Sight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese doctor's new discovery
concerning the interaction of hemoglobin and nitric oxide may help
to produce a safer blood substitute.
</P>
<P>
The discovery was made by Jia Li, a doctor at the Dongfang
Hospital in this capital of south China's Fujian Province, when he
was studying for a doctorate in the US.
</P>
<P>
American and Canadian scientists, who have made great progress
in the production of hemoglobin, were all baffled by the problem
of artificial hemoglobin getting rid of too much nitric oxide in
the blood after it enters the human body, threatening the patient.
</P>
<P>
Jia began his study of hemoglobin in the US six years ago, and
released his findings in the American science magazine "Nature"
this March.
</P>
<P>
In his paper, Jia analyzed the dynamic circulation between
nitric oxide and hemoglobin, which transports oxygen to all parts
of the human body and removes carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
A leading scientist and Nobel medicine prize winner said in a
comment, which was also published by "Nature", that Jia had
explained a new physiological theory of the adjustment of blood
pressure and gas exchanges in the human body.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Parliament Approves Law Banning Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Islamists dominated
Kuwait's National Assembly approved a bill on Tuesday night
banning mixed education of male and female in schools in the
country in five years.
</P>
<P>
The bill, proposed by the Islamist parliamentary members in the
50-member parliament, won 33 votes against 11 abstentions
including those by cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, co-education in Kuwait University, the only
university in the country, and private schools will be banned in
five years.
</P>
<P>
The bill is yet to be approved by Amir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad
Al-Sabah to become law.
</P>
<P>
At present, state schools and two colleges of Kuwait
University already apply segregation while in many other colleges
of Kuwait University, men and women sharing classrooms already sit
on different sides.
</P>
<P>
The bill was proposed earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Debate had been underway on the issue of gender segregation in
various Kuwaiti academic institutions prior to the approval of the
bill in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The assembly's Educational Committee assenting to the bill
blamed on May 14 in a note that co-education in the country is the
cause of moral corruption, sin and delinquency caused by the
mingling of male and female students on campus.
</P>
<P>
But Kuwaiti public institutions and societies as well as
academic faculties expressed their emphatic opposition to the
bill, saying it "posed a danger to the civilized image of the
Kuwaiti society as it implicitly cast doubts on Kuwaiti morals
and values."
</P>
<P>
They said the bill would lead to negative results in the long
term.
</P>
<P>
Officials here said the bill is a blow to the liberals in the
parliament who are intended to curb a growing Islamist influence
in Kuwait, a somewhat liberalized country in the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
Islamists contend that co-education has a negative effect on
students' behavior and learning capacities and does not conform
with Islam's rules.
</P>
<P>
"Even if others say that we are backward. We will take pride
in returning to Islamic Sharia (Islamic laws)," said Khaled
Al-Adoua, a deputy, after the bill was passed.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Witnesses More Irrigation Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Qinghai, Gansu, and Shaanxi
provinces, and the Xinjiang Uygur and Ningxia Hui autonomous
regions -- all in northwest China -- are witnessing increasing
irrigation acreage while some other parts of the country suffer
from decrease.
</P>
<P>
The acreage of irrigated farmland has reached 6.1 million ha in
the five northwest provinces and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
The local governments all consider water conservancy projects
as the essence of the agricultural production, noting that the
northwest in history always saw drought.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the northwest China invested a total
of some 10 billion yuan in construction of the water storage
projects, water diversion works and other water conservancy
projects.
</P>
<P>
According to incomplete statistics, more than 2,000 reservoirs
with storage capacity of 14.1 billion cubic meters have been built
in the area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the local governments also built a series of
projects to irrigate farmland on a higher level by lifting water
with a water pump.
</P>
<P>
To make up the scarcity of surface water, the northwest began
to develop groundwater resources in a planned way in the 1960s. So
far, the five provinces and regions have had some 20,000 wells.
</P>
<P>
The efforts began to pay off with a batch of high-yielding
irrigated farmland being set up.
</P>
<P>
The irrigation acreage in Gansu province, for example,
increased to some 14,000 ha from some 4,000 ha in 1991.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador Qin
Huasun hailed President Jiang Zemin's six-nation Africa tour and
Sino-African cooperation at a reception for African ambassadors
this evening.
</P>
<P>
Qin, China's Permanent Representative to the United Nations,
said at the reception that President Jiang's visit had created a
historical milestone in Sino-African friendship and added a
glorious new chapter to the annals of China's cooperation with
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"Further strengthening Sino-African unity and cooperation is of
great importance for maintaining world peace, seeking common
development and establishing a just and reasonable new
international political and economic order," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that President Jiang declared during his tour that
China was ready to consolidate and nurture a long-term and stable
relationship and comprehensive cooperation with African
countries. The president said such relations would be oriented
toward the 21st century on the basis of the Five Principles of
Peaceful Coexistence and made a five-point proposal to this end.
</P>
<P>
"We maintain that African countries should have a greater say
in international affairs and the international community should
earnestly heed the voices of African countries and respect the
views of these countries and the OAU (Organization of African
Unity)," Qin stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that China and African countries have always supported
and helped each other in international affairs and in national
development.
</P>
<P>
"China always backs African countries in their just struggle to
safeguard national independence, sovereignty and dignity, respects
their choices of political system and development path made in
light of their national conditions and supports their efforts to
maintain domestic stability and unity, reinvigorate their economy
and promote social progress.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and people will never forget the
valuable support rendered China by the African countries," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Lansana Kouyate, representative of U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali, said that Africa must not become "the
forgotten continent" at the beginning of the 21st century simply
because it is unable to reap the benefits of globalization.
</P>
<P>
"The President of the People's Republic of China has served the
interests of all of us -- Africans and non-Africans alike -- by
making his important visit to the region and thereby helping to
keep the focus of the international community on this important
continent," he said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Voters Flocking into Polling Stations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Millions of Israeli voters
streamed into polling stations today to elect directly for the
first time the prime minister and the 120-member Knesset, or
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 6,900 polling stations across the country opened at
7 a.m. local time (04:00 GMT) under clear skies. In many places,
voters, old and young, religious and secular, Jews and none-Jews,
formed long queues waiting to vote. The polls will be closed at 10
p.m. (19:00 GMT) today and the country's two main TV stations will
broadcast projected results.
</P>
<P>
The Central Elections Committee said that over 3.93 million
Israelis are eligible to vote, including 3.39 million Jews and
541,000 none-Jews. Under the Basic Law, any Israeli citizen aged
18 or above has the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
Today is declared a national holiday, and the government
offers free bus rides for those who are far away from their own
polling stations to go to vote. Special arrangements were made for
special voters at hospitals, prisons and military bases to
encourage every voter to vote.
</P>
<P>
On May 16, Israeli diplomats and emissaries and sailors on
ships abroad became the first to vote and soliders based in south
Lebanon and West Bank began voting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The security forces were in a high alert against any
disruption or possible terrorist attacks, with more than 200,000
policemen and soldiers deployed to guard the polling boothes. The
Israeli army forces also closed the Arab villages in Palestinian
territories to Israeli traffics in an attempt to prevent
terrorists from interfering with the elections.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Izzadin Kazzim, the military wing of the
Islamic militant movement Hamas, has called for suspending
attacks on Israel so as not to "make it like Hamas is helping the
Likud win the elections".
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in the 48 year history of the Jewish
state that the Israeli voters will cast two separate ballots
simultaneously, one for the prime minister and another for the
party he endorses in the Knesset . Any party which receives 1.5
percent of the votes will get a seat in the 120-seat Knesset.
</P>
<P>
There are 20 parties entering for the Knesset elections, while
the race for premiership features a two-man contest between the
ruling Labor party's leader Shimon Peres and Binyamin Netanyahu,
the hard-line opposition Likud party's chairman.
</P>
<P>
Peres is expected to cast his vote in Tel Aviv and Netanyahu
to vote in Jerusalem. The two were running neck-and -neck in the
pre-election opinion polls.

<HEADLINE> Thai Coalition Government Party Threatens to Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A Thai coalition government
partner, the Prachakorn Thai (Thai citizen) Party, has threatened
to quit the government, which completed its second reshuffle only
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The party, led by Deputy Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej,
blamed Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa for yielding too much to
demagogic pressure from the Palang Dharma (virtue force) Party
(PDP) and failing to expel the PDP from the government.
</P>
<P>
The Prachakorn Thai was particularly upset by PDP's attacks on
other coalition partners at a Bangkok gubernatorial election rally
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Prachakorn Thai, which commands 18 MPs in the House of
Representatives, on Tuesday resolved to decide on its political
future after the 50th anniversary celebrations of the King's
accession to the throne on June 9.
</P>
<P>
The threat, made on the very day when the new cabinet lineup
was made public, has spoiled the hoped-for after-storm relax which
would have followed Prime Minister Banharn's exclusion of some of
the most controversial ministers and deputy ministers of his party
from the cabinet to please his coalition partners, in particular
the PDP, whose five cabinet ministers quit last Friday.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the PDP, led by Deputy Prime Minister Thaksin
Shinawatra, returned to the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Coalition sources said Samak has also telephoned Muan Chon (the
masses) Party leader Chalerm Yubamroongto persuade him to pull his
party out. Chalerm reportedly promised to consider the request and
would discuss the matter further with Samak.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Posts 8.8 Pc Increase in Container Volume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Container throughput at the port
of Singapore registered a year-on-year increase of 8.8 percent to
3.03 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs) for the first quarter
of this year, the Shipping Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Citing statistics from the Port of Singapore Authority, the
report said that the box traffic growth in this period was notably
higher than that recorded by the world's busiest container port,
Hong Kong, which with a throughput of more than 12.5 million TEUs
last year, had seen an increase of two percent in the first
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Singapore also posted an increase in
its total cargo tonnage, and in the first quarter, it handled 76
million tons of cargo, marking a 3.8 percent year-on-year growth.
</P>
<P>
General cargo, which comprised 92 percent of containerized
goods, made up more than half the total tonnage. The rest were
bulk cargo, of which 93 percent were oil shipments, it said.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asia remained the port's biggest market, with 36

<HEADLINE> U.N. Deplores Failure of Yugoslavia to Arrest Mladic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council today deeply deplored the failure of the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia to arrest Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladic who has
been indicted for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council have taken note of the letter of 22 May
from the president of the International Criminal Tribunal for the
former Yugoslavia," said Council President Qin Huasun of China in
a statement to the press.
</P>
<P>
They "deeply deplore the continued failure of the government of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to cooperate with the Tribunal,
and in particular its failure to execute arrest warrants against
General Mladic and Colonel Sljivancanin, both of whom attended a
funeral in Belgrade on 21 May."
</P>
<P>
The statement reminded Yugoslavia of its obligations under the
council's resolutions and the Dayton peace agreement to cooperate
fully with the Hague-based tribunal.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that the willingness of Yugoslavia to cooperate
with the tribunal "will be an important factor for the development
of good relations" between Yugoslavia and the international
community.
</P>
<P>
The letter of 22 May from Antonio Cassese, the tribunal's
president, said that Mladic was in Belgrade on Tuesday, 21 May
1996, attending the funeral of another indicted Bosnian Serb
general, Djordje Djukic, and that Yugoslav authorities did not
arrest him.
</P>
<P>
Cassese said that a warrant for Mladic's arrest was formally
served on the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
many months ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Canada has arrested a Russian couple
for using false identities and will deport them immediately,
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported tonight.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said he would protest to his
Russian counterpart, Yevgeny Primakov, at a meeting next week.
</P>
<P>
The Russian couple came to Canada about five years ago using
identities belonging to deceased Canadians, CBC said.
</P>
<P>
Instead of spying against Canada, they were building their
false Canadian identities and were preparing to leave Canada soon
to pursue espionage elsewhere, CBC quoted Canadian security

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
today expressed concern over the situation in eastern Zaire, where
3,000 Rwandan and Zairean families are under siege by former
Rwandan government forces.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the press, Council President Qin Huasun of
China said the council discussed the situation after receiving a
letter from Rwanda's U.N. envoy Manzi Bakuramutsa and considered
it as a matter of concern.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Bakuramutsa requested an emergency meeting of the
Security Council to take immediate action to prevent a genocide in
eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
He also recalled that on May 12, approximately 100 Tutsis
living in Zaire were slaughtered in an attack on a Trappist
monastery in Mokoto.
</P>
<P>
Now the 3,000 families are surrounded in the villages of
Kichonga and Myamitaba by military forces of the former Rwandan
government who fled to Zaire in 1994 and now operate there with
impunity, he added.

<HEADLINE> 1995 Sees 30 Percent More Natural Disasters Than in 1994 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide natural disasters totaled
213 in 1995, 30 percent up from 1994, said the International
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC) in an annual
report published today.
</P>
<P>
Of the world's natural disasters, 84 occurred in Asia, followed
by the Americas with 69, an increase of 80 percent over 1994, and
Europe with 31, up 48 percent, said the IFRC in its 1996 World
Disasters Report.
</P>
<P>
Between 1970 and 1994, global disasters excluding wars exceeded
5,000, affecting more than 128 million people each year, including
about 150,000 deaths, and causing annual economic losses estimated
at 500 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Among all the disasters, drought, often leading to famine, and
flood are the two most devastating, each affecting well over 50
million people annually.
</P>
<P>
Floods cause the heaviest economic losses, about 183 billion
dollars worldwide every year during 1990-94, followed by high
winds, which resulted in losses of around 179 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Asia is the area hardest hit by natural disasters, in
particular by flood and high winds. From 1970 to 1994, nearly 630
of the 1,446 floods and 683 of the 1,609 high winds occurred in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Africa suffers most from drought, accounting for more than 270
of the global total of about 440 occurring between 1970 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, due to ethnic, religious, territorial and other
disputes, 30 major armed conflicts occurred worldwide, compared to
36 in 1990 and most of them were in Asia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
By early 1996, most of the conflicts in Africa had been ended
or otherwise reduced to a lower level and so had been those in
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Between 1990 and 1995, the disintegration of the Soviet Union
and former Yugoslavia led to conflicts in Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Croatia, Georgia, Nagorno-Karabakh and Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
All the conflicts have made millions of refugees and even more
internally displaced persons (INPs). In 1995, refugees totaled
some 15 million, down from over 16 million in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Africa accounted for more than 5.3 million of them. Among
African nations, Zaire alone hosted a total of 1.3 million
refugees from neighboring countries, while Rwanda was the origin
country of more than 1.5 million refugees.
</P>
<P>
An enormous increase was registered in INPs during the last
decade. The number of displaced people stood at 22 million in
1995, down from a record high of more than 26 million in 1994,
including nearly 12 million in Africa and 1.3 million in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The growing number of refugees, displaced people and other
war-affected populations has led to a corresponding increase in
global humanitarian efforts. Between 1990 and 1995, the budget of
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees rose from 500 million
dollars to 1.5 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Major Oil Firms Hike Pump Prices in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Major oil firms in Singapore have
decided to raise pump prices by 2 cents per liter across the
board, only to leave diesel price, which was raised in March,
unchanged this time, the Business Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
It said that Mobil took the lead in announcing the hike over
the weekend. Other companies, such as Shell, Esso, BP, Caltex, and
Singapore Petroleum first said they would not follow suit. But
they changed their minds three days later to decide on the price
increase.
</P>
<P>
For the industry, the report said, the adjustment would
translate into an increase in turnover of about 20.7 million
Singapore dollars (about 14.8 million US dollars) a year. To the
average car owner, the latest move would mean that they would have
to spend 40 to 50 dollars more a year on petrol.
</P>
<P>
With this increase, pump prices became once again identical
throughout the island country, with premium unleaded petrol at
116.6 cents per liter, up from 114.6 cents per liter, intermediate
unleaded at 110 cents, and the premium leaded at 128.7 cents per
liter.
</P>
<P>
Diesel remains at 50.1 cents per liter. Before March this year,
it was three cents cheaper at 47.1 cents.
</P>
<P>
The oil companies cited rising business costs and increases in
posted prices as reasons for the latest round of price hikes, the
first in two years, the report said. The last round was in May
1994 when the price of unleaded petrol was raised by 2.7 cents and
the leaded by 3.2 cents.

<HEADLINE> 2.5 Million New Houses Needed in Nepal by 2010 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Nepal needs some 2.5 million
additional housing units to meet the growing housing demand both
in the country's urban and rural areas over the next 15 years, the
government said in its new housing policy.
</P>
<P>
In order to resolve the housing problems, protect arable land
and ensure good housing management in the country, the government
is to implement a long-term national housing policy for the next
15 years, according to the Ministry of Housing and Physical
Planning Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
While announcing the newly formulated policy at a press
briefing here, Housing and Physical Planning Minister Balaram
Gharitimagar said the new housing policy would aim at increasing
shelters and repairing existing ones, promoting infrastructural
services, using modern building materials and technology,
mobilizing financial resources effectively and working out
necessary regulations.
</P>
<P>
He said the new policy will concentrate on constructing
well-managed housing units for the rural people migrating to urban
areas at a rapid pace in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The housing policy is to be carried out gradually in all cities
of the country on the basis of the decentralization program
adopted by the government, officials said.
</P>
<P>
It was also revealed Tuesday that 11 urban development projects
in Nepal would be presented at the United Nations Conference on
Human Settlement to be held in Istanbul, Turkey next week.

<HEADLINE> Speedy Freight Handling Arranged at Yangon Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Arrangements are being made on
prompt entry of freight vessels into Yangon port and speedy
freight handling, according to The New Light of Myanmar today.
</P>
<P>
At a coordination meeting here Tuesday of the committee for
bringing about speedy freight handling at ports, Myanmar Minister
at the Prime Minister's Office Brigadier General Lun Maung, who is
vice-chairman of the committee, warned against late claims of
imported cars and goods at Yangon port, adding that consignees
would be fined and action be taken against them for the late
claims.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar Minister for Transport Lieutenant General
Thein Win, at a recent contract signing ceremony on building a
container wharf at Yangon port, stressed the need to enhance the
capacity of ports to cope with the rising export and import
services.
</P>
<P>
He said that by the end of this year, the capacity of freight
handling at Yangon port would improve.
</P>
<P>
Yangon port, Myanmar's main gateway to the world, handles
nearly all of its imports and over 90 percent of exports. At
present, the port handles only 7.037 million tons of cargo
annually which is far from coping with the rising imports usually
taking many days for freight handling.

<HEADLINE> Central America, Caribbean Analyze Impact of Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Delegates from Central America,
Mexico and the Caribbean today began a seminar on the
impact of the mines used in wars to reach a common position on the
problem.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, sponsored by the International Red Cross
Committee, is part of the worldwide campaign launched by the
organization for a total ban on anti-personnel land mines.
</P>
<P>
To be discussed at the seminar are international humanitarian
law, the control or prohibition of the mines and the world plague
of anti-personnel mines and deadly weapons.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address, the committee's regional delegate
Patrick Zahnd said, "These weapons have caused a worldwide
epidemic which has torn the economic and social fabric apart in
dozens of countries."
</P>
<P>
According to figures distributed at the seminar, some 110
million mines, which kill or maim 30,000 people a year, have been
laid in 64 countries throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Zahnd reiterated that the committee's call for a complete ban
on the production, storage, transfer and use of mines is "the only
way we can drastically reduce the number of victims of land mines."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nicaraguan Foreign Aid Minister Erwin Kruger
reaffirmed his country's backing for the total elimination of
mines.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua is convinced that the only way to put an end to the
plague of anti-personnel mines is to prohibit their production,
transfer and usage, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
According to Kruger, some 95,000 of the 170,000 mines in the
Central American region are on Nicaraguan territory.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar which will end on Wednesday, the participants
will approve a joint declaration backing the committee's world
campaign.

BANGKOK, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has voiced objection to
proposed direct contacts between leaders and businessmen at
November's informal leaders' meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum in Subic, the Philippines, the Bangkok
Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to a source from the Thai Commerce Ministry, the
Philippine government proposed that the leaders meet a group of
businessmen in Subic and together attend a welcome reception to be
hosted by Philippine President Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
The source said Thailand believes such an arrangement would not
be appropriate for protocol reasons and would rather prefer the
business body concerned to meet APEC ministers instead before the
informal leaders' meeting.
</P>
<P>
The business body was set up at an APEC ministerial meeting
last year.
</P>
<P>
Some other countries of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN), especially Brunei, also opposed the Philippines'
proposal on the ground that it would not be the appropriate form
of dialogue, the source said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- France has decided to suspend
military cooperation with Burundi and pull out its military
advisers in the wake of the "security problems" in the central
African country, a spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry
announced today.
</P>
<P>
"The minimum conditions necessary for military cooperation to
function well are no longer there," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We have therefore decided to suspend our military cooperation
with Burundi until a comprehensive political settlement has put an
end to the violence and committed the country to the path of
national reconciliation."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that all the military advisers will have
left Burundi by June 9, and most of the civilian advisers will
also evacuate.
</P>
<P>
France has more than 20 military advisers and less than 10
civilian ones remaining in the strife-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Burundi has been in political turmoil and ethnic conflict for
more than two years since then-president Melchior Ndadaye was
killed in a military coup in October 1993 and his successor
Cyprien Ntaryamira died in a plane crash in April 1994.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of people have died in violence
between the country's Hutu and Tutsi nationalities.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, more than 50 people were killed in a conflict in
eastern Burundi.
</P>
<P>
France, which has about 400 nationals living in Burundi, has
tried in vain to help Burundi's two ethnic communities make peace
in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said today's announcement was an admission by
France that its efforts to bring peace to Burundi have ended in
failure.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Economy Grows 4.8 Percent Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Australia remained as one of the
most vigorous economies in the western world with its gross
domestic product (GDP) growing at an annual rate of 4.8 percent in
the March quarter.
</P>
<P>
The figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics
(ABS) today went contrary to market perceptions of the economy.
</P>
<P>
ABS figures showed that the real gross domestic production on
an average basis, GDP (A), rose 1.8 percent seasonally adjusted in
the three months to March over the December quarter. This made an
annual growth rate of 4.8 percent in the year to March, comparing
with the 3.1 percent in the year to December.
</P>
<P>
Local economic forecasters used to expect the GDP to grow at
0.8 percent in the March quarter, making an annual increase of 3.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
The federal Treasury forecasted that economic growth would slow
down to 3.25 percent in the fiscal year of 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
Anecdotical figures also showed that the economy was slowing
down. The unemployment rate rose to 8.9 percent in April. And
the housing industry was yet to climb from its trough.
</P>
<P>
The stronger than expected rise in GDP will effectively wipe
off the hope of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cutting
interest rates to stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
ABS figures released earlier also showed that value of stocks,
investment and profits of private companies grew in the March
quarter, foreshadowing a stronger economic growth in the latter
half of the fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> HK Dollar Debt Market Expects Robust in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The growth of the Hong Kong
dollar debt market will accelerate in the coming years, according
to HongkongBank's monthly Economic Report.
</P>
<P>
Initial figures show that activity on the Hong Kong dollar debt
market remained robust in 1996 because of increased expectations
that interest rates will bottom out during the year, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The prospects are better than at any previous time although it
may take several years before the local debt market matures, it
said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the introduction of the Mandatory Provident Fund
(MPF), the region's infrastructure financing requirements, the
H-bond market for the Chinese mainland companies, and the proposed
mortgage corporation will all play a part in the demand and supply
of Hong Kong dollar debt instruments in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Total issues amounted to 15.9 billion HK dollars (2.05 billion
US dollars) in the first quarter this year, it said.
</P>
<P>
Although the growth momentum of Hong Kong's debt market slowed
slightly in 1995, the volume of Hog Kong dollar debt issues was
still substantial in 1995 when compared with earlier years.
</P>
<P>
Private sector debt issues of Hong Kong dollar debt securities
amounted to 61 billion HK dollars (7.87 billion US dollars) in
1995, compared with 66 billion HK dollars (8.51 billion US
dollars) in 1994, according to Hong Kong Monetary Authorities.
</P>
<P>
Public sector debt issues were boosted by the issue of the
7-year Exchange Fund notes in late 1995. The first issue of the
notes extended the local benchmark yield curve further, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The successful launch of Hong Kong dollar debt issues by th4e
Chinese mainland entities recently has also paved the way for the
establishment of the H-bond market.
</P>
<P>
The Mandatory Provident Fund scheme will provide about 30 to 40
billion HK dollars (3.87 to 5.16 billion US dollars) in new debt
issues every year.

<HEADLINE> Zhuhai Provides Hygienic Vegetables for Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A crackdown on inspection
regulations for vegetables exported to neighboring Macao has been
declared by officials in this southern city, located in one of
China's leading special economic zones.
</P>
<P>
The city commodity inspection department has sent authorities
to vegetable production bases and purchasing stations to inspect
safety and hygiene management systems, and to enforce
newly-established regulations when necessary.
</P>
<P>
Inspectors also advised growers of the use of pesticides, and
warned the vegetable growers of about 59 kinds of farm chemicals
that are forbidden.
</P>
<P>
Newly-established purchasing stations require pre-approval for
operation by the city inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Inspection regulations also stipulate that the department may
perform a sample inspection of vegetables going through the
Gongbei Frontier Station to Macao, even if the production bases
have been approved.
</P>
<P>
Zhuhai has established a dozen bases producing vegetables for
Macao. Zhuhai provides more than 10,000 tons of vegetables for
Macao annually.

<HEADLINE> More Blind Tibetan People Freed from Darkness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lhasa, May 29 (Xinhua) -- An international aid project to help
cataract sufferers has restored sight to over 800 blind Tibetan
people.
</P>
<P>
Two contingents of ophthalmologists from the US, France, New
Zealand and Nepal have made surgical operation tours, starting
last year, around four Tibetan counties and a prefecture in the
autonomous region where a high incidence of cataracts has long
been a problem.
</P>
<P>
To date, over 800 cataract sufferers have been cured through
operations undertaken by the international medical teams, or by
local experts from the Lhasa People's hospital.
</P>
<P>
The operations have achieved 100 percent success, with the
patients regaining their sight to above 0.7 degrees on the sight
chart, according to a local source.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the international efforts are co-sponsored
by the Nepal NEP Ophthalmological Foundation, the Tibet
Development Foundation and the Lhasa Municipal Public Health
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has long been afflicted with high cataract incidence. A
lot of cataract sufferers here have lost their sight due to lack
of treatment.
</P>
<P>
To remedy the situation, the Lhasa municipal government decided
to launch the sight restoration project by taking advantage of
foreign aid and has put in large sums of money for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Nepal NEP Ophthalmological Foundation has
trained two groups of oculists from the Lhasa People's Hospital in
its ophthalmological center, which brought to Tibet the era of eye
operations under microscopes and artificial lens-transplant
operations.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan oculists have caught up with the world's most advanced
medical technologies for treating cataracts. They have succeeded
in conducting more than 200 cataract and artificial
lens-transplant operations.
</P>
<P>
To help establish Tibet's own cataract rehabilitation center,
the Nepal NEP Foundation has donated two advanced microscopes,
nearly 300 artificial lenses, as well as other medical instruments
and medicines.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Opposition Demands President Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Albania's largest opposition group,
the Socialist Party, today demanded the resignation of President
Sali Berisha and other senior officials for sending police to
quell a major opposition rally.
</P>
<P>
Riot police broke up an opposition rally in Skanderbeg Square
in central Tirana Tuesday afternoon and witnesses said some
opposition leaders and demonstrators, trying to get to the square,
were beaten. Afterward police surrounded the headquarters of the
Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
The rally was organized by the Socialist Party and five other
opposition groups, which pulled out of Sunday's parliamentary
elections for alleged serious irregularities, unfairness and the
government's manipulation in the voting process.
</P>
<P>
Before official election results were issued by the Central
Electoral Commission, the Democrats claimed they had won more than
half the valid votes and began to celebrate the unconfirmed victory.
</P>
<P>
But the six opposition parties, which also include the
Democratic Alliance, the Agrarian Party, the Social Democratic
Party, the Union for Human Rights and the Union of National Unity,
made clear that they would not accept the election results and
demanded a fresh vote.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference shortly after the failed protest,
Socialist Party chief spokesman Kastriot Islami urged the
international community to pay much attention to the mounting
tension in the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
Socialist leader Servet Pellumbi demanded the resignation of
Berisha, Interior Minister Agron Musaraj and one of his deputies
over the suppression, and that of the chief of the General
Department of Radio and Television for "distorted" coverage of the
rally. Pellumbi was still holed up in the party headquarters
along with his aides and other Socialists.
</P>
<P>
In an emergency meeting with foreign diplomatic missions, the
leaders of the six opposition parties criticized some Western
countries for "directly or indirectly" siding with the ruling
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
They also reprimanded some international groups monitoring
Albania's third multiparty elections for turning a blind eye to
irregularities in the balloting.
</P>
<P>
Berisha, in a statement broadcast by the state television,
called on the whole nation to keep calm and ignore calls from the
opposition to take to the streets.
</P>
<P>
A European Parliament mission overseeing the voting confirmed
in a statement today that some Albanian laws and media were in
favor of the Democrats and there did exist "a string of
irregularities and technical faults" in the voting process. The
withdrawal of the six opposition parties would raise questions
about the credibility of the counting process, it added.

<HEADLINE> ILO Calls for Global Efforts to Check Urban Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The International Labour
Organization (ILO) warned here today that already-acute urban
problems risk spiraling out of control if the current global trend
toward higher unemployment and underemployment is not reversed.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the number of the urban poor is expected to
swell to one billion from 400 million in the early 1990s, said
an annual global labour report released today by the ILO.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment is the main causes of urban poverty, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Urban poverty, characterized by the deterioration of living and
working conditions, overcrowding, spread of disease, crime and
malnutrition, is increasingly prevalent not only in the developing
world, but also in the most advanced industrialized countries, the
report noted.
</P>
<P>
Although the creation and protection of jobs is not the sole
means of alleviating the urban crisis, it is the most direct and
effective means available, the ILO stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to the ILO report, most urban unemployment in
developing countries takes the form of underemployment, where
people are obliged to do any kind of job available, however poorly
paid and unproductive.
</P>
<P>
In sub-Saharan Africa, the urban informal sector, which can
include such activities as small-scale peddling, petty services or
work in unregistered factories, is estimated to employ more than
60 percent of the urban labour force at extremely low wages.
</P>
<P>
In Latin America and the Caribbean, 83 percent of all new jobs
created between 1990 and 1993 were in the informal sector. Most of
the jobs are poorly paid, unsafe and of low productivity.
</P>
<P>
In India and Pakistan, the unorganized segment of the
manufacturing sector is estimated to comprise over 70 percent of
the total manufacturing industry.
</P>
<P>
As for developed countries, cities have been hit to different
degrees by de-industrialization, the report says.
</P>
<P>
Over the last two decades the average drop in employment in the
manufacturing sector in the Group of Seven industrialized
countries was 15 percent. Most European Union countries are
struggling with a double-digit jobless rate with the result that
social exclusion, once relatively rare in western Europe, now
looms large again in big cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
Although the United States enjoys a comparatively low jobless
rate, average real wages have been stagnant in the last 20 years,
and prospects of high unemployment do exist in some large
U.S. cities, the report says.
</P>
<P>
The ILO report notes that the only exception to the
unemployment trend is in the Asia-Pacific region, where
manufacturing employment grew by over six percent and wages by
more than five percent every year throughout the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Estimates show that during the past decade, 40 percent of the
total labor force growth in Asia-Pacific has taken place in urban
areas, and the figure could expand to 96 percent for the period
2000-2010.
</P>
<P>
In order to promote urban employment, the UN specialized labor
agency recommended that governments, employers' and workers'
organizations, community groups and others form local alliances to
mobilize the job-creation potential of cities.
</P>
<P>
It also urges municipal authorities to apply labor-intensive
investment policies in building municipal infrastructure, such as
housing, roads and sewage systems, as well as to improve the
living and working environment for the urban poor.
</P>
<P>
City planners are urged to provide training and organization
for the vast urban informal sector to boost its productive
potential and eventually bring it into the mainstream
economy.

<HEADLINE> EU Mediator Warns Against Putting Off Bosnian Polling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Carl Bildt, the EU High Representative
for Bosnian reconstruction, today warned against the postponement
of the Bosnian election, saying this could be detrimental to the
region's peace process.
</P>
<P>
The international community should pave the way and create
favorable conditions for an early polling, he told reporters here
after talks with Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini.
</P>
<P>
The earlier the election in that war-ravaged nation, the more
beneficial to peace and stability there, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace agreement, a general election should be
held within six to nine months after the agreement was signed in
mid-December of last year.
</P>
<P>
The two officials also discussed a comprehensive mid-term
review of the peace process, which is to take place in Florence,
Italy, on June 13 and 14.
</P>
<P>
Rome has actually become a center of diplomatic mediation for
promoting peace in Bosnia, Bildt said.
</P>
<P>
Italy is preparing for the conference, Dini said, hoping it
will "take several encouraging steps forward" on the basis of the
Dayton deal.

ROME, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini said today that steps would be taken at a G7 summit next

<HEADLINE> Chinese Capital Urged to Curb Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials and environmental
protection experts have urged the Chinese capital to curb the air,
water, noise and waste pollution that has been getting serious in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
An inspection group consisting of senior officials and experts
in charge of environmental protection warned that the pollution in
this city of 12 million people is "very serious" after an
eight-day investigation.
</P>
<P>
High-energy consuming industrial enterprises, motor vehicles
and burning coal have caused severe air pollution in urban
districts, according to a report released by the group Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Capital Iron and Steel Corporation (Shougang), for example,
covers only five-thousandths of the city's territory but releases
55 percent of the city's waste gases, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Coal still accounts for more than 75 percent of fuel burned in
Beijing, compared with merely five percent of clean gas fuels.
</P>
<P>
The problem of exhaust discharge has not been effectively
solved since the number of motor vehicles has topped one million
in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Water pollution around the city has not been controlled, and
there is a serious water supply shortage for both industrial and
household use, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Noise and domestic waste pollution have become more serious
along with the city's rapid economic and population growth in
recent years, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
During the inspection the group received about 1,600 phone
calls and 500 letters from some 6,000 citizens, who complained
about dirty air, polluted river water and vexing noises, the
"Beijing Daily" reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The experts suggest the city cut the number of industrial
enterprises causing serious pollution, set up a city-wide
central-heating system, control the increase of motor vehicles and
treat much more waste water.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing will take measures to control exhaust discharge, and
industrial and noise pollution," Beijing's Mayor Li Qiyan told the
inspection group Monday.
</P>
<P>
The city's environmental protection plan also includes
protecting drinking water resources, improving waste water
treatment and strengthening management of solid wastes, according
to Li.

<HEADLINE> New Ukrainian PM Pledges Support for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's new prime minister today
pledged his firm support for President Leonid Kuchma's social and
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Pavlo Lazarenko told parliament that the reforms are the only
way to rescue Ukraine's economy from collapse.
</P>
<P>
The former collective farm manager declared in his inauguration
speech that the government needs readjustment to iron out
deep-rooted problems.
</P>
<P>
The pace of structural reforms will be quickened with emphasis
placed on basic industries, privatization and the attraction of
foreign investment, the new prime minister told Ukrainian law
makers.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government will deal with the problem of
overdue wages, pensions and other social welfare benefits which
have amounted to 65.6 trillion Ukrainian rubles (352 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian president appointed 43-year-old Lazarenko to
succeed Evgeny Marchuk, 55, who was sacked on Monday. Kuchma
blamed him for the country's economic problems and for failing to
ensure a stable and efficient cabinet.

<HEADLINE> Defending Champs Through, Tennis Prodigy Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Thomas Muster and
Steffi Graf sailed into the second round of the French Open tennis
tournament as Jennifer Capriati, back for the first time in three
years, suffered an early exit.
</P>
<P>
Muster, the second-seeded Austrian, shook off his ankle injury
to down Denmark's Frederik Fetterlein 6-4, 6-2, 6-4, while Graf,
women's world No. 1 from Germany, nipped Larisa Neiland 6-3, 6-2
in 53 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Muster suffered a brief setback in the first set when he lost
four straight games after leading 3-0. Fetterlein, ranked
No. 107, served three aces in a row to go up 4-3.
</P>
<P>
But the Austrian regained command, taking three consecutive
games to win the set and keeping up the pressure on his rival to
snatch the following two sets.
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded Graf did not look at her best, making 19
unforced errors and looking erratic at times. But it was more
than enough to keep her on track for a fifth French Open title.
</P>
<P>
American Capriati, who reached the semi-finals here in 1990 at
the age of 14, lost to Chinese Yi Jingqian who is competing her
second Grand Slam match.
</P>
<P>
Capriati looked nervous and off form, making 34 unforced errors
and 11 double faults.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Yi, ranked No. 72, has played almost
exclusively in challenger events. In her only previous Grand
Slam, she lost in the first round at this year's Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
The only seeded player eliminated Tuesday was No. 6 Thomas
Enqvist, losing 6-2, 3-6, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 to American doubles
specialist Richey Reneberg.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Trade Balance Swings to Surplus in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia achieved a trade
surplus of 519.1 million Malaysian ringgit (about 207.64 million
US dollars) in March, the first surplus this year, according to
official figures reaching the press today.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian Statistics Department said in a release that this
surplus came on the back of a 30.4 percent rise in exports
(reaching 18.2 billion ringgit, or 7.28 billion US dollars)
against imports growth of only 15.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The department said the positive performance in March was the
first since December last year when the surplus was 655.3 million
ringgit (about 262 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Figures also showed that for the first quarter, Malaysia
experienced a trade deficit of 1.4 billion ringgit (about 560
million US dollars), down 20.6 percent from the 1.7 billion
ringgit (about 680 million US dollars) deficit recorded in the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Exports reached 47.3 billion ringgit (about 18.92 billion US
dollars) in the first quarter, while imports amounted to 48.7
billion ringgit (about 19.48 billion US dollars), the release
said.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts viewed the surplus in March with cautious
optimism, saying it was still too early to predict its impact on
Malaysia's current account that saw a deficit of 181 billion
ringgit (about 72.4 billion US dollars) at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
"It (the trade surplus) does not call for celebration because
the bulk of the trade is recorded in the second and third quarters
of the year," said one analyst.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Malaysia recorded deficits of 3.7 billion ringgit
(about 1.48 billion US dollars) in the second quarter, 2.7 billion
ringgit (about 1.08 billion US dollars) in the third quarter and
one billion (about 400 million US dollars) in the fourth quarter.

MOSCOW, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin has
ordered to set free Ala Dudayeva, widow of Dzhokhar Dudayev,
ex-leader of the breakaway Chechnya, Itar-Tass news agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Dudayeva was arrested on Monday in the southern Russian city of
Nalchik by Russian detectives when she attempted to go to Turkey
by using a false passport, Itar-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Releasing Dudayeva was considered one of the results of the
talks between Yeltsin and Chechen separatist leader Zelimkhan
Yandarbiyev, the successor to Dudayev who had been killed last
month in a rocket attack, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A peace accord had been signed between the leadership of the
Russian Federation and leaders of the separatist Chechnya to end

<HEADLINE> World Food Program to Monitor Food Distribution in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) is to
monitor the distribution of food that Iraq will be able to buy
under a U.N. "oil-for-food" agreement signed with Baghdad last
week.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time the WFP, the food aid arm of the
United Nations, has monitored the distribution of commercial food
imports bought by a government. It usually supervises the
distribution of food aid.
</P>
<P>
But for at least the next three months, until the food starts
arriving, the WFP will continue to appeal for aid to assist the
two million people most seriously affected by food
shortages in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
As commercial food imports under the U.N.-Iraqi deal start to
come through, the WFP will reduce the number of food aid
beneficiaries to between 600,000 and one million people, mainly
those either not covered by the commercial food imports or not
adequately covered. This includes malnourished children under the
age of five, people working in institutions and hospitals, Iranian
and Turkish refugees and displaced people.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Iraq after it
invaded Kuwait in 1990, which caused nationwide shortages of food
and medicines.
</P>
<P>
The WFP, which has been delivering and distributing emergency
food aid to needy Iraqis since 1991, has handed out more than
300,000 tons of food worth 117 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
After four rounds of tough talks, the United Nations and Iraq
finally reached an agreement last Monday allowing Iraq to export
oil worth two billion U.S. dollars over six months to buy
humanitarian food and medicines.

<HEADLINE> China Reclaims Unused Holdings from Developers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- China has dealt with 19,000 cases,
saving 5,000 hectares of land in a major crackdown on local
officials who overstepped their power on land approval.
</P>
<P>
The country has been intensifying efforts to recover farmland
that has been turned over for development and subsequently left
unused.
</P>
<P>
A total of 60,000 hectares of land were found to have been
taken out of cultivation since 1992 but left idle, China Daily
said today.
</P>
<P>
Some 24,000 hectares were reclaimed for farming thanks to a
newly-completed investigation launched last year by the State Land
Administration (SLA).
</P>
<P>
During the course of the investigation, 9,000 hectares of idle
land was ordered by local land agencies to be developed within a
certain period in accordance with their original requisition
purposes; 2,000 hectares will be used for other projects, while
the rights to another 4,000 hectares of land will be taken back by
land authorities, SLA officials said.
</P>
<P>
The national land-use check, the first in four years in the
country, was jointly conducted by local authorities and
investigating offices headed by leading local government officials.
</P>
<P>
The investigation also helped local authorities strengthen
their enforement of land laws that deal with local officials
overstepping their power on land requisition.
</P>
<P>
This misuse of power was regarded as a major cause of the
shrinkage of farm land in recent years and expansion of
construction of unapproved golf courses and luxury villas.
</P>
<P>
While uncovering 29,000 cases involving 23,000 hectares of land
where local officials over-stepped their bounds, the investigation
also looked into other illegal land-use involving 56,000 hectares
of land.
</P>
<P>
So far, 19,000 cases have been handled, and more than 70
percent of other illegal land-use projects have been dealt with.
</P>
<P>
The SLA is using local authorities to continue the crackdown on
illegal land-use, put farm land under special protection as
required by the central government and make the best use of the
country's limited land resources.
</P>
<P>
In urban areas, the random approval and construction of
development zones by local authorities must be strictly
controlled, the SLA said,
</P>
<P>
In addition, the use of farmland for private housing by farmers
has to be brought under control.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Confidence Dips in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Consumer confidence in the United
States weakened for the first time this year, the Conference Board
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The board, a leading private research group, set the index as
100 in 1985. The index of May stands at 101.2, down more than 3.5
points from April's 104.8.
</P>
<P>
The downward trend partly worsened the mood of the New York
Stock Exchange, which declined broadly in light trading.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board's monthly consumer confidence survey is
based on a representative sample of 5,000 U.S. households.
</P>
<P>
Government economic data released since last week indicated
that the country's economy was gaining strength, renewing some
investors' concerns about increased inflation.
</P>
<P>
Consumers surveyed this time are not as optimistic about the
next six months as they were last month, a news release of the
board said.
</P>
<P>
A larger proportion of consumers expect business conditions to
worsen. More survey participants now feel the job situation will
worsen in the near future. As for the expectations regarding their
families' income, consumers are considerably less optimistic than
last month, it added.
</P>
<P>
Despite the forecast, many professional analysts remain
upbeat about the economy. Some even predict that the Federal
Reserve would raise interest rates to slow the economy to avoid
fueling inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
The consensus forecast called for the unemployment rate to
remain unchanged at 5.6 percent this year and rise slightly to 5.7
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
A report of a real estate trade group released today showed
that sales of previously owned homes rose 0.5 percent in April to
the second highest level on record.

<HEADLINE> 2 armed gangsters killed in Nicaragua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Police agents killed two men and
wounded a third during a shootout with an armed group in the
department of Matagalpa, north of Nicaragua, said the authorities
today.
</P>
<P>
The 30 minute-long shootout occurred Monday morning on the
outskirts of the municipalities of La Dalia and Rancho Grande, and
the two people shot to death belonged to the rearmed Teodoro Rivas
Garcia gang.
</P>
<P>
According to the authorities, the police and the army
undertook a cleanup program in the north of the country to
guarantee the electoral process this coming October.
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Orlando Aguilera who was in charge of the
operation declared that he has a special task force that will
carry out "specific tasks" to eliminate the criminal bands
in the zone in order to guarantee normality in the electoral
process.
</P>
<P>
The police blame the armed gangs for the attacks against
farmers and peasants in northern Nicaragua.

<HEADLINE> Refugee, IDP Problem Cost Rise Over Last 5 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The International Federation of Red
Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) today said efforts and
corresponding expenses to help refugees and internally displaced
persons (IDPs) went up enormously over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
Between 1990 and 1995, the budget of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) alone increased from 500 million
U.S. dollars to 1.5 billion, the IFRC said in the World Disasters
Report 1996 published today.
</P>
<P>
Other humanitarian agencies such as the IFRC itself, the World
Food Program and many non-governmental organizations are also
spending far more on refugees, displaced people and other
war-affected populations.
</P>
<P>
Above all, the IFRC annual report blamed the situation on the
dramatic growth in refugees and IDPs, the number of which rose
from 22 million in 1985 to some 37 million in 1995, due to
internal conflicts -- averaged more than 30 a year during the
period, and an increase in dissolved states, including the former
Soviet Union and ex-Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Notably, the number of IDPs grew sharply during the period.
They totaled about 26 million by 1994, up from 22 million in 1990.
If the current trend continues, said the IFRC, IDPs would be
estimated at some 40 million by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Now international humanitarian assistance is also extended to
displaced people and other war-affected populations, not only to
refugees in asylum countries as was the case in the past, said the
IFRC.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, refugees were the only target population of UNHCR
assistance, but by 1995, almost half the UNHCR's case-load of an
estimated 25 million people were IDPs and other people remaining
in their own countries affected by internal conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the past, increasingly more efforts are now to
address humanitarian emergencies and needs in the phase of
"solutions," such as refugee repatriation, re-habitation and
reintegration programs.
</P>
<P>
According to the IFRC, until recently most of the people aided
by the UNHCR were long-term refugees in camps, and in 1985, some
80 percent of the UNHCR's resources went on care and maintenance.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall on Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street fell sharply
today as some unexpectedly strong economic readings renewed
inflation concerns.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 53.19 to close at
5,709.67. The barometer of 30 big U.S. companies, which celebrated
its 100th anniversary over the weekend, continued to stumble after
setting two new records last week.
</P>
<P>
Broader market measures also declined.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly 2 to 1, with
volume totaling just 338.25 million shares, well below Friday's
pace.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 3.22 to 360.52 and the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 6.28 to 672.23. Both indexes, which
are dominated by larger companies, had closed at record highs
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 11.50 to 1,236.30 and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index fell 3.18 to 610.77.
</P>
<P>
Bonds started the day higher, but slid after the National
Association of Realtors reported that sales of existing homes rose
0.5 percent to 4.22 million in April, the third consecutive
advance. The yield on 30-year Treasuries rose above 6.85 percent.
</P>
<P>
Investors grew more pessimistic in the afternoon after a report
came out on an increase in retail sales for the first three weeks
of May compared with April.
</P>
<P>
Boeing cushioned the Dow's fall after reports that British
Airways has ordered up to 4.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of 777
and 747 planes.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Urged to Support African Peace Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- African countries,
especially countries of the Economic Community of African States,
(ECOWAS), today urged the Security Council and the world community
to provide adequate assistance to the West African peacekeeping
force in Liberia (ECOMOG).
</P>
<P>
"The time for this Council to act is now, to secure
unconditional logistic and financial support for ECOMOG, coupled
with humanitarian and development assistance to Liberia, to get
the job done," said Ghana's U.N. envoy Jack Wilmot.
</P>
<P>
"A solution now will be cheaper in terms of human lives and
material resources, than it will be tomorrow, after ECOMOG is
compelled to withdraw, as a result of inaction by the
international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jack Wilmot made the remarks at an open debate of the Security
Council on the situation on Liberia. The country, after several
months of relative peace, suffered a major setback in April as a
result of renewed factional fighting among warring parties.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim A. Gambari, U.N. envoy of Nigeria, the country which
contributes more than 80 percent of ECOMOG troops, said that if
the ECOMOG were perhaps provided with the requisite resources, the
new fighting could have been avoided.
</P>
<P>
While calling for international help, speakers emphasized the
fact the the ultimate responsibility for peace rests with
Liberians themselves, notably the government and faction leaders,
who need to demonstrate in specific terms their commitment to
implement the Abuja Agreement and to achieve peace in their
country.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Permanent Representative to the United Nations Qin
Huasun said at the meeting that the international community should
take measures to help Liberians in their struggle for peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has consistently held that a stable and
growing Africa is an indispensable and important part of a
peaceful and prosperous world," said Ambassador Qin.
</P>
<P>
"The international community is duty-bound to take effective
measures to help them end fighting and find a political solution
to their conflicts."
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin hoped that Liberia will, with the assistance of
the international community, end its conflict and achieve peace
and stability at an early date.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will work together with the international
community to this end.

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Rises Against Mark, Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar surged to a
17-month high against the German mark and a six-week high against
the Japanese yen today, prompted by speculation that interest
rates in Germany and Japan will remain weak.
</P>
<P>
By 4 p.m. in New York, the dollar traded at 108.85 yen, up from
107.80 yen Friday and the highest level against the Japanese
currency since a 108.95 exchange rate on April 12. The dollar also
traded at 1.5464 marks, up from 1.5420 marks Thursday and its
highest level since a 1.5660 reading on January 6, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. financial markets were closed Monday for Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
The dollar's rise followed a rally late last week after Eisuke
Sakakibara, head of the Japanese Finance Ministry's international
finance bureau, indicated that the Bank of Japan was not likely
to increase interest rates in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Those gains were extended today after Japan released two
weaker-than-expected economic reports, which were understood as
that the country's economic problems persist. Lower rates make a
currency less attractive.
</P>
<P>
Against the mark, the dollar gained on speculation that the
German Bundesbank may lower interest rates at its policy-making
meeting this Thursday in order to spur a turnaround in the
slumping economy.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Ensure Success of ECOWAS Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria today launched a national
one-week campaign to promote an insurance scheme of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
The country will continue to take measures to make the ECOWAS
brown card scheme ''a huge success'', said chief Ayo Ogunlade,
Minister of National Planning, while launching the campaign
aiming at arousing public awareness and support of the project.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS scheme is one of the several measures which
complement the ECOWAS protocol on the free movement of persons
and the right of residence and establishment.
</P>
<P>
It is designed to provide third party liability insurance
cover for motor vehicles and motorists travelling within the
territories of the 16-member states of ecowas.
</P>
<P>
The scheme is expected to cover the liability for personal
injuries and damage to property which may arise from the movement
of vehicles on community highways in memder states.
</P>
<P>
According to Chief Ogunlade, the card when fully implemented
would enable the country to maximise the benefits derivable
therefrom.
</P>
<P>
''As a nation we have a lot to gain from the scheme'', he
said, adding that Nigeria's share in the movement of persons and
goods within the sub-region is quite substantial.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chairman of the ECOWAS brown card scheme in
Nigeria, Alhaji Mohammed Kari called on member states to
intensify efforts to make the ECOWAS card scheme a viable
venture. enditem
