DRAFTS OF IMPEACHMENT RESOLUTON LIST 3 CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Hous Judiciary Committee has prepared two
rough drafts of a resolution listing three articles of impeachment
against President Clinton _perjury, obstruction of justice and
abuse of power _ and each charge is accompanied by a list of dates
and accusations against Clinton, a Republican official said on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the committee plan to meet on Monday to begin
finalizing their early drafts _ there are at least two competing
versions _ and to weigh the benefits of splitting the perjury
charge into two articles, one related to Clinton's statements in
the Paula Jones case and the other related to his Aug. 17 grand
jury testimony in the Lewinsky matter. If that happens, there could
be as many as four articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, cautioned
that these were early drafts that could change over the next few
days.
</P>
<P>
   The first article in the drafts charges Clinton with perjury,
the official said. It accuses him of signing an affidavit swearing
to tell the truth, and then lying about whether he had had a sexual
relationship with a federal employee. The first article also
accuses the president of making false statements under oath on Jan.
17, in his deposition in the Jones sexual misconduct case, and of
giving false testimony before the grand jury on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   In the second article of impeachment, which accuses Clinton of
obstructing justice, the committee staff has laid out eight
examples that they believe bolster the accusation, according to two
preliminary versions of the resolution. On Dec. 17, the article
charges, Clinton encouraged Monica Lewinsky, who was not named in
the draft, to lie in a sworn affidavit and to give false testimony
in an affidavit, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also accused of seeking to influence the testimony of
another witness one month later, by ``relating a false account of
events,'' and then of repeating the same story to several
subordinates, knowing that they were witnesses in the case,
according to the draft. In his report to Congress, the independent
counsel Kenneth Starr accused Clinton of trying to impress upon his
secretary, Betty Currie, that nothing improper had occurred between
him and Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The articles also charge that Clinton tried to help Ms. Lewinsky
get a job and that he engaged in a plan to hide evidence. Clinton
has been accused in the past of trying to conceal several gifts he
had given Ms. Lewinsky. The articles also state that Clinton
authorized his lawyers to ``make a false representation'' to a
federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   The third article of impeachment accuses Clinton of ``misusing
and abusing'' his power as president and lists at least five
examples, the official said. Among them, Clinton is charged with
making false or misleading statements to ``deceive the American
public'' about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky; filing ``false
or insincere assertions of privilege'' with the court, though he
knew he was not being truthful; using his lawyers to make those
assertions and ``purposely jeopardizing'' Paula Jones' ability to
pursue justice in a court of law. The last example accuses Clinton
of disregard for the office of the independent counsel, an agency
of the government, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion of the draft resolution says, ``In all of this,
William Jefferson Clinton has brought scandal and disrepute on the
Presidency and the administration of justice, and acted in a manner
contrary to his trust as President and subversive to the rule of
law and constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the
cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury to the people
of the United States.'' &QL;

SHTTULE ASRONAUTS JOIN FIRST TWO PIECES OF SPACE STATION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following a series of intricate maneuvers and the
skillful use of a robot arm on Sunday, astronauts aboard the space
shuttle Endeavour joined the first two of many segments that will
form the international space station.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle and its crew of six snared the Russian-made Zarya
control module after chasing it around the Earth in ever-closing
orbits throughout the day. Less than an hour after a rendezvous 240
miles above the Earth shortly before 6 p.m., Lt. Col. Nancy Currie
of the Army deftly used the 50-foot arm to grab the 40,000-pound
cylinder as the craft passed above Russia and slowly pull it toward
the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle commander, Col. Robert Cabana of the Marines, noted
that visual inspection of Zarya confirmed that two antennas had
failed to deploy from the module after its launching from
Kazakhstan on Nov. 20. There were earlier indications that the
antennas, which will be used later to manually assist spacecraft
dockings, had not extended.
</P>
<P>
   Currie took almost two hours to painstakingly move Zarya above
the American-made Unity docking port positioned in Endeavour's
cargo bay. When the pieces were aligned within inches of one
another, Cabana fired thruster rockets that raised the shuttle,
allowing the modules to clamp together.
</P>
<P>
   Before the docking, the crew waited for a new sunrise, which
occurs every 45 minutes in orbit, before closing the last few
inches separating the modules. After ground calculations confirmed
observations from the shuttle that the modules were aligned,
Endeavour nudged the components together while traveling over the
southern Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston, Endeavour _ We have capture of Zarya,'' Cabana
announced at 9:07 p.m. Eastern time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations to the crew of the ship Endeavour. That's
terrific,'' came the reply from the Johnson Space Center in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   After the docking, the crew and ground controllers noticed a
slight misalignment of the connection as they tried to pull back a
capture ring and clamp the two modules together. Engineers
concluded that the shuttle's robot arm, still attached to Zarya,
was unexpectedly exerting enough pressure to drag the pairing out
of sync.
</P>
<P>
   With release of the arm, Zarya and Unity were permanently
clamped together, never again to be separated during the life of
the space station, said NASA spokesman James Hartsfield.
</P>
<P>
   The two station pieces, together measuring about 77 feet from
end to end and having a combined mass of 70,000 pounds, are the
first of 100 major components to be united in space over five years
to form an orbiting outpost that would weigh almost a million
pounds and span an area the size of two football fields.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 additional missions by American shuttles and
Russian rockets will be used to haul all of the components and
other supplies into orbit, and astronauts from both nations are to
spend almost 1,800 hours doing spacewalks to assemble the entire
structure, expected to cost its partnership of 16 nations more than
$40 billion just to construct.
</P>
<P>
   The project's total cost is a subject of debate, but estimates
now put the price of assembly and of operation for the station's
estimated lifetime of 10 years as high as $110 billion. Of that,
the United States would spend roughly $96 billion, and the
project's 15 foreign partners would spend about $14 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Projections are that the job will require 160 spacewalks, which,
for safety reasons, will always be done by two people. Modules of
interconnected laboratories and living quarters for up to seven
astronauts are to form a habitat equal to that of two 747
jetliners. It is hoped that the station will provide a laboratory
in which weightlessness will allow researchers to develop new
materials and new drugs and explore the remaining mysteries of
physiology, in part so that humans may someday know how to adapt
for long space flight to other worlds.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bringing the pieces together is only the first step in mating
them. A pair of astronauts, Col. Jerry Ross of the Air Force, 50,
and Dr. James Newman, 42, a physicist, are to make three spacewalks
this week, the first on Monday, during which they will hook up
electrical and communications cables, remove covers, attach
handrails and perform other tasks to get the modules to work as one
unit.
</P>
<P>
   As construction goes on outside, the astronauts inside Endeavour
will be making preparations to enter the new station through a
connecting tunnel and docking system.
</P>
<P>
   Next Thursday the crew will enter the embryonic station for the
first time, installing portable fans and lights. On Friday they
will again enter, to prepare for the arrival in 1999 of the next
major element, the first one both built and financed by Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult part of today's mating of the $240 million
Zarya to the $300 million Unity was bringing them together after
the shuttle caught up with the Russian unit. Zarya, or Sunrise, was
built by Russia but paid for by the United States. At 41 feet long,
it is to be a kind of tugboat for the embryonic station, furnishing
power and propulsion as well as communication and rendezvous
abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Currie had to use the Canadian-built robot arm to place Zarya on
top of Unity without being able to see where the pieces joined.
Unity, raised in Endeavour's cargo bay on Saturday, is so large
that it blocked Currie's view of the mating fixtures from the
shuttle's windows.
</P>
<P>
   Currie used views from remote cameras and a special computerized
vision system built on the arm to estimate the relative positions
of the two large segments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never done anything like this before,'' Currie said
before the flight, adding that she had practiced the maneuver more
than 100 times over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   The flight of Endeavour, which took off from Cape Canaveral,
Fla., last Friday, had gone according to plan until early Sunday,
when mission control ordered the shuttle to change its orbit
slightly to avoid a piece of space debris. Air Force space debris
trackers noted that the shuttle was to pass within 1.6 miles of a
spent stage of an American booster rocket launched last month.
</P>
<P>
   Although this was considered a safe distance, shuttle
controllers decided to widen the separation to five miles as an
extra precaution.

PLANNERS MAY PUT HIGH-DENSITY, LOW-INCOME APARTMENTS IN
MIDDLE-CLASS SUBURBIA
</HEADLINE>

(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
By BETH BARRETT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Without public debate or a formal policy
directive, Los Angeles city officials are planning for massive
population growth based largely on providing high-density
apartments, mainly for low-income people, city housing projections
show.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the growth is targeted for middle-income areas, which
would dramatically alter parts of the San Fernando Valley,
including Sherman Oaks and Studio City, and other communities
throughout the city, a review by the Daily News found.
</P>
<P>
   The direction of city planning has surfaced since the Planning
Commission unexpectedly blocked adoption last month of the housing
element of the city's General Plan, a document required by state
law to show how a community expects to meet anticipated population
growth.
</P>
<P>
   City planners are relying on decades of past planning and zoning
decisions to formulate the housing element. At the same time, they
have made construction of affordable housing in the form of
apartments in residential neighborhoods across the Valley a central
focus of the new housing element.
</P>
<P>
   Their actions come without policy direction from the mayor or
City Council, an examination of the impact on neighborhoods or a
detailed study of the availability of transit, sewers, roads or
other municipal infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process is like a runaway train,'' said city Planning
Commission Vice President Bob Scott, a Woodland Hills attorney and
San Fernando Valley civic leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going in some direction on rails, but there doesn't seem
to be anyone at the controls, nobody is providing vision. It's a
bureaucratic-driven process. It's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Los Angeles is expected to grow from 3.6 million people to
more than 4.2 million by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The San Fernando Valley is estimated to grow by about 233,700 to
nearly 1.5 million people by then, or nearly the size of Houston or
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, there were 1.3 million dwelling units in the city. That
number would climb by more than 10 percent if anticipated growth is
to be met without additional crowding.
</P>
<P>
   The planners' goal is to keep housing occupancy rates at 1990
levels, or 2.83 persons per unit. Construction of much of the
low-income housing would depend largely on the availability of
public funds.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Richman, the manager of policy and planning in the city's
Housing Department, said nearly 150,000 new units, however, would
not ease Los Angeles' current overcrowding, which at 16 percent of
all households represents the highest rate of any major U.S. city.
</P>
<P>
   Adoption of the housing element _ normally regarded as a
technical document _ was temporarily delayed by the Planning
Commission in hopes it could be used to trigger a comprehensive
debate over growth and housing in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city talks about affordable housing, but what percentage
of the city's housing should be targeted low-income? Where should
the balance be struck?'' Scott asked. ``Does this mean we won't
stop until Sylmar has the same density as South Central? What's all
this going to look like in 20 years?
</P>
<P>
   ``The city adopts all these pieces of the General Plan, but they
are adopted in a vacuum. Then when it does something that seems
idiotic, officials point back to these elements and say, That's
what you adopted.''
</P>
<P>
   The apartment construction issue was raised Saturday at the
first gathering of San Fernando Valley Latino community leaders to
consider the possibility of Valley secession from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas J. Hogen-Esch, a University of Southern California
doctoral candidate writing his dissertation on urban secession
movements, suggested that Valley homeowner associations want
control over zoning to prevent the encroachment of apartment
buildings into areas dominated by single-family homes. He said some
cities exclude certain socioeconomic groups by prohibiting
apartments and multiple-family dwellings.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeff Brain, president of Valley Voters Organized Toward
Empowerment, which favors a study of Valley secession, said the
Valley already has a high degree of apartment development, with 50
percent of the Valley's residents being renters.
</P>
<P>
   Just how far L.A. officials are willing to go in publicly
debating the growth issue remains to be seen, but Mayor Richard
Riordan said a citywide housing policy remains high on his ``radar
screen,'' with the focus on rehabilitation of existing units, not
construction of tenement-like high-rises that could deteriorate
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Residents will not tolerate an overcrowded city,'' he said.
``We must continue to evaluate realistically how many people can
live in L.A. and under what circumstances.''

LOS ANGELES: what circumstances.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Examination of the housing element under consideration shows how
extensively communities have been zoned for high-density living
without community input or a policy consensus.
</P>
<P>
   The plan identifies room for 530,506 new dwellings in L.A. and
says there will be a need for 146,441 new units _ most of them
low-income _ by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley has room for 189,956 new units, it estimates. Demand
is anticipated to reach 35,795 new units within five years, nearly
half low-income.
</P>
<P>
   Such higher-density building would represent a sharp reversal of
recent Valley building trends. With most construction in
single-family homes, permits for only 132 apartment units have been
taken out this year.
</P>
<P>
   City planners acknowledge the arbitrary nature of their effort
to define how housing expectations will be met and point out that
calculations on where future housing might go are based on existing
zoning potential and current poverty rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has said how many poor people Los Angeles can handle,''
said Deputy Planning Director Franklin Eberhard.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one said: Gee whiz, West L.A. doesn't have enough, or some
other area has too much, let's give it to the Valley,'' he said.
``No one did that.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that there ``clearly is a tension between the need for
affordable housing and what communities would like to see happening
in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The housing element doesn't remove that tension.''
</P>
<P>
   The department said it will take years before an in-depth and
costly review of community plans is completed. A recent review
corrected mainly technical errors in the plans.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Without coherent planning, officials said Los Angeles risks
creating slum pockets, overtaxing its streets and utilities and
destroying neighborhoods, many in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to look at our planning right now,'' said Council
President John Ferraro, who represents part of the southeast
Valley, including North Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't put people on top of each other. Before we adopt the
housing element, we have to look at all the problems of
infrastructure, schools, all the things that are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``These issues may not be important to someone living in
Brentwood or Pacific Palisades. But they're important to the people
living in other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman Oaks, Studio City, Toluca Lake, North Hollywood and Van
Nuys are among the areas ripest for more apartment construction.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro said downzoning might be necessary to preserve some
communities' quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   West Los Angeles, by contrast, has an anticipated demand for
only 2,940 low-income units, just more than 3 percent of the city's
total.
</P>
<P>
   No developer is going to build low-income units in high-priced
communities, city officials said. But increasingly, community
leaders are rejecting the idea that poorer areas should be held
responsible for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, we can't continue to increase all the population
in the same few neighborhoods in the Valley and just south of the
Santa Monicas,'' Hollywood-area Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you overbuild you're breeding crime that no one wants. We
can't be creating large, gaping, soon-to-be-slum areas. The reality
is we're on a collision course between doing what is necessary to
support more population in existing areas, or expanding slightly in
other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood-Wilshire community already has 123,651 apartments,
condominiums and other units in its high-density corridor. The plan
estimates an additional 33,207 units _ two-thirds low-income _ will
be needed within five years.
</P>
<P>
   The state originally set a June deadline for completion of the
housing element, but has extended it until 2000, but Richman said
the low-income housing situation is urgent.
</P>
<P>
   She said that whatever affordable housing is built likely will
satisfy only a small percentage of the need in a city where four
low-income families are waiting in line for each low-cost apartment
on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Low income is considered $41,050 or less per year for a family
of four in Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a matter of public policy,'' Richman said.
``How do you explain in the richest country in the world people
sleeping on the sidewalk? Do we have a narrow or an enlightened
self-interest?''

LOS ANGELES: self-interest?''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Councilman Michael Feuer, who represents the Sherman Oaks area
in a district that straddles the Santa Monicas, said low-income
housing can be compatible with high quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   He said many people who qualify for such housing are
professionals and other working people who enhance, rather than
detract from neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Providing there are adequate streets and utilities, Feuer said
some kinds of density _ like a planned 85-unit senior housing
complex in Sherman Oaks _ can serve neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lower-income units actually have diminished traffic impact,''
he added, noting their residents typically depend on mass transit.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman Oaks residents _ many of whom took the senior housing
project as a bitter loss _ say that without a reassessment of land,
the door remains open to far greater development, whether they like
it or not.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners
Association, said his group asked city planners to reopen zoning
discussions 1{ years ago and to consider housing and other
quality-of-life issues but were rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told that only inconsistencies and corrections of
errors in the plan would be addressed _ not major changes,'' said
Close, whose community had fought to keep the senior citizen
apartment at 39 units.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the debate,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who will have the power: the communities to focus on quality
of life, or the politicians and unions that want to maximize the
size of projects?''
</P>
<P>
   There already are 18,726 apartment units and homes built in
Southeast Valley multiple-family zones.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 33 apartment units per acre theoretically could be built
on properties that lap against the Los Angeles River, then meander
along major corridors like Moorpark Street and Colfax, Woodman,
Fulton and Coldwater avenues and lick at established, single-family
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Already the roads are grinding to a halt, parking isn't
available. To downtown, the quality of life in neighborhoods is a
low priority,'' Close said.
</P>
<P>
   Five public workshops were held on the housing element about a
year ago. Public turnout was low, despite 1,000 meeting notices
mailed to residents and an advertising campaign on television and
the Internet, planners said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said he objected that the system did not reach out to more
people and that it was designed to comply with state regulations,
not grapple with a planning vision for the city.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials have joined him in calling for an open debate on
future growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get everyone in the room who cares about this and
to figure out a plan that does the least harm to the most people,''
said Goldberg. &QL;

KILLER CALL AFFECTS MORE THAN OUTCOME OF ONE GAME

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Before Seattle fans commit to a full
week of kill-the-refs contempt, it's helpful to recall that the
Seahawks should not have been in position, during Sunday's game as
well as the season, to need the benevolence of fair judgment in
order to avoid a 10th straight playoff-free season.
</P>
<P>
   Having said that ... Kill the refs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, don't write me letters. I don't mean it literally. Hot
gravel in the pantaloons would be a fine alternative.
</P>
<P>
   And if that seems cruel, how about demanding something much more
mundane, yet a significant element in most everyone's workday life:
Accountability.
</P>
<P>
   It's not likely that the seven-man crew of officials who blew
the decisive moment in the Seahawks-Jets game will be held to a
public reckoning. The NFL works in secretive ways. For the most
part, that's a wise move, since these accountants, insurance
salesmen and high school gym teachers who rule weekly on America's
most popular spectactor sport would be creating a lot of widows and
orphans if they were publicly identified.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't seem unreasonable to ask they be available to
questioners, that their methods be scrutinized, their shortcomings
acknowledged and their reprimands published.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the NFL perpetuates a travesty that is beginning to
dominate its image, which had another dubious display at the NFL's
main stage in the shadows of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The best Sunday's blown call can be called is a damn shame. The
worst that some are calling it is Seahawk career-ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wins and losses have serious effects on people's lives and
careers,'' said Seahawk guard Pete Kendall, fuming. ``Bad as the
call was, what do you do about it?''
</P>
<P>
   What the NFL will do is fine Kendall and his teammates and
coaches for venting their outrage instead of sanctioning the
principals involved. While it isn't fair that referess be vilified
for every blown judgment call, the system, supplemented by video
(and, in the case of the Pittsburgh-Detroit Thanksgiving Day game,
audio) replay, needs a serious overhaul to restore public and
participant credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could have been one of the biggest wins in Seahawk
history,'' said Seahawk receiver Mike Pritchard. ``Playing on the
road in New York, against a good team, with a new, young
quarterback ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was, in coach Dennis Erickson's words, the ``most
disappointing loss'' of his career. Indeed, it will be the one that
demarcates the end of his Seahawk tenure. Although he will finish
out the year, the 32-31 defeat marks the season's seventh loss and
elimination from the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   While any one of several agonizing losses can be put through the
coulda-shoulda-woulda test, Sunday seemed destined to be a win that
would at least buy Erickson some league-wide respect. To have
defeated in one season AFC rivals Marty Schottenheimer of Kansas
City and Bill Parcells of the Jets would have been worthy, if
ultimately futile, chips to take to the bargaining table with
Seahawk president Bob Whitsitt for a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the granting of a 5-yard touchdown run to Jets
quarterback Vinny Testaverde, when replays showed indisputably that
he traveled only about 4{ yards, invalidated not only a splendid
Seahawk effort but the point of these weekly exercises: Let the
best team win.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my job, and I feel like people are toying with me,''
said linebacker Chad Brown. ``To have part-time guys do this is
crap.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a reference to the fact that NFL officiating is a
weekend gig done by guys with regular jobs. While it's debatable
whether more training would have changed the outcome _ it appeared
that only one of the referees had either the position or the guts
to make a quick call, and it was the wrong one _ the fact that the
game's decisive play occurred in a closed-in end zone with a
raucous home crowd demanding a touchdown raises the issue of
professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   The call was made only after a group meeting, suggesting there
was either a difference of opinion or no opinion among most of the
crew. And since a call against the home team on the game's decisive
play can be a life-threatening event in New York, it's not
difficult to imagine a less resolute member voting based on the
specter of a size-D battery deployed as a brain implant from 20
yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have it happen like that ... '' said Erickson, who topped a
full season of stricken postgame looks with a death-row pallor,
``it just makes you sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Real estate in New York is among the world's most expensive, yet
on this unusually warm afternoon some valued, hard-to-get swampland
was given away free.
</P>
<P>
   One need have no interest in the Jets or the Seahawks to have an
interest in fair play, and to realize that bit of real estate, and
all that takes place upon it, has to be treated with a little more
value and respect.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the Seahawks will have a call like that go their way
someday. When they do, a lot of the people who were victimized
won't be around for the karmic payback.

JETS SNEAK OUT WIN ON BLOWN CALL 
</HEADLINE>

 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ As Cortez Kennedy was making his way
through the locker room, assistant offensive line coach Bill Meyers
stopped the Seahawks' defensive tackle in mid-trudge.
</P>
<P>
   Meyers put his hands on Kennedy's massive shoulders, stared
straight into his eyes and offered, ``You made a hellvua play. You
won the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Kennedy, Meyers and the rest of the Seahawks,
the officials did not agree.
</P>
<P>
   Replays showed that Kennedy had dragged Jets' quarterback Vinny
Testaverde to the turf short of the goal line on fourth down in the
final seconds of Sunday's game at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest in a series of blown calls by league officials
awarded Testaverde the touchdown, giving the Jets a frantic 32-31
victory and snuffing the Seahawks' flickering playoff hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Losing this game would have been bad enough for the Seahawks,
now 6-7. Knowing a blown call had taken it away from them was much
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was our season right there. Our season came down to one
play on the goal line,'' said strong safety Jay Bellamy, who helped
finish what Kennedy started by pouncing on Testaverde as he was
falling toward the goal line. ``It was a bogus call. If it's a
touchdown, it's a touchdown. Then all right, we got beat. But let
the players decide the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde's plunge toward the end zone was not shown on the
stadium replay screen. But the players closest to the play knew the
Jets quarterback never crossed the goal line. Not with the ball.
Not even with his helmet.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys need to go to Oz to get some courage and to get
some heart,'' said defensive end Michael Sinclair, using a Wizard
of Oz analogy to describe the officials' indecisiveness on the
decisive play. ``You make the obvious calls, but what about the
tough ones? I don't feel they came through today. I really don't.
It was awful. Awful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys should be fined.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Sinclair can expect to be fined by the league office
for his comments. Players and coaches are not supposed to criticize
the officiating. Not even this year, when blown calls are becoming
an epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Sinclair obviously did not care.
</P>
<P>
   As for the officials, the worse they can expect is a reprimand _
even this crew headed by referee Phil Luckett, the same official
who botched the coin toss to begin the overtime period in the
Thanksgiving Day game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Detroit
Lions.
</P>
<P>
   The league office will review videotape of this game, as its
does with all games. The Seahawks can expect a phone call, probably
on Wednesday, telling them the wrong call was made on Testaverde's
run.
</P>
<P>
   Then what?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no recourse,'' said Randy Mueller, Seahawks vice
president of football operations, who was slumped upon a stool in a
far corner of the locker room. ``No recourse at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the Seahawks' angst was the way the play was called.
As soon as Testaverde disappeared into a pile of players, two
officials signaled touchdown _ side judge Laird Hayes, who was some
30 yards away from the pile along the Jets sideline, and head
linesman Earnie Frantz, who was behind the play in the end zone.
Umpire Hendi Ancich, who was in the middle of the melee, never made
a call. Luckett later explained that Frantz's call was the
determining factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy in the middle never called anything,'' Sinclair said.
``They need instant replay. They need to bring it back.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have helped the Seahawks' cause Sunday. Repeated TV
replays from three different angles showed that Testaverde did not
break the plane of the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   Some on the field came up with the same conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Vinny get hit probably around the 2 or 3 (yard line) and
I know for a fact that he was no way near the goal line,''
cornerback Shawn Springs said.
</P>
<P>
   When it was suggested that perhaps Testaverde had reached the
ball over the goal line after he was down, Springs' face contorted
in a yeah-right expression before he added, ``If they are going to
say he made a second effort or whatever, in that case he fumbled
and Jay Bellamy recovered the fumble. In that case, it should have
been our ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his effort after going down, Testaverde said, ``It was an
effort to get the ball over the goal line, and that's what the refs
saw.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' late rally erased what Seahawks coach Dennis Erickson
considered one of his team's most courageous efforts in the past
four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played their rear ends off,'' Erickson said. ``And to
lose it on a play like that, it's totally disappointing and it just
makes you sick.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks jumped to leads to of 21-10 and 31-19 as Jon Kitna
hooked up with Joey Galloway for two long touchdown passes (70 and
57 yards), Ricky Watters scored on his longest run since 1996 (37
yards) and rookie linebacker Anthony Simmons returned an
interception 36 yards for a TD.
</P>
<P>
   But Testaverde kept bringing the Jets back. He completed 42 of
63 passes for 418 yards. He threw TD passes to fullback Keith Byars
and wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, and also made the throws to set
up a TD run by Curtis Martin and a pair of field goals by John
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde also passed himself into position for the final
quarterback sneak toward the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a perfect call,'' Johnson said of Testaverde's
run on fourth down.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the play surprised the Seahawks, Springs said,
``Obviously not, because we stopped it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unofficially, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of bobbled it as I was running through the line. I
wasn't able to reach the ball out,'' Testaverde said. ``The refs
called it good _ I heard the replays showed it wasn't _ and we had
some calls go against us as well. I thought it was going to be
close. But when you get knocked around, you can't see as good as
the refs.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Testaverde's career passing day, another impressive
showing by Kitna and a slew of big plays by both teams, what will
be remembered from this game is the blown call that cost the
Seahawks a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sucked,'' Sinclair said. ``The refs sucked.''

OAHU PAIRS AIR FORCE WITH UW 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The fallout from UCLA's upset loss Saturday at Miami
affected the postseasons of four Pac-10 football teams, last of
them Washington, which Sunday was named to face Air Force in the
fledgling Oahu Bowl in Honolulu on Christmas Day at 5:30 p.m. PST.
</P>
<P>
   In the first game of the first-ever bowl doubleheader, Oregon
will meet Colorado in the Aloha Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe yesterday,'' said Marcia Klompus, executive
director of the Hawaii bowls, referring to the upsets of UCLA and
Kansas State. Then, in reference to Kansas State (11-1) being
excluded from the eight-team Bowl Championship Series, she added,
``I couldn't believe this morning, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Kansas State and UCLA, the big losers from Saturday's
results were Central Florida and athletic administrators of the
Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   Central Florida had earned a conditional bid to Hawaii if the
Pac-10 couldn't send the second team along with Washington it was
contracted for. But UCLA's loss knocked the Bruins from the
national-title game in the Fiesta Bowl to the Rose Bowl, while
Arizona fell from the Rose to the Holiday, and Oregon dropped from
the Holiday to the Aloha, replacing Central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Washington likely would have played Colorado in the Aloha if
UCLA had won and Oregon had stayed out of Hawaii. But, said
Klompus, ``Oregon played Air Force last year (in the Las Vegas
Bowl), and ESPN wasn't interested in that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the second straight year a Pac-10 team that was a
nine-point favorite lost a final regular-season game and thus cost
each conference school about $500,000 in the league's bowl
revenue-sharing system. Last year, Arizona State was upset by
Arizona and fell out of the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first two reactions were, I felt bad for the conference,''
Klompus said, ``and then for Central Florida. Then my business
heart took over and I said, `Hey, that's why we made these two bowl
games, to have two Pac-10 teams.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force matchup pits Washington against a team it meets
next Sept. 18 in Seattle. The Falcons (11-1) run the wishbone with
quarterback Blane Morgan _ who played on a bad ankle in his team's
20-13 victory over Brigham Young in the WAC title game _ and led
the WAC in scoring at 36.6 points a game. They also were No. 1 in
total defense at 284.7 yards a game.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the fourth time Washington has played in Hawaii on
Christmas Day. Oregon will be making its first appearance in the
Aloha, and facing a Colorado team that beat the Ducks 38-6 in the
1995 Cotton Bowl, a game Oregon remembers for a fake punt run by
the Buffaloes in the waning moments.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies began bowl practices Saturday and also worked out
Sunday. Defensive end Josh Smith, who sustained a knee strain in
the Oregon loss Nov. 7, is not yet having contact work. His
position coach, Randy Hart, stayed out of the practice with a bad
back.

REIGN COACHES EMBRACE LIFE `AT NEXT LEVEL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The coaches of Seattle's women's pro basketball team
are bona fide Southerners. Tammy Holder is from Richmond, Va.,
where she coached the University of Richmond Spiders until becoming
director of basketball operations for the ABL's Richmond (now
Philadelphia) Rage three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Wilson, the Reign's associate coach, is from a little
deeper down in Dixie. Wilson has 13 seasons as head coach of South
Carolina to her credit, not to mention a wondrous, rolling Southern
drawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere we go around here, Nancy has to repeat everything
because people can't understand what she's saying,'' Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   True, in these Northwest environs, honey-coated Carolina accents
are about as common as sunny days in winter. But in this brave new
world of professional women's basketball, the Reign's two Southern
coaches have made their way West, getting some interesting lessons
in geography, among other things, along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for the Reign's road game against the Power, Holder
and Wilson were flying with the team down to Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``And here was Nancy reciting all the names of the mountains,''
Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stewardess was trying to correct me, but I know which ones
are which. There was Baker, Rainier, Mount St. Helen's and Adams,''
Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, Wilson's ability to identify the volcanic peaks of
the Cascades was pretty darn good for a woman who vowed last
December that her stint in Seattle would last only until the end of
the 1997-98 season.
</P>
<P>
   For Holder, who was named head coach a year ago after the
midseason firing of Jacquie Hullah, it had been a semi-hard sell to
get Wilson to join her.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson and Holder first met in 1982 during an Athletes in Action
basketball tour in Southeast Asia. Two years later, after Holder
got her master's degree from Richmond, Wilson invited Holder to be
one of her assistants at South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the roles are slightly reversed, although Holder
refuses to call Wilson her ``assistant,'' since coaching duties and
leadership on the Reign are equal. Holder runs the offense, Wilson
the defense. Holder works the officials and runs the huddles.
Wilson diagrams plays and keeps track of the details.
</P>
<P>
   `We're just two ladies coaching a very great group of basketball
players,'' said Holder, who is just glad Wilson decided to help out
with the Reign.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I told Tammy I'd come out here, I had no intention of
being out here for more than those 2{ months,'' said Wilson, who
resigned at South Carolina in March 1997 to care for her ailing
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'd have to say that 15 minutes after I was on the court
for that first (Reign) practice, I loved it. I had totally
forgotten, in those last years that I was in the SEC (the
ultra-competitive Southeastern Conference) beating my head against
the wall every day, how much I loved the actual game,'' Wilson
said.
</P>
<P>
   In this new era of women's pro hoops, we've heard a lot of talk
about how great it is for the nation's top women players to have a
place to go once their college careers are complete.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Starbird and Niesa Johnson and Val Whiting and Shalonda
Enis all are former collegiate standouts whose job it is now to win
games for the Reign _ something they are doing with remarkable
frequency these days, going 7-2. They move the ball. They run and
shoot and believe they should win. They can play.
</P>
<P>
   But if women's pro hoops has broadened the horizons of the
athletes whose futures now extend beyond college, what can you say
about the coaches?
</P>
<P>
   Here in Seattle, Holder and Wilson are getting their opportunity
to dig into the game they love at a higher level, too. And both
women are more than pleasantly surprised about what they have
discovered about coaching a women's pro team, free of the
recruiting and academic issues that make college coaching so
exhausting.
</P>
<P>
   When Holder was working with Wilson at Carolina, she said it was
draining ``keeping up with the Joneses'' of the powerful SEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the ACC was right next door, too. We had one of the
nation's top recruits tell us that she thought Geno Auriemma, who
as an assistant at Virginia at the time (now coach of the mighty
UConn women), was the most handsome man she had ever seen. So we
knew we were in for a tough battle to get her to sign with us,''
Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, too, was astounded by the growing demands of running a
top-notch Division I women's program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty brutal in the SEC. I mean, there was no relief
anywhere in your conference schedule. And when South Carolina moved
into the SEC, yes, it opened the door for us to get into the homes
of a lot of top recruits, but that didn't mean we could get them. I
mean, (the University of) Georgia and (Pat Summit's) Tennessee were
one state away.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Wilson did not score her share of top recruits, helping
Wilson become a mainstay with USA Basketball. Now, though, the
rigors of relentless recruiting are behind Wilson and Holder, who
are thrilled to be able to do more pure coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a coach's dream,'' Holder said. ``These women are
self-disciplined and they're all talented.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think on this level, you can coach to each player's
strength. In college, you coach to hide your team's weaknesses,''
Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing when not to overcoach may be the secret to success in
the women's pro game _ something the first Reign coaching staff did
not understand. Luckily, the Reign has two very pro coaches whose
experience and philosophy have unlocked the potential of this
winning team.
</P>
<P>
   And they can even recite the names of the Cascade's highest
peaks, in buttery Southern accents to boot.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
WACO _ After back-to-back 2-9 seasons, Baylor officials announced
Sunday night that head football coach Dave Roberts would be
reassigned within the athletic department.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baylor athletic director Tom Stanton was not available for
comment, but a faxed release from the athletic department said the
search for a new coach would begin immediately. No information was
provided on the status of the assistant coaches under Roberts, but
the release said Roberts would be given other responsibilities in
the department.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors about Roberts being replaced have been circulating for
more than a week, and there has been speculation that school
officials are interested in former Texas A&AMP;M and Alabama coach Gene
Stallings, who has a ranch in Paris, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not been contacted by Baylor,'' Stallings said Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Stallings, 63, said he is committed to coaching a college
all-star team that will play a series of games in Italy next
summer. When asked if he would be interested if Baylor contacted
him, Stallings said: ``I think the chances of me getting back in it
are slim.''
</P>
<P>
   Stallings retired from coaching three years ago, but he led the
Crimson Tide to the 1992 national championship. He was 70-16-1 as
head coach at Alabama from 1990-96. Stallings was head coach at
Texas A&AMP;M from 1965 to 1971 and also coached the Arizona Cardinals
from 1986 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Gunn, an administrative assistant on the Baylor coaching
staff, is Stallings' son-in-law. One source close to the Baylor
athletic program said school officials had considered bringing in
Stallings for two or three years to groom Dallas Highland Park High
School coach Scott Smith to take over the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not been contacted by anyone from Baylor,'' Smith said
when reached at home Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would entertain an offer to join the Baylor coaching
staff, Smith said: ``I can't comment on that, because we just
finished our season here last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 40, was a backup quarterback and defensive back for
former Baylor coach Grant Teaff from 1977 to 1981 and served as a
graduate assistant under Teaff for two seasons. Smith led Highland
Park to the Class 4A playoffs each of the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   It also has been speculated that Teaff, who coached the Bears
from 1972 to 1992, might be asked to come in on a short-term basis
if Stallings were not interested.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, 51, informed the players Sunday evening that he would
not be the coach next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys were disappointed, but some were relieved,'' Baylor
linebacker David Armstrong said. ``We're just tired of going
through all this losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor was 2-9 overall and 1-7 in Big 12 play in each of the two
seasons under Roberts, a former offensive coordinator at Notre Dame
under Lou Holtz.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears were 2-3 after five games this season, including an
upset over North Carolina State, which was ranked 25th in the
nation at the time after an upset of Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   But it was all downhill after a victory against Kansas on Oct.
10. The Bears lost their last six games, and attendance at Floyd
Casey Stadium was the lowest in more than 20 years. The team
finished last in the Big 12 in total offense and total defense.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, a former head coach at Northeast Louisiana and Western
Kentucky with a career record of 68-67-3, was hired to replace
Chuck Reedy, who was fired after the Bears recorded a 4-7 record in
the first year of the Big 12 Conference in 1996. Reedy was
finishing the fourth year of a five-year contract as the handpicked
replacement for Teaff.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor is in the process of spending millions to upgrade Floyd
Casey Stadium, including the addition of 34 luxury suites and a new
press box. Most of the suites already have been sold for next
season.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say some of the prominent alumni who have purchased
luxury suites were insistent that a change be made with the head
coach before next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like there was a big demand to get (Roberts) out,''
Baylor cornerback Gary Baxter said. ``I guess they felt they had to
make a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor officials never announced the length of Roberts'
contract, but he is believed to have had a three-year deal.
Roberts' tenure as head coach was the shortest at the school since
1913, when Norman Payne left after one season with a 4-4-2 record.

`BUG'S LIFE' REMAINS ATOP THE HOLLYWOOD FOOD CHAIN

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Moviegoers continued to swarm the nation's
multiplexes to see ``A Bug's Life'' as the computer-animated comedy
dominated the U.S. box office with an estimated $17.4 million at
2,701 theaters during the Friday-Sunday period, studio sources said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The results gave the Disney project, co-produced by Pixar
Animation, a total of $69 million after 12 days in nationwide
release. The Friday-Sunday take for ``A Bug's Life'' declined 47
percent from the previous Friday-Sunday, in line with forecasts as
overall moviegoing followed its traditional pattern of sliding
sharply during the first weekend of December following Thanksgiving
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Disney marketing executive Chuck Viane noted that the
weekend-to-weekend decline for ``A Bug's Life'' was the smallest of
holdover films. ``We are getting a very balanced demographic for
this film and we are starting to see a lot of repeat viewers,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Viane pointed out that one-third of the audience for ``A Bug's
Life'' has been between 2 and 11 years old and another third
between 12 and 25.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Arthur Rockwell said ``A Bug's Life'' would easily
outperform the past three Disney animated films _ ``The Hunchback
of Notre Dame,'' ``Hercules'' and ``Mulan'' _ but might not match
the $192 million domestic take of 1995's ``Toy Story,'' the first
Disney-Pixar collaboration, due to increased choices for
moviegoers. `` `A Bug's Life' has obviously done very well against
tremendous competition,'' Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's opening of its ``Psycho'' remake, starring Anne
Heche and Vince Vaughn, debuted with a respectable $10.7 million at
2,477 theaters as it benefited from being the only major movie to
debut, the popularity of the horror genre and the novelty of
reshooting the 1960 Alfred Hitchcock release.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Psycho' is getting tons of press and the market is deluged
with family films right now,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, president of
the Reel Source forecasting service. He projected ``Psycho'' could
gross as much as $50 million domestically, which would make the $20
million movie highly profitable for its beleaguered studio.
</P>
<P>
   Three holdovers also performed solidly, led by Disney's third
weekend of ``Enemy of the State'' with $9.5 million at 2,458 sites
as the Will Smith vehicle neared $63 million after 17 days.
Paramount's third weekend of ``The Rugrats Movie'' followed with $8
million at 2,832 theaters to nearly hit $68 million and Disney's
fifth weekend of ``The Waterboy'' continued to draw decently with
$6.6 million at 2,778 locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Waterboy'' now has $130.8 million after 31 days and is the
89th film to take in more than $130 million at the domestic box
office.
</P>
<P>
   The overall weekend total hit close to $77 million, up an
impressive 35 percent from the year-ago period, as the top five
films accounted for two-thirds of receipts. Year-to-date business
has topped $6.1 billion, or about 10 percent ahead of last year's
total to this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of good product out there,'' Rockwell said.
``Christmas shopping did not derail the business.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's downside came from a pair of high-priced Universal
projects that continued to perform below expectations _ the fourth
weekend of ``Meet Joe Black'' with $2.6 million at 2,180 screens
and the second weekend of ``Babe: Pig in the City'' with $2.5
million at 2,385 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The negative press has just killed `Babe,' '' Bucksbaum said
of the sequel, costing a reported $90 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babe: Pig in the City'' earned a mere $11.5 million after 12
days and its poor performance led to the recent departure of studio
chief Casey Silver. The studio has launched a massive push for its
next film, ``Patch Adams,'' starring Robin Williams in a medical
school comedy due out Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Gramercy's fifth weekend of ``Elizabeth'' continued to draw well
in eighth with $2 million at 540 theaters. Warner Bros.' second
weekend of Drew Barrymore's ``Home Fries'' followed in ninth with
$1.76 million at 1,925 locations, edging Sony's fourth weekend of
``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer'' with $1.75 million at
2,212 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   PolyGram's ``Very Bad Things'' followed in 11th with $1.6
million at 1,260 locations.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax's opening of Academy Awards hopeful ``Little Voice''
generated solid results with $91,400 at six theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life'' could lead next weekend although it will face
solid competition from Paramount's opening of ``Star Trek:
Insurrection'' at more than 2,600 theaters. Also debuting will be
Warner's family comedy ``Jack Frost,'' starring Michael Keaton.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WE sat in our living rooms and couldn't believe our eyes.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the most dramatic, decisive day of college football
we had seen all year. It just couldn't get any better.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA put on a wild show, with Cade McNown becoming a human
adjective, tossing heroic bombs all over the football patch.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Bruins watched their national-championship hopes go
south, to Miami, mostly because the Bruins' defense was like a
cheap horror movie _ it looked fierce but for the most part was
harmless.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Texas A&AMP;M showed Bill Snyder's Kansas State Wildcats that
loose lips don't sink ships, but Aggies linebacker Dat Nguyen and
the better-late-than-never careers of seniors Branndon Stewart and
Sirr Parker do.
</P>
<P>
   After a season's worth of muzzling the spectacular Michael
Bishop, Snyder tried to put the disappointment into words once the
Aggies' shocking double-overtime upset was done. But it was all
just silent screams.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there was the definitive and impressive Tennessee
finish to the Southeastern Conference title game. This Tennessee
team proved it deserves a shot at the national championship, no
matter what kind of close calls the Vols might have had against
Syracuse, Arkansas or anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Shakedown Saturday sent the pollsters scurrying for a way to
make sense of it all and the Bowl Championship Series computers
wheezing and coughing in search of a way to squeeze four or five
deserving teams into a two-team Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, it was a day that deserved better treatment
than it received Sunday. Somebody should sue over the
bowl-selection debacle.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps BCS chief Roy Kramer even should sue himself, calling it
Kramer vs. Kramer, because on the one hand he told us that
Shakedown Saturday only showed why the ``integrity'' of the current
system should remain untouched. But on the other, he responded to
the clear injustices of the bowl pairings Sunday by saying, hey,
this is just a business.
</P>
<P>
   What's it going to be, Roy? Integrity or business?
</P>
<P>
   Kramer and the BCS boys told us one thing but showed us another.
What's it going to be? More years of late-season bowl-pairing
letdowns? Or finally a playoff system that could make days like
Saturday lead to something other than frustration for clear title
contenders?
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the glowing aftermath there should have been after
Saturday's remarkable games, it proved to be a Sunday, bloody
Sunday of fuming fans, bickering experts and coaches feeling
spurned and cheated.
</P>
<P>
   After not believing our eyes for all the terrific college
football moments, we could not believe our ears when the BCS tried
to tell us everything was fine with K-State getting snubbed and
Syracuse making it into a $12 million game.
</P>
<P>
   What should have followed Saturday's entertaining day was
another one the next weekend, as survivors moved on to the
semifinals, then those survivors to the final. Each round of the
remainder of the season would prove to be better than the previous
one. And no one could argue with the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as Saturday should not have been the best thing
we'll see all year, it's going to have to be. The bowl system
failed again. Boy, Roy. You've gotta do better than this.
</P>
<P>
   Florida-Syracuse in the Orange Bowl? Kramer talked integrity but
then told us the Gators ``earned'' the at-large berth instead of
the higher-ranked Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State was on the brink of the national championship into
the evening hours Saturday and fought to the last man in double
overtime. Its reward was a trip to the Alamo Bowl against Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   We heard about the business of it all, but it's all funny
business.
</P>
<P>
   And come Jan. 5, there will be questions asked, people wondering
and coaches, players and fans justifiably feeling cheated.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee-Florida State will be a terrific match in the Fiesta,
no doubt. If the Vols win, few could argue against their
national-championship rights.
</P>
<P>
   But wouldn't you have wanted to see what Ohio State could have
done over the next couple of weekends? Or what the Buckeyes could
have done in an eventual matchup with Tennessee? Or how Kansas
State would have reacted to its heartbreaker?
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't you have sat there and watched every moment of the next
round of games? There would have been Arizona, Syracuse, Florida,
maybe even overlooked Tulane providing the kinds of thrills that
Miami, Texas A&AMP;M and Tennessee did Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been the logical next step. It's what Saturday
deserved but didn't get.

DEFENSE SPARKS PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Chad Eaton had just beaten up the best center in
the business, Pittsburgh's Dermontti Dawson, for a team-high eight
tackles and three sacks. His arms and neck were red and scraped
from the battle, and sweat was pouring from him.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton was pleased, and he was asked about Sunday's defensive
revival by the Patriots, who held the Steelers to three field
goals, kept Kordell Stewart to no rushing attempts, caused him to
rush his throws (21 of 45, 206 yards, two interceptions), and held
Jerome Bettis to 48 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally,'' said Eaton, who watched admiringly as his former
Washington State teammate, quarterback Drew Bledsoe, connected nine
times with Terry Glenn in a 23-9 victory over the Steelers.
``Finally, we were able to shut down a team. The last two weeks
were about our offense making the plays at the end of the game to
win, but today we finally got our defense right.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' third straight win, in balmy Three Rivers Stadium,
improved them to 8-5. They remained tied with Buffalo for third
place in the AFC East, as the Bills and the teams tied one game
ahead in first, the Jets and Dolphins, also won.
</P>
<P>
   But middle linebacker Ted Johnson tore his right biceps tendon
on the second play of the game and is lost for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the team rallied around that.
</P>
<P>
   Backup Marty Moore came on and helped fill the enormous void by
stuffing the run.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pete Carroll paid tribute to Johnson afterward, calling
him the ``heart and soul of our defense.'' But as Johnson watched
from the sideline, he probably saw more heart and soul than he's
seen from the defense all season.
</P>
<P>
   The containment game New England played, the blitzing from new
angles and on delays, all were huge in stopping the Steelers, who
have only six field goals to show for their last 14 red zone
chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers may not even make it to the playoffs now, with a
7-6 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed,'' said Steelers coach Bill Cowher.
``Right now we're going to find out about ourselves, this whole
football team. I'm going to sit down, look at it, and make some
decisions accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have no such worries. They found out a lot about
their character and their ability to finally win in Pittsburgh
after a 12-year drought.
</P>
<P>
   Revenge was theirs after the Steelers had snatched two
heart-breaking games from them last season, including the 7-6
playoff loss here.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe threw for 327 yards, with one touchdown and three
interceptions, and he found Glenn often. Glenn, who didn't speak to
reporters after submitting the greatest receiving performance in
Patriots history by going for 193 yards on those nine grabs, caught
an 86-yard bomb with 1:56 left in the first half that made it 13-3,
Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry is so explosive coming out of the break that people who
cover him have to give him some space and give up the underneath
stuff, but he just broke loose and I found him out there all
alone,'' Bledsoe said.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn beat his coverage by a country mile as the Steelers
blitzed Bledsoe on the play. Glenn waited for the heave, caught it
at the 45, and sprinted the rest of the way with free safety Darren
Perry chasing helplessly. It was the fourth-longest pass play in
Patriots history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry continues to show how important he is to our club,''
said Carroll. ``And Drew, on that corner route that went for a
touchdown, was an exceptionally thrown ball, since he had to throw
it at the last possible second.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In that situation, Terry was one-on-one with the safety,''
said fellow receiver Shawn Jefferson. ``Any time you hook up a
receiver one-on-one with the safety, it's a win-win situation. They
have a tendency to blitz; that's how we ended up with that
matchup.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were running a lot of stunts on us early in the game, and
then, after that play, they backed off a bit,'' said center Dave
Wohlabaugh.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots survived a sloppy third quarter, in which they were
penalized eight times (they had 12 for 77 yards in all).
</P>
<P>
   On their first possession of the second half, Bledsoe moved the
Patriots from their 25 to the 42 before he fumbled (and recovered
it), then had an interception, when he tried to step up in the
pocket and was picked off by Chris Oldham.
</P>
<P>
   At that point Bledsoe was having problems with the splint on his
broken finger, and balls were taking off on him.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers took over at the New England 46, but could manage
only a Norm Johnson 43-yard field goal to make it 13-9.
</P>
<P>
   When the Patriots got the ball back, more throws were sailing on
Bledsoe, giving rise to the possibility that Tom Tupa or Scott
Zolak might get the call. New England started the drive at its 19
following a holding penalty on a kickoff and went in reverse to the
5.
</P>
<P>
   Tupa was forced to punt from deep in his end zone, and he boomed
a 63-yarder that Courtney Hawkins returned 14 yards to the Steelers
49. But the Patriots' defense got tough. Eaton stuck Bettis on a
2-yard gain and then Stewart made two poor throws, one with Lawyer
Milloy and Larry Whigham hitting him right after.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots remained in poor field position until the defense
made a huge play. Willie Clay tipped a Stewart pass intended for
Charles Johnson, and it was picked off by Ty Law at the Steeler 18
as time expired in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots tried three runs by Robert Edwards, but he was
stuffed for a 3-yard loss on third and 2, setting the stage for
Adam Vinatieri's third field goal, a 35-yarder that made it 16-9.
</P>
<P>
   After the kickoff, with the crowd booing loudly, Stewart
completed a 7-yard pass to tight end Mark Bruener. But on second
and 3 from the Steeler 33, Bettis fumbled when Eaton forced the
ball loose and Milloy recovered at the 35.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, who didn't know how he reinjured his finger, now was
fitted with a longer splint, giving him more control of the ball.
He hit Glenn for a 9-yard gain, and one play later Derrick Cullors
hit the hole hard for a 6-yard gain for a first down at the 22. A
holding call on Wohlabaugh set the Patriots back 10 yards, but
Levon Kirkland interfered with Ben Coates near the sideline inside
the 5 and a flag was thrown. Edwards, who carried the ball 28 times
for 66 yards, then had his finest run of the day, being stopped
cold and then bouncing off Kirkland and Carnell Lake to get in the
end zone with 9:20 left to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers couldn't score, even with the help of a Bledsoe
interception by linebacker Earl Holmes at the Patriots' 22. They
got as close as the New England 9, but a breakup of a fourth-down
pass by Law ended that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very big,'' said Coates of the win. ``We just have to
take it and enjoy it and get ready for the Rams. We hold our own
destiny now.''

STEWART LEARNS HARD LESSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Kordell Stewart sat alone for a long time Sunday
afternoon, stuffed deep into the darkness of his thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback of the Pittsburgh Steelers leaned back into the
shadows of his locker to a place where it was quiet for the first
time all day and said nothing for a time. A long time.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally he would bite his lip or glance around a room
stuffed with players and sportswriters, but he addressed neither.
Instead he watched in silence, enjoying the brief absence of the
ugly cacophony that has surrounded him all season.
</P>
<P>
   For those few minutes, no one was cursing his name. No one was
screaming at him about his ineptitude. No one was throwing beer on
him. No one was saying anything to him, because what was there to
say after you have played badly and been treated worse by 58,000
people who call themselves your fans?
</P>
<P>
   Keep a stiff upper lip, mate?
</P>
<P>
   Fear not, pal?
</P>
<P>
   Et tu, Brute?
</P>
<P>
   What could anyone say to Kordell Stewart Sunday that would take
the sting away?
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour earlier, he had finished up a day in which he'd
thrown two killer inteceptions, been sacked three times, completed
less than 50 percent of his passes, ran for not a yard, and failed
to get his team a touchdown in a 23-9 loss to the Patriots on the
Steelers' home turf, turf that used to be friendly but this season
has turned unforgiving not to the Steelers' opponents but to
themselves, and most of all to a second-year starter who is
struggling the way second-year starters do at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   In his heart, Stewart understands what's happening at the
moment. He has a new offensive coordinator this year before he'd
even fully learned what the last one was trying to teach him. He
has an offensive line in front of him weakened by injury and
free-agent defections. Same is true of his receiving corps and his
running backs.
</P>
<P>
   So should it come as a shock that he is struggling to find
himself and in his struggles failing to produce the plays that
first won him the job, the same plays his team needs to keep itself
alive in the AFC playoff chase now?
</P>
<P>
   It must be to some, but not as surprising as it was to Stewart
to be walking off his home field Sunday and have someone throw a
cup of beer on him as if he was any enemy of the Roman government
leaving the Coliseum with the lions in pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's agitating to walk off the field and have people throw
beer on you and call you things,'' Stewart said about Steeler fans'
reaction to their team slipping to 7-6 and all but eliminating
itself from the playoff race. ``I never have had that happen
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans are gonna be there when you do great and not when you
don't. We all know that. There's a lot of frustration right now,
and the only way I can handle it is to stay calm and not act out of
character. I have to wait to fight another day.''
</P>
<P>
   As the hour drew short Sunday in the fourth quarter, Stewart did
not seem to have much fight left in him after he threw an
interception that led to a Patriot field goal and fullback Jerome
Bettis followed six plays later with a fumble that led to a New
England touchdown that changed the game from a 13-9 nail-biter to a
23-9 beer-thrower.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Stewart started drives at the Patriot 22 and their
49 and failed to get his team another point, and each time the
crowd booed him incessantly when he went to the sideline. There he
stood alone, a baseball cap pulled down over his shaved head and no
one within 10 yards of him.
</P>
<P>
   This was Kordell Stewart's public pose as the game's final
minute wound down. A young man alone. Surely that is how a youthful
quarterback with little experience must feel. It was written on his
face. It was obvious as he sat naked but for two white ankle wraps
still taped to his legs for a long time in front of his locker,
speaking to no one and no one speaking to him.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally did emerge from that cocoon more than an hour
after the loss, the quarterback spoke quietly but from the heart.
His confusion at what has befallen a team he led to the AFC
Championship Game last year was clear. So, too, was the hurt he is
carrying with him because his own fans have turned on him, calling
for his benching on talk radio and pelting him with liquid
commentary as he simply tried to go home.
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart spoke of something more than that, too. He spoke of
who he still believes he is regardless of how many critics now
curse his name in Pittsburgh. He spoke of who he is and who he
believes he still will be one day soon. Maybe not soon enough to
save the Steelers this season, but soon enough for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My confidence is still there,'' Stewart said when asked if the
fact he'd thrown 11 touchdown passes and 13 interceptions this
season reflected a lessening in his belief in his arm's
trustworthiness. ``I feel I'm just as good as any quarterback in
this league.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a winner and you're used to success, it causes you
to wonder what's going on. To come so close and lose because you
didn't make plays is an emotional thing. But I understand the fans
are going to be the fans. They booed Neil O'Donnell, and he took us
to the Super Bowl. They probably helped run him out of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, they're not going to run me out of here. They're going
to have to deal with me. I understand memories are real short. I'm
a young guy who is working hard with his teammates to get something
done, but I'm getting some knives thrown at the back of my head a
couple of times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee you this: You put any of them in this position and
they are not going to get it done. That's why I'm here. I can get
it done. I will get it done.
</P>

not as bad as it seems. I assure you of that. I'm still the same
guy who took his team to the AFC Championship and came up 3 points

VICTORY FORGED BY SPEED OF GLENN 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ He is not the fastest man in the NFL. At least not
officially. But it doesn't matter. Terry Glenn doesn't have to be
the swiftest man in his league. All he has to think about on Sunday
afternoons is this: Am I the fastest man in my stadium?
</P>
<P>
   Glenn stood in a Three Rivers Stadium mirror Sunday and asked
himself that question. The Patriots receiver is so fast that he was
gone before his reflection could stare back at him and give an
affirmative answer. OK, that's an exaggeration. But only by a
little bit. You want to check Glenn's speed credentials? Talk to
Chad Eaton. Talk to Shawn Jefferson. Check with Drew Bledsoe. And,
most important, chat with a man named Darren Perry. Glenn is so
fast that Steeler safety Perry still hasn't seen his face. All
Perry knows is that Glenn wears No. 88 and has his name on the back
of his white jersey, and that when you are 10 yards behind him on a
field, you probably aren't going to catch him.
</P>
<P>
   Perry was in that unwinnable position Sunday. In the second
quarter, Bledsoe noticed that Glenn was one-on-one with Perry. The
quarterback threw the ball from his 5, Glenn caught it at the New
England 45, and that was it. Perry was trailing, looking like a kid
wheezing and screaming, ``Wait up!'' to his big brother. But like
many big brothers, Glenn didn't wait. He just kept running. Fast.
So fast that he probably taunted Perry on his way to the end zone,
but it came so fast that Perry didn't hear him.
</P>
<P>
   Before the play, which would cover 86 yards, many people
wondered if Glenn's sore left hamstring was bothering him. But
there would be no pull-ups or limps on this run. Glenn ran toward
the end zone and slowed up, only to do an appropriately quick
dance. Fast guys can do that because the nearest defender is
usually 10 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, did you see that?'' Bledsoe said after the Patriots' 23-9
win was secured. He went on to explain that he saw the Steelers
were blitzing on the play and that someone was going to be open.
``They blitz with the idea that I won't have enough time to find
someone,'' Bledsoe said. He first looked for Ben Coates, but the
tight end was covered. So he looked left to Glenn's side of the
field, threw toward him, and watched him sprint down the sideline.
By the time the day was over, Glenn had nine catches for a
team-record 193 yards.
</P>
<P>
   It might be a redundancy to mention that Glenn is far too fast
for lay people. You might already have told yourself: If Perry, a
professional football player, can't catch Glenn, how is some
slow-footed journalist going to catch up to him? If you had that
thought, congratulations. Glenn was so efficient with his movements
Sunday that many of the media types assembled here didn't even see
him. That's right. At least Perry was within 10 yards of him. But
after the game, Glenn apparently wasn't in the mood to talk. He was
able to shower, pick up his clothes, dress, and leap on the team
bus without being seen by many people. Then again, maybe he didn't
shower. And that's cool. Most pro athletes can definitely use some
soap, water, and, eventually, cologne after a game. Not Glenn. He
is so fast that he probably doesn't even sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton did see Glenn before the game. In fact, he was right next
to him. Their lockers were side by side Sunday. ``He's a great
neighbor,'' Eaton said. ``He doesn't say much. Just real focused.''
Eaton, a defensive lineman, says a lot. He is the same man who
swears he was abducted in 1984. He is the same man who swears he
was struck by lightning in May. So Eaton had to say something to
the Fastest Man In The Stadium. What was it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him to go out there and kick butt,'' Eaton said. ``I
told him that he could do great things with his speed.''
</P>
<P>
   And then what happened?
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like, `Yeah, whatever,''' Eaton said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   He probably said a lot more than that. But Eaton didn't hear it.
Remember: Terry Glenn is fast. Real fast. He walks fast and runs
even faster. He even looks fast. And you know what happens when
receivers have that track-star look about them? Cornerbacks react.
More specifically, cornerbacks back up. That's what the Steelers
did, often lining up 6 or 7 yards away from Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``That surprised me,'' Jefferson said. ``But maybe I shouldn't
be surprised. All of our receivers are fast.''
</P>
<P>
   This is true. Although Glenn may be the fastest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference when he's out there,'' Jefferson said.
``You can see it and so can everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Steelers, they won't have to see Glenn again
this year. What's so unfortunate about that is they won't see him
in the playoffs because, for the first time under coach Bill
Cowher, they probably won't be in the playoffs. The Patriots hope
they see Glenn for the rest of the season. And they want to see him
in his game gear, not the jeans, boots, and hooded sweatshirts they
have seen him wear on many Sundays while his teammates were in
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots need Glenn. They need him available for the final
three games of the season if they want to think about the playoffs.
He makes things easier for everyone. Even Robert Edwards was
claiming that Glenn helped the running game, which accumulated a
scant 73 yards. ``They don't put so many people (between the
tackles) when he is there,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   When he is there. That's the key phrase. When he is not, the New
England offense tends to sputter. Quickly.

FORMER COUP LEADER WINS VENEZUELEAN PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CARACUS, Venezuela _ Venezuelans swept a former coup-leader,
Hugo Chavez, to a historic election victory on Sunday night,
delivering him the presidency he failed to seize by force six years
ago. Hoping for an end to decades of poverty amid oil wealth,
euphoric supporters of the former paratrooper burst onto the
streets and filled them with music, fireworks and blaring horns.
</P>
<P>
   The former lieutenant colonel, who on Sunday defeated a
Yale-educated businessman, Henrique Salas Romer, with more than 50
percent of the vote, is the first leader in 40 years who has not
come from Venezuela's dominant political parties. His meteoric
success among legions of disaffected voters smashed the old-line
party machinery and fanned fears of leftist dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are democrats, and we are going to demonstrate it now,'' he
told a television interviewer here Sunday night, smoothing over the
hostility that had marked the campaign. ``We're not tyrants. We're
not dictators.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night enthusiastic crowds, many sporting Chavez's
trademark red beret, filled a main avenue and shouted, ``Viva
Venezuela! Viva Chavez!'' They chanted demands to rewrite the 1961
Constitution, which had bolstered the rule of the elite for the
four decades of Venezuela's democracy. ``Chavez: A National
Feeling,'' declared a tall yellow banner raised to serve as the
triumphant candidate's backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   As the streets throbbed with the joy of his supporters, nobody
was really sure what Venezuela would look like under Chavez, who
has been called a nationalist, a Communist, a hero and a would-be
dictator. In the campaign, he frequently sported the red beret of
the military special forces he once led to storm the presidential
palace and called on supporters to crush ``los corruptos'' on
election day.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night he took off his beret and wore a business suit
in a series of interviews. He said his priorities would be
improving education and health care, and creating jobs. He took aim
at the state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, saying its
budget and operations should be subordinated to national, rather
than corporate, goals. ``It cannot be seen as a state within a
state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chavez has mentioned privatizing some operations and
overseas assets, he ruled out selling the oil company to pay off
the country's debt. ``We are going to pay our foreign debt, but we
have a quantity of other mechanisms to do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned restructuring the foreign debt and trading ``a part
of the debt for investment projects.'' He also said Venezuela might
seek a one or two year ``grace period'' for some of its debt,
``during which the country can recover.''
</P>
<P>
   A fiery orator who has visited Cuba and praised President Fidel
Castro, Chavez has become the symbol of hope through radical change
for the four out of five Venezuelans who are poor, and the
dangerous devil to the 20 percent who do not.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of the announcement of his victory, Chavez
pledged to seek moderation and foster forgiveness, after a campaign
rife with disinformation, innuendo and dirty tricks. Just days ago,
at his closing rally in downtown Caracas, he had warned 700,000
supporters about the prospect they might lose the election through
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, he told his supporters to ``celebrate, but with
humility, even with silence, with reflection. It's not about
sticking your head out of the window, because tomorrow we begin
another battle'' to rebuild Venezuela, he said. He called on
Venezuelans to build ``with harmony, and with a great capacity for
forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To those who have made mistakes, we say, `So did we.' Let's
forgive each other our errors,'' Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
   With 78 percent of the vote counted, Chavez had 56 percent
compared to 40 percent for Salas, according to official results
from the National Electoral Council.
</P>
<P>
   In conceding defeat, Salas struck a similarly conciliatory note.
``I want to say to all Venezuelans that not only do I accept my
adversary's victory, I also wish him much luck because his luck is
Venezuela's luck,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Chavez called on the banking and private sector to bring back
assets and investment capital sent abroad, precisely out of fear he
would win Sunday's election. Chavez offered to open talks with the
private sector, adding, ``Venezuela needs you, it needs friends.''
He told business leaders he wanted to understand ``how to interpret
your expectations, your anxieties, your aspirations.''
</P>
<P>
   But initially, those appeals seemed to draw little more than
skepticism. Eric Ekvall, a political consultant here, was watching
Chavez's interview with a group of very wary business executives.
</P>
<P>
   When the president-elect called for the repatriation of capital,
``There was a whoop of derisive laughter from the group here,''
Ekvall said. The reaction, he added, ``sets the tone for how a lot
of the business community here is going to react to him in the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of massive fraud, of a post-election settling of scores,
and threats of rioting ran like rivers through the capital in the
days leading up to the election on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Though Chavez had been leading in election polls by 15 to 22
points, veteran political analysts said on Sunday night they were
still surprised that the old parties released their once-iron
fisted hold on power under the weight of the democratic will.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are historic elections,'' the American ambassador here,
John Maisto, said in an interview with reporters before the Chavez
victory. ``Nothing like these elections has happened in Venezuela's
history.''
</P>
<P>
   The ambassador also said Washington would ``work with any
government, no matter who is elected.'' Previously, the Clinton
administration had denied Chavez a visa, citing his role in the
attempted coup, but a State Department spokesman suggested last
week that Chavez might have better luck securing a visa next time.
The rejection, he said, ``is in the past, and the future we will
deal with at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   After trying, and failing, to seize power in two attempted coups
against Carlos Andres Perez in 1992, Chavez became a symbol for
Venezuelans impatient with corruption and misery amid vast oil
wealth. Chavez went to jail for two years, but Perez lost as well:
he was impeached to face corruption charges a year later. The
paratrooper's popularity grew.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His statements have fallen all over the political map, often
depending on his audiences, although he has generally moved toward
the center in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Educated Venezuelans doubt Chavez's devotion to democracy, while
the poor say democracy here has been little more than a cover for
institutional corruption. Venezuela is the leading exporter of oil
to the United States, and the biggest oil producing country outside
the Middle East, but 40 percent of its people live in dire poverty,
unable to afford a nourishing diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We voted Chavez because we want a change, not a
dictatorship,'' said Kurokwis Escobar, 35, who paints cars for a
living.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we need a change,'' declared Hughes Castilla
Molina, 52, who owns an auto repair shop. ``If you say we're going
to lose our liberty, I say we've lost it already. At least we'll
have a change. We'll have education, health care, and housing,
which we don't have now. That's the popular clamor.''
</P>
<P>
   From the poor hillside slums like Petare to the posh, tree-lined
streets of Altamir, Venezuelans turned out in record numbers to
vote in an election freighted with a sense of history in the
making.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-day, the number of voters at polling stations around
Caracas had exceeded the total balloting in congressional and state
elections a month ago, when Chavez's Patriotic Pole won a plurality
with a third of the legislature and eight of the 23 governorships.
</P>
<P>
   For 40 years, the two traditional parties, Democratic Action and
Copei, had shared the spoils of power in this oil-rich nation, and
by the end of voting, their long day in the sun had come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the two parties fielded no candidates for
president, and instead threw their support behind Salas in an
unsuccessful, last ditch effort to tip the election in his favor.

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
DENVER _ For almost 54 minutes, the undefeated, untied Denver
Broncos were about to be undone by the Kansas City Chiefs in a
shocking upset that would have reverberated all the way to Miami
and New York.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Chiefs and beleaguered coach Marty
Schottenheimer, John Elway authored another unbelievable comeback
Sunday to secure the home-field advantage in the first round of the
playoffs for the third consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   Elway's 24-yard pass to tight end Shannon Sharpe with 3:34
remaining was the decisive touchdown in the Broncos' 35-31 victory,
as they became the third 13-0 team in NFL history and tied a league
record with their 18th consecutive win.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably as fun a game as I've been involved in in a
long time,'' Elway said after throwing for 400 yards and two
touchdowns and engineering his 47th come-from-behind win, including
nine against Schottenheimer. ``It seemed like old times.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway's winning touchdown pass enabled the Broncos to overcome a
31-21 fourth-quarter deficit and remain unbeaten with games left
against the New York Giants, Miami and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the 1972 Dolphins, the only undefeated and untied
champions in NFL history, celebrate each season when the last
undefeated team is beaten. They will have to keep their champagne
on ice for at least another week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they never get to pop that champagne,'' said Elway, who
has thrown nine touchdown passes in his last three games.
</P>
<P>
   NFL and ABC executives in New York breathed a collective sigh of
relief because the Broncos remained unbeaten. They are hoping that
if Denver is 14-0 entering its Dec. 21 Monday-night game at Miami,
it could be watched by more television viewers than any
regular-season game in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``This crown just keeps getting heavier and heavier,'' Broncos
defensive end Neil Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos flirted with disaster against the Chiefs, falling
behind by 14 in the first quarter and 10 in the fourth, thanks to
three touchdown passes by Kansas City quarterback Rich Gannon. In
between, they suffered two turnovers in the Chiefs' end zone _ an
Elway interception and a Terrell Davis fumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of early and late adversity,'' Denver coach Mike
Shanahan said. ``They caught us off balance on both sides of the
ball, and we fell behind, but we kept our composure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an opportunity to score almost every time we had the
ball, but bad things kept happening to us. We stuck together. John
made big plays down the stretch. The defense came up with some big
plays, and we were able to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The comeback began when Vaughn Hebron returned a kickoff 42
yards to Denver's 46. Before Elway trotted onto the field with 8:13
left, offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak told him, ``Boy, we haven't
been in one of these in a while, have we? Go get them.''
</P>
<P>
   On third-and-seven, Elway threw over the middle for wide
receiver Willie Green, who broke away from cornerback Dale Carter
for a 50-yard gain to the one. On the next play, Davis scored his
third touchdown. Jason Elam's extra point pulled the Broncos to
within 31-28 with 6:48 left.
</P>
<P>
   After the Chiefs went three-and-out on their next possession,
Darrien Gordon returned the punt 14 yards to midfield. Elway had
6:13 left.
</P>
<P>
   Davis carried for five yards and turned a short pass into a
12-yard gain for a first down at Kansas City's 33. Davis then
carried twice for nine yards. On third-and-one, Shanahan called a
timeout when he saw what kind of defense the Chiefs were using.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went into a short-yardage defense,'' Shanahan said.
``With third-and-inches, I thought we'd take a shot at the big
play, and if we didn't make it, we'd go for it on fourth down. If
we didn't make it on fourth-and-inches, we wouldn't have deserved
to win anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe, who had been double-covered and shut out at that point,
got single coverage when the Chiefs blitzed the run. But Elway
faked to Davis and, with defensive tackle Chester McGlockton
closing in, threw a perfect pass to Sharpe, who beat strong safety
Reggie Tongue for the touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs got the ball back at their 30 with 3:34 left. With
help from a 23-yard interference penalty on linebacker John Mobley,
Kansas City got a first down at the Denver 36.
</P>
<P>
   After Gannon threw three incompletions, the Broncos blitzed him
on fourth down. Safety Steve Atwater had a clear path to Gannon.
When Atwater leaped into the air, Gannon held the ball, and he was
sacked by defensive end Alfred Williams to seal the victory before
74,962.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not for Steve, I don't think I could have made that play,''
Williams said. ``If Steve hadn't jumped, I don't think I could have
gotten to him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Williams did get to Gannon, allowing the Broncos to win
their 16th consecutive home game, and their 23rd straight at home
in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when two streaks came to an end _ Davis had touched the
ball 836 times in the regular season before losing his
third-quarter fumble, and Jason Elam had a field goal blocked after
making 19 of 19 this season _ the Broncos had reason to be nervous.
</P>
<P>
   In their first 12 games, the Broncos allowed only 23 points in
the first quarter. They allowed 21 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon threw touchdown passes of 26 yards to Andre Rison and 11
to Kimble Anders, and Bam Morris scored on a one-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' one-yard touchdown and Elway's 13-yard pass to Ed
McCaffrey tied it 21-21 in the second quarter. Cornerback Mark
McMillian intercepted Elway in the end zone before the first half
ended.
</P>
<P>
   After Davis fumbled in the end zone in the third quarter,
Gannon's 26-yard touchdown pass to Joe Horn gave Kansas City a
28-21 lead. Pete Stoyanovich's 20-yard field goal made it 31-21.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time John has the ball in his hands, we have a chance to
win,'' said Broncos receiver Rod Smith, who had eight catches for
165 yards. ``When John got the ball on those last two touchdown
drives, he told us we were going to win, and we believed him.''

OFFENSE SLOWS TO A DRIZZLE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - After spending five days in balmy Tucson, the New
York Giants ventured into the great white north Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors not only had to contend with the Cardinals, who are
trying to make the playoffs, but also the raw elements for which
the Giants appeared unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the poor New Yorkers _ they simply aren't accustomed
to our bitter winters _ huddled in blue parkas, wet and shivering,
their breath forming vapory plumes, the Cardinals took pity on the
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   How else can you explain what the offense did?
</P>
<P>
   Or didn't do.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, the Cardinals had first and goal at the
Giants' 1-yard line and didn't score.
</P>
<P>
   With two minutes left and needing a touchdown and extra point to
win, the Cardinals lined up at the New York 7. Second and 4.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't score _ again.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Plummer threw two interceptions and had the ball stripped
from his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see, oh yes, Jake's best play, a 30-yard keeper to the
Giants' 3, was nullified by an offside penalty.
</P>
<P>
   After leading, 17-7, the Cards scored only two points in the
second half _ actually the Giants scored for them, on an
intentional safety.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Redbirds (6-7) lost for the second week in a
row. After the 23-19 defeat, several players dutifully recited the
company line, the one about controlling their own destiny. The
locker room message sounded every bit as positive as the bright
little sayings hidden inside Peking Noodle Co. fortune cookies
served in the Sun Devil Stadium press box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your Luck Will Soon Be A High Point.''
</P>
<P>
   What luck?
</P>
<P>
   ``All Your Hard Work Will Soon Pay Off.''
</P>
<P>
   But will it?
</P>
<P>
   This is a young group unaccustomed to playing meaningful games
in December. The pressure is on. You wonder what this team is
``really'' thinking now.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals probably must win their last three games to make
the playoffs. But the defense is badly hobbled, and what are we to
make of an offense that stubbornly refused to open the door when
opportunity knocked?
</P>
<P>
   This game turned early in the second quarter after Plummer took
the offense to the Giants' 4 and the Cardinals settled for a field
goal.
</P>
<P>
   How confident is this team?
</P>
<P>
   Lomas Brown gave a quick glance around the inner sanctum of the
locker room and shook his head. ``Worried? Yes I'm worried,'' said
the 14-year veteran, who is unafraid to speak his mind. ``We need
to do some soul-searching. I don't know where everybody's mind is
at. But if we don't play better, we'll be watching the playoffs on
TV. We'll be saying `That could have been us. That should have been
us.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals saw more than their own breath Sunday. They saw
harsh reality. The offense remains a weekly question mark. As for
the battered defense . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't talk now,'' Andre Wadsworth said softly, asking
reporters for space with downcast eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive line can't afford to lose any more players. But
now Wadsworth is hurting. The rookie, who suffered a calf bruise,
pulled himself up from a stool and limped toward the training room.
He could barely walk.
</P>
<P>
   If every NFL club could play the Cardinals as well as the Giants
do, you could forget the playoffs right now. Jim Fassel is 4-0
against the team he once served as offensive coordinator. The
weather was different Sunday, but the result was the same.
Predictably, the Giants lined up in the second half and ran the
ball, exploiting the Cards' thinning defense.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Cards could have won. They ``would'' have won if the
offense hadn't come down with a bad case of bronchitis near the
goal line, coughing and sputtering to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   What does the future hold?
</P>
<P>
   I opened a cookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take That Chance You've Been Considering.''
</P>
<P>
   Run the reverse against the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   I opened another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your Winsome Smile Will Be Your Protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Right. That and some better blocking. &QL;

FASSEL-JINXED CARDS FADE TO BLACK, BLUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Jim Fassel, upon awakening Sunday, must have
taken a look outside and broken into a wide grin.
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't even need his perceived magic this time. Fassel's
New York Giants had been given a Meadowlands kind of day in the
middle of the desert: A 41-degree, breezy, drizzly afternoon. Just
right, Fassel knew, for pounding the ball at a battered opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Three times since he left as Cardinals offensive coordinator
last year, Fassel and his Giants had manhandled the Cardinals.
Sunday's 23-19 pounding extended the reign of terror.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals had talked about the mastery, how this was the
kind of thing a playoff-caliber team does something about. Yet the
Giants ran for an even 200 yards, 118 of them in the second half
after overcoming a 10-point deficit and entering into a game of
keep-away. The Cardinals' defense, fresh off offering non-stop
service to Washington and Kansas City, couldn't stop Gary Brown
(124 yards, 5.0-yard average) or Charles Way (60 yards, 4.6
average).
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' offense, which led the NFL in red-zone scoring,
produced three points on three trips inside the Giants' 10-yard
line.
</P>
<P>
   It was a battle that left the Cardinals with as many emotional
scars as physical, a thrashing that left them drained and angry.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the reality of it is that it took them out of nothing _
except, perhaps, the services of several defensive starters.
</P>
<P>
   Even at 6-7, the Cardinals remain in the driver's seat for the
final NFC wild-card playoff berth. They visit Philadelphia on
Sunday, then come home to finish the season against New Orleans and
San Diego. If they win all three, they are in. If they win even two
of the three, as long as one of them is New Orleans, they're likely
in.
</P>
<P>
   That was of little consolation after being shredded in another
Fassel Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't control our destiny the way we played,'' Cardinals
offensive tackle Lomas Brown said. ``To me, it doesn't make sense
to say we control our destiny if that's the best we're going to
play. That team sure does have a stranglehold on us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' defense already was nicked. Defensive tackle Eric
Swann is scheduled to have his seventh knee operation today. Middle
linebacker Ron McKinnon is probably out again this week because of
a strained knee. Cornerback Tom Knight has another strained
hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   They were joined on the injury list by end Simeon Rice (bruised
ribs), who is out three to five days; tackle Mark Smith (sprained
ankle), out of the Philadelphia game; and end Andre Wadsworth (calf
bruise), out four or five days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they would try to pound us,'' Cardinals linebacker
Jamir Miller said. ``When it's rainy, wet and slippery, that helps
a team run the ball. Getting guys hurt didn't help us. Teams attack
your weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter who suits up defensively next Sunday, the Eagles
seemingly are a group that Jake Plummer could outscore _ if only
Plummer doesn't play as he did against the Giants with three killer
turnovers. During one stretch, he threw 11 successive passes that
were not caught by a Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   That was after Plummer drove the Cardinals to a 17-7 lead with
scores on three consecutive first-half possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Then, 21 seconds before halftime, Plummer served up an
interception that the Giants (5-8) converted into a field goal _
crucial points that later allowed the Giants to take a safety
rather than risk a blocked punt deep in their territory.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, Plummer dropped back to pass and had the
ball stripped by reserve defensive end Cedric Jones. That led to a
touchdown that put the Giants ahead, 20-17.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after the Cardinals turned a first and goal at the 1 into
third and goal at the 4, Plummer was intercepted in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   In a game he needed to take over, Plummer completed 18 of 40
passes for 263 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take a lot of the blame for this loss,'' Plummer said. ``If
we control the ball, we win. I gave them an early Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer seemed to atone when he ran 30 yards to the Giants' 3
with 5:18 to go and the Cardinals seven points from regaining the
lead. But the gain was called back because wide receiver Ronnie
Anderson was ruled offside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronnie said he asked the official before the snap to give him
a thumbs up or thumbs down on where he was lined up, and he didn't
give him anything,'' Plummer said. ``That's the ref's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very odd, but it's the Cardinals. Oddities are part of
our game, I guess.'' &QL;

AFTER BUILDING LEAD, COYOTES HAVE TO SETTLE FOR A TIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ The Coyotes have been talking
lately about how badly they need to learn how to put teams away.
Jump on them early, smell the blood, and then go for the kill.
</P>
<P>
   They've been finding ways to win without doing that, as their
franchise-record start has shown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' center Jeremy Roenick said, ``but we'd find it a lot
easier if was 6-0 or 6-1 at the end of two (periods). We can't
afford to keep making it close.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's exactly what happened Sunday night against the
Vancouver Canucks, who have been without three of their best
players, including All-Star holdout Pavel Bure. It was so close,
that it ended in a 3-3 tie before 14,490 at General Motors Place.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Chris McAllister scored his first NHL goal with 11:07
left in regulation to force the overtime after the Coyotes had
taken a 3-2 lead in the second period on the second of Roenick's
two goals, his seventh and eighth of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes (15-3-3), who outshot the Canucks, 46-24, had a
golden opportunity to ice it in the final minute of regulation but
they couldn't score on a power play awarded at the 19:04 mark when
Brad May was called for holding.
</P>
<P>
   Canucks goalie Garth Snow stopped 43 shots in a show-stopping
performance, while Coyotes goalie Jimmy Waite remained undefeated
with a 5-0-2 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is, but a lot of times it's like we play
down the team's level we're playing,'' Roenick said. ``It's very
upsetting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes were seething with 7:25 left in the first period
after Markus Naslund had given the Canucks a 2-1 lead with his 13th
goal, his sixth in seven games and his fourth in the past two.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes thought they had tied it when, in a reversal of
recent trends regarding deflections in traffic, Keith Tkachuk sent
a hard slapshot through a crowd and Teppo Numminen tipped it in.
Referee Paul Devorski, however, thought Numminen was in the crease
and he went upstairs to video replay judge Malcom Ashford.
</P>
<P>
   Replays shown to the fans appeared inconclusive at best, but the
goal, which actually looked to go in off the skate of Vancouver's
Bill Muckalt, was disallowed.
</P>
<P>
   `My take on that is that our player was pushed into the
crease,'' Schoenfeld said. ``When I look at it again (on videotape)
I will maintain that same opion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say it was a wild one tonight, but Vancouver
dominated us for the first seven minutes or so until we got our
game . . . but both team should be happy with getting the point.
We'll settle for .500 (1-1-1) on this trip and go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the Coyotes' fortunes started to turn shortly after
the controversial ruling. Up to that point, the Canucks clearly had
dominated the game. Phoenix scored first on a deflection by Dallas
Drake on a Numminen shot at 5:16, but that was the only shot the
Coyotes could muster against Snow in the first 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   `It's the same old story,'' Numminen said. ` It took us 10
minutes tonight before we got our legs going.''
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver, meanwhile, blistered Waite with all kinds of heat.
Bruiser Donald Brashear made it pay off first, reaching deep to put
back a rebound with a backhander 23 seconds after Drake's fifth
goal. With Roenick in the box for roughing, Naslund made it 2-1 on
the power play at 9:41.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing, 10-2, in shots, the Coyotes went on the attack with
the aid of three power plays. They wound tying it on a
man-advantage goal by Roenick with 21 seconds left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk, who set up Roenick's first goal, set up his second as
well early in the second as Phoenix retook the lead, 3-2. Roenick
held the puck patiently along the boards before stepping up into
the left faceoff circle and drilling a slap shot that Snow couldn't
handle.
</P>
<P>
   The second period was painful for the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Center Juhe Ylonen got hit in the face with a puck, but returned
after receiving 10 stitches in the cheek. Roenick dove to block a
slap shot from Adrian Aucoin and the blast nailed his right foot.
After several tense moments lying on the ice and then leaving the
bench for treatment, he also returned.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes got a legitimate scare late in regulation, though,
when defenseman Gerald Diduck was checked hard into the back boards
behind the Phoenix net. It appeared as though he took most of the
impact with his head, and he left the game for observation. The
team said he suffered a bruised thigh. &QL;

POPOV IS ONLY FOE HALL CARES ABOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - In a swift turnaround,  &UR; Gary Hall Jr. is on a roll. He
beat swimming's international governing body, FINA, in a Phoenix
court last week. Two days later, he beat one of the year's fastest
fields in the pool at the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   He's been beating everybody but  &UR; Alexander Popov.
</P>
<P>
   It's Popov, the angry Russian, who still stands between Hall and
vindication. Blame Hall for that.
</P>
<P>
   The off-beat, entertaining Hall has set himself up for an
inevitable confrontation that promises to define him. It figures to
come at the 2000 Olympics. For Hall, there will be victories along
the way. But, somehow, they'll loom as a prelude to the Sydney
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Fair or not, Hall's battles with coaches about his work ethic
and his fight with FINA over an off-and-on suspension for a
positive marijuana test created enemies. Popov is one of them.
There's also a perception that Hall is a rebel without a coach or a
clue.
</P>
<P>
   He's an intriguing athlete, who is saddled with a public
portrayal that often misses the mark. In front of the cameras, he
becomes a showoff who angers some people. It's an act. Nonetheless,
it has contributed, indeed confirmed, his decision to go it alone.
</P>
<P>
   Six months of trouble, lousy publicity and lost endorsements
seem to have toughened him. He says he's motivated by anger.
</P>
<P>
   Adversity might prove to be an ally, one of his few friends.
Above all, it seems to be forcing maturity onto a 24-year-old
Phoenix sprinter who two years ago was seen as a goofy kid with
four Olympic medals.
</P>
<P>
   Only an adult will beat the tough-minded Popov, who won two gold
medals in closely contested races with Hall in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: There will be more adversity.
</P>
<P>
   Hall has appealed the methods of FINA's testing and suspension
to the Swiss-based international Court of Arbitration for Sport,
which is expected to hear his case within four months.
</P>
<P>
   A restraining order that expires this week allowed him to
compete last week. He still has 12 days to serve of a suspension
that was imposed on June 15, lifted for weeks and reimposed.
</P>
<P>
   There are questions about how FINA will apply the remainder.
Will it suspend him for his next competition? Or will it let the
suspension expire out of competition? The issue probably could pass
quietly. But Hall won't let it, which only ensures further trouble
from FINA.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. Swimming will give Hall a chance to make the
team for the Pan-Pacific Games in Sydney, a key Olympic
steppingstone in August. He was unable to compete for a spot last
summer because of his suspension. If he's fast enough at the next
U.S. Nationals, he'll be added. But somebody figures to lose a spot
if Hall is as fast as expected en route to the only confrontation
that matters:
</P>
<P>
   Popov. &QL; 
Briefly. . .  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More Popov: Hall's father, three-time Olympian  &UR; Gary Hall Sr.,
said he's still trying to put together a match race between his son
and the Russian at Phoenix Swim Club. But Popov wants at least
$50,000. He trains in Australia at the Aussies' expense, $250,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   USA Boxing sought and got support from Pakistan's  &UR; Anwar
 &UR; Chowdry, chief of the International Amateur Federation, for a
political post won by an American. It was Chowdry who loudly
defended the judges who robbed
 &UR; Roy Jones Jr. of a gold medal in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Bugs and drugs: A bug patrol at the Asian Games in Hong Kong is
busy keeping insects out of the pool. Dead bugs have littered the
surface. Wasn't the ingestion of bugs supposed to be a herbal
secret to China's success in running and swimming? Maybe the patrol
also is collecting the performance-enhancing species. &QL;

ANGER REMAINS TOWARD REFEREES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ They sneaked out of town with a
precious two points, but the Coyotes were still livid at the way
Saturday night's 3-2 victory in Calgary went down. The target of
their ire: referees  &UR; Mark Faucette and  &UR; Dave Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Neither called a penalty on  &UR; Jason Wiemer after the Canucks
center flew through the crease and knocked Coyotes goalie  &UR; Nikolai
Khabibulin to the ice. Calgary's  &UR; Jarome Iginla scored on the play
to pull within a goal with three minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a B.S. goal,'' complained Khabibulin, who was elbowed
by Wiemer and lost his balance. ``Referees should be more watchful
for that kind of thing. It should have been a penalty, and they
could have called just about anything on that play, from roughing,
to goalie interference, to elbowing. Why they decided to call
nothing, I have no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes defenseman  &UR; Keith Carney, who helped bail out the team
down the stretch with numerous defensive stops, has his own theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the refs wanted to make it interesting, who knows?''
Carney said. ``All I know is that was goaltender interference.
They're supposed to be trying to protect the goalies, so why let
someone take a run at him?'' &QL; 
Adams A-OK &QL; 
After going the first 14 games of the season without a goal,
veteran left wing  &UR; Greg Adams, a free-agent pickup from the Dallas
Stars, was starting to worry about his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come to a new team, it's hard to know what to expect
or what they expect from you,'' Adams said. ``But obviously, I've
scored goals in the past and I expected to contribute in that area
and also be reliable at the other end of the ice, too. I thought I
was playing well, but nothing was going in for me.''
</P>
<P>
   They have been lately. Pulling into Vancouver, where he spent
eight seasons, Adams had scored five goals in his past six games.
Almost every one of them has come at key moments, which has made
ending the slump even more enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question,'' he said. ``I was getting lots of chances
earlier, but I didn't feel I was contributing in the way I was
supposed to. The team was still winning, but you want to
contribute. You want to be part of the team, especially being a new
figure on the team.'' &QL; 
Winning the draw &QL; 
Since being moved to center on an almost exclusive basis,
second-year pro &UR; Juha Ylonen is taking faceoffs for the first time.
And lately, he has been racking up the wins. Saturday night in
Calgary, he took 19 draws and won 13 of them (68 percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``Some games, that's the way it goes,'' the 26-year-old from
Helsinki, Finland, said. ``You win everything. Another game comes
along and you can't win anything. But this has been fun. It don't
think I really took any faceoffs last year.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is he implying? That Coach  &UR; Jim Schoenfeld made a
mistake by not using him in the circle earlier?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, maybe,'' Ylonen said with a laugh. &QL;

   PHOENIX - As Texas A&AMP;M scored its game-winning touchdown
Saturday, Bobby Bowden turned to his wife, Ann, and said, ``Gee
whiz, we're going to Phoenix.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said it with a smile, because the Valley has been
particularly kind to the Florida State coach. He is 4-0 in trips to
Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it. I love it. I can't wait to get there,'' he said
Sunday after the Bowl Championship Series standings were announced.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 2 Seminoles will face No. 1 Tennessee in the Fiesta Bowl
on Jan. 4 at Sun Devil Stadium to determine the national champion.
</P>
<P>
   Both coaches sounded relieved a day after a wild Saturday of
upsets. Florida State (11-1), in fourth place last week, jumped
ahead of UCLA and Kansas State, which both lost.
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers (12-0) secured their trip with a 24-14 victory
over Mississippi State on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee Coach Phillip Fulmer doesn't believe the game loses
any luster just because Florida State comes in with a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not disappointed,'' he said. ``I've always been a great
admirer of Coach Bowden and their program and what they've done. .
. . Florida State is about as good a team over a long period of
time as there has been in college football. And we're honored to
have the opportunity to play them.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the success, both teams have encountered adversity along
the way.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles lost the second game of the season to North
Carolina State, 24-7. Eight games later, they lost their starting
quarterback, Chris Weinke, to neck surgery. He is sidelined until
the spring.
</P>
<P>
   His replacement, Marcus Outzen, will start against Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``After our loss, we just tried to get back on the winning track
to try and win a conference championship and be available for an
Alliance Bowl,'' Bowden said. ``But the closer we got to (the end
of the season), our thinking was, `Men, we may not get into that
championship game, the odds are not good, but the worst thing we
could do is not be available if it does come open.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles kept themselves in position by winning their
regular-season finale against Florida, 23-12, on Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers' toughest meeting was a 20-17 overtime victory
over Florida in the second game of the season. They also struggled
to beat Arkansas late in the season but managed to avoid the upset
that plagued Fiesta contenders Kansas State, UCLA and Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee will come to Tempe without offensive coordinator David
Cutcliffe, who accepted the head-coaching job at Mississippi last
week. Running backs coach Randy Sanders will fill in through the
title game, Fulmer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will be a distraction,'' he said. ``We were
hoping (Mississippi) could wait, but they didn't think they could
afford to do that, and David didn't want to jeopardize his job in
any way. We understand that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just looking forward to coming to Tempe. We know it's a
great time for all concerned because it's such a beautiful area.''
</P>
<P>
   He can't love it as much as Bowden. He's won two Fiesta Bowls
here, beating Nebraska in 1988 and 1990. He's also defeated Arizona
State twice in the regular season in Tempe, 29-26 in 1983 and 52-44
in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bowden felt good about his team's chance of playing in
the Fiesta Bowl after watching Kansas State lose, he started
second-guessing himself Sunday morning after reading the
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were saying there was a chance UCLA or Ohio State might
go,'' Bowden said. ``Then I started wondering, `Gee, what if we
don't make it?' Five minutes before the bowl show on TV, I asked
someone, `Hey did we make it?' He said, `Yeah, y'all made it.'
That's how I knew.'' &QL;

SHOT AT HUSKERS IS UA'S CONSOLATION

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona's disappointment at missing out on a Rose Bowl berth was
tempered Sunday by the prospect of playing traditional power
Nebraska in the Dec. 30 Holiday Bowl in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, all our fans, players and staff are very
disappointed that we didn't get to go to the Rose Bowl because we
felt we were very deserving,'' Arizona Coach Dick Tomey said. ``But
we understood that we didn't control our own destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want the best things to happen to us, we have to control
our own destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's hopes for its first Rose Bowl trip came apart with
UCLA's 49-45 loss on Saturday to Miami. That knocked the Bruins out
of the Fiesta Bowl and into the Rose as Pac-10 champions. The
championship was won by virtue of a 52-28 victory over UA on Oct.
10.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise Sunday was that the Holiday picked Nebraska
as UA's opponent instead of Kansas State, which lost to Texas A&AMP;M
on Saturday and fell from contention for a shot at the national
title in the Fiesta Bowl all the way to San Antonio's Alamo Bowl
against unranked Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   If the Holiday had selected once-beaten Kansas State, the bowl
would match the two highest-ranked teams not invited to a BCS game.
Kansas State is No. 3 in the BCS rankings and No. 4 in the
Associated Press poll. Arizona is No. 7 in the BCS and No. 5 in the
AP poll. Nebraska is 11th in the BCS rankings and No. 14 in the AP
poll.
</P>
<P>
   The bowl selections apparently outraged Kansas State. The school
canceled a scheduled news conference and said Coach Bill Snyder
would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, Kansas State experienced the biggest drop,'' Tomey
said. ``I really sympathize with Bill Snyder and his team.''
</P>
<P>
   Potential ticket sales were a key factor in the Holiday
decision. According to bowl President Weldon Donaldson, 10,000
tickets were sold in the two weeks since Nebraska was mentioned as
a likely team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the best match-up in our history,'' said
Donaldson of a game that is already assured of a record crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Bowl officials said they are within 4,000 tickets of a sellout
at 70,500-seat Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Kansas State, Arizona's prospects were somewhat
predictable, despite speculative reports about interest from the
Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ended up where we knew we'd wind up if UCLA didn't win,''
said Tomey, who went on to express enthusiasm for the chance to
play the Cornhuskers, who shared last year's national title but
slipped to a disappointing 9-3 record this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get a chance to test ourselves against one of the most
prominent programs in the nation,'' Tomey said.
</P>
<P>
   Tomey said he spoke with many of his players after UCLA's loss
Saturday. He said it was tough for them to suddenly have a Rose
Bowl chance snatched away.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Keith Smith was with teammates at offensive lineman
Yusuf Scott's house to watch the UCLA game. Their reactions were
shown live by ESPN during the UCLA telecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was bad, man,'' Smith said. ``I felt like they were doing
it on purpose just to keep us out of the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to go to the Rose Bowl, but you can't let it
get you down because we still had a great season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we're 9-3 or something. We're 11-1, and we're
ranked pretty high. We were hoping we would get into one of those
BCS bowls.'' &QL;

<P>
   Arizona associate head coach  &UR; Duane Akina is one of six
finalists for the vacant Hawaii job.
</P>
<P>
   Akina, who coaches Arizona's defensive backs, grew up in Hawaii
and was a high school legend in Honolulu before he went to
Washington as a backup to quarterback  &UR; Warren Moon.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii's leading candidate is reported to be  &UR; June Jones, the
interim head coach for the San Diego Chargers. The school might
delay a decision until seeing whether Jones gets the Chargers job
permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii's other candidates are Utah Coach  &UR; Ron McBride, Southern
California defensive coordinator  &UR; Bill Young, NFL coaches executive
director  &UR; Larry
 &UR; Kennan, Navy assistant and former Honolulu prep star  &UR; Kenny
Niumatalolo and
 &UR; Cal Lee, coach of the Honolulu powerhouse St. Louis High. &QL; 
The winners &QL; 
Cornerback  &UR; Chris McAlister was honored Sunday night as Most
Valuable Player at the team's awards banquet.
</P>
<P>
   Wildcat of the Year honors went to receiver  &UR; Jeremy McDaniel and
linebacker
 &UR; Marcus Bell. Defensive lineman  &UR; Eli Wnek, a redshirt freshman from
Glendale, and senior wide receiver  &UR; Chris Forwood shared academic
awards for maintaining the team's best grade-point averages. &QL; 
Bowl bound &QL;
</P>
<P>

IT'S DOWN TO 3 GAME SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin simplified the NFL's
complicated playoff system for his confused team.
</P>
<P>
   He told his players after Sunday's 23-19 loss to the New York
Giants that if they win their final three games, they will get an
NFC wild-card playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically a three-game season,'' wide receiver Rob Moore
said. ``Nothing else matters. We need to win all three games. Going
9-7 will get us in.''
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't have been this hard.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals were in great shape two games ago when they won at
Washington to improve their record to 6-5. But they lost at Kansas
City, 34-24, eight days ago and blew a 17-7 lead Sunday to fall to
6-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one hurts because we really needed this game,'' offensive
tackle Lomas Brown said. ``For us to lose this game (at home) is
inexcusable. . . . For us to have so much at stake at this point of
the season, and to go out and play the way we did, is
discouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   The only points the Cardinals scored in the second half came in
the final 20 seconds when the Giants took an intentional safety.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, they allowed the Giants to rush for 118 yards in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we are looking behind to make sure that no one is going
to catch us in the playoff race,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals don't have to look far to find the New Orleans
Saints, who also are 6-7 after upsetting the Dallas Cowboys, 22-3,
on Sunday at the New Orleans Superdome.
</P>
<P>
   If the season were to end today, the Cardinals would be in the
playoffs over the Saints because of a better record in NFC games _
6-4 to New Orleans' 5-5. But the two teams play at Sun Devil
Stadium on Dec. 20, and the first tiebreaker is head-to-head
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints have a much tougher remaining schedule. They play
host to NFC West rival Atlanta (11-2) next week and finish the
season at home against Buffalo (8-5). Their remaining opponents are
a combined 25-14.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' remaining foes are just the opposite, 14-25. They
return to action next week at Philadelphia (3-10) and finish at
home against San Diego (5-8).
</P>
<P>
   Others still in the picture for the third wild-card spot are
Tampa, 5-7 going into tonight's game against Green Bay; and Detroit
and the Giants, both of whom are 5-8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can look at it as a three-game season,''
tight end Chris Gedney said. ``We should start with the Eagles and
consider that a one-game season. If we win, we have another
one-game season the next week.''
</P>
<P>
   It's possible the Cardinals could win just two of their final
three games and make the playoffs, but they aren't even considering
the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a silver lining in that we still control our own
destiny,'' defensive back J.J. McCleskey said. ``But there has been
a silver lining the last two weeks, and we've not done anything to
help ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you want to barely make the playoffs when you can do
something and really earn your way in?''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Jamir Miller said the players have to ``look inside
themselves'' if they want to become the first Cardinals team since
1982 to make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a chance to do something special,'' Miller said.
``Do we want to fight, or do we want to lay down?''

INJURIES TAKE TOLL ON CARDS' DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. -  &UR; Rashod Swinger was the only member of the
Cardinals' starting defensive line still standing at the end of
Sunday's 23-19 loss to the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle  &UR; Mark Smith was out because of a severely
sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive ends  &UR; Simeon Rice (bruised ribs) and  &UR; Andre Wadsworth
(right calf contusion) joined Smith on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were at the point of having to put (linebacker)  &UR; Patrick
Sapp in at defensive end in our standard defense,'' defensive
coordinator  &UR; Dave McGinnis said.
</P>
<P>
   Sapp already was in the lineup because of outside
linebacker &UR; Tony McCombs' sore toe.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals dressed only six defensive linemen and entered the
game without three other defensive starters _ tackle  &UR; Eric Swann
(knee), middle linebacker  &UR; Ronald McKinnon (knee) and cornerback
 &UR; Tommy Knight (hamstring).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a battered and bruised defensive football team,'' Coach
 &UR; Vince Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is the most serious of the newly injured. He will be out
seven to 10 days, meaning he is expected to miss next Sunday's game
at Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth, the team's first-round draft choice, also could be
out for that game. He is expected to miss four to five days of
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Rice will be out three to five days.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, rookie running back  &UR; Michael Pittman suffered a
fractured hand that likely will end his season. He will be
re-evaluated today. &QL; 
Move backfires
</P>
<P>
   If the Cardinals had played conservatively and ended the half by
running the ball, they would have taken a 17-7 lead into
intermission.
</P>
<P>
   But after  &UR; Adrian Murrell's 28-yard run gave them a first down
on the Cardinals' 33 with 34 seconds left, they tried to score more
points, and it backfired.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback  &UR; Jake Plummer was intercepted by rookie safety
 &UR; Sherman Williams at the Giants' 49, setting up  &UR; Brad Daluiso's
51-yard field goal on the final play of the first half, cutting the
lead to 17-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interception down there was huge,'' Giants Coach  &UR; Jim
Fassel said. ``It could have made the difference coming down to the
wire. We might not have been able to take the safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants took an intentional safety with 17 seconds left to
keep the Cardinals from getting good field position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have been punting that ball in a different
situation,'' Fassel said. ``I wouldn't have been able to (take the
safety) if it's a three-point ball game at that time.'' &QL; 
Streak continues
</P>
<P>
   Fassel, the ex-Cardinals offensive coordinator, extended his
record to 4-0 against his former boss, Tobin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I knew what it was, I'd like to put it in a bottle and
carry it with me next week,'' he said of his success against the
Cardinals. &QL; 
Short shots
</P>
<P>
   The 41 degrees at kickoff was the coldest ever for a Cardinals
game at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie cornerback &UR; Corey Chavous has interceptions in each of his
first two starts.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer missed 11 consecutive throws during a stretch in the
second and third quarters. &QL;

GRAHAM'S SILENT REVENGE: GIANTS' RUNNING GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Kent Graham was too busy playing football Sunday
to get a glimpse of the derisive banner a couple of Cardinals fans
were parading around Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Graham, you still suck,'' it read.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't miss the same message when it was profanely
delivered by some vocal Cardinals supporters who waited for Graham
at the tunnel leaving the field.
</P>
<P>
   Graham just grinned as he trotted up the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? His New York Giants had just beaten the Cardinals,
23-19, damaging Arizona's chances for a wild-card playoff berth.
And inside, at least, he had to be chuckling at the knuckleheads
who cheered the last time he played at Sun Devil Stadium _ in a
Cardinals uniform _ when he went down because of an injury.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Graham didn't so much beat the Cardinals as not beat
the Giants. He completed only 8 of 23 passes for 144 yards and a
touchdown. He was intercepted twice, and 87 of his passing yards
came on a single play, in which Graham simply tossed a screen pass
to Tiki Barber. The Cardinals were caught in a blitz, and Barber
went the distance.
</P>
<P>
   It was New York's running game, which methodically pummeled the
Cardinals' injury-decimated defense for 200 yards, that beat
Arizona on a cold, wet, New Jersey-gray day. Tailback Gary Brown
ran for 124 yards on 25 carries. Bullish fullback Charles Way
carried 13 times _ usually with a couple of Cardinals aboard _ for
60 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   So dominating was New York's running game that the Giants,
facing a first and 20 after a penalty, rushed three consecutive
times and got the first down during a fourth-quarter drive that led
to Brad Daluiso's 45-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Graham admitted it was a satisfying day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big time,'' he said. ``As far as coming back and winning a
year later, it's a great feeling. Especially the way we did it. It
was a tough game, a real tough game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being as wet as it was, it was tough to throw. But we still
came through with a win and hung in and fought, even when we were
down early.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham very nearly blew it when he tried to force a pass over
Arizona's J.J. McCleskey, who intercepted at the Giants' 40 with
7:33 to play. But New York's defense held on fourth and 3 from the
6 with 1:54 remaining to preserve it.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why Giants Coach Jim Fassel didn't immediately
endorse Graham as next week's starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kent wanted to play real well,'' Fassel said. ``I know
it was important to him. I think he probably tried to make some
plays, and early on, it was wet and sloppy. Things weren't
clicking, so I tried to get into the run game.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a nice way of saying Graham didn't screw it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a good job of moving the ball and keeping it away from
their offense,'' Graham said. ``That was kind of the strategy going
into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Graham wanted to say anything to those fans who ripped
him, he resisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say anything, because we're just happy to come
away with a win,'' he said. ``It was a bit ironic. I try not to
worry about the fans out there who weren't in support of me. I
expected that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt bad for the Cardinals in a sense _ for Jake (Plummer).
I know what it's like to throw for a lot of yards and then you lose
the game. I'm happy to be on the other side of it.'' &QL;

GIANTS ADD INSULT TO CARDS' INJURIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Sure, they control their own destiny. But who are
``the''y? Who will be left now that Mark Smith is on crutches,
Andre Wadsworth has a problem with his right calf and Simeon Rice
can't find the strength to blow his nose?
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the boys from New York have sucker-punched the
optimism. Knocked the wind out of the Cardinals, and maybe for
good.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, the Cardinals are crying foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were cheap shots on me all game,'' Jamir Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the way they play, man,'' Smith said. ``They've
been doing that the last couple of years we've been playing them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the warrior's code of professional football, there is nothing
so repulsive, nothing so damning.
</P>
<P>
   In the infirmary that served as a locker room, the Cardinals
were sickened by the loss, infuriated by the losses. Smith will be
out seven to 10 days. Rice and Wadsworth are questionable and could
miss a must-win game against the Saints two weeks down the road.
</P>
<P>
   The damage was severe, just like the accusations. That the
Giants played nasty and the Giants played dirty, a team that may
have prevailed in the murky shadows of fair play.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the matter is Giants tackle Roman Oben. In the
third quarter, Smith engaged with the Giants' Greg Bishop. The two
formed a human teepee, and in the space between their legs, Oben
saw an opportunity. He dived at Smith's legs, and 10 minutes later,
Smith left on a cart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had broken it,'' Smith said of his sprained ankle.
``I felt it crack. I heard it crack when I went down. But the
X-rays didn't show it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless there are further complications, Smith was lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see the cart, you think something is broken,''
personnel boss Bob Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Oben claimed that Smith wasn't engaged on the play. And
maybe in the letter of the law, Oben's block was technically legal.
But it was definitely cheap. And ethically wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't right to go after a guy deliberately like that,''
Miller said. ``That's flagrant. I was telling them that all day
long. And when Mark went down, I told them that they were
bleep-bleep-bleep. Bad words, bad words, bad words.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Giants' locker room, Oben was asked about his motive,
one that seemed highly questionable on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were they showing it a lot?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he was told.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it a slip block,'' Oben said. ``I was supposed to roll
and cut him. I guess his foot got caught in the turf. I was on the
field talking to him. It wasn't intentional.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what Oben had to say, Smith glared ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't say (expletive),'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Cardinals, it wasn't an isolated incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw (Giants center) Lance Scott throw a cheap shot early in
the game on Andre Wadsworth,'' said one Cardinal executive. ``And I
mean cheap. C-H-E-A-P. I just talked to Andre, and he agreed.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL police would be wise to examine this film. If the
Cardinals are right, they need to penalize the suspects. If the
Cardinals are wrong, they need to clear the air. Before this feud
gets out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there is no love lost between these two football
teams,'' cornerback Corey Chavous said. ``So whatever happened, I'm
not surprised. What we have to do is respond. Chop them back.
That's the key.''
</P>
<P>
   As night fell on a gruesome afternoon, Smith hobbled out of the
locker room, unable to put pressure on one foot. Rice grunted and
groaned, straining to breathe through bruised ribs. Wadsworth had
limped off the field and was holed up in the training room.
</P>
<P>
   And you had to wonder: Has the sun finally set on a once
promising season?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not slipping away, we can't even think that way,'' Miller
said. ``If we win out, then we get the spot. But that's the thing.
We have to win out. We can't have any more slips.''
</P>
<P>
   Right. With a potential front line of Cousins, Simpson, Swinger
and Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a battered and bruised defensive football team,'' Coach
Vince Tobin said. ``No question about that.'' &QL;

VAN IMPE ON A POWER PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He is not as flashy as Sergei Samsonov, not as highly
touted as Joe Thornton, and not as big as Hal Gill. But 25-year-old
Darren Van Impe has carved out a niche for himself and become a
valuable member of the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   The young defenseman arrived in Boston a year ago, Nov. 26,
claimed on waivers from Anaheim. Originally earmarked for
Providence, Van Impe got a long, hard look look from Bruins coach
Pat Burns and assistants Jacques Laperriere and Bob Francis, and
wound up sticking. Although he had been evaluated by the Ducks as
expendable, the Bruins had themselves a diamond in the rough.
</P>
<P>
   Though tentative at times when the club was auditioning him as a
second point man to complement Ray Bourque on the power play, Van
Impe has come a long way in a season. This year, he's been a
power-play staple. After missing two games because of a coach's
decision and two games because of injury, Van Impe has come into
his own. In his first 19 games, he had 11 points, three of them
power-play goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess when I came here I was just trying to show the coaches
I could play and just go from there,'' said Van Impe. ``I had a
strong playoffs last year and I was just hoping I could carry it
over to this year and have a better season than last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Like in many other pro sports, confidence plays perhaps the
biggest role short of pure talent. Last season, Van Impe seemed
reluctant to pull the trigger at times and was eager to surrender
the puck to his teammates. This year, he's playing with more
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting a chance to play on the power play regularly and
I've gotten a few points, and that's helped,'' said Van Impe.
``When things are bouncing your way, obviously you get more
confidence, and that's been the situation for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Point-gathering has never been a problem for Van Impe. In 63
games with Baltimore of the AHL in 1995-96, he had 58 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always played it in juniors and in the minors,'' he said
of his special-teams role. ``I was known as a power-play guy. When
you come up to the NHL, obviously it's tougher. I've tried to
adjust to that and show I can play. But guys are smarter and you
don't have as much time and they play their positions so well. In
the lower leagues, you can find a way around that. The key is to
just move the puck around, keeping your head up and seeing who is
open, and not just try to throw it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Impe sees his role in Boston as miles ahead of where he was
previously in his professional career. ``My first year I was a
rookie so at times I didn't get the opportunity,'' he said. ``Here
they've been showing some more confidence in me and I've tried to
feed off that and just do my best. They're giving me the chance,
and I'm trying to take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Impe said he was never even aware that when the Bruins
picked him up off waivers, they fully intended to use him to
improve their fortunes in Providence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here, I met (Burns) and he told me it was a great
bunch of guys and I'd like them,'' he said. ``I never knew there
was an issue of going to Providence. I was trying to show them I
could play and I think I was kind of an eye-opener for them because
they kept me around the whole year.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Impe said in addition to his newfound confidence, other
factors have contributed to his success. One is being around
players such as Bourque, a future Hall of Famer, and the other is
working with Laperriere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bourque is just the power-play man,'' said Van Impe, grinning.
``He's been around a long time. Just being out there with him, he
teaches me to be more patient and relax and play. He's really good
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lappy has changed my game around defensively. He's great. He
worked hard with me last year and showed me some things I didn't
even know I was doing wrong, in situations down low, playing the
man. Like containing and when I was in front of the net, not being
too close to the goalie when the puck is behind the net. He keeps
pumping it into your head until eventually it just sinks in and
becomes a natural thing.''
</P>
<P>
   As Van Impe progresses and becomes a better-known quantity, he
said he always knew that all he needed was a chance to prove what
he could do. ``I knew I could play this way,'' he said, ``but
getting the opportunity to play and them putting me in those
situations just builds my confidence even more.''

IN THE END, FIESTA MATCH-UP IS NO-BRAINER  
 AFTER UPSETS, TEN NESSEE, FLORIDA ST. ARE TOP CHOICES

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - In the end, it was not decided by decimal points,
quartile rankings or adjusted deviations.
</P>
<P>
   No one involved in college football needed a complicated formula
to tell them that Tennessee and Florida State should meet in the
Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4 at Sun Devil Stadium, with the winner all but
assured of becoming the consensus national champion.
</P>
<P>
   Fiesta Bowl officials could not have hoped for more. Entering
Saturday's games, there were three undefeated teams at the top of
the polls. If all had won, the chances of a split national
championship would have grown, as would have the sweat stains under
the arms of those yellow coats the Fiesta Bowl folks wear.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to losses by No. 2 Kansas State and No. 3 UCLA,
Florida State jumped two spots in both the Associated Press and
coaches polls, as well as in the Bowl Championship Series
standings.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, Florida State's dim chance of a national
championship became a brilliant opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   No one at the Fiesta Bowl was complaining about the weekend's
course of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Providence usually takes pretty good care of the old Fiesta
Bowl,'' said John Junker, the bowl's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't the only one thanking a higher power for an exciting
Saturday afternoon of college football.
</P>
<P>
   While parked on a couch in his home, Florida State Coach Bobby
Bowden watched Miami upset UCLA and then Kansas State fall to Texas
A&AMP;M in the Big 12 Conference championship game.
</P>
<P>
   No one is shocked that No. 1-ranked Tennessee (12-0) won
Saturday and is playing in the game. But few people thought Florida
State (11-1) had a chance after Kansas State, Tennessee and UCLA
entered the final weekend undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   This was not lost on Bowden, whose team was upset early in the
season by North Carolina State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a situation where Tennessee came through the
front door,'' he said. ``We kind of feel like we came through the
back door. But now we're going to face off in the middle of the
room and it's going to be a heck of a shootout.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee was the unanimous No. 1 choice in the both the AP and
coaches final regular-season polls, and Florida State was No. 2 in
each poll by a comfortable margin.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, there will be those looking in who can't help think
they deserve a shot at the title.
</P>
<P>
   Third-ranked Ohio State has lost just once, but will settle for
playing Texas A&AMP;M in the Sugar Bowl. Kansas State's loss Saturday
proved costly, as the Wildcats dropped out of the four BCS bowls
all the way to the Alamo Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The school canceled a scheduled news conference, and Coach Bill
Snyder declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams with one loss, including Arizona and Wisconsin,
could argue that they are as worthy as Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy to be in the Sugar Bowl, but I think we can make
an argument that we're one of the top two,'' Ohio State Coach John
Cooper said. ``We were Number 1 for nine straight weeks. You stub
your toe one time, you've got to be a great team to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   The BCS formula was created to determine the country's top
teams, which are guaranteed of playing in the national championship
game.
</P>
<P>
   The formula has four components: average ranking of the two
polls, the average of three computer rankings, schedule strength
and record.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles were a strong No. 2 team in the BCS standings,
partially because their schedule was rated the fourth strongest in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the Fiesta's fourth national championship game. Its
last title game was in 1996, when Nebraska beat Florida, 62-24.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State last won the national title in the 1993 season,
while Tennessee's only national championship came in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers have danced on the edge of making it to a
national title game over the past few years and have finished in
the top 10 of the AP poll for four consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   With the departure of quarterback Peyton Manning to the NFL, the
Volunteers were not a preseason favorite to win the national title.
</P>
<P>
   But they've beaten Florida, won at Georgia, survived against
Arkansas and avoided being upset Saturday, which the other two top
teams couldn't do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't do that by accident,'' Coach Phillip Fulmer said.
``We have been a resilient team all season, and we've found a way
to get it done.''

COWHER, STEELERS RUNNING ON FUMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Bill Cowher was fuming, expressing an emotion that
seems close to his heart much of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Cowher had grown weary of watching his team trot in and out of
the huddle in lackluster fashion Sunday even though it was fitting
because that's the way the offense was playing.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, frustration and bitter anger in his voice, Cowher
called his offense together on the sideline and exhorted it. Later,
Steelers wide receiver Charles Johnson said, ``Bill wanted us to
come into and out of the huddle with tempo. But it's hard to get
tempo when it's always third down.''
</P>
<P>
   It was third down 13 times for the Steelers in 61 plays Sunday,
roughly 25 percent of the time. Of those plays, only four times did
Cowher's offense convert. The rest of the time, instead of going to
the huddle they went to the sideline, which is where they'll be
headed soon if they don't find some way to win their remaining
three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed in how we played,'' Cowher said after
losing to the Patriots, 23-9, at Three Rivers Stadium. ``Now we're
going to find out a lot about ourselves and this whole football
team. I'm not in position right now to make any assessments, but I
was not very pleased with our performance today.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point you have to make a play, and we have not done
that. I don't know if it's us putting players in the position to
make plays or us just not making them.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, Cowher knows he has little time to solve the
problem if the Steelers are to reach the playoffs again. In their
last 14 games since a big win over the Kansas City Chiefs a year
ago, Pittsburgh is 7-7. Since a big win over the division-leading
Jaguars this year, they've lost two straight and Sunday looked like
a rudderless ship offensively.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers couldn't score a touchdown. They couldn't convert
turnovers into points. They couldn't throw the ball much or run it
at all. They couldn't do anything, including win at home, and that
may have been the most disturbing thing of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is we don't lose at home and we did today,''
Johnson said. ``That's not Pittsburgh.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately it has been, however, and Cowher knows it. Whether he has
a solution that can change that he has no idea, but there is no
denying that at 7-6 with three games to go and trailing the Jaguars
by a three-game margin in the AFC Central, the divisional title is
gone. All that's left is a wild run for an unlikely wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think 10 wins has a chance to get you in the playoffs,''
Cowher said. ``We're not mathematically eliminated. Mathematics
says we have very little margin for error, though. None.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathematics also says the Steelers' bread-and-butter _ their
inside power running game _ has deserted them. Sunday, the Steelers
rushed only 13 times, so although they averaged 4.2 yards a carry,
fullback Jerome Bettis was all but abandoned in large part because
the Patriots put seven and eight men in the box near the line of
scrimmage and challenged Kordell Stewart to throw.
</P>
<P>
   He did. He just didn't throw very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get it done offensively,'' Bettis said. ``We went
down a couple of times and we couldn't move the football (in the
red zone). That created problems for us because we were unable to
score touchdowns. Later we made some mistakes _ an interception, I
fumbled the ball _ and when you do that against a playoff-quality
team you don't give yourself a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Steelers, Sunday's performance may have done worse than
that. It may have prevented them from making the playoffs for the
first time since 1991, the last season before Cowher took over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's looking real shady,'' Steeler tackle Jermaine Stephens
said. ``If there's a chance, we're definitely going to have to win
out the rest of the season.''

MOORE, PATRIOTS DEFENSE FLYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ When it was over, and Patriots found Steelers and
Steelers found Patriots at midfield for postgame socializing,
Pittsburgh cornerback Carnell Lake gave a bear hug to New England
cornerback Ty Law at the 35-yard line and Lake said to Law, ``You
deserved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's was the Patriots' best defensive game since New England
last played Pittsburgh, in the playoffs 11 months ago, and it came
at no bigger time and with no bigger physical crisis, merely the
latest, to hit the Patriots: the loss of middle linebacker Ted
Johnson with a torn biceps on the second play of the game, when
Johnson was tackling Jerome Bettis. Johnson, though, seemed hardly
missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that it's over, I guess it was a big loss,'' said
linebacker Tedy Bruschi in words that would be echoed by Patriot
defender after Patriot defender. ``But during the game it didn't
look like we lost much of anything the way Marty (Moore) was
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, the last player taken in the NFL draft five years ago,
Mr. Irrelevant himself, was immense as Johnson's replacement.
``We're proud of Marty,'' said coach Pete Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did was go back and look at the film of the last time
we played the Steelers,'' said safety Lawyer Milloy. ``And what we
saw in that playoff game last year was that we were flying around
the ball, something we hadn't been doing this year. And we saw that
we were putting a lot of pressure on Kordell Stewart (the Steelers'
befuddled QB), and we did that this time.''
</P>
<P>
   So much so that Stewart, after a decent start, was so out of
sync and inept in the late moments that the few thousand remaining
fans in Three Rivers Stadium booed him relentlessly and one fan
dumped a cup of beer on him as he left the field after firing one
last pass that was picked off by cornerback Steve Israel. Stewart
was 21 of 45 for 206 yards and two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   That other interception was by Ty Law (his eighth of the
season), late in the third quarter. And with 2:48 left in the game,
and New England on shaky Astroturf despite a 23-9 lead, Law made a
great play to break up a pass to Hines Ward in the end zone. It was
great because Patriot QB Drew Bledsoe had just thrown an ugly
interception and Pittsburgh had more than enough time to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy to perform good in front of the home crowd,''
said Law, who grew up in nearby Aliquippa, Pa. ``I haven't picked
off Kordell since we've been playing together, and, you know, I
finally get one back from the Hail Mary (a Stewart pass to Michael
Westbrook over Law that gave Colorado a last-second win over
Michigan in 1994). This'll never replace that, but I'm just glad to
get the interception in front of the hometown folks.''
</P>
<P>
   Law, Israel, Milloy, and the rest of the beleaguered New England
secondary also made a huge improvement in what had been its
Achilles' heel all season: giving up first downs on
third-and-longs. The Steelers were only 4 of 13 on third-down
plays, much more like the Patriot defense that throttled Pittsburgh
in its 7-6 playoff loss to the Steelers here last season. Nonstop
pressure on Stewart, just as last season, was the key.
</P>
<P>
   But another key was the play of Chad Eaton, who just may be the
most improved defensive lineman in the NFL. For the second straight
week, Eaton led the team in tackles (eight), a statistic usually
reserved for linebackers. Eaton also had three sacks of the usually
unsackable Stewart and also put a hit on Jerome Bettis early in the
fourth quarter that caused (a) Bettis to fumble and (b) Steelers
coach Bill Cowher to gather his offense around him on the sideline
for a fiery tongue-lashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to do with Bettis what we always do,'' said Eaton of
the Pittsburgh back who was held to a puny 48 yards on 12 carries.
``And that's to get everybody around the ball when he has it. I got
lucky ... I just got him with the helmet.''
</P>
<P>
   But Eaton couldn't be modest about his sacks of Stewart, one
when he caught the speedy QB from behind, a play seldom seen. As
usual, the cheery Eaton had a unique take on the sack from behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazing,'' said Eaton. ``And I kind of let Kordell know about
it, too. I said to him, `Did you just let me catch you?' And, `Did
I just catch you from behind?'''
</P>
<P>
   And did Stewart say anything back?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I think Kordell was looking over to Bill, and Bill was
just giving him that chin.''
</P>
<P>
   Key plays by the defense were many, and perhaps few were any
bigger than when Willie Clay banged into Steeler receiver Hines
Ward on Pittsburgh's first possession of the second half, knocking
the ball loose and saving a TD.

AS PASSER, STEWART FAILS TO MAKE GRADE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL McDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Patriots have Kordell Stewart's number, and Sunday they once
again exposed him as not being a prime-time NFL passer.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was inept through the air, and because he could not do
anything against the Patriots' pass defense, his team had no
chance.
</P>
<P>
   The way to beat the Patriots is to score points on them with the
pass. They play the run well, but against the pass they give up
more first downs than almost any team in the league. New England
has trouble rushing the quarterback, but when the passer can't make
plays via the air, as Stewart demonstrated once again Sunday, there
is less need for pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In 3 1/2 games against the Patriots, here are Stewart's passing
numbers:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Att. &LR;   &UR;  &LR;   &UR; Com. &LR;   &UR; Yds. &LR;   &UR;  &LR;   &UR; TD &LR;   &UR; Int &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   31 14 134 0 1 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   45 21 206 0 2 &QL; 
 &UR; Totals  &LR;   &UR; 134 &LR;   &UR; 61 &LR;   &UR;  &LR;   &UR; 606 &LR;   &UR; 1 &LR;   &UR; 5 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In those games, dating back to the playoff game two years ago in
Foxborough (when he debuted with that 0-for-10 beauty), note the
one touchdown vs. five interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   And this all has happened while the Patriots have been geared up
to stop Jerome ``The Bus'' Bettis. When Stewart has had success
throwing, it has come when Bettis is having a big game on the
ground and the opposition has to commit more players to stopping
him.
</P>
<P>
   Bettis has not been able to run against the Patriots the way he
does against the rest of the league. The Bus has had a flat tire
against the local lads, gaining only 235 yards in his last four
games against New England, on 78 carries, with no touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers had beaten the Patriots two games in a row before
Sunday because their defense did a good job against the Patriots'
offense, pressuring Drew Bledsoe. Sunday, especially in the first
half, Bledsoe could have eaten a sandwich before he let the ball
go.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Terry Glenn, Ben Coates, and Shawn Jefferson were
able to make big plays in the passing game.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's defense lives by the zone blitz. Sunday, it was
ineffective. The zone blitz is predicated on the idea that the rush
is going to make the passer throw the ball prematurely. At the same
time, the defensive backs are supposed to run with the recievers
off the snap, so the quarterback will get hit before a man gets
open.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' offensive line did a great job of protecting
Bledsoe. The three interceptions he threw were his fault, not the
line's, although he was bothered by his broken finger during the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots still could not run the ball. But their attack was
wide open through the air. The Steelers produced no pressure, and
defensive backs afraid of Glenn and Jefferson deep gave ground
consistently when the Steelers executed a zone blitz, playing zone
instead of man-to-man on those occasions.
</P>
<P>
   On their first drive of the day, the key play was a 43-yard pass
to Glenn, when the Steelers blitzed and were blocked, leaving
Bledsoe a world of time and Glenn a ticket to get open.
</P>
<P>
   They went up, 6-0, because of the same situation with Jefferson.
The Steelers blitzed. Bledsoe got time, and the defender backed far
away from Jefferson, who gained 25 yards on a hook to set up
another field goal by Adam Vinatieri.
</P>
<P>
   However, the play of the day was the 86-yard pass from Bledsoe
to Glenn. Again the Steelers came with a blitz, and again Bledsoe
had forever. Glenn ran from the Patriots 14 to the 45 while Bledsoe
unloaded. No one on the Steelers can match Glenn's speed, certainly
not safety Darren Perry, and Glenn got 5 yards behind him to make
the easy catch and score.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Stewart was struggling. Aside from not being an
accurate passer, he always looks at the reciever he is going to
throw to all the way down the field. Twice, Willie Clay took
advantage of this to make great plays. On those occasions, Stewart
tried to hit receivers running down the seams of the zone and over
the goal line, when Clay, reading Stewart's eyes, made great reads
and moved over to knock away two potential touchdown passes. Each
time the reciever was open, but Stewart gave his target away
prematurely and threw late, allowing Clay time to react.
</P>
<P>
   The only time in the game Stewart had success was in the second
period, when he completed several stop passes in a row for short
gains. Outside of that, he could do no damage. It is difficult in
the NFL to throw 45 passes and have just 206 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers are not the Steelers of the past, way back or
recently. When they've had good teams, they have been able to run
the ball and rush the passer. This year they can do neither.
</P>
<P>
   Their offensive line is beat up and cannot get the job done.
Defensively, they cannot bring the heat the way they have in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   This week they were a great matchup for the Patriots, who are
weak defending the pass and got a weak passer, and stout throwing
the ball against a team that can't rush the passer.

BLEDSOE PUTS FINGER ON PROBLEM, ADJUSTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ For the first half, Drew Bledsoe seldom had been
better, torching the Pittsburgh defense with 239 yards of passing,
including an exquisite sighting of Terry Glenn at the last possible
instant and a perfect pass from the Patriots 5-yard line to their
45.
</P>
<P>
   So exquisite that Glenn could dance away from safety Darren
Perry for an 86-yard touchdown. And, for the first six plays of the
third quarter, it was more of the same, Bledsoe finding Glenn three
more times with perfect passes and Robert Edwards for a fourth.
</P>
<P>
   New England had a first-and-5 at the Steelers 42, leading, 13-6.
All seemed well.
</P>
<P>
   But only Bledsoe knew that his broken right index finger was
hurting, even more than playing an NFL game with a broken finger on
his passing hand should hurt, ``and all I know is I didn't hit it
on anybody,'' he said. ``I don't know ... I don't know for sure
what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever had happened was not good. On that first-and-5, Bledsoe
dropped back and could no longer even grasp the ball. It slipped
out of his fingers, and he had to fall on it for a 13-yard loss.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was what Bledsoe would call ``that fiasco of the
third quarter.'' First the ball sailed on him on a short pass to
Glenn, and then, on third and 18, with Glenn open deep, Bledsoe
scrambled and fired a pass that was picked off by Chris Oldham.
Fiasco, indeed. The Steelers were ready to be picked apart even
more by Bledsoe, but the quarterback's passes were wandering and
wayward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was before that that my finger was already hurting,'' said
Bledsoe. ``That's why the ball slipped out of my hands and why the
passes were sailing. That last joint on my index finger wasn't
quite working the way it was supposed to be working.''
</P>
<P>
   The medical staff worked on Bledsoe's finger on the sideline. It
was clear to Bledsoe that his short cast, which left the tip and
top joint of his finger exposed, had to be altered. The decision
was to go to a longer cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put a splint on it, a longer splint, to hold it in
position and to cover that (top) joint,'' said Bledsoe. ``And that
helped me keep my hand on the ball a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   But the problem was not worked out immediately, as the
``fiasco'' continued on the next drive. With help from referee Dick
Hantak's flag-happy crew (it averages 20.1 penalties a game, the
most of any in the NFL), the Patriots steadily moved backward.
</P>
<P>
   New England started with a first-and-10 at its 19 because of a
penalty on the kickoff, and it degenerated into a fourth-and-27
from the 2. The Patriots were in control, but it seemed about to
unravel because Bledsoe's passes were sailing or bouncing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a broken finger,'' said Bledsoe, matter-of-factly. ``The
feeling wasn't the same (on his passes). It's a broken finger, and
it's not as accurate as it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, Bledsoe threw on the sideline, seeking to regain
the feel, the touch, with his finger. Finally, with the longer
splint in place, Bledsoe trotted back onto the field with the ball
again deep in his territory, on the Patriots 8, after the defense
had pitched a most timely three-and-out at the Pittsburgh offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know anything about it,'' said tackle Bruce
Armstrong. ``Drew didn't say anything in the huddle to us about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bledsoe felt better, thinking ``that with longer splint on
it, I should be able to get the job done. We played around and
tried some different stuff on the finger and eventually came up
with something that allowed me to get the ball out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Which he did. A 20-yard right-on-the-money pass to Ben Coates
quieted the Steelers fans and brought the ball out to the New
England 29. Two more passes, one to Coates and one to Glenn,
covered 25 more yards. The Patriots did not score on that drive,
but the offense did relieve much of the pressure on the team. And,
on the next two drives, the Patriots did score, first a field goal
and then a TD one play after Bledsoe threw a perfect 32-yard pass
to the left flat to Coates, who was interfered with on the play.
Edwards banged it in on the next play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drew had some problems with his finger, you could tell,'' said
coach Pete Carroll. ``The ball started flying on him and he had a
hard time controlling it. But the doctors made an adjustment on the
brace, which I think helped, and Drew came back and played well.''
</P>
<P>
   And, once again, courageously. As Armstrong put it, ``This team
is used to key guys getting hurt and coming back to make plays.''
The result was a win in Pittsburgh, a convincing win in Pittsburgh,
a win in Pittsburgh that was one of the Patriots' most significant
in the regular season for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's healing, and that's the most important part of
it,'' said Bledsoe, when asked if Sunday represented a setback
regarding his finger. ``I'm not doing any more damage to it by
playing, and all the evidence so far is that it is healing while
I'm playing. So hopefully in the next couple of weeks it will have
healed enough so that I don't have to wear the splint on it and
I'll be back to normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe did throw a horrendous interception late in the fourth
quarter, one that brought instant recall of Kevin Henry to all
Patriot fans, but New England's defense saved the Patriots from
deja vu of one year ago in Foxborough against the Steelers. And,
when it was all done, Bledsoe was most pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a particularly clean game for me _ I threw them
three balls, and I missed some easy throws,'' said Bledsoe. ``But
to come in here and get a victory feels very good and very
satisfying, especially with the history I've had here. It feels
good to leave this place with a victory rather than walk out of
here with your head down.''
</P>
<P>
   It was no equal of Bledsoe's miracle finishes of the last two
weeks, but his return to the field Sunday in the third quarter just
may be a metaphor for these battered and bruised Patriots.
Character abounds on this team.

EDWARDS SETTLES SCORE WITH TOUCHDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ They talked trash to the rookie all day. They said
things to him that we cannot repeat here. Robert Edwards touched
the ball 28 times Sunday, and on 27 occasions he heard some foul
words from the Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the game,'' Edwards said with a shrug, ``I guess they
were trying to distract me. They should know I don't get distracted
that easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Steelers didn't see the Patriot running back's tattoo.
It is a Bible verse, seared into his left biceps. The verse, from
the book of Philippians, alludes to all things being possible
through a higher power. Edwards lives by those words when he goes
to work. So that might explain why one of his carries exemplified
the trend of the day: Edwards was the one making noise and the
Steelers were walking away, either muttering to themselves or
simply saying nothing.
</P>
<P>
   How did that happen? A touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards scored on a 4-yard run in the fourth quarter. It not
only ended the Patriots' scoring for the day, it ended a pleasant
70-degree day for many western Pennsylvanians. After the score,
thousands of people picked up their things and headed for the
inevitable traffic wars. That made the score 23-9, which is how the
game ended.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Edwards did not try to pretend he had a great day. It
was tough running for most of the afternoon. Those 28 carries
produced only 66 yards, an average of 2.4. The Steeler linebackers
are not the fastest Edwards has seen all year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen Miami twice,'' the rookie reminded everyone. But you
don't always have to be fast to stop the run. You just have to be
able to anticipate what's going to happen. The Steelers did that
about 26 times. They didn't do so well on a 17-yard Edwards run in
the first quarter. And they didn't know what to do with that
touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I haven't been in the end zone for a while,'' Edwards
said, ``but I haven't had that many opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Edwards had twice as many opportunities as Pittsburgh's
Jerome Bettis. A 250-pound runner nicknamed The Bus, Bettis rushed
for 48 yards. Many people would argue that if you had to choose
between runners, you'd take Bettis over Edwards every time. But on
a key fourth-quarter play Bettis, carrying the ball at his team's
34-yard line, fumbled and lost the ball to Lawyer Milloy. The
Patriots simply took the ball and finished off a four-play drive
with Edwards's touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   You should have seen the Pittsburgh sideline after the fumble
and, eventually, touchdown. Bettis shook his head on the way to the
bench. Bill Cowher, the coach who usually cajoles and cheers along
the field, stood with hands on hips with nothing to say. The game
was over.
</P>
<P>
   When the analysis began in the Patriots locker room, Shawn
Jefferson was saying that the offense needs to find a way to score
when it is only 20 yards from the end zone. ``If I had to look at
one thing we struggled with, that's it,'' Jefferson said. They
didn't struggle with it all day. Edwards didn't get many yards, but
he did find the end zone.

A FIESTA FOR VOLS, SEMINOLES 
</HEADLINE>
 CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ After a rash of upsets Saturday jumbled rankings and
crushed hopes of major bowl berths, undefeated seasons, and
national championships, college football restored order with
Sunday's release of the final Bowl Championship Series rankings.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, No. 1 and unbeaten Tennessee and No. 2 and
once-beaten Florida State will meet in the Fiesta Bowl in Tempe,
Ariz., Jan. 4, to decide at least part of the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   In the other BCS bowl pairings announced Sunday, Texas A&AMP;M, a
double-overtime upset winner over Kansas State in the Big 12
championship game, will meet once-beaten and Big Ten co-champion
Ohio State in the Sugar Bowl Jan. 1; Big East champion Syracuse
will meet Florida in the Orange Bowl Jan. 2; and Big Ten
co-champion Wisconsin will meet Pac-10 champion UCLA in the Rose
Bowl Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the Fiesta Bowl will be declared the national
champion in the USA Today-ESPN coaches' poll, while the Associated
Press media poll will wait until after the game to vote on its
champion.
</P>
<P>
   And while the winner of the Fiesta Bowl is a heavy favorite to
be crowned national champion, there still could be controversy if
No. 3 Ohio State beats Texas A&AMP;M by a wide margin and Florida State
wins a lackluster defensive battle against Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, which became the first team this season to receive
all 70 first-place votes in the AP poll, can head off any
controversy by beating the Seminoles. That would give the
Volunteers their first national title since 1951.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS situation cleared up significantly after Saturday's
games, in which Kansas State and UCLA, which lost to Miami, were
knocked from the ranks of the unbeaten. That left it obvious who
was No. 1, but it opened a new debate: Who's No. 2?
</P>
<P>
   UCLA and Kansas State paid heavily for their losses, although
Kansas State suffered the biggest drop, falling all the way out of
the $12 million BCS bowl pool into the $1 million Alamo Bowl in San
Antonio, against Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA, which lost a 49-45 shootout to Miami in the Orange Bowl,
received a nice consolation prize by landing in the Rose Bowl slot
traditionally reserved for the Pac-10 champion.
</P>
<P>
   If there were controversies in the aftermath of the upsets, they
were the elevation of Florida State into the Fiesta at the expense
of Ohio State; the exclusion of Kansas State; and the inclusion of
twice-beaten Florida, which didn't even win its division in the
SEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Florida State and Tennessee were the two best teams,''
said BCS chairman Roy Kramer, pointing to computer printouts that
ranked both of those teams far ahead of Kansas State, Ohio State,
and the rest of the field.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer was less specific about why Florida made it, especially
since it finished five spots behind Kansas State in the final BCS
rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the BCS was to match the two best teams in the
country,'' he said. ``From there on down, there was a lot of
freedom for the bowls to do what they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Orange Bowl wanted was to choose Florida, which has not
played in the bowl since 1967, as an opponent for Syracuse, which
had three losses during the regular season but automatically earned
a BCS berth as the Big East champion.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators should bring plenty of fans to South Florida. Kansas
State has a similiar reputation of fan support, but Orange Bowl
officials may have doubted how much support would be left following
a loss of such magnitude to Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State coach Bobby Bowden, who will take his team to its
third national title game in six seasons, and Tennessee coach Phil
Fulmer were delighted.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said his respect for Tennessee is genuine. ``They have
the symptoms of a national championship team,'' he said, meaning
the Vols possess quick defensive players who have made big plays
when needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things worked out for us,'' said Bowden. ``We're lucky, and
yet there are several other teams that deserve to be in there as
much as we do.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be repercussions. I've never been a
proponent of a playoff. I've always said I like the system. If they
voted us in, good. If they don't, we'll live with it. But I'm
getting to where I think we probably ought to be have a four-team
playoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer is just happy to be heading west. ``We were a team that
did the job when it had to be done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A playoff system can wait. For now, the system in place will
feature at least one of the two best teams in its title game,
perhaps both.

WHIPPLE HAS UMASS EXPECTING VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, Mass. _ The University of Massachusetts football team
is divided into two groups: those whose memories of last season
have gathered dust because of the success of this year, and those
who have enjoyed this season on its own merits because at this time
last year they knew virtually nothing about the program.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is first-year coach Mark Whipple. No one needed to
tell him how awful the Minutemen were in 1997; he was less than two
hours south, coaching at his alma mater, Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Whipple was hired at UMass last December, he
encountered several people who were more than anxious to inform him
of what he was getting into.
</P>
<P>
   ``People came to me so many times during the first few weeks,
saying, `You're going to be fine, but it's going to take about
three years,''' said Whipple, who guided the Minutemen to their
first 10-win season with a 27-21 win over Lehigh Saturday in the
second round of the Division 1-AA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Minutemen (10-3) will visit Northwestern State (11-2) of
Natchitoches, La., Saturday at 3 p.m., in the second national
semifinal game in school history. Saturday's home playoff win was
the first for UMass in school history.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to compare what UMass has done this season _
rebounding from a 2-9 campaign last year _ to any other college
football program's resurgence.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the fact that the roster pretty much stayed intact
from last year. Whipple merely added a few talented players at the
skilled positions such as quarterback Todd Bankhead from a
California junior college and wide receiver Jimmy Moore from
Southern Methodist, as well as several excellent freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would say to me that we don't have very good players
here, but they knew I would get them, and they knocked how the
recruiting had been poor the last few years,'' Whipple said. ``But
I never bought that. I'm not going to live long enough to wait
three years to win.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have to wait. The blend of exceptional newcomers who
didn't know about last year's demise and talented returnees bent on
doing something about it has served the Minutemen well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back at last year, I don't know what went on,'' said
Bankhead, who earlier this season said he had heard only about the
UMass basketball program while in California. ``But I know that the
guys that were on this team before could play and still can play. I
haven't seen any film of what happened last year, but we just have
all the confidence in the world that we can win.''
</P>
<P>
   It showed Saturday. Against previously unbeaten Lehigh, the
Minutemen rebounded from several miscues to take a 13-point
fourth-quarter lead and held on after the Mountain Hawks cut the
lead to 6 with 7:11 left.
</P>
<P>
   The UMass defense, as it had in several games down the stretch,
secured the victory by stopping Lehigh once it drove to the 9-yard
line with 2:01 remaining. ``UMass did a great job defensively,''
said Lehigh coach Kevin Higgins. ``We had a chance to gain
momentum, and that is a big part of any team's success and
confidence. Unfortunately, we didn't give ourselves enough
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The result set off a celebration not seen at McGuirk Stadium in
years.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the last time UMass's players were involved in such a
frenzy was last season, when a Boston University team still reeling
from the school's decision to cancel football routed the Minutemen,
33-8, in BU's final home game, and Terrier players and fans
attacked the goal posts as UMass players left the field stunned and
dejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans, coaches, and teams are finally getting back
something for all the hard work we've put into this,'' said senior
linebacker Khari Samuel. ``This is my fourth and a half year here
and this is the best fun I've been having. I'm happy we have
another week to look forward to.''
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern State is the regular-season champion of the
Southland Conference. UMass beat Southland member McNeese State of
Lake Charles, La., 29-21, in the first round. Northwestern State
rallied from a 10-7 fourth-quarter deficit to defeat visiting
McNeese State, 14-10, in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been there, and I don't think we'll lack for
confidence,'' said Whipple about the return trip to Louisiana.
``It's going to be a tough, tough game. I think they realize how
tough it was after being down at McNeese. I think we will be better
prepared for it.''

 CROSS-SETON HALL-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WORCESTER, Mass. _ The Holy Cross women's basketball team has
been a rather polite host of the ECAC Women's Holiday Festival the
last couple of seasons, losing the championship game of its own
tournament in its own arena. Maryland took the crown last season
and Providence won it the year before.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, playing in its third consecutive ECAC tournament
finals at the Hart Center, Holy Cross held off Seton Hall, 71-65,
before 456 fans to capture its first victory this season against a
Big East team. The Crusaders had lost to Boston College (65-59) and
were pounded, 107-56, by UConn, the No. 1 team in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Even with four players scoring in double figures, led by
tournament Most Valuable Player Amy O'Brien's 21 points, Holy Cross
still had to hold off a late Pirates push. Seton Hall pulled to
within 5 with 35 seconds left but would come no closer.
</P>
<P>
   Holy Cross (5-3) also received double-digit scoring performances
from Anna Kinne (17 points) as well as Summer Ivan and Lara
Marcsisin (13 each). Freshman forward Starr Fuller of Burke High
scored 22 for Seton Hall (3-5).
</P>
<P>
   Neither team shot especially well _ Holy Cross at 39.1 percent
and Seton Hall at 40.6 percent _ but the Holy Cross defense,
employing a full-court press throughout, caused 22 turnovers, 13 in
the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Number one, after we got beat by UConn, there was some talk
that Holy Cross might be all done, that we aren't as good as usual,
but we've come back with three quality wins'' (Fordham, Rider, and
Seton Hall),'' said Holy Cross coach Bill Gibbons, whose teams won
three of the last four Patriot League titles, including last
season's. ``A third time is a charm to winning this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Holy Cross's defense, mixing man-to-man and zone coverages, was
impressive. ``Our half-court defense was excellent,'' Gibbons said.
``We found a way to win, with the key being our starting five, the
way they played to decide the second half. Usually I substitute
more, but they were playing so well I had to play them those last
eight or nine minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Holy Cross held only a 1-point lead, 34-33, early in the second
half, but then the Crusaders made five of six field goals to go up,
47-37, on an O'Brien layup with 15 minutes left. ``We had turnovers
and we've been doing that for six games,'' said Seton Hall coach
Phyllis Mangina. ``We seem to relax on defense and give up some
easy shots and get ourselves in a hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Holy Cross braced for a Seton Hall comeback, similar to the one
the Pirates used in beating George Mason (77-73), despite building
a 23-point lead. ``But we made our free throws (seven of last nine
in the last 2:56),'' O'Brien said. ``That's the type (of) team that
can hurt you when you let your guard down. We knew they'd make a
run at us.''

QUEST PULL ONE OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD _ The coach of the Columbus Quest resigned two weeks
ago. Three of the team's starters were out with knee injuries.
Another three missed the team flight here Saturday night and showed
up less than an hour before game time.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that mattered Sunday, as the Quest pulled out a
65-61 win over the New England Blizzard at the Civic Center before
8,112.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a third-quarter run by the Blizzard in which they surged
to a 47-43 lead, the Quest showed why they're the two-time
defending ABL champions and now are sporting an 8-2 record. Guard
Shannon Johnson poured in a game-high 20 points (including four
3-pointers), followed by player/coach Tonya Edwards (12) and Lisa
Harrison (10).
</P>
<P>
   Center Kara Wolters scored a team-high 16 points, but it wasn't
enough to get the Blizzard out of the hole they dug in the first
half. Both the 5 points in the second quarter and the 17 points in
the first half were franchise lows for the team in its third
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first half, I think we were in awe of the ABL
champions, and one of the things you saw was our standing around on
offense and not having the discipline to go through plays,'' said
coach K.C. Jones. ``We made some adjustments the second half and
came out with much more determination and came back with the
offense and were moving. But they're the champions, they came right
back on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolters, who scored all of her points and grabbed all of her
game-high nine rebounds during the second half, said her team
scored too little too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``(They) play hard and have a great defense; you have to really
work a whole game (to beat them),'' she said. ``But a game is a
first and second half, and unfortunately we only played hard the
second half.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Blizzard went into the locker room at intermission,
they took a 12-point deficit with them. Nothing had seemed to go
right in the second quarter, as they were 2 for 8 from the floor
and committed seven turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Wolters said the mood at halftime was ```Come on guys, let's
go.' We knew we didn't have the fire that we needed. It was just a
pride thing, we don't want to keep losing.'' But the Blizzard fell
to 2-7.
</P>
<P>
   They did come out blazing in the first 1:43 of third quarter.
Suddenly it was the Quest who seemed out of synch as the Blizzard
went on a 5-0 run _ or as many points as they scored in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   As the theme from ``Rocky'' played, the crowd roared and the
Blizzard took a 41-40 lead with two minutes to go. Wolters grabbed
a rebound and made a layup with 1 second left, giving the Blizzard
a 47-43 lead at the end of three. They had outscored the Quest,
18-5, in the last five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But the heroics would not last another quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Quest regrouped and tied it at 49. After that they never
looked back. Despite letting the Blizzard get within 2 points,
Columbus sealed the win with two free throws by Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the Quest might be hurting _ Edwards is the interim
player/coach since Brian Agler left to go the WNBA. Beverly
Williams, Valerie Still, and Katie Smith are all nursing ACL
injuries. But none of that mattered Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Edwards scored 28 points to lead the Philadelphia Rage to
an 85-68 victory over the host Seattle Reign.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Chasity Melvin added 21 points for the Rage.
</P>
<P>
   Niesa Johnson led Seattle with 18 points while Shalonda Ennis
had 15.

PAGE SHOWS GREAT SKILL, COURAGE

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY _ Johnny Tapia's attempt to win the bantamweight
title was supposed to be the main event on Don King's homecoming
card Saturday night in Atlantic City, but after James Page and Jose
Luis Lopez were finished punching each other in the head,
everything else was a preliminary.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 rounds, Page defended the World Boxing Association title
he won two months ago in Paris with courage and skill. When he
relied on the skill he dominated Lopez, who is the kind of guy who
apologizes if you don't hit him flush.
</P>
<P>
   But when courage was required it was needed in handfuls, because
on those occasions when Lopez chose to be a pitcher instead of a
catcher he did great damage to the champion. Twice Lopez dropped
him, although one was suspect and appeared to be a slip, and four
other times Page went down on slips that were partly the result of
Lopez's wily trainer, Lou Duva, loading his fighter's trunks with
water each round.
</P>
<P>
   That kept up a constant spatter on the Budweiser logo in the
center of the ring, and because Page was a mover while Lopez was a
stalker, it was the champion who often found himself slipping to
the floor. Most of the time, Lopez had nothing to do with that, but
on several occasions he nearly bombed Page out with the kind of
fearsome right hands that have made Lopez one of the most feared
welterweights in the world despite the fact he entered the bout
with three losses and two draws and left with another of the former
after dropping a 12-round decision even he did not dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good fight, but Page deserved to win,'' Lopez
(42-4-2) said. ``I'll fight anybody. But tonight I was just a bit
off.''
</P>
<P>
   If he was, it was a good thing because just as he had done to
defrocked WBA champion Ike Quartey (who was stripped of the title
Page later won not long after fighting Lopez to a draw) Lopez twice
dropped the champion and on at least three occasions seemed to have
him out on his feet but never was able to finish him off.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Page refused to fall, but then again so did
Lopez, despite being strafed round after round with some nasty
combinations that would have sent lesser men to the emergency room,
let alone the canvas. But Lopez always has been as hard-headed
about being knocked backward as a cement pillar, and Saturday night
was no different. Although he might be willing to lose, he never
was willing to back up to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt how strong he was when I hit him,'' Page (23-3) said.
``I thought he would at least bobble, but he never budged. I had to
stay focused and keep my jab going.''
</P>
<P>
   That was not easy to do because whenever Lopez would land his
counter right hand _ as Page kept making the mistake of retreating
straight backward after throwing combinations that often left him
off balance _ he would wobble the champion or make him blink. By
the end of the night, Page was blinking like a lighthouse, but that
light refused to go out and that force of will carried the night
for Page and for King, who now controls two of the three major
welterweight titles as well as two of the heavyweight ones and most
of the middleweight champions.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday he also added the WBA bantamweight champion to his
stable when Tapia came out and won a workmanlike 12-round decision
from Nana Yaw Konadu. Konadu cut Tapia's right eye in the third
round and did some serious damage to his challenger's face when he
landed, rubbing his right cheek raw as well as patches on both his
shoulders and half-closing that right eye by the time the fight was
done.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for most of the evening, Konadu simply followed where Tapia
led like a willing dance partner. After Tapia first felt Konadu's
power he decided the three extra pounds he now was carrying since
moving up from junior bantamweight were doing him little good and
he chose the wise course, which was to box and stay away from the
champion as much as possible after he first tasted his power in
that third round.
</P>
<P>
   Because Tapia was so effective, he left the new Atlantic City
Convention Center with Konadu's title as well as his fingerprints
on his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't bleed and get a black eye, I haven't won
anything,'' said the tough-talking Tapia (45-0-2). ``I fought a
strong fighter, but it was very frustrating. He was not coming
after me. He wasn't doing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared to James Page and Jose Luis Lopez, neither was Johnny
Tapia.

ORBITER HINTS MARS HAS LOTS OF WATER 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A spacecraft now flying in orbit above the poles
of Mars has given Earth-bound scientists fresh confidence that vast
seas of ice and deep water still lie beneath the Red Planet's arid
surface.
</P>
<P>
   The latest news from the craft called Mars Global Surveyor is
offering a wealth of surprises about the planet's ice-covered North
Pole and the great bowl-shaped depression that appears to fill much
of the Martian northern hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   The pole itself, once believed to be huge and to contain
virtually all of what might remain of any ancient Martian water, is
now seen as little more than a modest ice cap holding somewhat less
than half the volume of the ice now covering Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   But there's plenty of water elsewhere on the planet, the
scientists agree. It probably lies buried beneath surface dust in
the form of several separate seas of ice perhaps a mile and a half
thick, with liquid water beneath them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A beautiful place to look for life,'' said a delighted Norman
H. Sleep, a Stanford University geophysicist.
</P>
<P>
   New findings on the Martian surface and what may lie beneath
were reported Sunday at the opening of the American Geophysical
Union's annual fall meeting in San Francisco. More than 8,000
scientists who study the Earth, the oceans, the planets, the
climate and the sun's influence have gathered at Moscone Center for
five days of reports and debate.
</P>
<P>
   The Global Surveyor spacecraft, which reached Mars 18 months
ago, is now flying barely more than 75 miles above the surface _
well within the upper Martian atmosphere _ and is radioing back the
first extremely high-resolution images of the north polar ice cap
and the surface surrounding it for many miles.
</P>
<P>
   According to David E. Smith of NASA's Goddard Space Flight
Center in Greenbelt, Md, that ice cap is nowhere nearly as large or
as high as researchers had believed. It stands less than two miles
high above a deep bowl-shaped region that covers much of the
planet's northern hemisphere, and is cleaved by spiral-shaped
troughs and deep chasms unlike anything ever known on Earth, Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   The ice cap, he said, is most probably all water and not frozen
carbon dioxide as once thought.
</P>
<P>
   Instruments aboard the Global Surveyor show for the first time
how the slopes of the polar cap vary. They range from a relatively
gentle 10 degrees (easy enough for a cross-country skier) to a much
steeper 20 to 45 degrees (plenty challenging for a skilled downhill
racer).
</P>
<P>
   But what surprises Smith and his colleagues most is the fact
that instead of water from the ice cap in the distant past flowing
out toward the flat plains around it, the water from far-away
higher regions nearer the equator must have flown into the ice cap
over the millennia.
</P>
<P>
   To Michael Carr of the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park,
Calif.,this means it is ``almost certain'' that copious groundwater
must once have flown from springs to feed the upstream ends of
large river valleys. An ``early'' Mars _ perhaps a billion or more
years ago _ held large seas of water covering what are now broad
plains in the Martian highlands nearer to the equator.
</P>
<P>
   It is quite possible, Carr said, that volcanoes known to be
still active on Mars may be keeping underground reservoirs of water
liquid even today, marking these areas as ``targets for future
exploration.''
</P>
<P>
   Another indication that large quantities of water, frozen or
not, undoubtedly exist on Mars, comes from the nature of the
Martian meteorites that have frequently reached the Earth after
being blasted from the surface of Mars by the impact from
asteroids, Sleep said.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical analysis of those meteorites, he said, show that their
minerals formed in the presence of water _ a not surprising fact,
he said, since fully a third of all the Earth's water is bound up
in sediments and minerals even now.  &LR;

AIR POLLUTION CROSSING PACIFIC 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL T. HALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Clouds of dust and industrial pollutants from
Asia are showing up as air pollution along the West Coast,
scientists revealed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In the first detailed look at the movement of air pollution
across the Pacific, new studies suggest that Californians may need
to look as far away as China to find the source of all the soot,
carbon monoxide and industrial toxins they may be breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Two sets of measurements in 1997 and 1998 found significant
amounts of smog and dust with an Asian imprint in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have shown before that dust storms in North Africa
can cloud the air along the eastern seaboard of the United States,
and industrial toxins have been traced from the American east coast
to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings, summarized Sunday during a meeting of the
American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, show for the first
time that pollution can even hitchhike all the way across the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Such long-range transport is not a major source of air problems,
probably contributing less than 1 percent of the more common
pollutants, said Dan Jaffe, an associate professor studying
atmospheric chemistry at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do the long-range culprits mean regulators should lighten up
on local polluters. But Jaffe noted that pollution blowing in from
Asia could become a growing problem as China and other east Asian
economies continue to industrialize.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not be an important contributor to local air pollution
conditions now,'' he said. ``But we shouldn't just close our eyes
to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Findings by Jaffe and his associates are part of a three-year
research effort financed by the National Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Measurements taken in March 1997 at the Cheeka Peak Observatory
in northwest Washington showed substantially higher levels of
pollutants had managed to cross the Pacific than scientists had
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Carbon monoxide levels, for example, were 10 percent higher than
found in normal Pacific marine air, particulates were 50 percent
above normal and a type of industrial pollutant called peroxyacetyl
nitrates was nearly double the expected concentration.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical analysis showed the source clearly was somewhere in
eastern Asia, although Jaffe said there isn't enough data to prove
whether the pollutants came from coal burning in China or an oil
source in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The contaminants appear to have traveled in the troposphere, as
high as about 10,000 feet, when a low-pressure system over the
Aleutian Islands combined with a high-pressure cell over Hawaii.
The effect was described as ``twin gears pulling a high-speed
conveyor belt'' laden with contaminants.
</P>
<P>
   Another set of measurements, taken in May, showed a large
expanse of the air above the northwestern United States choked with
fine soil dust blown in from Asia.
</P>
<P>
   On some days, it appears the imported dust accounted for as much
as two-thirds of the allowed standard for certain airborne
particulates, said John Merrill of the University of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've known that these materials can go a very, very long
way,'' he said, ``but this is the first time it's been documented
moving all way across the Pacific.''

   SELECTED POEMS: 1960-1990
</P>
<P>
   By Maxine Kumin. (Norton, $17.95.) This collection by a
versatile elegist and observer of nature features vivid poems that
are, refreshingly, about something: Many tell stories that serve to
preserve her family's history. Last year in the Book Review,
Richard Tillinghast called the book ``a welcome addition to any
poetry library.''
</P>
<P>
   A JOURNEY WITH ELSA CLOUD
</P>
<P>
   By Leila Hadley. (Penguin, $14.95.) Invited to India by her
estranged hippie daughter, a demanding, perfectionist mother
embarks on a voyage of self-discovery that takes her from New Delhi
to the home of the exiled Dalai Lama, with epiphanies and emotional
awakenings along the way. ``Hadley is a gifted travel writer with
an artist's eye for the composition _ and the look, smell and
history _ of every scene,'' Diane Johnson wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   IN INDIA: FROM MIDNIGHT TO THE MILLENNIUM
</P>
<P>
   By Shashi Tharoor. (Harper Perennial, $14.) An expatriate takes
a hard look at his country's first 50 years of independence, and
explains why parliamentary democracy has done so little to relieve
poverty, illiteracy and disease. ``Few books in recent years, if
any, offer such a comprehensive overview of what ails India, its
politicians and its people,'' John F. Burns said in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   FOUR LETTERS OF LOVE
</P>
<P>
   By Niall Williams. (Warner, $13.99.) The narrator of this tale
of romance and fate is a Dubliner whose search for one of his
artist father's paintings leads him into the arms of a young woman
on the Irish coast. Last year, reviewer Katharine Weber called the
novel ``a luminously written, magical work of fiction ... filled
with marvelous characters, large and small.''
</P>
<P>
   THE END OF THE NOVEL OF LOVE
</P>
<P>
   By Vivian Gornick. (Beacon, $12.) Examining the works of writers
like Willa Cather and Grace Paley, a critic argues that literature
has lost its faith in the transformative power of love. ``Gornick
makes forceful and dramatic judgments,'' Elizabeth Frank wrote in
1997. ``Reading her essays, one is reassured that the conversation
between life and literature is mutually sustaining as well as
mutually corrective.''
</P>
<P>
   THE MERRY HEART: REFLECTIONS ON READING, WRITING, AND THE WORLD
OF BOOKS By Robertson Davies. (Penguin, $14.95) A posthumous
collection of lectures and essays by the Canadian novelist on the
literary life and matters of humane concern. Last year, reviewer
Sven Birkerts said that even though much of his public prose is
less successful on the written page, ``Davies was a relaxed and
winning raconteur, a beguiling autocrat of the rostrum.''
</P>
<P>
   TRAIN WHISTLE GUITAR
</P>
<P>
   By Albert Murray. (Vintage International, $13.) This novel, just
restored to print, is about a black boy growing up in Alabama in
the 1920s and his idol, a blues guitarist named Luzana Cholly. In
1974, John Wideman admired the ``long passages of dialogue,
monologue, the lyric descriptions of countryside and fireside,
which are nothing so much as the riffs and choruses of a blues
artist translated into speech and action.''
</P>
<P>
   THE FILE: A PERSONAL HISTORY
</P>
<P>
   By Timothy Garton Ash. (Vintage, $13.) A British historian tells
how he found a blurred image of his younger self in an old East
German secret police file, and how he tracked down the people who
had informed on him. The result is ``a political thriller,
reminiscent of Graham Greene and John le Carr, and a treatise on
memory, forgetting and forgiving in the great tradition of
Proust,'' Tomas Venclova wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   HALLUCINATING FOUCAULT
</P>
<P>
   By Patricia Duncker. (Vintage International, $12.) This
intricate first novel focuses on a graduate student who tracks down
and falls in love with the subject of his dissertation, a French
novelist in an insane asylum. The result is ``a fascinating drama
of knowledge and power, reason and desire,'' Allen Lincoln wrote
last year.
</P>
<P>
   MURDER IN THE MUSEUM OF MAN
</P>
<P>
   By Alfred Alcorn. (Zoland, $13.) When a university dean is found
dead in the Museum of Man, the museum's courtly recording secretary
turns sleuth. The result is a ``stylish, occasionally fiendish
detective story ... out to skewer glitzy academic corruption,''
Nina Auerbach wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   TRUMAN CAPOTE: In Which Various Friends, Enemies, Acquaintances,
and Detractors Recall His Turbulent Career
</P>
<P>
   By George Plimpton. (Anchor/Doubleday, $16.95.) This chronicle
shows how the talented Capote turned fame into an art form, and
finally into a substitute for art itself. His lurid story is told
mostly through the firsthand accounts of fellow celebrities. In
1997 the reviewer, Julia Reed, found the book to be filled with old
gossip, but said ``some of the best bits reveal more about the
speaker than about the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   PILGRIMS
</P>
<P>
   By Elizabeth Gilbert. (Houghton Mifflin, $12.) Many of the
pilgrims in this first short-story collection are working-class
folks searching for redemption but skeptical of spiritual
enlightenment. The author ``embraces the bizarre and fabulous with
similar enthusiasm,'' Liam Callanan wrote in 1997. ``She moves
stealthily, avoiding the temptation to grandstand, moralize or,
especially, patronize.''

(bl) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Theodore Roosevelt plotted the beginning of the end
of John D. Rockefeller's oil empire at a secret meeting at the
White House on a summer night in 1906. Surrounded by his attorney
general and other key cabinet members, he mapped out the antitrust
suit against Standard Oil that prompted steel baron Henry Clay
Frick to complain on behalf of his fellow oligarchs, ``We bought
the son of a bitch, and then he didn't stay bought.''
</P>
<P>
   It took five years for Roosevelt's case to be won in the Supreme
Court, breaking up Standard Oil into 34 companies. And for the
better part of the next 70 years, Washington's economic agenda was
dominated by the high-stakes politics of curbing the power of big
enterprises: The regulatory zeal of the New Deal, the oil cartel
cases of the 1950s and '60s, the failed _ and now foolish-looking _
13-year pursuit of IBM, the breakup of the Bell System.
</P>
<P>
   But something has changed in Washington in the past decade or
so, something that has taken the issue that Woodrow Wilson called
``these vast aggregations of capital'' off the country's political
agenda, even as it lives on in courtroom arguments about the
legality of Microsoft's strategies to dominate the electronic
ether.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when two of the biggest remaining parts of the old
Rockefeller empire, Exxon and Mobil, were recombined in the world's
largest merger, Washington yawned. House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt, the pro-union, pro-consumer voice of the Democratic
Party's left wing, spent the day complaining loudly _ about the
Clinton impeachment inquiry, and he has yet to say anything about
the deal, according to his office. In fact, scarcely a politician
of any stripe headed for the cameras to question whether the $75
billion deal was good for the country, for workers or for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The same silence greeted the deal that created Citigroup, which
was the largest financial services company for a few minutes until
Deutsche Bank bought Bankers Trust Corp., earlier this month, and
Cargill Inc.'s move to snap up Continental Grain, one of the few
huge concerns that farmers could turn to if they didn't like the
prices Cargill was offering for their harvest.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, only steps away from the room where Roosevelt
held forth 92 years ago, was hardly pounding the podium. ``My
position on mergers,'' he said, ``has always been that if they
increase the competitiveness of the company and bring lower prices
and higher quality services to the consumers of our country, then
they are good; and if they don't, they aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's fence-sitting reflects the odd politics of an era of
prosperity tinged with uncertainty. A few years ago downsizing was
a brewing political issue; though layoffs continue _ last week the
Asian economic crisis claimed another 28,000 workers at Boeing _
job growth has been so strong that that the issue has been defused.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a decade ago, when Japanese corporations snapped up
New York's Rockefeller Center and two Hollywood studios, many in
Congress were in an uproar over the sale of American icons to
foreigners. But these days, with the Dow bobbing at record levels
and analysts declaring the triumph of American-style capitalism,
neither the Deutsche Bank acquisition or Daimler-Benz's purchase of
Chrysler Corp. last spring has yielded a similar furor.
</P>
<P>
   Many theories have been offered to explain this new passivity
about the evils of Big Everything: the pace of technological
change, or the realities of borderless competition in a year of
global tumult, or the confusing business currents that at once
celebrate the global reach of U.S.-based multinationals and the
entrepreneurial spirit of small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps it's just temporary _ if prices start going up again
at the pump, or if the U.S. economy falters, there could be a
renewed clamor to reign in corporations viewed as too big, too
powerful or too heartless. But whatever the reason, noted Sen. Paul
Wellstone, D-Minn., who is among the few in Congress still
exercised about the concentration of corporate power, ``Once upon a
time this was a burning issue, and now it's not even on the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's current antitrust case against Microsoft seems
at first blush be the notable exception: It's hard to turn on the
television these days without hearing about the company's supposed
scheme to dominate the Internet browser market, or its secret
strategies to flatten competitors. (Imagine the muck Ida Tarbell
could have raked with access to e-mail.)
</P>
<P>
   But among politicians, the case is rarely mentioned. No one ran
for office on a platform of Gates-bashing the way Roosevelt once
called Rockefeller's crowd ``the biggest criminals in the
country.'' At a rare high-profile hearing this year on the
long-term effect of mergers, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan argued that the government was inept at determining in
advance those mergers that would create competitive problems and
would be wiser to wait and see.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would feel very uncomfortable if we inhibited various
different types of mergers or acquisitions on the basis of some
presumed projection as to how markets would evolve, how technology
would evolve,'' he said, ``because history is strewn with people
making projections that have turned out to be grossly inaccurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's view was challenged at the hearing, chiefly by Joel
Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of antitrust, and
Robert Pitofsky, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission,
which will review the Exxon-Mobil merger and presumably force the
company to divest some assets. Pitofsky noted that undoing the
damage after employees of an acquired company have been fired,
after its plants have been closed and after top management has
moved on, ``is enormously expensive.''

   But the fact remains that few lawmakers dare to venture deep
into this territory, even though it sustained generations of their
predecessors. ``The biggest reason is the mix of money and
politics,'' says Wellstone, who is intensely focused on the issue
as he decides whether to run for his party's presidential
nomination. ``For both parties, these are the heavy hitters, the
monied interests who have a huge impact on the tenure of people in
Congress. Not too many people want to challenge them.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that was also true in Roosevelt's day, even if Frick
and other monopolists came to regret their support of the
president. But Wellstone notes a second reason: the quiet arrival
in Washington of ``a set of shared assumptions about what is
necessary these days for survival in a global economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The first is that while bigger is not always better, it may be
the only way to extend one's reach abroad. ``The ability to be a
global player and to be competitive anywhere in the world has
become more important as all the traditional walls of regulation,
state ownership and time barriers have come down,'' said Daniel
Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
</P>
<P>
   The second assumption is that technology moves faster than
antitrust cases. When the government began its push against IBM in
the late 1960s, the microprocessor had just been invented. By the
time the case was abandoned, the microprocessor was revolutionizing
the computer industry, and IBM was missing the boat. It caught up,
but market dominance was no longer an issue.
</P>
<P>
   And the breakup of the Bell System, while leading to lower
long-distance rates and helping to promote technological advances,
has also driven millions of consumers up the wall. For many, the
only thing more annoying than trying to figure out how to get a
phone fixed is answering dinner time calls from solicitors trying
to sign up customers for a new phone service nobody has ever heard
of.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, today's trust-busters are no longer politicians but
technocrats and regulators who, over the next few months, will be
reviewing neighborhood-by-neighborhood what to do about streets
that have both a Mobil and an Exxon station. Almost no one is
talking about blocking the merger itself, a merger that a decade
ago Exxon would not have dared to think possible.

 WASHINGTON: enormously expensive.''

   But the fact remains that few lawmakers dare to venture deep
into this territory, even though it sustained generations of their
predecessors. ``The biggest reason is the mix of money and
politics,'' says Wellstone, who is intensely focused on the issue
as he decides whether to run for his party's presidential
nomination. ``For both parties, these are the heavy hitters, the
monied interests who have a huge impact on the tenure of people in
Congress. Not too many people want to challenge them.''

FINDING A COMMON FOE, FRINGE GROUPS JOIN FORCES

(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frustrated and embittered by their failure to stop abortions _
and by a federal law protecting clinics _ fringes of the
anti-abortion movement are linking up with a new ally: the
right-wing militia movement.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by religious zeal and radicalized by events, these
splinters have adopted a violent, insurrectionary style that has
been associated with seven murders in the last six years. In much
the way gun control legislation mobilized the right-wing militias'
anti-government politics and the Vietnam War shaped the leftist
Weather Underground, these groups have formed a shadowy ``Army of
God,'' which is not so much an organization as a shared set of
ideas and enemies. In recent years this ``army'' has claimed
responsibility for scores of bombings and other attacks on abortion
clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Militia types have shown more and more interest in the
abortion issue, while the anti-abortionists are becoming more and
more militant and allying themselves with the militia movement,''
said Dallas Blanchard, chairman of the University of West Florida's
sociology department, who has written on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The overlapping of abortion with the anti-government agenda, say
law enforcement officials and researchers, is most clearly seen in
the case of Eric Rudolph, who is accused by the FBI of bombings at
the 1996 Olympics, a gay bar and an abortion clinic near Atlanta,
and the bombing this year of a Birmingham abortion clinic in which
an off-duty policeman acting as a guard was killed. Rudolph
disappeared into the North Carolina woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric Rudolph personifies the convergence of these issues,''
said Frederick Clarkson, author of a study for the Southern Poverty
Law Center on the ties between the anti-abortion fringe and the
militias. The Olympics, he said, represented ideas of
internationalism and racial integration _ the so-called New World
Order _ which are anathema to the extreme right, particularly to
the white supremacist, anti-Semitic Christian Identity movement.
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, the same conclusion is voiced on a fiercely
anti-abortion Internet Web site maintained by the Rev. David
Trosch, a Catholic priest in Mobile, Ala., who was one of the
signers of a ``justifiable homicide'' declaration in 1993 after the
first murder of an abortion provider, Dr. David Gunn.
</P>
<P>
   Listing the four bombings, Trosch's Web site declared: ``The
common link _ all of the bombings were against people highly
offensive to God.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, white supremacists calling themselves the Phineas
Priests robbed a bank and bombed a newspaper office and an abortion
clinic in Spokane, Wash. Larry Pratt, the head of Gun Owners of
America, who was a co-chairman of Pat Buchanan's 1996 presidential
campaign until his ties to militias and racist groups became known,
helped raise nearly $150,000 to pay the court fines and other debts
of Operation Rescue, the militant anti-abortion group. When the
authorities arrested the Arizona Patriots, another militia band,
they found plans to blow up hydroelectric dams, synagogues _ and
abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the vast majority of abortion opponents, many of whom
still conduct regular protests outside clinics, do not advocate or
condone murder. It is a small band of protesters, many of whom
hardened their beliefs in prison during the 1988 Operation Rescue
activities in Atlanta, who claim biblical justification for killing
abortion providers.
</P>
<P>
   The Operation Rescue protests of the late 1980s and early 1990s
represented a high-water mark for the radical anti-abortion
movement. Hundreds of demonstrators were arrested for weeks on end
as they tried to block clinic entrances in New York, Atlanta,
Wichita and other cities. But in 1994, Congress passed the Freedom
of Access to Clinic Entrances law, which made it a crime to
obstruct clinics and provided tough penalties if anyone was hurt
during demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics kept by the National Abortion Federation, a
pro-abortion group, show that the clinic blockades dropped off
sharply with the passage of the law to only 2 with 16 arrests this
year from a high of 201 with 12,358 arrests in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1993, there have been seven murders of doctors and
other clinic workers _ something previously unheard of _ along with
14 attempted murders and many incidents involving bombing, arson
and vandalism. In the latest, the sniper slaying of Dr. Barnett
Slepian near Buffalo, N.Y., in October, the FBI is seeking to
question James Kopp, a longtime itinerant protester with a Catholic
group called the Lambs of Christ. He is yet to be found.
</P>
<P>
   Neal Horsley, who maintains an anti-abortion Web site with a
logo of dripping blood and a list of doctors who perform abortions
_ their names are crossed out if they are killed _ blames the
federal law as ``the step that made it inevitable to see a
crescendo of violence.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government made up its mind to block any
nonviolent attempt to stop abortion,'' Horsley said in an
interview. ``The federal government literally drove men mad, moved
them to execute abortionists. When a federal monolithic government
begins to crush the rights of a minority, if the issues truly
matter, fighting men rise up and do the things fighting men do. In
the life and death struggle to stop this unjustified slaughter,
Christian men are looking down the barrel of a rifle.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Saporta, executive director of the National Abortion
Federation, a pro-abortion group, said: ``There has truly been an
evolution of violence. They started with peaceful demonstrations,
and then as the protesters became frustrated, to invasions and then
blockades, and then some became so frustrated they decided the only
way to stop abortions was to murder providers.''
</P>
<P>
   There are now Internet links between the Web site of the
neo-Nazi Aryan Nation and Horsley's Web site. And the anti-abortion
movement has its own underground literature of apocalyptic
revolutionary novels, similar to the ``Turner Diaries,'' which
inspired Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh. In one titled
``Rescue Platoon,'' protesters rise up against the government.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the anti-abortion movement has created its own
version of the milieu in which the far right operates, where
leaders _ mostly male _ set forth an ideology and scattered
individuals or small groups act on their own to carry it out. A
former Ku Klux Klan leader and prominent rightist, Louis Beame, has
called this strategy ``leaderless resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There clearly must be some underground network,'' said
Blanchard. ``It couldn't happen without a community of support.
They split into smaller and smaller groups, and as the groups got
smaller, they got more violent. They tend to limit their own group
_ becoming encapsulated, it's called _ and this does reinforce the
tendency to violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarkson and Chip Berlet, another researcher, said claims of
biblical justification for the killings come from three fringe
theological traditions: Christian reconstruction, which grew out of
conservative Protestant splinter groups, particularly
Presbyterianism, and seeks to establish a theocratic government;
apocalyptic Catholicism, and the racist, anti-Semitic Christian
Identity sects that view abortion as a threat to the propagation of
the white race.
</P>
<P>
   An undercurrent running through much of the violence is the
mysterious Army of God.
</P>
<P>
   The deadly Birmingham bombing attributed to Rudolph was claimed
in notes signed by the Army of God. Its underground manual gives
detailed instructions for attacking abortion clinics, including how
to manufacture homemade explosives and cut off doctor's hands or
thumbs; it also contains an effusive tribute to protesters using
their jail-house nicknames, including Kopp, who is called ``Atomic
Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who or what is the Army of God?'' Clarkson wrote in his study.
``That question has plagued investigators for years. Whether it is
a concept _ a handy moniker for whoever takes up the cause _ or a
permanent underground group is not yet clear.''

MASTERS OF JERSEY? WALL ST. SHUDDERS AT LIFE ACROSS THE RIVER. 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To the surprise of almost no one, the New York Stock
Exchange has agreed to stay in New York. Whether its well-heeled
officials really, truly, turn-blue-and-die meant their many threats
to move to New Jersey will probably never be known.
</P>
<P>
   After years of negotiations, the exchange finally muscled city
and state officials into coming up with $900 million in cash and
tax breaks for a new trading complex in lower Manhattan. The
exchange's board still has to vote, but by Friday, it was virtually
a done deal.
</P>
<P>
   But buckets of money aside, there are certain intangibles that
add up to a strong case that they were never really serious about
leaving. There are, after all, some things that you just can't put
a price on.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the name problem. The New Jersey Stock Exchange. The
Jersey City Stock Exchange. Actually, officials had anticipated
that problem long ago and secured the right to call themselves the
New York Stock Exchange wherever they might land. Still, there
would be the inevitable jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People use the phrase Wall Street around the world,'' said H.
Claude Shostal, president of the Regional Plan Association. ``It's
a brand name and a marketing image. It's Coca-Cola; it's Scotch
tape. The New York Stock Exchange would jeopardize its enormous
psychological and marketing value if it moved very far away from
Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies will move part of their operations to less
expensive space in New Jersey or elsewhere, Shostal said. For an
institution like the New York Stock Exchange, however, there is an
incalculable value in being in New York, where the financial
industry is concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Shostal made his living luring New York companies
to Jersey City for Cushman Realty. He jumped through hoops putting
together a deal to build a broadcasting headquarters for NBC in
Jersey City, only to see NBC snap up a $100 million tax break to
stay at Rockefeller Center. ``We knew Tom Brokaw was not going
anywhere,'' he said. ``The people in the bright red suspenders and
the silk ties are not going to go to Jersey City.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, New Jersey is off the beaten limo track. Could the
masters of the universe have handled the logistics? The trip from,
say, Greenwich would border on indignity. The train to Grand
Central, then the subway to Times Square, then a transfer to a
subway to Penn Station, a walk through the tunnels to get the Path
train for the trip under the Hudson River to Jersey City. Then a
taxi or who knows what to the new quarters.
</P>
<P>
   And could they really leave behind the headquarters of Morgan
Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Salomon Smith Barney, or
the restaurants, or the recognition of having made it in New York?
</P>
<P>
   Shostal did get Merrill Lynch to move several thousand back
office workers to Jersey City. But, he said, the tax breaks and
subsidies on either side of the river are merely icing on the cake.
``The vast majority of tenants locate where they need to for
business reasons,'' Shostal said. ``The bidding war between the
states is really a milking of the public sector, rather than a
determining factor in where they want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that the New York Stock Exchange, which
pays about $51 million a year in a variety of taxes, is cramped at
its 100-year-old home on Wall Street. On an average day, 680
million shares are traded on the market, up from 160 million 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Exchange chairman Richard Grasso, who lives on Long Island,
always maintained that he wanted to remain in New York. Yet, new
construction is always a difficult proposition in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In playing the relocation card, the Stock Exchange was no
different than Mercedes-Benz, Nebraska Beef, Intel Corp. or any
company that has pitted one state against another, from Alabama to
Maine and California. Corporate relocation has had as much to do
with the chairman's comfort as with economics. In a study of 38
companies that left Manhattan in the 1970s, urban planner William
Whyte found that 31 moved to within 8 miles of the chairman's home.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the flight to the suburbs ends in a crash landing.
Whyte found that 17 of the 38 departed companies were later bought
out or raided, or merged with a dominant partner. A majority posted
lower-than-average profits, while a comparable group of three dozen
major companies that remained behind saw their stock valuation jump
an average of 277 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But this is an old movie. In 1990, New Jersey offered to build
New York's five commodity exchanges a $100 million complex at the
Harborside Financial Center before New York offered a more generous
deal. Five years later, the Cotton Exchange signed a letter of
intent to move to New Jersey, but New York countered with a higher
bounty and the traders stayed put.
</P>
<P>
   Even the developers in New Jersey who talked to the the New York
Stock Exchange privately acknowledged long ago that they had little
chance of luring away the Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New
York University, said the New York Stock Exchange needs to be in
Manhattan to retain its crown as the world's largest equity market,
especially with Frank Zarb's Nasdaq moving to New York and merging
with the American Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Jersey may be a better place to live but it's not a better
place to work,'' said Moss. ``There is more of a chance of
schmoozing and acquiring random information in an hour in the
hallways, on the streets, at lunch or on the concourse at Grand
Central Terminal in New York than there is by spending a week in a
parking lot in New Jersey.''

MASTERS OF JERSEY? WALL ST. SHUDDERS AT LIFE ACROSS THE RIVER.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ To the surprise of almost no one, the New York Stock
Exchange has agreed to stay in New York. Whether its well-heeled
officials really, truly, turn-blue-and-die meant their many threats
to move to New Jersey will probably never be known.
</P>
<P>
   After years of negotiations, the exchange finally muscled city
and state officials into coming up with $900 million in cash and
tax breaks for a new trading complex in lower Manhattan. The
exchange's board still has to vote, but by Friday, it was virtually
a done deal.
</P>
<P>
   But buckets of money aside, there are certain intangibles that
add up to a strong case that they were never really serious about
leaving. There are, after all, some things that you just can't put
a price on.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the name problem. The New Jersey Stock Exchange. The
Jersey City Stock Exchange. Actually, officials had anticipated
that problem long ago and secured the right to call themselves the
New York Stock Exchange wherever they might land. Still, there
would be the inevitable jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People use the phrase Wall Street around the world,'' said H.
Claude Shostal, president of the Regional Plan Association. ``It's
a brand name and a marketing image. It's Coca-Cola; it's Scotch
tape. The New York Stock Exchange would jeopardize its enormous
psychological and marketing value if it moved very far away from
Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies will move part of their operations to less
expensive space in New Jersey or elsewhere, Shostal said. For an
institution like the New York Stock Exchange, however, there is an
incalculable value in being in New York, where the financial
industry is concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Shostal made his living luring New York companies
to Jersey City for Cushman Realty. He jumped through hoops putting
together a deal to build a broadcasting headquarters for NBC in
Jersey City, only to see NBC snap up a $100 million tax break to
stay at Rockefeller Center. ``We knew Tom Brokaw was not going
anywhere,'' he said. ``The people in the bright red suspenders and
the silk ties are not going to go to Jersey City.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, New Jersey is off the beaten limo track. Could the
masters of the universe have handled the logistics? The trip from,
say, Greenwich would border on indignity. The train to Grand
Central, then the subway to Times Square, then a transfer to a
subway to Penn Station, a walk through the tunnels to get the Path
train for the trip under the Hudson River to Jersey City. Then a
taxi or who knows what to the new quarters.
</P>
<P>
   And could they really leave behind the headquarters of Morgan
Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Salomon Smith Barney, or
the restaurants, or the recognition of having made it in New York?
</P>
<P>
   Shostal did get Merrill Lynch to move several thousand back
office workers to Jersey City. But, he said, the tax breaks and
subsidies on either side of the river are merely icing on the cake.
``The vast majority of tenants locate where they need to for
business reasons,'' Shostal said. ``The bidding war between the
states is really a milking of the public sector, rather than a
determining factor in where they want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that the New York Stock Exchange, which
pays about $51 million a year in a variety of taxes, is cramped at
its 100-year-old home on Wall Street. On an average day, 680
million shares are traded on the market, up from 160 million 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Exchange chairman Richard Grasso, who lives on Long Island,
always maintained that he wanted to remain in New York. Yet, new
construction is always a difficult proposition in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In playing the relocation card, the Stock Exchange was no
different than Mercedes-Benz, Nebraska Beef, Intel Corp. or any
company that has pitted one state against another, from Alabama to
Maine and California. Corporate relocation has had as much to do
with the chairman's comfort as with economics. In a study of 38
companies that left Manhattan in the 1970s, urban planner William
Whyte found that 31 moved to within 8 miles of the chairman's home.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the flight to the suburbs ends in a crash landing.
Whyte found that 17 of the 38 departed companies were later bought
out or raided, or merged with a dominant partner. A majority posted
lower-than-average profits, while a comparable group of three dozen
major companies that remained behind saw their stock valuation jump
an average of 277 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But this is an old movie. In 1990, New Jersey offered to build
New York's five commodity exchanges a $100 million complex at the
Harborside Financial Center before New York offered a more generous
deal. Five years later, the Cotton Exchange signed a letter of
intent to move to New Jersey, but New York countered with a higher
bounty and the traders stayed put.
</P>
<P>
   Even the developers in New Jersey who talked to the the New York
Stock Exchange privately acknowledged long ago that they had little
chance of luring away the Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New
York University, said the New York Stock Exchange needs to be in
Manhattan to retain its crown as the world's largest equity market,
especially with Frank Zarb's Nasdaq moving to New York and merging
with the American Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Jersey may be a better place to live but it's not a better
place to work,'' said Moss. ``There is more of a chance of
schmoozing and acquiring random information in an hour in the
hallways, on the streets, at lunch or on the concourse at Grand
Central Terminal in New York than there is by spending a week in a
parking lot in New Jersey.''

   MOSCOW _ They sell bread on the streets in Russia, from the
windows of little roadside kiosks identified by signs proclaiming a
single beloved word: bread. White bread, black bread, delicious
Georgian bread laced with cheese, braided loaves and loaves baked
in the shape of big brown domes, and much more. The average
Russian's consumption of baked goods rose 5 percent from 1990 to
1995. In 1996 he ate 143 pounds of bread _ 6.4 ounces every day,
365 days a year. Russians even have a saying: ``Bread is the
beginning of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   So why have they begun lately to eat less bread? The answer says
a lot about the state of Russia and its people. What it says most
is ``chaos.'' And not just bread, either: The entire Russian diet
is lurching through a perestroika that mirrors the bust-and-boom,
future-versus-past nature of the nation's economy and mentality.
</P>
<P>
   Like the country itself, Russian cuisine is a messy scene.
Russia today is a society caught somewhere between tiny torts
exquisitely topped with kiwi and a predominant national dessert,
the deep-fried apple. It is a place where subway vendors hawk cases
of Pringles to a population whose principal source of protein is
real potatoes, lifted fresh from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Russia wavers today between Tyson chicken, the pricey pinnacle
of frozen fowl displayed in better markets, and the plate of hot
sausage of indeterminate origin that was free when Leonid Brezhnev
was in charge. At the moment, sausage, boiled potato and fried
apple are in the ascendancy. Nationalism may be part of it;
Russians are bridling at Western influence over their culture and
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   But to the experts, the overwhelming factor is money. Russia and
Russians are broke, and prices are rising. The ruble lost
two-thirds of its value in a single week in August. Bread costs
more _ 10 percent of the average Russian's food bill, compared to 4
percent just a few years ago. It is enough to make some Russians
long for Brezhnev's steady socialist hand on the tiller, at least
until they remember the iron grip that came with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between today and the '80s,'' said Alexander
Baturin, deputy director of the Institute of Nutrition at the
Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, ``is that then the shelves
were empty, but people who could buy a bit of fish were satisfied.
It was enough. Today you can find almost everything in every store.
The question is whether people can afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   A relative few can. In prosperous Moscow, two Western-style
supermarkets stocking both Russian and European brands opened last
month alone. Given enough money, you can now buy Haagen-Dazs and
Tony's frozen pizza in Moscow. In a few places, one can even find a
real luxury _ fresh milk, from Finnish cows.
</P>
<P>
   But Muscovites are less than 10 percent of Russians. The rest of
the country briefly flirted with lowfat milk and skinned chicken
breasts and ugli fruit, now found even in parts of Siberia. But it
sleeps with traditional Russian cuisine, the comfort food that saw
it through Brezhnev and Gorbachev and, now, the lean years of Boris
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   This means fatty fried meats, fried potatoes, fried apples,
pancakes, cabbage soup topped with mayonnaise, fermented cabbage,
butter and dense black bread. And tea. Without milk, but perhaps
with a little jam. Preferably bought in bazaar-style markets, from
stalls crawling with live crawdads and dripping with cattle blood
and groaning with produce, none of it freshness-dated or
shrink-wrapped by clerks with plastic gloves.
</P>
<P>
   To a lot of Western palates, this tastes, well, heavy and
greasy. Heavy and greasy is the norm in a climate better suited to
reindeer than humans.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes greasy is good: glorious onion-and-hamburger-filled
pancakes, or blinis, that surely were lifted from White Castle
recipe banks; tasty vinaigrette salads of cabbage and carrots and
oil; a good borscht. The key word here is sometimes. The downside
of Russian cuisine is that it is not especially healthy; three
daily helpings of sausage is bad for the heart. Three daily
helpings of potatoes and bread can lead to obesity, and half of all
Russian adults are overweight.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does freedom from Communist shackles seem to have helped
much. Post-Communist Russia has been flooded with Western meats and
groceries _ up to half of all food sales _ yet a recent study by
one expert concluded that the vitamin content of Russian diets has
not appreciably improved. Virtually every Russian suffers from
vitamin deficiency. Among Russian children, half of whom do not
regularly drink milk, the shortage of B vitamins, which promote
bone growth, is catastrophic, Baturin says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our way of life is a violation of the norms from the very
beginning,'' said Yuna Popova, an administrator at the government's
premier center for treating food-related disorders.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that Russians ate better when the Kremlin
played mama, ordering its subjects to eat what was put in front of
them or go hungry. But turning the Russian diet over to the market
has been a mixed bag.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for instance, the free, hot lunch. Under Soviet rule,
virtually every factory and office worker got one, either free or
nearly so, as part of the state's cradle-to-grave package of social
benefits. In modern Russia, there is no such thing as a free lunch
_ and many people simply do not eat as a result. Most Russians eat
twice a day _ morning and late evening, Ms. Popova said.
</P>
<P>
   Skipping a meal could be seen as a good thing. A few years ago,
the average Russian packed away 3,000 calories a day by some
measures, a quarter more than is recommended. And the calorie
intake has dropped during the 1990s. But the dropped calories came
largely from costlier foods that are important to a healthy diet.
Baturin's institute periodically asks thousands of Russians about
their eating habits, and some conclusions are disturbing. Fruit
consumption dropped one-third between 1990 and 1995; meat,
one-quarter; vegetables, a fifth. Fish consumption was halved.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, less meat means less fat _ and some Russian doctors
point to that to explain a slow decline in heart ailments that
began in 1994. But it also has immediately led to an increase in
iron deficiencies among women; a third of pregnant women lack
enough iron. The decline in fruit consumption now means that 20
percent of Russians are critically low in vitamin C _ so low they
risk getting rickets.
</P>
<P>
   Cost is one factor, Baturin said, but another is inertia. Most
fruits and vegetables have never grown well in Russia; cabbage is
the primary source of vitamin C. People eat what they know. Just as
western Russians eschew one southern appetizer _ donkey-meat jerky
traditionally cured by several weeks beneath the saddle of a sweaty
horse (it tastes like a Slim Jim) _ others are repelled by sweet
peppers. Or artichokes. Or pears.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone. Baturin tells of coming across a report of
Russian family that loved pears, despite living in a remote
Siberian town where pears were uncommon. Delighted by their healthy
eating habits, he decided to find out what led them to add fruit to
their diet. The answer was simple and telling. The husband was
jobless; the wife worked but had not been paid in months. To
survive, they unloaded fruit trucks _ and were paid part of their
salary in castoff pears.

 By JILL ABRAMSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Richard Nixon's political advisers were eerily
prescient when they named his 1972 campaign organization the
Committee to Re-elect the President: It wasn't too long before his
critics dubbed it CREEP, a moniker that proved hard to shake,
especially after the Watergate break-in.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, when nearly everything in politics is market-tested by
polls, focus groups and consultants, it would be unthinkable for a
presidential candidate to blunder into an acronym like CREEP.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., who is flirting with another
run for president in 2000. The wholesome, uplifting name Kerrey
chose for his political action committee, Building America's
Conscience &AMP; Kids PAC, has an equally wholesome and uplifting (and
even cute) acronym, BACKPAC.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance experts estimate that to be competitive in
2000, presidential candidates will need to raise a minimum of $22
million _ or $50,000 a day _ before the selection of delegates
begins in early 2000. So the hopefuls are building war chests even
before they declare their candidacies, and most are turning to
political action committees to raise money. Like corporations,
labor unions and advocacy groups, congressional leaders and
prospective presidential candidates are allowed to operate such
groups under federal election law.
</P>
<P>
   In today's fund-raising frenzy, candidates and organizations
have to be increasingly inventive in thinking up ways to separate
donors from their money. Although the evidence is anecdotal, there
are signs that patriotic, optimistic or catchy names help political
action committees raise more cash. Emily's List, for example, whose
memorable name stands for Early Money Is Like Yeast, has become the
biggest PAC of them all, raising money for women candidates in
congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like to identify themselves with positive terms such as
hope, future and family,'' said Larry Sabato, a professor of
government at the University of Virginia. ``Would you rather give
to Americans for Hope Growth and Opportunity or the Committee for
Steve Forbes?''
</P>
<P>
   Americans for Hope Growth and Opportunity is the name chosen by
Forbes for the nonprofit group he founded to raise money and help
promote his free-market agenda. ``The name is his mantra,'' said
Joel Rosenberg, an aide to Forbes, the wealthy publisher who made a
surprisingly strong showing in his upstart bid for the Republican
nomination in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a bit of a mouthful, Rosenberg conceded. ``Some of us
said the name was going to be hard to fit around a mug,'' he said.
But Forbes liked it, and the organization has managed to pull in an
impressive $13 million from 140,000 donors.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who also ran for the Republican
nomination in 1996, has two committees: Campaign for a New American
Century and We the Parents. According to an aide, Brian Kennedy,
Alexander chose the names himself. In fact, aides to all of the
prospective 2000 candidates insist that their bosses chose their
PAC names themselves without the help of polls or consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander already had a PAC from 1996, the Republican Fund for
the '90s, but that wouldn't do for 2000, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is for Republicans to provide leadership for the
new American century, so that's how he picked the name,'' Kennedy
explained. We the Parents, he added, was chosen because of
Alexander's desire to put ``government and schools and the culture
on the side of parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, a conservative leader making his first bid for
national office, chose Campaign for Working Families. ``It
underscores our Main Street focus,'' said Tim Goeglein, a spokesman
for Bauer. The PAC has already pulled in millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   So far Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic front-runner,
hasn't set up a committee for 2000. In the most recent election
cycle, though, the vice president set up a PAC on behalf of
Congressional candidates that was blandly named ``Leadership '98''
(Friends of Albert Gore Jr. Inc.). As for this time around, ``We're
more concerned with the purpose than the name,'' said Marla Romash,
a political adviser to Gore.

   WASHINGTON _ Richard Nixon's political advisers were eerily
prescient when they named his 1972 campaign organization the
Committee to Re-elect the President: It wasn't too long before his
critics dubbed it CREEP, a moniker that proved hard to shake,
especially after the Watergate break-in.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, when nearly everything in politics is market-tested by
polls, focus groups and consultants, it would be unthinkable for a
presidential candidate to blunder into an acronym like CREEP.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., who is flirting with another
run for president in 2000. The wholesome, uplifting name Kerrey
chose for his political action committee, Building America's
Conscience &AMP; Kids PAC, has an equally wholesome and uplifting (and
even cute) acronym, BACKPAC.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance experts estimate that to be competitive in
2000, presidential candidates will need to raise a minimum of $22
million _ or $50,000 a day _ before the selection of delegates
begins in early 2000. So the hopefuls are building war chests even
before they declare their candidacies, and most are turning to
political action committees to raise money. Like corporations,
labor unions and advocacy groups, congressional leaders and
prospective presidential candidates are allowed to operate such
groups under federal election law.
</P>
<P>
   In today's fund-raising frenzy, candidates and organizations
have to be increasingly inventive in thinking up ways to separate
donors from their money. Although the evidence is anecdotal, there
are signs that patriotic, optimistic or catchy names help political
action committees raise more cash. Emily's List, for example, whose
memorable name stands for Early Money Is Like Yeast, has become the
biggest PAC of them all, raising money for women candidates in
congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like to identify themselves with positive terms such as
hope, future and family,'' said Larry Sabato, a professor of
government at the University of Virginia. ``Would you rather give
to Americans for Hope Growth and Opportunity or the Committee for
Steve Forbes?''
</P>
<P>
   Americans for Hope Growth and Opportunity is the name chosen by
Forbes for the nonprofit group he founded to raise money and help
promote his free-market agenda. ``The name is his mantra,'' said
Joel Rosenberg, an aide to Forbes, the wealthy publisher who made a
surprisingly strong showing in his upstart bid for the Republican
nomination in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a bit of a mouthful, Rosenberg conceded. ``Some of us
said the name was going to be hard to fit around a mug,'' he said.
But Forbes liked it, and the organization has managed to pull in an
impressive $13 million from 140,000 donors.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who also ran for the Republican
nomination in 1996, has two committees: Campaign for a New American
Century and We the Parents. According to an aide, Brian Kennedy,
Alexander chose the names himself. In fact, aides to all of the
prospective 2000 candidates insist that their bosses chose their
PAC names themselves without the help of polls or consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander already had a PAC from 1996, the Republican Fund for
the '90s, but that wouldn't do for 2000, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is for Republicans to provide leadership for the
new American century, so that's how he picked the name,'' Kennedy
explained. We the Parents, he added, was chosen because of
Alexander's desire to put ``government and schools and the culture
on the side of parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, a conservative leader making his first bid for
national office, chose Campaign for Working Families. ``It
underscores our Main Street focus,'' said Tim Goeglein, a spokesman
for Bauer. The PAC has already pulled in millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   So far Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic front-runner,
hasn't set up a committee for 2000. In the most recent election
cycle, though, the vice president set up a PAC on behalf of
Congressional candidates that was blandly named ``Leadership '98''
(Friends of Albert Gore Jr. Inc.). As for this time around, ``We're
more concerned with the purpose than the name,'' said Marla Romash,
a political adviser to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Some PAC names are unabashedly direct, like the recently created
Friends of Newt Gingrich. Others strive for a can-do flavor; last
spring, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani unveiled Solutions
America, a national organization to finance his out-of-state travel
and give money to other Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Some groups don't need stirring acronyms or language to stand
out in the crowd: In the last election cycle, a PAC set up to
defeat the effort by former Rep. Bob Dornan, R-Calif., to regain
his House seat called itself The Deranged One Has Been Dumped

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Most wars in Africa since the end
of colonialism have been civil wars. Even though their borders were
drawn by Victorian imperialists, African states have generally kept
their armies inside them, no matter how flagrantly those long-dead
European males ignored tribal affinities and natural landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Congo, the huge central African country formerly
known as Zaire, is changing all that. Troops from as far south as
Namibia and as far north as Chad are fighting inside the vast
equatorial basin of the Congo River. Would-be presidents, waiting
to step forward if Laurent Kabila is overthrown, are preening in
hotel rooms from Cape Town to Brussels. Mining companies from South
Africa to Canada are holding their breaths _ and checkbooks _
waiting to see how things turn out.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Congo is a single country in name only. Because the
interior is so impassable and the hinterlands so ungovernable, it
has functioned for years like three _ the east imports and sells
through Uganda and Kenya, while the south does so through Zambia
and South Africa; only the west and the interior answer to the
capital, Kinshasa. Now, this war is threatening to make the
informal state of affairs into a formal division.
</P>
<P>
   Every force in the Congo fights for a different reason. Sadly,
greed and hatred are the two strongest.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, what has developed is a tribal war along lines
that are almost biblical _ rulers from Nilotic ethnic groups in
Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda against Bantu peoples of central and
southern Africa in league with Arab rulers of northern Chad and
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   But the old adage ``the enemy of my enemy is my friend'' also
applies. The Sudan is involved, for example, because it hates
Uganda, which supports guerrillas in southern Sudan. Zimbabwe and
Namibia say they are defending Congo's sovereignty, but they are
reported to have been promised mining deals by Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   In brief, with Congo as weak as it is, it is simply too big, too
central and too rich in resources for its neighbors not to encroach
on. And the deeper some go in, the more likely their rivals are to
join the fray. The war has become a continent-wide free-for-all.
</P>
<P>
   By various estimates, Kabila started with some 15,000 effective
troops, half of whom defected to the other side. He is aided by
6,000 Zimbabweans, perhaps 5,000 Angolans, 3,000 Sudanese and
Chadians and 300 Namibians. The war also reflects the ethnic split
between central Africa's Tutsi and Hutu groups. Up to 12,000 poorly
organized Hutus, chased out of Rwanda in 1994, are said to be
helping him, even though his own Tutsi-led forces slaughtered
fellow Hutus in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Arrayed against them are an unknown but probably larger force of
rebels. Many of these are Banyamulenge Tutsis who were born in
Congo but were denied citizenship both by the former dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko and by Kabila. These Tutsi are backed by Rwandans
and Ugandans fighting to defeat Hutu raiders based in eastern
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides use Soviet-bloc weapons, but the rebels are said to
have better U.S. communications gear.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the scale of fighting must be kept in mind. The former
Zaire is about the same size as the portion of today's United
States that was involved in the American Civil War, and its
population, 40 million, is roughly the same as that of the Union
and Confederacy combined. But while 2.9 million Americans on both
sides were under arms between 1861 and 1865, the whole of Congo is
being fought over by fewer than 70,000 men.
</P>
<P>
   What they are fighting is only barely a mechanized war. Tanks
were used briefly in the far west, some Zimbabwean and Angolan jets
have bombed rebels and the most dramatic move of the war was the
hijacking of three cargo planes to carry rebels 1,300 miles from
the eastern border to the Atlantic for an abortive assault on
Kinshasa. Mostly, though, it is a war of men slogging down dirt
roads with AK-47s, sometimes helping armored cars through the mud.
When Zimbabwe claimed recently to have bombed a ``rebel supply
column,'' it said the column comprised 1,500 cattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forces in Congo have to be small _ they're living off the
local population, stealing food and extorting money,'' said Richard
Cornwell, a South African military historian. ``The units aren't
really a coherent force, and there isn't really a front line. It's
more like a series of dots with skirmish lines blocking the
roads.''
</P>
<P>
   Looting is endemic. Angolan troops, Cornwell said, agreed to
fight only in return for booty, and cargo planes are flying home
their gains, including cars and refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   And even if a winner emerges, ruling Congo is no piece of cake.
Poverty, illiteracy and disease are endemic. There are rich lodes
of diamonds, gold, cobalt and copper, but millions of dollars worth
of equipment and roads are needed to extract them. The Belgians
profited here in the early part of the century, but they governed
only through astonishing brutality; at one time, piles of preserved
hands bore witness to the policy that a quota of villagers had to
be killed to maintain rule by terror. Then, in the 1970s, '80s and
'90s, Mobutu amassed an immense fortune but ignored his desperate
people until Kabila's forces overthrew him last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is some pressure for peace. Zimbabwe, facing
bankruptcy, can ill afford to stay. Angola needs its troops at home
as its 25-year-old guerrilla war flares anew. Discontent with the
war has been voiced in Uganda. And even if other countries, greedy
for Congo's underground wealth, keep interfering, they cannot win
more than a hollow victory. Mining contracts are worthless without
a guarantee of political stability, which neither side can deliver.
</P>
<P>
   So there have been rumors of cease-fires, the latest reports of
an impending truce having come just last week. But not once have
all members of both sides sat down to talk. Until that happens,
Congo's flaws will still make it as prone to fracture as its fabled
gems.

GRAY AREA: CONGRESSIONAL RESOLUTION OF CENSURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In June, the House of Representatives voted to
condemn, by name, the three white men in Texas who were charged
with murdering a black man by dragging him behind a pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   This was one of dozens of resolutions adopted in the 105th
Congress expressing the approval or disapproval of lawmakers. Other
resolutions involved happy matters, like the one congratulating
Mark McGwire on breaking the home-run record; grave ones, like the
one expressing condolences to the families of those killed in the
bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and matters
over which the Congress has no control, like the one urging
President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many Republicans who had no compunction about voting to
express strong opinions on these far-flung topics say now that
Congress has no business passing a resolution censuring President
Clinton for personal conduct that the lawmakers find deplorable.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the majority whip, who has
been on television day after day arguing for impeachment and
against censure, say that censure would be unconstitutional because
the Constitution does not specifically give Congress the authority
to punish the president in any manner other than impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's opponents also argue that censure would be a
meaningless slap on the wrist, particularly in the case of a
president who seems to have a limitless capacity to endure shame,
and would not address adequately the disgrace they feel he has
brought to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   To many politicians, the arguments against censure seem
preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be strange,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., if
lawmakers could freely pass resolutions stating their views on
almost every kind of behavior but not on conduct ``that has
threatened the Clinton presidency and stirred broad and deep
emotions among the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in most cases, congressional expressions of opinion _
whether in resolutions about new baseball legends or corrupt
African dictators _ are in fact meaningless, even frivolous. There
have been instances, however, when resolutions stating the views of
Congress have indeed carried weight.
</P>
<P>
   The Gulf of Tonkin resolution of 1964 was used for years by
supporters of the Vietnam War as evidence of congressional
concurrence with the military commitment. Similarly, the Persian
Gulf resolution of 1991 was seen as a stamp of bipartisan political
approval of the war against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution explicitly directs Congress to discipline its
own members, and the House and Senate have passed censure
resolutions occasionally over the years. Sometimes, as in the case
of Sen. Thomas Dodd, D-Conn., in 1967 or Sen. Dave Durenberger,
R-Minn., in 1990, both of whom were reproached for ethical lapses,
the action had little consequence other than to dissuade relatively
obscure politicians from running for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate's condemnation of Sen. Joseph McCarthy, R-Wis.,
in 1954 for conduct that brought ``the Senate into dishonor and
disrepute'' marked the end of an era of what the Senate called
distortions and misrepresentations, sent one of the most dominant
political figures of his time packing and led to a Democratic
majority that lasted 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   And the House's vote last year to reprimand and fine Speaker
Newt Gingrich for ethical violations was an indication that seeds
of opposition to Gingrich were sprouting among his troops.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., argues that an official, public censure
would indeed be a severe blow to someone like Bill Clinton, who
worries about his place in history.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the underlying reason for the opposition to censure
among most Republicans in the House is neither the constitutional
question nor the issue of whether the punishment would be
meaningful. It is that DeLay and most of his fellow Republicans in
the House are determined to press ahead with a vote on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   If censure becomes an option, it could drain votes from their
cause. Rep. Bill Paxon, R-N.Y., called censure ``nothing more than
a political out.'' That, presumably, is why Rep. Bob Livingston,
R-La., the speaker-designate, will not say whether he will even
allow a vote on it.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, many politicians agree, censure is the most likely
outcome. There may not be enough votes in the House for
impeachment. There certainly is not the two-thirds majority needed
in the Senate for conviction. And if Congress fails to remove the
president from office, many Democrats as well as Republicans will
still want an official way to express their disapproval of his
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard to envision how Congress gets from here to there.
The waters are uncharted.
</P>
<P>
   The only time a president has been censured or otherwise
officially reproached by Congress was in 1834 when the Senate voted
to denounce President Andrew Jackson in a policy dispute involving
the removal of the secretary of the Treasury. The resolution did
not actually contain the word censure, but most authorities treat
the vote as amounting to the same thing. The resolution was revoked
three years later when Jackson allies gained control of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, Congress considered censuring several other
presidents, and censure resolutions involving lower-ranking
executive branch officials were adopted by the House in a few
instances. But until now, no censure resolution against someone
other than a member of Congress has been seriously discussed in
this century.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the paltry record of precedents, a small band of
moderate Republican representatives opposed to impeachment, led by
King, assembled a censure proposal last week and circulated it at
the White House to get the president's reaction. The measure would
condemn his conduct, require him to acknowledge that he had
deceived the American people and impose a fine. The authors
described it as a way short of impeachment to express Congress'
disapproval and prevent the president from getting off unpunished.
Democrats worked on their own censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Censure could take the form of a concurrent resolution, meaning
that it would express the views of Congress but not require the
president's signature. Or it could be a joint resolution, a measure
resembling an ordinary bill, which would be approved in identical
form by the House and Senate and signed by the president and thus
carry the force of law.
</P>
<P>
   The Tonkin Gulf and Persian Gulf measures were joint
resolutions, and some lawmakers who favor censure see a parallel
here.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war, just
as it gives Congress the power to impeach. These resolutions were
steps short of a declaration of war, just as censure would be a
step short of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The White House would not discuss its reaction to these
proposals other than to say, as the press spokesman Joe Lockhart
did Friday, that the president's advisers were ``aggressively
listening.'' But the discussions were a clear indication that the
president was interested in a back channel as an alternative to
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Most authorities agree that Congress cannot require the
president to pay a financial penalty. To do so would be a bill of
attainder, a legislative punishment of an individual, which is
forbidden by the Constitution. So the president would have to agree
to the fine.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there would be no one to challenge its legitimacy. The
question is, if the president goes along, would it really amount to
punishment?

GRAY AREA: CONGRESSIONAL RESOLUTION OF CENSURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In June, the House of Representatives voted to
condemn, by name, the three white men in Texas who were charged
with murdering a black man by dragging him behind a pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   This was one of dozens of resolutions adopted in the 105th
Congress expressing the approval or disapproval of lawmakers. Other
resolutions involved happy matters, like the one congratulating
Mark McGwire on breaking the home-run record; grave ones, like the
one expressing condolences to the families of those killed in the
bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and matters
over which the Congress has no control, like the one urging
President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many Republicans who had no compunction about voting to
express strong opinions on these far-flung topics say now that
Congress has no business passing a resolution censuring President
Clinton for personal conduct that the lawmakers find deplorable.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the majority whip, who has
been on television day after day arguing for impeachment and
against censure, say that censure would be unconstitutional because
the Constitution does not specifically give Congress the authority
to punish the president in any manner other than impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's opponents also argue that censure would be a
meaningless slap on the wrist, particularly in the case of a
president who seems to have a limitless capacity to endure shame,
and would not address adequately the disgrace they feel he has
brought to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   To many politicians, the arguments against censure seem
preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be strange,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., if
lawmakers could freely pass resolutions stating their views on
almost every kind of behavior but not on conduct ``that has
threatened the Clinton presidency and stirred broad and deep
emotions among the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in most cases, congressional expressions of opinion _
whether in resolutions about new baseball legends or corrupt
African dictators _ are in fact meaningless, even frivolous. There
have been instances, however, when resolutions stating the views of
Congress have indeed carried weight.
</P>
<P>
   The Gulf of Tonkin resolution of 1964 was used for years by
supporters of the Vietnam War as evidence of congressional
concurrence with the military commitment. Similarly, the Persian
Gulf resolution of 1991 was seen as a stamp of bipartisan political
approval of the war against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution explicitly directs Congress to discipline its
own members, and the House and Senate have passed censure
resolutions occasionally over the years. Sometimes, as in the case
of Sen. Thomas Dodd, D-Conn., in 1967 or Sen. Dave Durenberger,
R-Minn., in 1990, both of whom were reproached for ethical lapses,
the action had little consequence other than to dissuade relatively
obscure politicians from running for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate's condemnation of Sen. Joseph McCarthy, R-Wis.,
in 1954 for conduct that brought ``the Senate into dishonor and
disrepute'' marked the end of an era of what the Senate called
distortions and misrepresentations, sent one of the most dominant
political figures of his time packing and led to a Democratic
majority that lasted 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   And the House's vote last year to reprimand and fine Speaker
Newt Gingrich for ethical violations was an indication that seeds
of opposition to Gingrich were sprouting among his troops.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., argues that an official, public censure
would indeed be a severe blow to someone like Bill Clinton, who
worries about his place in history.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the underlying reason for the opposition to censure
among most Republicans in the House is neither the constitutional
question nor the issue of whether the punishment would be
meaningful. It is that DeLay and most of his fellow Republicans in
the House are determined to press ahead with a vote on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   If censure becomes an option, it could drain votes from their
cause. Rep. Bill Paxon, R-N.Y., called censure ``nothing more than
a political out.'' That, presumably, is why Rep. Bob Livingston,
R-La., the speaker-designate, will not say whether he will even
allow a vote on it.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, many politicians agree, censure is the most likely
outcome. There may not be enough votes in the House for
impeachment. There certainly is not the two-thirds majority needed
in the Senate for conviction. And if Congress fails to remove the
president from office, many Democrats as well as Republicans will
still want an official way to express their disapproval of his
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard to envision how Congress gets from here to there.
The waters are uncharted.
</P>
<P>
   The only time a president has been censured or otherwise
officially reproached by Congress was in 1834 when the Senate voted
to denounce President Andrew Jackson in a policy dispute involving
the removal of the secretary of the Treasury. The resolution did
not actually contain the word censure, but most authorities treat
the vote as amounting to the same thing. The resolution was revoked
three years later when Jackson allies gained control of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, Congress considered censuring several other
presidents, and censure resolutions involving lower-ranking
executive branch officials were adopted by the House in a few
instances. But until now, no censure resolution against someone
other than a member of Congress has been seriously discussed in
this century.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the paltry record of precedents, a small band of
moderate Republican representatives opposed to impeachment, led by
King, assembled a censure proposal last week and circulated it at
the White House to get the president's reaction. The measure would
condemn his conduct, require him to acknowledge that he had
deceived the American people and impose a fine. The authors
described it as a way short of impeachment to express Congress'
disapproval and prevent the president from getting off unpunished.
Democrats worked on their own censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Censure could take the form of a concurrent resolution, meaning
that it would express the views of Congress but not require the
president's signature. Or it could be a joint resolution, a measure
resembling an ordinary bill, which would be approved in identical
form by the House and Senate and signed by the president and thus
carry the force of law.
</P>
<P>
   The Tonkin Gulf and Persian Gulf measures were joint
resolutions, and some lawmakers who favor censure see a parallel
here.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war, just
as it gives Congress the power to impeach. These resolutions were
steps short of a declaration of war, just as censure would be a
step short of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The White House would not discuss its reaction to these
proposals other than to say, as the press spokesman Joe Lockhart
did Friday, that the president's advisers were ``aggressively
listening.'' But the discussions were a clear indication that the
president was interested in a back channel as an alternative to
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Most authorities agree that Congress cannot require the
president to pay a financial penalty. To do so would be a bill of
attainder, a legislative punishment of an individual, which is
forbidden by the Constitution. So the president would have to agree
to the fine.
</P>

punishment?

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Espy case another indictment against independent
counsels
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can the independent counsel law survive the wipeout that saw a
jury blow off all 30 counts brought against former Agriculture
Secretary Mike Espy? Prosecutor Donald Smaltz was reduced, for
justification, to claiming indictment alone sends a cautionary
message to public officials. Well, yes, in the way that torturing
their innocent has always had a marvelously pacifying effect on
targeted audiences. The Inquisitors knew.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel law is up for renewal next year and
already was tottering under the outlandishness of Kenneth Starr's
permanent investigation of all things Clinton. Smaltz's grotesque
performance could be the last straw.
</P>
<P>
   Espy, in effect, continued acting the congressman he had long
been when he moved into President Clinton's Cabinet. He accepted,
as he should not have, perks and favors from food companies his
department regulated and was rightly squeezed out for it. Smaltz
aggregated the value of the small-time goodies as $33,000 and
barraged Espy with 38 felony charges, but even before the issues
went to trial, it was clear that this, at best, was a case of gross
over-charging.
</P>
<P>
   Espy's ``crimes'' included limo rides, invitations to parties,
hitchhiking on a company jet, taking a couple of NFL tickets from a
natural history museum in Atlanta to attend a Smokey Bear promotion
that fizzled, and the like. The trial judge threw eight of the
charges out, and the jury wasted little time on the rest. Espy's
lawyers didn't even bother to put on a defense; the prosecution's
own witnesses had testified Espy was an independent secretary who
made decisions contrary to the interests of his casual benefactors.
</P>
<P>
   Smaltz had tried to weave a hanging rope out of small threads
and loose ends _ and spent four years and $17 million doing it. He
points, for further justification, to some 20 convictions and $11
million in fines from implicated agribusinesses, but one key case,
against Sun-Diamond Growers of California, is under appeal and some
companies _ Tyson Foods, for instance _ look to have pleaded guilty
mainly to cut their losses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Starr, five more independent counsels are aprowl
in Washington. One will soon take former Housing Secretary Henry
Cisneros to trial on 18 counts having mainly to do with his
under-reporting _ not denial, mind you _ under-reporting of how
much he paid a former lover.
</P>
<P>
   This has all become quite lunatic, and Republicans are pushing
for still more special prosecutors to investigate Clinton campaign
funding. Easy for them to say. Auditors for the bipartisan Federal
Elections Commission recommend holding the Dole campaign to even
larger account _ $17 million to $7 million _ than the Clinton
campaign for 1996's excess, but the special prosecutor law wouldn't
kick in against Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   The law has become a gimmick for endless partisan harassment by
prosecutors without time and budget restraints or effective
supervision. If Congress can craft a replacement with higher
thresholds and sharp accountability, fine, but if not, well, the
old sport of throwing the rascals out didn't work all that badly.

<P>
   As the years pass, the number of survivors of the Japanese
attack on Pearl Harbor dwindles. The strike, on the quiet Sunday
morning of Dec. 7, 1941, killed 2,403 of the 65,000 people
stationed at the base.
</P>
<P>
   One survivor, Henry A. Lachenmayer, of Oxon Hill, Md., recorded
his thoughts and observations, including rumors that turned out to
be false, in his diary the next day. Lachenmayer says he wrote his
account on a Royal portable typewriter, long since gone, which he
kept in his berth aboard the battleship Pennsylvania. He says he
made the entry on pages that he stored in a typing book that zipped
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Lachenmayer, who moved to the Bronx from Germany as a child, was
a 22-year-old musician second class at the time of Pearl Harbor. He
doubled as a medic when bombs raked the Pennsylvania, but not
before having the presence of mind to stow his trombone.
Lachenmayer, now 79, retired from the Navy in 1960 after having
risen to the rank of band master aboard the battleship Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from his diary, adapted from a longer
version that appeared in 1991 in his local newspaper, The
Enquirer-Gazette in Upper Marlboro, Md.

</P>
<P>
   It was Sunday again, you might say just another Sunday, but to
us in the fleet it meant more than that, it meant the one day of
the week that granted us true relaxation, the one day apart from
drills maneuvered and work of all sorts. A day for church, and a
day for play.
</P>
<P>
   We, the band on the Pennsylvania, had a strenuous day on
Saturday. A landing force inspection in the morning and a dance
band contest in the evening which, incidentally, we won. We were
still speaking of this same contest the next morning as we heard
band call go at 10 minutes of 8 and we proceeded to the quarter
deck in preparation for morning colors. . . .
</P>
<P>
   At exactly three minutes of eight, looking over toward the Naval
Air Station on Ford Island, we could see a group of planes
proceeding gently from a high altitude and then leveling off about
150 feet from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   To our unsuspecting eyes it was just another drill, though it
was somewhat peculiar that they would pick Sunday morning for
maneuvering. Not until we saw the flames shoot out of the large
hangar at the head of the small island did we realize the
significance of the situation.
</P>

station, where he helped put out a fire ignited by an explosion in
the main deck and in the case mate, the enclosure where
anti-aircraft shells were stored: (END ITALICS HERE)

<P>
   The bandmaster marched us back on the double and the officer of
the deck screamed for all hands to man their air defense stations.
. . .
</P>
<P>
   A plane that looked half like a Stuka and half like one of our
own dive bombers was just leveling off and I could see the bombs
dropping out of its bottom. It was a silver-gray plane with a
reddish gold ball or sun painted on its side. I still don't know
how I got my instrument in my case and back to the shelf in the
band room but I must have made Superman's speed look amateurish. By
this time all hands were manning their battle stations and I
proceeded towards mine, stopping on the way to get my gas mask.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at my station, which incidentally is the second deck
patrol and repair station where I am a stretcher bearer, I
commenced the process of . . . closing all ports and hatches which
would be highly detrimental if left open. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Down below once more, I was asked by an ensign to assist him in
reaching some of the officers on shore leave by telephone and this
was my job for the next half hour. I succeeded in reaching
Commander Holden, who almost refused to believe the inevitable but
once convinced, arrived on board ship with the greatest of speed.
</P>
<P>
   For the next part I returned to my station and found work
enough; a fire had broken out on the second deck and had to be
attended to with haste. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The fire was precipitated by the bursting of a 500-pound bomb in
the case mate and the main deck. The havoc created by this one bomb
hit can never be exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   All our fire extinguishers were used up in no time. . . . Due to
the cooperation of all hands concerned, the fire was eventually put
out. . . .

   Ahead of us in dry dock were two destroyers also under repair,
despite their wonderful barrage and cooperation; (they fought like
wild cats) a number of bomb hits were scored and their crews were
forced to abandon. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Directly aft of us, moored at ten-ten dock, were the U.S.S.
Oglala and the U.S.S. Helena. These two vessels, the former a mine
layer and the latter one of our latest 10,000-ton cruisers, were
tied or moored together. An enemy torpedo plane headed directly for
the Oglala . . . and launched its torpedo. The old ship, severely
injured, immediately turned on its side, and sank.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the harbor . . . our battleships were
receiving a merciless pounding. The U.S.S. Arizona received two
bomb hits amidship and a great number of torpedoes. She split in
half and her forward magazines burst. Directly forward of her, the
U.S.S. Oklahoma received many torpedo hits and capsized.
</P>
<P>
   Next to her the U.S.S. West Virginia received a tremendous
amount of bomb hits and her whole port battery was wiped out. . . .
The U.S.S. Tennessee stood up fairly, or rather, remarkably well
considering the pounding she took. The U.S.S. Maryland stood as
solid as a piece of granite and fought the enemy. She remained in
one piece.
</P>
<P>
   Directly forward of the Maryland, though some distance away . .
., the U.S.S. California received torpedo hits and listed on her
port side. The U.S.S. Nevada, in a daring attempt to reach the open
sea through the channel, was torpedoed and her wary skipper
grounded her on the right side of the harbor in order to keep the
channel clear.
</P>
<P>
   One destroyer in the floating dry dock on our starboard was hit
and went on fire, burning right at the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)The human toll was horrific.(END ITALICS

</P>
<P>
   Now to the casualties, and I write this with a heavy heart. On
our own ship, the one bomb hit pierced the boat deck abreast of No.
7 A.A. gun and tore through the No. 9 case mate and down to the
main deck. All this area exploded with vigor. The Marine division
suffered the severest losses.
</P>
<P>
   First Lieutenant Craig, standing near the three-inch gun, had
both legs blown off and received other injuries; he died almost on
the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Doctor Rall, a lieutenant junior grade, and a pharmacist's mate
were mangled and killed instantly. This information I received from
one of the musicians, Andrew Lambert, who, standing near by, saw it
happen and was shell-shocked. His fellow stretcher bearer, Musician
S.W. Craig, survived with minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   I wandered around the dressing station, my eyes not believing
what they saw. I gave a drink here and loosened an article of
clothing there; there was not much else I could do.
</P>
<P>
   Many were badly burned and screamed for relief of pain; they had
already received drug injections, and a glass of water to the lips
was in many cases the only human assistance possible. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day I assisted in taking the dead off the ship and
in bringing on board many rounds of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   As far as other casualties are concerned I am in complete
ignorance, though I know that they were severe. In the case of the
capsized Oklahoma I have heard that there were from 500 to 1,100
men trapped inside her hull, I believe that the majority of them
were extricated.
</P>
<P>
   I am proud to say that the U.S.S. Pennsylvania was the first in
action and that we accounted for not less than eight enemy planes.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Rumors swirled in the aftershock of the
attack: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the rumors passing amongst us, none of us
having real solid information. Some of the enemy planes were
piloted by German fliers. The enemy tried to land troops at Nanakuh
and Waikiki beaches, but were repulsed. We sank two enemy aircraft
carriers some distance from the islands. Wake and Midway islands
are in Japanese hands. Saboteurs land in great numbers on the
island. In reference to this last fact I must admit that quite a
large number of prisoners were taken here in the Navy Yard.
</P>
<P>
   We had two more alarms yesterday, but these proved to be only
scares. Our men are now and forever on the alert, and woe to the
enemy if they try it again.

 UNDATED: put out. . . .

<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) He was also witness to the tremendous
damage inflicted on other vessels, and to the Navy's efforts to
fight back: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of us in dry dock were two destroyers also under repair,
despite their wonderful barrage and cooperation; (they fought like
wild cats) a number of bomb hits were scored and their crews were
forced to abandon. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Directly aft of us, moored at ten-ten dock, were the U.S.S.
Oglala and the U.S.S. Helena. These two vessels, the former a mine
layer and the latter one of our latest 10,000-ton cruisers, were
tied or moored together. An enemy torpedo plane headed directly for
the Oglala . . . and launched its torpedo. The old ship, severely
injured, immediately turned on its side, and sank.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the harbor . . . our battleships were
receiving a merciless pounding. The U.S.S. Arizona received two
bomb hits amidship and a great number of torpedoes. She split in
half and her forward magazines burst. Directly forward of her, the
U.S.S. Oklahoma received many torpedo hits and capsized.
</P>
<P>
   Next to her the U.S.S. West Virginia received a tremendous
amount of bomb hits and her whole port battery was wiped out. . . .
The U.S.S. Tennessee stood up fairly, or rather, remarkably well
considering the pounding she took. The U.S.S. Maryland stood as
solid as a piece of granite and fought the enemy. She remained in
one piece.
</P>
<P>
   Directly forward of the Maryland, though some distance away . .
., the U.S.S. California received torpedo hits and listed on her
port side. The U.S.S. Nevada, in a daring attempt to reach the open
sea through the channel, was torpedoed and her wary skipper
grounded her on the right side of the harbor in order to keep the
channel clear.
</P>
<P>
   One destroyer in the floating dry dock on our starboard was hit
and went on fire, burning right at the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)The human toll was horrific.(END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Now to the casualties, and I write this with a heavy heart. On
our own ship, the one bomb hit pierced the boat deck abreast of No.
7 A.A. gun and tore through the No. 9 case mate and down to the
main deck. All this area exploded with vigor. The Marine division
suffered the severest losses.
</P>
<P>
   First Lieutenant Craig, standing near the three-inch gun, had
both legs blown off and received other injuries; he died almost on
the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Doctor Rall, a lieutenant junior grade, and a pharmacist's mate
were mangled and killed instantly. This information I received from
one of the musicians, Andrew Lambert, who, standing near by, saw it
happen and was shell-shocked. His fellow stretcher bearer, Musician
S.W. Craig, survived with minor injuries.

for Sunday, Dec. 6, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   _ NATIONAL/GENERAL (Moving in `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-CENSURE-REVIEW (Washington) _ Advocates of impeachment
say Congress has no authority to pass a resolution of censure
condemning President Clinton. Yet, Congress apparently did have the
authority to pass a resolution congratulating Mark McGwire for his
home-run record. To many, the arguments against censure seem
preposterous. Still, in most cases, congressional expressions of
opinion _ whether in resolutions about baseball heroes or African
dictators _ are in fact meaningless, even frivolous. By David E.
Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   ANTITRUST-REVIEW (Washington) _ From trust busters to trust
trusters. For most of this century, Washington's economic agenda
was dominated by the high-stakes politics of curbing the power of
big enterprises. But Exxon and Mobil announced the world's largest
merger, Washington yawned. Many theories have been offered to
explain this new passivity about the evils of Big Everything. By
David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   ABORTION-MILITIAS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Frustrated and embittered
by their failure to stop abortions _ and a federal law protecting
clinics _ fringes of the anti-abortion movement are linking up with
a new ally: the right-wing militia movement. By John Kifner.
</P>
<P>
   NY-STOCK-EXCHANGE-REVIEW (New York) _ To the surprise of almost
no one, the N.Y. Stock Exchange has decided to stay in New York.
Whether its officials really meant their many threats to move to
New Jersey will never be known. Government giveaways aside, there
are certain intangibles that add up to a strong case that they were
never really serious about leaving. By Charles V. Bagli.
</P>
<P>
   PACS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In today's fund-raising frenzy,
candidates and organizations have to be increasingly inventive in
thinking up ways to separate donors from their money. Although the
evidence is anecdotal, there are signs that patriotic, optimistic
or catchy names help political action committees raise more cash.
By Jill Abramson. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   PEARL-HARBOR-REVIEW (Undated) _ Excerpts from the diary of a
Pearl Harbor survivor, Henry Lachenmayer of Oxon Hill, Md.
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE-MYTHS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at some recent
scientific and medical myths. Scientists may be no different from
lay people when it comes a message that strikes a chord in them. By
Gina Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ FOREIGN (Moving in `i' category)
</P>
<P>
   CONGO-REVIEW (Johannesburg) _ Most wars in Africa since the end
of colonialism have been civil wars, but not the current war in
Congo. Troops from as far south as Namibia and as far north as Chad
are fighting inside the Congo basin. In one sense, what has
developed is a tribal war along lines that are almost biblical _
rulers from Nilotic ethnic groups in Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda
against Bantu peoples of central and southern Africa in league with
Arab rulers of northern Chad and Sudan. By Donald G. McNeil Jr.
WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-FOOD-REVIEW (Moscow) _ The entire Russian diet is
lurching through a perestroika that mirrors the bust-and-boom,
future-vs.-past nature of the nation's economy and its mentality.
By Michael Wines. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-FRANCE-BRITAIN-REVIEW (Paris) _ With allies like France,
does the U.S. really need enemies? Put another way: With allies
like Britain, who needs France? Exasperated U.S. policy-makers have
asked themselves questions like these over the years. By Craig R.
Whitney.

SCIENTIFIC MYTHS THAT ARE TOO GOOD TO DIE

(Repeating for all needing.) 
 (ATTN: Ill., Mich.)  (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone has heard about the LSD-soaked stickers given away to
schoolchildren. The stamp-size tabs are reportedly decorated with
blue stars or pictures of Superman, butterflies or clowns.
</P>
<P>
   Or how about the story of the child who is dying of cancer and
wants postcards sent to him? Or how about Neiman Marcus' $250
cookie recipe?
</P>
<P>
   They are all urban myths, of course, stories that refuse to die
no matter how many times they are roundly debunked.
</P>
<P>
   Science is different, right? Study results become part of the
annals, authenticated by weighty papers and validated by panels of
experts. This is the usual route to credibility. Then there are the
myths.
</P>
<P>
   Take the ``Hawthorne effect,'' which is much embraced in social
psychology. It refers to a study from 1927 to 1933 of factory
workers at Western Electric's Hawthorne Plant in Illinois. It
showed that regardless of the changes made in working conditions _
more breaks, longer breaks or fewer and shorter ones _ productivity
increased. These changes apparently had nothing to do with the
workers' responses. The workers, or so the story goes, produced
more because they saw themselves as special, participants in an
experiment, and their inter-relationships improved.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds very compelling. ``The results of this experiment, or
rather the human relations interpretation offered by the
researchers who summarized the results, soon became gospel for
introductory textbooks in both psychology and management science,''
said Dr. Lee Ross, a psychology professor at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   But only five workers took part in the study, Ross said, and two
were replaced partway through for gross insubordination and low
output.
</P>
<P>
   A psychology professor at the University of Michigan, Dr.
Richard Nisbett called the Hawthorne effect ``a glorified
anecdote.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you've got the anecdote,'' he said, ``you can throw away
the data.''
</P>
<P>
   Myths happen in medicine, too. Dr. Robert Buckman, a cancer
specialist at the University of Toronto, discovered an urban legend
when he tracked the story of a spectacular cancer treatment to its
source.
</P>
<P>
   Buckman first heard the story on June 25, 1990, in Toronto in a
lecture given by Dr. Bernard Siegel, a doctor who has written
popular books on the power of the mind over cancer. Siegel told of
two oncologists chatting about a study they were participating in
to test a combination of four chemotherapy drugs, which had the
initials EPHO.
</P>
<P>
   One doctor's patients were doing spectacularly well; three
quarters of them were responding to the drugs. But only a quarter
of the other doctor's patients were improving. Then the first
doctor explained that he had simply rearranged the letters of the
drugs so they spelled HOPE.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel's audience was overwhelmed. ``If hope did that, then it
was the most powerful anti-cancer agent the world had ever known,''
Buckman said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he was skeptical. He knew by the initials of the drugs
that the treatment must be for small-cell lung cancer, which is
very difficult to treat. Why had he not heard of the study before?
</P>
<P>
   Buckman asked Siegel for his source, which turned out to be a
book by Norman Cousins, who had referred to an article published in
a 1988 Western Journal of Medicine. Buckman telephoned the writer,
a cancer specialist in La Jolla, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor told Buckman that he had invented the story. It was a
parable meant to tell doctors that there was more to treating
cancer than merely doling out drugs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Are scientists as credulous as the parents who worried about the
LSD stickers? Perhaps urban legends take hold, Ross said, because
``sometimes a story deserves to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists may be no different from lay people when it comes a
message that strikes a chord in them. The Hawthorne effect had an
enormous appeal for many social psychologists, Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study became a symbol initially for arguing that change
itself is good or that anything you do produces positive effects,''
he said. Then it was interpreted to mean that people who take part
in experiments behave differently simply because they are taking
part in an experiment, he added. That, too, appealed to many
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us kind of believe that subjective factors matter a
lot in medicine,'' Ross said. ``We want there to be demonstrations
that make that point. And so we may ignore flaws and deficiencies
in a study if it is saying something we believe to be important.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, if some naysayer takes note of the paucity or absence of
data, Ross said, ``it's like seeing a magician's trick and then
having the magician tell how he did it.''

lecture given by Dr. Bernard Siegel, a doctor who has written
popular books on the power of the mind over cancer. Siegel told of
two oncologists chatting about a study they were participating in
to test a combination of four chemotherapy drugs, which had the
initials EPHO.
</P>
<P>
   One doctor's patients were doing spectacularly well; three
quarters of them were responding to the drugs. But only a quarter
of the other doctor's patients were improving. Then the first
doctor explained that he had simply rearranged the letters of the
drugs so they spelled HOPE.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel's audience was overwhelmed. ``If hope did that, then it
was the most powerful anti-cancer agent the world had ever known,''
Buckman said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he was skeptical. He knew by the initials of the drugs
that the treatment must be for small-cell lung cancer, which is
very difficult to treat. Why had he not heard of the study before?
</P>
<P>
   Buckman asked Siegel for his source, which turned out to be a
book by Norman Cousins, who had referred to an article published in
a 1988 Western Journal of Medicine. Buckman telephoned the writer,
a cancer specialist in La Jolla, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor told Buckman that he had invented the story. It was a
parable meant to tell doctors that there was more to treating
cancer than merely doling out drugs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Are scientists as credulous as the parents who worried about the
LSD stickers? Perhaps urban legends take hold, Ross said, because
``sometimes a story deserves to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists may be no different from lay people when it comes a
message that strikes a chord in them. The Hawthorne effect had an
enormous appeal for many social psychologists, Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study became a symbol initially for arguing that change
itself is good or that anything you do produces positive effects,''
he said. Then it was interpreted to mean that people who take part
in experiments behave differently simply because they are taking
part in an experiment, he added. That, too, appealed to many
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us kind of believe that subjective factors matter a
lot in medicine,'' Ross said. ``We want there to be demonstrations
that make that point. And so we may ignore flaws and deficiencies
in a study if it is saying something we believe to be important.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, if some naysayer takes note of the paucity or absence of
data, Ross said, ``it's like seeing a magician's trick and then
having the magician tell how he did it.''

   Jury Acquits Espy In Corruption Case
</P>
<P>
   Donald Smaltz spent four years investigating former Agriculture
Secretary Mike Espy, alleging that he had illegally accepted sports
tickets, luggage and other favors from companies he was supposed to
be regulating. A jury took two days to find Espy not guilty of all
30 charges. In the process, the jury provided powerful new
political ammunition for opponents of the law, set to expire in
June, that provides for the appointment of independent prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Espy said he wants to be one of the first witnesses when
Congress takes up the issue of renewing the independent counsel
law, probably in February.

   Serb General Arrested
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of a high-ranking Bosnian Serb general on charges of
genocide for directing the 1995 attack on Srebrenica, in which
7,000 Bosnian Muslims were marched off, presumably to their deaths,
provided a potent reminder that those responsible for the
atrocities of the Bosnian civil war cannot rest easy.
</P>

   At issue is whether Ickes lied in a 1997 deposition when he said
he did not know of any administration efforts to intervene in a
strike by teamsters at a walnut processing plant in California.

   New Jersey Sniffs At New York's Garbage

   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has always dealt with New York City's
problems with elegant simplicity. Pedestrians getting in the way of
cars? Reroute the pedestrians. Too many potholes? Well, fill them.
No place to put the city's garbage? Send it to New Jersey.

   In Display of Unity, European Nations Cut Rates

   Eleven European nations cut their interest rates to a nearly

to bolster European economies by making it cheaper for businesses

   It was the most coordinated action yet toward European monetary

   The United States, treading into a political and diplomatic
confrontation it tried to avoid, said it would declassify some
government documents on the killing and torture conducted by former
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. The decision could open ``a can

   An Indulgent Pope
</P>
<P>
   For the year 2000, Pope John Paul II has introduced a fast track
to heaven. Throughout the yearlong millennium celebration, Roman
Catholics who quit smoking or drinking for a day can earn
indulgences to avoid punishment in the hereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Indulgences were sold by church officials in medieval times and
the practice helped drive Martin Luther to protest, starting the
Reformation. Indulgences are viewed as atavistic by some liberal
Catholics. But the pope wants penitence to be a major theme in the
third millennium, and he has broadened the criteria for earning
indulgences, allowing sinners to stop smoking for a day or visit a
hospital or prison. It is still no cakewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so easy for some to give up smoking for a day,'' said
Archbishop Crescenzio Sepe, a top Vatican official. ``It might be
easier to visit a prison inmate.''

telling America to mind its own business.

 &HT;    Consumer questions
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a lot of ribbons left over from my homecoming mum, and
I would like to save them for next year. How can I keep them from
discoloring? _Amy S.
</P>
<P>
   A: To keep the color fresh store it away from extremes of light,
moisture and temperature (no garage, no attic). The color should
remain fresh. It helps to store any fabric or paper in an acid-free
box or in acid-free tissue paper. Pick up a box at the Container
Store or from an archival supply house like Light Impressions at
(800) 828-6216. Storing ribbon on a roll will prevent creasing and
keep wire ribbon from crimping. Should it crease, a blow dryer or
careful (LOW heat) ironing usually gets the kinks out.
</P>
<P>
   Ribbon guru Camela Nitschke, at (419) 872-0073, sells books on
the history of ribbon as well as teaching videos for ribbon
projects and even kits for making ribbon flowers (including
bluebonnets!).
</P>
<P>
   Ribbon began as the Velcro of history _ holding sandals with
leather strips and wool capes in place. Ribbon also was a sign of
high station. When the Pope moved to Avignon the French pumped up
the ribbon industry. Victorian times were the golden age of ribbon,
and when the sewing machine became popular, common man finally got
a shot at this finery.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I caught the end of a radio clip announcing someone is
producing a Gen. Colin Powell doll. I searched the Internet and
contacted some local bookstores and can locate no additional
information. This would make a great Christmas gift for my
hard-to-buy-for husband. Any ideas how I can find out how to
purchase the doll?
</P>
<P>
   _Kim B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Hasbro, maker of that 1960s icon G.I. Joe, has created the
doll honoring the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who
oversaw military crises such as the Persian Gulf War and the
invasion of Panama. Proceeds from dolls are shared with Boys &AMP;
Girls Clubs of America.
</P>
<P>
   The doll comes with a U.S. Army flag and U.S. flag on flag stand
bases and a 23rd American Division patch and patch box. Suggested
retail price from Hasbro is $49.99. Kay-Bee Toys expects to carry
this doll and Toys R Us has had a few _ but they go fast.
</P>
<P>
   Bonus info: G.I. Joe debuted at 11 1/2 inches tall and had 21
moving parts _ although I am hard-pressed to name them all.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We do brown bag lunches at my office, and I am trying to find
someone to come to our company and demonstrate package-wrapping and
bow-making for this time of year. _P.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: No takers for this workplace demonstration but I bet you
could do it with a little help from the folks at the Container
Store. Call the store's mail order line at (800) 786-7315 for a
free ``Guide to Beautiful Bows.'' Instructions for four primary bow
types _ pompom, florist, big and basic _ are included. Need more
direction? Attend one of the Container Store's free bow workshops.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What amount is the national debt? Last I heard, it was $5.5
trillion. _R.A.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's still in the same high-dollar neighborhood. The Bureau
of the Public Debt clocks this figure and posts it daily about
10:30 a.m. CST. For to-the-penny figures, access
www.publicdebt.treas.gov.
</P>
<P>
   Want to make a contribution to reduce this mammoth debt? Write a
check to Bureau of the Public Debt and note on the check's face
``gift to reduce the Public Debt.'' Mail the check to Capital Area
Servicing Center, 1300 C St. SW, Washington, D.C. 20239-0001.
Testamentary bequests are also accepted. In the fiscal year 1997,
$955,897.15 was contributed to this reduction fund. Wonder who sent
the 15 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the correct dimensions for a king-size mattress? I
purchased one, and my king-size sheets do not fit. The mattress is
smaller than the box springs. The dimensions are 76 inches wide and
78 inches long. _E.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: A king-size mattress is 76 inches by 80 inches, says mattress
maker Serta. No wonder the sheets don't fit. I hope you got a
really good deal on that ``king.'' Serta, maker of mattresses for
more than 60 years, has made custom mattresses in a variety of
sizes _ from miniatures (15 by 15 inches) for a display of
historical monarchs' bedrooms to a 100-square-foot mattress for an
NBA player.

(512) 445-3697; e-mail jgreig(at)statesman.com or fax (512)
445-3968.

   ATLANTA _ You won't be surprised to learn the North Pole is
wired with the latest in T3 high-speed data lines and the finest
and most powerful of servers. Santa Claus, after all, does not mess
around.
</P>
<P>
   Kids have been writing letters to Santa for a long time now.
Each year, the post office routes any letter addressed to Santa
Claus at the North Pole to helpers who answer them if they can.
This is the busy season. If you or a young one wants to write Santa
online, you'll find there are many mysterious ways to reach Saint
Nick.
</P>
<P>
   We'll list some of the Web sites here that offer free letters
from Santa. Your child can write a note to Santa, using the e-mail
address on the Web page, and receive an answer by e-mail. The sites
we will visit today offer this cyber-fast connection to Santa free.
There are also places on the Web that charge _ but no child should
have to pay to get a letter from Santa, so we'll ignore them, and
you probably should, too.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop for the day is a Web site maintained by a
commercial storefront on the Net called the Christmas Store. But
despite the commercial nature of the site, you won't pay to write a
letter to Santa using the link on the page at http://www

   .holidaytree.com/xmasnt.html. In fact, you might urge your child
to really pull out the stops and write the best possible letter.
</P>
<P>
   There is a small prize, $100, for the best letter to Santa
received at the site. While that amount might not change your
Christmas dramatically, it sure wouldn't hurt. As you'd expect,
there are also links to various products and services sold from the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas, of course, knows no nationality. So don't think it
odd that we're stopping next at the UK Online Pages at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .uk-online.com/christms
</P>
<P>
   /letter.htm. This site makes it easy, if a bit impersonal, to
send Santa a list of presents your child wants. Just fill in the
blanks, hit the button and the letter wings its way to the North
Pole.
</P>
<P>
   The United Kingdom has more than its share of Christmas letter
sites, and we'll visit an excellent one next. It's called Christmas
and Santa Letter and is located at http://www.north-pole.co.uk
</P>
<P>
   /index5.htm. Not only can your child use the link on this site
to write a letter to Santa, there also is a link that will let
anyone send some of the prettiest electronic Christmas cards you'll
find on the Web. There's no cost for that service, either, and the
whole family probably will enjoy this place. The electronic
Christmas cards come in all varieties, including religious themes
and funny ones, too.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Claus Online also offers a fine way to send e-mail to the
North Pole at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .santaclausonline.com/
</P>
<P>
   santapages/letter.html.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find a form to fill out on this page. Then, just a bit
after you press the button to send your e-mail to Santa, you'll get
a canned reply. While most of the letter is traditional in nature,
some plugs for the products on the commercial site are included at
the bottom. So some parents may wish to avoid this site if the
notion of blending the commercial with the sublime bothers them.
</P>
<P>
   But don't worry. This is just a sampling of the places where
your child can write Santa. The selection is so broad you are sure
to be able to find the kind of site that appeals to your family.
Just use your favorite search engine and type in these search
terms: santa, online, letter. You'll get screenful after screenful
of sites that blend the old-fashioned spirit of the season with
this new-fangled Internet.

   Hey, a Guy's Gotta Eat
</P>
<P>
   For a typical suburban family, the monthly bills seem
extravagant: $11,000 for mortgage payments, $1,600 for groceries
and $1,100 for utilities.
</P>
<P>
   But John A. Gotti, the reputed Mafia leader, insists the
expenses are essential for supporting his wife and their four
children, and for the upkeep of two luxurious Long Island homes and
several rural properties. Gotti cited the household overhead in a
plea to a federal judge for a reduction in his bail supervision
costs. Awaiting trial on a raft of federal racketeering charges, he
was released on $10 million bail in October with the provision that
he pay $21,000 a month for private guards to monitor his activities
at his main home in Oyster Bay, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Because prosecutors have frozen more than $3 million of his
assets, including bank accounts and rents from commercial
properties, Gotti says his monthly income is now a mere $11,000. He
claims that unless his assets are freed or the surveillance costs
lowered, he will be unable to pay his bills or his lawyers' fees.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors argue that the guards are necessary to prevent him
from meeting with other suspected mobsters and assert that Gotti,
34, known as Junior, is running the powerful Gambino organized
crime family for his imprisoned father, John J. Gotti, 58.
</P>
<P>
   And, if the younger Gotti is convicted, prosecutors say, most of
his assets probably will be confiscated as having been obtained
through criminal profits.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gotti laments that he is scraping by with loans from
his sister, Victoria, an author of crime novels.

   Painful Truth, Painful Lie
</P>
<P>
   If the congressional impeachment inquiry into President
Clinton's sex life accomplishes nothing else, it afforded Pam
Parsons a heartfelt opportunity to apologize for committing perjury
by lying about her sex life as a lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that I ever denied about myself was what created a
spiraling journey through hell,'' Ms. Parsons told the House
Judiciary Committee. Her appearance was designed by the Republicans
to prod greater public outrage over the president's
sex-and-mendacity scandal by showing that ordinary Americans suffer
jail time for lying.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parsons lost her career as a women's basketball coach when,
at a critical moment of truth, she denied to a sportswriter that
she had been in a gay bar. She later sued for libel and perjured
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Her suffering was noted with sympathy last week by Wendy Weaver,
a high-school teacher and volleyball coach in Utah who was faced
with a similar moment of truth and chose to simply admit to a
curious student that, yes, she was gay. Ms. Weaver eventually lost
her coaching job and was barred by the Nebo School District from
talking with students or staff members about her sexual
orientation, even outside of school.
</P>
<P>
   She sued with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union and
finally scored a point for the right to not lie about her sex life.
A federal judge last month ordered the school to backtrack in the
name of Ms. Weaver's ``unblemished'' reputation in the face of
``the private antipathy of some members of a community.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parsons, as she sadly testified, found comfort in the truth
the hard way. ``That day that I got slapped into recognizing that,
yes, there are things that you pay consequences for, my life had a
chance to turn around.''

 &HT;    Going once, twice ... auctions to treasure
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Online auctions prove one of the basic truths of human
nature: One person's trash is another's treasure.
</P>
<P>
   The Web auction game is relatively new, and might be a little
too much for Web surfers just getting comfortable with online
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if you read the directions carefully and ignore the $250
Furbys (unless the money is going to charity), you can find your
own personal pot of gold _ or gold plate _ at an online auction.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most popular online auction houses are eBay
(http://www.ebay.com) and Yahoo! Auction (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .yahoo.com). On these sites, you'll be able to find nearly
everything your heart desires, from rare coins to collectible
Christmas ornaments, vintage Barbie dolls and Waterford crystal.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a collector, or know someone who is, purchasing a
hard-to-find treasure through an online auction can be fun and
rewarding. A quick survey of collectors of a variety of items
showed that for the most part, initial asking prices on the items
were what a person would expect to pay at a flea market, an
in-person auction or a retail store.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with all this in mind, newbies should take care to read
all the fine print before signing up or placing a bid. Once you
have purchased an item, you are conducting business with the person
auctioning the item. Yahoo! and eBay allow you to check up on both
buyer and seller. The eBay system has more checks and balances,
although problems are rare.
</P>
<P>
   There are sites such as Amazon.com, which have perfected the art
of one-click ordering, but eBay and other online auctioneers aren't
the sort of places where you log in, order up and log out. By their
very nature, these sites invite you to stay, take a look around and
see if they have any classic matchbox cars, Fiestaware soup bowls
or vintage rhinestone jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   If you see something you want to buy, that's great, but unlike
online retailers, you've got to register whether you are a buyer or
a seller. That way, if you develop a reputation as a con artist or
a welcher, the whole eBay community will find out via online
postings. And there truly is nothing worse than having a bad
reputation in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   For beginners, there's no better place to learn the ins and outs
of online auctions than eBay, which has an easy-to-follow tutorial,
a list of frequently asked questions and lots of other information
to help you before you bid. And even if you don't want to buy, it's
still fun to look. Recent items on sale at eBay included a 1983
DeLorean auto and a snuffbox featuring a painting of the Titanic
disaster. Yahoo! Auctions is equally easy to use and also requires
registration. There may be fewer items and the organization might
not be as efficient as eBay's, but if they have what you want, it
really doesn't matter what else they may have.
</P>
<P>
   With so much talk about sites that want to build community on
the Web, eBay and others create an instant community of like-minded
souls united by common interests. EBay founder Pierre Omidyar says
there may be only one or two collectors of a certain item in your
hometown, but there could be hundreds online. Here's where you can
find them and gather up some goodies along the way.

 &HT;    Why not pick up that new car in Europe?
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's time to face the age-old problem, what to buy as
holiday gifts. If your kids are grown, you are an empty nester or
if you have had enough of buying for buying's sake, perhaps one
major purchase for the household might be in order.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you have long thought about a European vacation for the
holidays. What could put you more in the season than to enjoy the
Old World ambience of the Yuletide? But practicality has always
dictated another option. Seems you always need more stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The one big-purchase option eliminates trips to the mall and all
that wrapping. This holiday season, Volvo is one of several
automakers that may have the answer to your dilemma. BMW,
Mercedes-Benz and Saab also offer European delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo's European delivery program, through March 31, includes
free round-trip airfare to Europe and one night's free hotel
accommodations. You must take delivery by Aug. 31. However,
customers who take delivery by this Dec. 31 will receive a second
night's hotel accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to turn the December deal into a weekend jaunt
to Europe. Just hop the red-eye out on Thursday evening, arrive in
Europe on Friday, schedule your hotel accommodations for Friday and
Saturday nights, enjoy Sunday on the Continent and then return home
on a Sunday evening flight.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the program only provides one ticket, but
sometimes alert shoppers can find a free or low-price companion
ticket. But even if you can't, you might save enough on your
purchase price to justify buying that plane ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The program guarantees as much as a 10 percent discount on the
purchase price. With pricing on all eligible models (the new S80
luxury sedan, C70 coupe, S70 sedan and V70 sportwagon) all
beginning at $35,000 or better, that's a cool $3,500 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo also promises to make the experience as hassle-free as
possible. It allows you to choose from 13 European cities in which
you may take delivery, including Berlin, Frankfurt, Geneva, London,
Madrid, Munich, Paris and Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo arranges for temporary registration and insurance, so
new-car owners can enjoy their vehicle throughout the vacation,
saving additional ground transportation costs and hassles. At the
end of the trip, Volvo will ship the new car from your drop-off
point of choice to your local retailer. Overseas freight expenses,
insurance and U.S. customs duty are among the many elements
included at no extra cost.
</P>
<P>
   Like to know more, but don't want to talk to a salesperson? Call
1-800-631-1667. Who knows, Santa just may have to look for you in
the Alps this year.

 &HT;    Swatch branching out into pager business
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Swatch, the company that made the plastic watch cool,
has launched a line of plastic pagers. The Swatch Beep Box is round
with a regular-sized message screen placed above one round button.
</P>
<P>
   The beeper comes in three colors, airmail blue, black grape and
round table orange. Like America Online, the beeper lets you create
a ``buddy list,'' which lets you send group messages.
</P>
<P>
   The beepers are available on the Web, at http://www.swatch.com.
The Beep Boxes start at $100, which includes 1,000 pages and three
months of service. One thousand more pages cost $30. There is no
reactivation fee should you let your service lapse. The beeper
alone is on sale at electronics and Swatch retailers for $75.
</P>
<P>
   The Beep Box, made with help from Motorola, is a numeric pager.
It can store 16 messages, each with a time and date.
</P>
<P>
   A new way to attack 'mouse wrist' malady
</P>
<P>
   If the permanent aching wrist caused by keeping one hand on your
mouse all day is starting to bother you, a new device available
online might be your answer.
</P>
<P>
   Mousebar Co. out of Waterford, Wis., has a patented pad that
attaches either to your desk or your chair arm. The bar can be
moved backward and forward. It is made of plastic with a textured
surface for the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The bar, which retails for $28.95 plus $4.95 for shipping, comes
in light gray or charcoal. The bar is mounted with either a clamp
or adhesive. Both are included in the package.
</P>
<P>
   The guy who invented the bar, James Baranowski, uses computer
design tools at work and was looking for a way to ease the wrist
pain he was feeling after hours at his computer.
</P>
<P>
   The bar comes with a 30-day money back guarantee. It can be
ordered over the Internet at http://www.mousebar.com.
</P>
<P>
   Car maintenance meets the computer
</P>
<P>
   Some dads used to keep excruciatingly detailed facts about their
cars: how many miles per gallon the old Galaxy 500 got for each
fill-up dating to 1965, when the tires were bought, who from and
how much he paid. Now there's a software program to take all that
out of the glovebox and onto the PC.
</P>
<P>
   Dew Technology's Peak Performance lets the Type A types track
scheduled maintenance, unscheduled maintenance, gas mileage
performance and includes a maintenance forecast that tells you when
to rotate your tires, change your filters, tune your engine, flush
your radiator and change your transmission oil.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which retails for $49.95, lets you keep histories
of 10 vehicles. Minimum requirements are 3 megabytes of application
memory, a 486/66 megahertz processor, 8 megabytes of RAM and
Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   Peak Performance is available at the company's Web site,
</P>
<P>
   http://www.dewtech.com.
</P>
<P>
   Slice of Americana captured on CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Norman Rockwell, among the most traditional and American of
artists, has been brought into the high-tech world.
</P>
<P>
   On the 20th anniversary of his 1978 death, New Jersey's Cinegram
Media is offering an interactive CD-ROM called Norman Rockwell _
The Man and His Art. A disc of screen savers that includes more
than 30 of his better-known paintings is also available.
</P>
<P>
   The disc lets you ``tour'' Rockwell's Massachusetts studio,
``meet'' his models and view interviews Rockwell gave Edward R.
Murrow and others.
</P>
<P>
   The disc contains more than 450 images of Rockwell's paintings,
hundreds of photographs, an audio narrative, the complete series of
324 Saturday Evening Post covers and behind-the-scenes looks at his
more well-known works.
</P>
<P>
   The disc is available at software retailers, or online at
http://www.cinegram.com, for $69.95. The screen saver collection
sells for $29.95.
</P>
<P>
   Exploring the hottest Web business models
</P>
<P>
   Corporations compete with business models rather than products.
The folks at Amazon.com sell the same books as those at B Dalton
Bookseller, but Amazon.com is hot because its business model _
buying books over the Internet _ keeps you out of the malls. The
idea that models, not products, will pave the way to corporate gold
is the premise behind the cover story in the Dec. 7 issue of
Fortune.
</P>
<P>
   A special section called ``The E-Corporation: More Than Just
Web-based, It's Building a New Industrial Order,'' explores the
idea of that the ``hottest and most dangerous new business models
are out there on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   If you can't program it, just try talking to it
</P>
<P>
   After years of making VCRs that were somewhat difficult to
program, companies have been making simpler machines. Now, Zenith
Electronics has taken that one step further. The company that
brought the remote control to market is offering SpeakEZ, a way to
control the recording function of your VCR with your voice.
</P>
<P>
   SpeakEZ will be available in seven Zenith VCRs. The feature will
talk the user through each function, from recording to
clock-setting.
</P>
<P>
   The feature will be available on Zenith VCRs in time for the
holidays. Suggested retail price is $149 to $249.

 &HT;    Encarta is tops, but still has errors
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Microsoft's Encarta has been at the top of the heap of
popular electronic encyclopedias since its first appearance, and
the 1999 edition will not lose that place.
</P>
<P>
   The interface has been tweaked, not all of it for the good. It
takes more mouse clicks now, in some cases, to get what you want.
But it remains easy to use, and all articles are displayed in
large, easy-to-read text.
</P>
<P>
   The deluxe version is now a three-disc set, one disc being used
entirely for installation and the inevitable attempt to stuff
Explorer down your throat. It does this with a vengeance _ no by
your leave, no ``would you like to.'' It just sets up Explorer as
your default browser. I find that infuriating.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Encarta is a fine encyclopedia, with a heavier
emphasis on the arts than most. There are, for instance, large and
well-done sections on ceramics, woodworking and furniture. All
music (that I listened to, at any rate) was presented in excerpts
from commercial recordings.
</P>
<P>
   The sections on flamenco and bullfighting remain essentially
unchanged, and quite good except for the usual incorrect captions,
questionable choice of photos and unfortunate tendency to try to
force the bullfight into the general category of sports.
</P>
<P>
   Entries on firearms, which I have not previously examined, have
some very strange problems. As curator of arms at the West Point
museum, Robert W. Fisch may not have been the best choice to write
the little section on shotguns; clearly he is out of touch when he
tells us, ``Modern pump-action and semi-automatic shotguns equally
share the field with the similar side-by-side and single-barreled
pieces ...''
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be a museum curator to know pumps and
semi-autos rule the field, and the traditional double gun is no
longer made by major manufacturers, having been largely replaced by
over-and-under guns.
</P>
<P>
   The biography of John Moses Browning, the greatest arms designer
who ever lived, is unsigned. Probably a good thing, since it
contains ludicrous errors and, for want of a better term,
understatements. It says Browning invented ``two machine guns ...
the Colt Peacemaker and the Browning Automatic Rifle.''
</P>
<P>
   Peacemaker, of course, is the popular name of the Colt's Single
Action Army, the single most popular handgun of the American West
following the Civil War, and by no stretch of the imagination a
machine gun.
</P>
<P>
   The bio goes on with the offhand statement that Browning ``also
designed an automatic pistol.'' It is for this, embodied originally
in the Colt M1911A and refined later in the Browning Hi-Power, that
Browning is chiefly known today. Both weapons have been changed but
little since their inception and remain the most popular of all
semi-auto designs.

 &HT;    Road to telecommuting more likely just a cow path
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I am telecommuting today. Instead of sitting behind my
two work computers _ a G3 Macintosh and a Pentium II PC _ that are
connected to a high-speed data line and all the various news
services that pump information into any modern newspaper, I have my
feet propped up on my desk in a spare bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   The cat is curled up in the sunshine nearby, and I am
barefooted.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommuting is fine for what I am doing at this moment:
writing a column. And if that were all I did in my newspaper job,
there would be no reason to trek into the office at all, unless
someone were retiring and chocolate cake were being served.
</P>
<P>
   But because my job involves so many different things _
discussing stories with reporters who cover technology, sometimes
talking to readers with a question and often pacing around waiting
for a reporter's story to edit _ telecommuting isn't a real
substitute for being there.
</P>
<P>
   In my old-fogey opinion, at least, that daily commute in your
car is unlikely to be replaced _ on a day-to-day basis at least _
with a cyber-office at home.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you picture regular commuting as driving along the
interstate in a modern automobile, this telecommuting stuff amounts
to pedaling to work on a rickety bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if _ despite the appeal of working from home _ it would
work for most folks I know. Among my friends are physicians who
would be hard-pressed to work in a cyber sort of way, a fellow who
installs and maintains commercial roofs (I can't picture him
pouring on an extra layer of tar this way, no matter how fast the
Internet connection) and several graduate students who spend their
days arguing in class. Typing out messages might work for them, but
it sure wouldn't work as well.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that I have spoken before at telecommuting
conferences and certainly despite the fact I like the notion that _
in just a moment or two _ I'll be able to eat some of my sister's
famous Thanksgiving fruit salad and eat it here at my desk, I have
real doubts that telecommuting represents an important future in
the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lot like wrapping a leaking radiator hose with duct tape
_ it works better than nothing but isn't a permanent solution. So
today _ forced to stay home by a stomach that is riding some kind
of internal roller coaster _ I'm glad I can sit here with the cat.
And I'm sure the reporters I edit are happy I am not pacing about
their desk, trying to look unconcerned as I wait for their stories.
</P>
<P>
   But there are so many things _ little and big _ I can't do
today. And I won't be able to see how fast the other guy is typing,
or spend a moment to ask about his Thanksgiving. The real problem
isn't goofing off _ I'm typing as fast as I can _ but work without
the human touch is a pretty bland sort of thing.
</P>
<P>
   Look, there are plenty of folks who disagree, and maybe my
telecommuting today represents some real future. But I'm glad to
tell you what I think anyway. With all the voices for change and
all those eloquent people who explain how technology will make life
better, it is good to have one lonely voice here in the
cyber-wilderness who understands the value of being a human in a
cyber world.

 &HT;    The X factor in parenting is knowing when to say 'when'
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ I've not been in the position, only in the
breathless spectator role. But I've come to believe that only when
the baby's head peeks out through the cervix is ``push'' a
clear-cut decision.
</P>
<P>
   Mom pushes. Child responds. Don't get used to it.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a dad, you'll do lots of pushing _ strollers, swings,
merry-go-rounds. But generally it will be on the wings of your
child's desire.
</P>
<P>
   You could be a control freak and force every decision on your
child. But at some point even the sternest parent must take ``no''
for an answer. That's particularly true when the child digs canals
in your neck with purple fingernails and won't let go.
</P>
<P>
   Some will say: ``You must lay down the law.'' But at some point,
wild boars cannot pull a resistant child from your neck.
</P>
<P>
   I'm thinking of a swimming lesson in which our eldest son, then
6, absolutely, positively refused to jump into the deep end. The
instructor was just as resolute. She wouldn't take no.
</P>
<P>
   She finally convinced him that she'd be there to catch him in
the water. He flung his quivering self right on top of her.
</P>
<P>
   It was like a mackerel landing on a lilly pad. Both went under.
Both grappled for something to hold. Fully clothed, I was crouched
to leap in to save somebody when she managed to right herself.
</P>
<P>
   She should have taken ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting a child to do homework, or brush teeth, or clean up a
room is not so much the issue. These are things that must be done.
</P>
<P>
   The real issues are endeavors like youth sports, or music
lessons, or other things you consider enrichment.
</P>
<P>
   'It's good for you'
</P>
<P>
   When do you push? When do you know that a child who says ``no''
is just being lazy, backing away from a challenge, or that he or
she really, fiercely, doesn't want to do it?
</P>
<P>
   I offer no answer. Maybe you have one.
</P>
<P>
   Our youngest son is a good athlete. But he's always resisted
organized sports. He's played no Little League. He went out for
soccer at 9, but felt disadvantaged against boys who'd been playing
since they were 5. He quit.
</P>
<P>
   I knew he could compete. Should I have pushed? I mined him for
reasons, gave him several chances to change his mind. He didn't.
</P>
<P>
   From my own experience and knowing his ability, I was certain
organized sports would be fun for him. But I have never pushed.
</P>
<P>
   And what do you know. This fall at the ripe age of 11 he decided
he wanted to take basketball skills honed on the driveway against
dad and join a league, which he did Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Mom decides to push
</P>
<P>
   Our oldest son is less of a jock, but is a dynamo in a host of
creative arts. He's also got the average teen bio-rhythmic pattern,
which wavers between manic zest for life and, ``Wake me when the
world ends. On second thought, you'll be extinct . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout their school years both boys have participated in the
PTA Reflections program _ a local, state, national competition with
categories in visual arts, photography, writing and music. They've
won their share of accolades. This year Michael, the oldest, had a
great idea for a Reflections poster, but as the deadline was
approaching his lower lip was collecting cat hair in one of his low
modes. His mom, who'd purchased materials for the project, decided
not to take no for an answer when he sloughed off encouragement.
She made it an order.
</P>
<P>
   Under duress, he started to work. It wasn't long that, great
idea as it was, he got immersed. What began grudgingly turned a
Michelangelesque epic. He had pencil grime on his chin. He stayed
up all night. The result was stunning:
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks, Mom, for pushing me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And if you think that's stunning, you should see the poster. Why
doesn't someone tell us when to push?

   Hey, a Guy's Gotta Eat
</P>
<P>
   For a typical suburban family, the monthly bills seem
extravagant: $11,000 for mortgage payments, $1,600 for groceries
and $1,100 for utilities.
</P>
<P>
   But John A. Gotti, the reputed Mafia leader, insists the
expenses are essential for supporting his wife and their four
children, and for the upkeep of two luxurious Long Island homes and
several rural properties. Gotti cited the household overhead in a
plea to a federal judge for a reduction in his bail supervision
costs. Awaiting trial on a raft of federal racketeering charges, he
was released on $10 million bail in October with the provision that
he pay $21,000 a month for private guards to monitor his activities
at his main home in Oyster Bay, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Because prosecutors have frozen more than $3 million of his
assets, including bank accounts and rents from commercial
properties, Gotti says his monthly income is now a mere $11,000. He
claims that unless his assets are freed or the surveillance costs
lowered, he will be unable to pay his bills or his lawyers' fees.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors argue that the guards are necessary to prevent him
from meeting with other suspected mobsters and assert that Gotti,
34, known as Junior, is running the powerful Gambino organized
crime family for his imprisoned father, John J. Gotti, 58.
</P>
<P>
   And, if the younger Gotti is convicted, prosecutors say, most of
his assets probably will be confiscated as having been obtained
through criminal profits.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gotti laments that he is scraping by with loans from
his sister, Victoria, an author of crime novels.

   Painful Truth, Painful Lie
</P>
<P>
   If the congressional impeachment inquiry into President
Clinton's sex life accomplishes nothing else, it afforded Pam
Parsons a heartfelt opportunity to apologize for committing perjury
by lying about her sex life as a lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that I ever denied about myself was what created a
spiraling journey through hell,'' Ms. Parsons told the House
Judiciary Committee. Her appearance was designed by the Republicans
to prod greater public outrage over the president's
sex-and-mendacity scandal by showing that ordinary Americans suffer
jail time for lying.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parsons lost her career as a women's basketball coach when,
at a critical moment of truth, she denied to a sportswriter that
she had been in a gay bar. She later sued for libel and perjured
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Her suffering was noted with sympathy last week by Wendy Weaver,
a high-school teacher and volleyball coach in Utah who was faced
with a similar moment of truth and chose to simply admit to a
curious student that, yes, she was gay. Ms. Weaver eventually lost
her coaching job and was barred by the Nebo School District from
talking with students or staff members about her sexual
orientation, even outside of school.
</P>
<P>
   She sued with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union and
finally scored a point for the right to not lie about her sex life.
A federal judge last month ordered the school to backtrack in the
name of Ms. Weaver's ``unblemished'' reputation in the face of
``the private antipathy of some members of a community.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parsons, as she sadly testified, found comfort in the truth
the hard way. ``That day that I got slapped into recognizing that,
yes, there are things that you pay consequences for, my life had a
chance to turn around.''

 &HT;    Avoiding the anxiety of holidays at home
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tips on coping with stress over family visits during
the holidays:
</P>
<P>
   _ Temper your expectations. The notion of the ``perfect''
reunion can set you up for frustration and depression.
</P>
<P>
   _ Call a friend if the family setting becomes unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
   _ Take heed of alcohol consumption. It may seem relaxing in the
short term, but its physiological effect can compound stress and
depression.
</P>
<P>
   _ Set comfortable limits. Determine how involved and
accommodating your plans should be well in advance, and make your
limits known to others involved.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reach out to those with whom you have healthy, nurturing
relationships. Get together with friends if a family setting is not
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   _ Change gift-giving procedures. Consider instituting a limit of
one gift per person.

 &HT;    For some, stress-filled traditional trip home has become too
much of an ordeal
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS, ILLUSTRATION, ATL-HOLIDAY-ROLES-TIPS
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The truth is, you can go home again. The question is,
do you really want to?
</P>
<P>
   Fed up with the ``terrible cooking'' of her mother in Ohio,
Christine Ronn, 41, of Marietta decided a few years ago that
telephoning home would be easier on her stomach, not to mention her
nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can get nauseous just seeing the Toledo city limits sign,''
says Ronn, a mother of three. ``At some point as you get older,
it's just not worth it _ unless you get off on going nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   For millions of Americans, going home for the holidays has
become an arduous, stress-filled ordeal in which grown men and
women unconsciously revert to childish roles, elderly parents bark
orders like tyrants, and somebody else _ anybody but you _ makes
all the decisions, including when, where and what to eat, when to
open gifts, how to decorate the tree or even whether it's OK to
leave for a while without hurting anyone's feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday stress, brought on in part by such visits, is one reason
America's suicide rate starts rising in January from a low in
December. And why January is the busiest month for
psychotherapists.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Wheeler, an Atlanta psychologist, says her patients
seemingly can't wait to get holiday hell stories off their chests.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are confrontations over tinsel or icicles on the tree,
or turkey with corn bread or roasted chestnuts,'' Wheeler says.
``People worry, `Are my gifts good enough? Did I spend enough
money? Is Aunt Sara gonna be as horrible as last year? Is Dad gonna
get drunk?'
</P>
<P>
   ``It can all make you feel empty, depressed, alienated. It's now
a tradition to feel guilty for not feeling happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta stockbroker Pierce Hammond, 54, is a case in point. He's
trekked to Mobile, Ala., for longer than he can remember to spend
the holidays with his wife's folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's chaotic, is what it is,'' says Hammond. ``God,
everybody's there. All my wife's sisters and brothers and their
kids, a whole bunch of people floating around. It's kind of a haze.
I'm ready to leave when it's done _ even before.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses, then grins: ``But I'm supposed to say it's great,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   49 percent who visit feel stress
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, heading home really can be great, even relaxing,
says Dr. Rick Winer, a Roswell psychiatrist. ``In some instances,
you don't have to think, because everything's scheduled.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, difficulties loom. ``With your parents, there's always
that feeling, `Do I need to let them know where I'm going and when
I'll get back?''' Winer says. ``Parents will assert their authority
more: `You are under my roof, you are under my rules.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, we go. About 45 percent of us will visit faraway
relatives, according to the American Automobile Association. The
numbers may be even higher in metro Atlanta, where fully 42 percent
of the residents aren't native Georgians.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Thompson, 22, a salesman for Pugmire Izusu in Marietta,
is weighing whether to drive home to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, it's comforting,'' he says. ``I think I like it
because nothing ever changes. They try to fix my plate. They tell
me to wear my coat.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Wilber, senior analyst with the Roper Organization at
the University of Connecticut, says polls show that 49 percent of
adults who visit their parents report significant stress. They
report difficulties over being treated like children, over how to
trim the tree and how much to spend on gifts, over the trip itself
_ even lingering sibling rivalries. ``Who got the biggest raise?
Who has the best car? The best house? It's like comparing
curriculum vitae,'' Wilber says.
</P>
<P>
   Ronn has decided that home for the holidays is wherever her
``real house'' is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be my mom and dad were the big kahunas,'' she says.
But doing without the annual trip to Ohio turns out to be just
fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The food is better. In Toledo, the sexiest thing we had to eat
was beef stew. Mom's idea of cooking was to get a can of vegetables
and boil them until they are so limp they scream to get out of the
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother is the queen of criticism'' she adds. ``I'll be
damned if I'm going to fall back into that.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Bramham, 51, an executive at CNN, still enjoys his family
visits _ for the most part.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a change, and in a lot of ways it's really nice,'' he
says. ``Mom always reverts,'' he laughs. ``I had asthma as a child,
and she always says, `Put on a sweater, you'll get cold. Close the
window.' Her favorite comment is `Now listen to your mother.' We
still have a great time, and I still look forward to the
holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses and adds, ``But I'm really, really thankful for Jan.
2.''

 &HT;    Altered dreams just as good as those pure ones we had as kids
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ One of the greatest things about being a
little kid is that
</P>
<P>
   nothing is impossible. Dreams are the truth of the moment and
reality is only in the perception.
</P>
<P>
   My young playmates and I operated in a world of infinite
possibilities. In the days of our youthful make-believe, we worked
hard at the fantasy of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Tootie always wanted to play opera. We'd improvise an apartment
on my front
</P>
<P>
   porch complete with a toy stove, a sink (with running water if
we filled the reservoir on the back), a tin teaset, and a toy
telephone. The oversized, cushioned glider was our bed.
</P>
<P>
   Tootie's plan was to have a penthouse (we all wanted one of
those because in the movies, truly glamourous people lived atop
buildings filled with other
</P>
<P>
   glamorous people), sing at the Met, and live in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Ann insisted we play newspaper. She wanted to be Brenda
Starr, dazzling
</P>
<P>
   girl reporter, writing and searching remote corners of the earth
for her elusive ``Mystery Man.''
</P>
<P>
   We all thought she could have made it if only her mom would have
allowed her to dye her hair copper penny red.
</P>
<P>
   My burning ambition never wavered. I was going to be a test
pilot of such fame that no matter where I happened to be in the
world, and no matter what great cause I was serving, when a new
fighter rolled out of the hangar, I'd be the one called to ``take
it up and wring it out.'' Later, I kind of lost interest when they
took the propellers off of airplanes. Jets just didn't look fierce
enough to suit me.
</P>
<P>
   Day after day, the three of us played on that porch, sharing our
dreams, confident that if we only believed hard enough, they would
all come true.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, as I was hoofing it around town, putting in my two
miles and trying to figure out what was with this spring-like
weather in December, I came upon a scene that took me back to those
times.
</P>
<P>
   Three little kids on a swingset were hollering at a fourth, a
little boy named Jimmy, who just happened to be standing in a
battered zinc washtub on top of a picnic table. ``Okay, now stay
still,'' a little girl yelled as they pumped their swings faster
and faster, stretching their toes to the limit to reach - what? In
a matter of seconds my question was answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop! Stop!'' the little girl screeched. The three swingers
dragged their heels, dug in their toes, and came to a halt. They
put their heads together and then walked over to Jimmy. ``Get out
of the tub a minute,'' the little girl ordered. Jimmy demurred but
after a brief discussion as to the possibility of moving the picnic
table closer to the swingset with him in the washtub, he gave in.
The kids put some muscle into it and began to shove the table
across the grass.
</P>
<P>
   After some dispute and a series of minor adjustments, the little
girl declared the operation a success and told Jimmy to get back in
the washtub which he did gladly, obviously enjoying his position as
top man in the tub.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy assumed an heroic stance, arms folded across his chest,
and declared
</P>
<P>
   himself ready. The kids pumped up their swings again. Faster and
higher, reaching with their toes toward Jimmy who appeared ready to
repel all encroachers on his washtub kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   But then the magic crumbled. Simultaneously and with shouts of
unbridled glee, three sets of feet collided with Jimmy's zinc
citadel and sent him flying, backside over tin tub, onto the grass.
He howled. Things hadn't quite worked as planned. Or maybe they had
- for the other three.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy wasn't hurt and I couldn't help but chuckle, thinking back
to the day I had come home from the movies with a new trick. I'd
just seen a man whip a tablecloth out from under four place
settings of fine china and crystal. I knew I could do it too, only
I wasn't dumb enough to risk smashing a table full of my mother's
dishes. Instead, I conned Tootie into standing on an old bedspread
while I snatched it out from under her. I assured her she'd be
unharmed. I was wrong. Tootie landed firmly on her backside and
went home yowling. I was in big
</P>
<P>
   trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But the dreams didn't die. Over the years we just altered them
slightly to
</P>
<P>
   fit new realities.That works too.

   PARIS _ With allies like France, does the United States really
need enemies? Put another way: With allies like Britain, who needs
France?
</P>
<P>
   More often than they like to admit, exasperated U.S.
policy-makers have asked themselves questions like these over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   But as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright heads for Brussels
and Paris this week for meetings with allied foreign ministers and
a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration on Human Rights, she might reflect that U.S.
disagreements with Britain over the past half century have
sometimes been as rancorous as those with the French.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain clashed over a joint French and
British attempt to grab the Suez Canal in 1956, and did not see eye
to eye about what should be done to stop the fighting in Bosnia
until 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But ever since two soul mates named Churchill and Roosevelt
commiserated about their dealings with an individualist named de
Gaulle, the strong underlying assumption of trust that exists
between Washington and London has simply not been there to the same
degree between Washington and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Americans tend to think the world of the British, and the worst
of the French. Even when France and the United States are in basic
agreement, as they are at the moment on Iraq, there's always
somebody like Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., to throw a monkey wrench
into the works.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, whom the French consider no friend, appeared to suggest
on an American television news show that the reason Saddam Hussein
had been able to avoid Anglo-American bombing last month might have
been that France had tipped him off that the bombers were on the
way.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the United States itself had warned Iraq
repeatedly that it faced imminent bombing if it didn't back down
and comply with United Nations resolutions on arms inspection.
McCain denied accusing the French, and officials in Britain later
confirmed that nobody had given the exact timetable to them anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Britain and the United States are in basic
disagreement, as they were during much of the war in Bosnia until
1995, American Anglophilia tends to rewrite history. This left the
impression that it was actually the French who didn't want the
United States to start bombing in Bosnia to stop Serbian aggression
and halt attacks on lightly armed United Nations peacekeepers from
Britain and France.
</P>
<P>
   France did indeed have to overcome sympathies for Serbia that
date from World War I, but as recently published memoirs by a
British commanding general of the U.N. peacekeepers in Bosnia, Sir
Michael Rose, confirm, Britain was strongly opposed to heavy NATO
bombing raids that the Americans kept wanting to launch against the
Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister John Major's conservative government
feared that the Serbs would retaliate by attacking the
peacekeepers. The impasse was not broken until French President
Jacques Chirac came to power in France in 1995 and mobilized
British and U.S. support for a policy with more military muscle,
after the Serbs overran the United Nations ``safe area'' in
Srebrenica and massacred Muslim civilians.
</P>
<P>
   NATO did go ahead with a strategic bombing campaign and the
Serbs, after suffering other setbacks on the ground, agreed to a
cease-fire and a beefed-up NATO peacekeeping operation that finally
put U.S. troops, along with others, on the ground alongside the
French and British.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor government has begun
moving closer to French ideas for making Europe capable of an
autonomous defense within NATO, but it has also made privileged
British relations with the United States a declared strategic
objective.
</P>
<P>
   That is much too abject a policy for France, French officials
say. After all, Louis XVI gave the Marquis de Lafayette 6,000
troops to help George Washington in 1777 not because the king
shared Lafayette's enthusiasm for the revolutionaries but to make
trouble for the British, who were his enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, French-U.S. relations have been like a long-running
marriage, frequently warmed by frictions.
</P>
<P>
   De Gaulle restored pride to a nation humiliated by defeat in
World War II, often at U.S. expense. ``The French need to take
pride in France,'' de Gaulle explained to his acolyte Alain
Peyrefitte in 1962. ``Otherwise, they fall into mediocrity, fight
with each other and head for the bistro.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Kissinger understood. ``De Gaulle was not anti-American in
principle,'' he wrote in his book ``Diplomacy'' (Touchstone/Simon &AMP;
Schuster). ``He was willing to cooperate whenever, in his view,
French and American interests genuinely converged. Thus during the
Cuban missile crisis, American officials were astonished by de
Gaulle's all-out support _ the most unconditional backing extended
to them by any allied leader.''
</P>
<P>
   De Gaulle dominated Europe, but he didn't want anyone else to _
not the Soviet Union, certainly, but not the United States, either.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, French leaders tend to see the United States in
Steinbeckian terms, as a strong, friendly but unsophisticated giant
whose full embrace might be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   So when the United States says that it really does want a
united, prosperous Europe, and doesn't feel threatened by plans for
the euro, the new common European currency that will used next
month, the French either don't believe it or suspect that what the
United States must really want is a Europe led by Britain.
</P>
<P>
   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine also worries about a
world in which there is only one superpower _ the United States _
overwhelming all other countries with its military, economic,
technological and cultural strength. ``Their weight carries them
towards hegemonism, and the idea they have of their mission is
unilateralism,'' he told the daily Liberation recently. ``And that
is not acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   French diplomats tell their U.S. friends that frank advice, not
sycophantism, is the mark of true friendship. By that measure,
France is indeed the most stalwart of allies.

 &HT;    Article helps stamp out Windows 98 bugs
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any piece of software, no matter how good, is a work in
progress. Every company ships programs with lots of bugs, and that
includes the current operating system Microsoft Windows 98. Learn
about what bugs are in Win98 and how to fix at least some of them
in the December issue of Windows magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The December issue of Windows also includes a comprehensive
guide to Windows NT5, which is Microsoft's industrial-strength
operating system, typically used to run server computers. You'll
find a detailed discussion of NT's strengths and weaknesses as well
as a recommendation on who should use it.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   War and destruction remain popular, at least for computer game
makers. As always, many of the titles released this holiday season
feature war and are aimed at boys. Cavedog Entertainment, for
example, has released the ``Total Annihilation Commander Pack.'' It
includes ``Total Annihilation,'' a popular war game, and two
expansion sets. The pack retails for $44.99 and requires Windows 95
and a 100-megahertz Pentium computer.
</P>
<P>
   For something a little more benign, there's Wizardworks'
``Rudolph the Red-nose Reindeer's Magical Sleigh Ride.'' There's
not a single casualty in this computer CD game based on the
soon-to-be-released animated movie of the same name. In this game,
you help Santa gather toys for his ride, locate kids needing gifts
and print out holiday cards. Available for both PCs and Macs,
Rudolph retails for $19.99.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   If you are a fan of those little plastic replicas of people like
Darth Vader, check out a new site by Hasbro. It produces a lot of
these figures and now has a database of information about them
online. Called HasbroCollectors
</P>
<P>
   .com, the site will both sell these plastic figures and provide
a details about them. There are also chat rooms where collectors
can trade information and discuss their favorite figures. You'll
find the HasbroCollectors.com site at
http://www.HasbroCollectors.com.

 &HT;    UT teaching grad students to avoid academia-speak
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ University researchers talk so much about
standard deviations, null hypotheses and scientific paradigms that
people outside the academic world have formulated their own
standard reply: ``Huh?''
</P>
<P>
   Universities are beginning to pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   As the job market for academics has tightened, the University of
Texas and other schools are training future scientists, professors
and business people to be not just good at research, but also able
to make people understand it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard people say the problem is we're cloning ourselves
at a time when the market has really changed and the world needs
different people,'' said Rick Cherwitz, UT's associate dean of
graduate studies. ``Personally, I think that goes too far ... but
there are some things we need to be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those, he said, is teaching graduate students to become
better communicators. What began as an experimental program with
three courses in the summer of 1997 has been expanded to 10 regular
courses this school year. Called the Graduate Professional
Development Program, its main focus is on writing and speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Students from the sciences, engineering and the arts have
clamored to get in, UT officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people out there are hungry for writing teachers''
whether they are in academia, business or government, said Betty
Sue Flowers, an English professor and guest lecturer at a recent
class on academic and professional writing.
</P>
<P>
   She, too, has heard the criticism about inaccessible, esoteric
academic writing. Even people inside universities complain they
can't understand their peers.
</P>
<P>
   The Boyer Commission on Educating Undergraduates in the Research
University said in a recent report:
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowhere are the failures of graduate education more serious
than in the skills of communication. Corporate leaders complain
that new Ph.D.s too often fail as communicators and cannot advance
their own careers or contribute to the success of their
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Flowers has taught writing to lawyers and judges and has trained
corporate executives, including leaders of General Motors and Shell
Oil, how to articulate their visions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes a difference in the world is not the facts as much
as how you tell the stories,'' Flowers told the class. ``If you
change your story, you can change the world. ... I think that's
what happened when our country was founded.''
</P>
<P>
   Students in the class, led by Professor JoyLynn Reed, said they
enjoyed getting feedback on their writing and learning with
students from different fields. Reed uses a tape recorder when
critiquing student papers, and students were eager to get the tapes
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great deal of jargon in the medical and health
professions, and a lot of times, individuals don't understand what
we're telling them,'' said Bobbie Sue Sterling, 50, a nurse working
on a doctorate in parent-child health. ``This course is helping me
learn how to write better to a general audience, and that will make
me a better nurse educator.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Stone, 23, who is working on a master's in accounting, said
that even though she works with numbers, words are equally
important. She must learn to write analyses of financial statements
and other reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``How to approach writing is what I have learned from this
class,'' she said. ``I've become a more confident writer, and it's
good to practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Samarth Pai, who is 23 and working on a master's in computer
science, said he has learned that some of the most successful
people are not necessarily the ones with the most ingenious ideas.
They are the people who communicate their ideas best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do a lot of writing, and I thought a writing class would be
essential so people would understand what I'm saying,'' he said.
``When you write, you learn. This helps me clarify my ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Flowers advised the class to avoid ``writing for the lowest
common denominator.'' Instead, she said, when conveying complex
ideas to a broad audience ``generalize at a level that would make
you squirm.''
</P>
<P>
   Most professors don't teach people how to write for nonacademic
audiences, said Robert King, a linguistics professor and former
College of Liberal Arts dean who also spoke to Reed's class. King
said he writes newspaper opinion pieces to share ideas with a broad
audience. Newspapers use short sentences and short paragraphs _ a
style researchers can emulate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short, good. Long, bad,'' King said. ``If you're using more
than one semicolon in a sentence, you're getting dangerously close
to the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Jules LaPidus, president of the Council of Graduate Schools,
applauded the UT program and sees it as part of a national trend to
better prepare doctoral students for work outside academia.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he said, only about half of the students who come out of
major research universities are interested in teaching. Even fewer
will get jobs as schools hire more part-time faculty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ivory tower is not the ivory tower anymore,'' Reed said.
``The walls around the university need to come down, and teaching
students to communicate to broader audiences is one way to do
that.''

 &HT;    Santa's waiting for e-mail
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You won't be surprised to learn the North Pole is
wired with the latest in T3 high-speed data lines and the finest
and most powerful of servers. Santa Claus, after all, does not mess
around.
</P>
<P>
   Kids have been writing letters to Santa for a long time now.
Each year, the post office routes any letter addressed to Santa
Claus at the North Pole to helpers who answer them if they can.
This is the busy season. If you or a young one wants to write Santa
online, you'll find there are many mysterious ways to reach Saint
Nick.
</P>
<P>
   We'll list some of the Web sites here that offer free letters
from Santa. Your child can write a note to Santa, using the e-mail
address on the Web page, and receive an answer by e-mail. The sites
we will visit today offer this cyber-fast connection to Santa free.
There are also places on the Web that charge _ but no child should
have to pay to get a letter from Santa, so we'll ignore them, and
you probably should, too.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop for the day is a Web site maintained by a
commercial storefront on the Net called the Christmas Store. But
despite the commercial nature of the site, you won't pay to write a
letter to Santa using the link on the page at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .holidaytree.com/xmasnt.html. In fact, you might urge your child
to really pull out the stops and write the best possible letter.
</P>
<P>
   There is a small prize, $100, for the best letter to Santa
received at the site. While that amount might not change your
Christmas dramatically, it sure wouldn't hurt. As you'd expect,
there are also links to various products and services sold from the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas, of course, knows no nationality. So don't think it
odd that we're stopping next at the UK Online Pages at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .uk-online.com/christms
</P>
<P>
   /letter.htm. This site makes it easy, if a bit impersonal, to
send Santa a list of presents your child wants. Just fill in the
blanks, hit the button and the letter wings its way to the North
Pole.
</P>
<P>
   The United Kingdom has more than its share of Christmas letter
sites, and we'll visit an excellent one next. It's called Christmas
and Santa Letter and is located at http://www.north-pole.co.uk
</P>
<P>
   /index5.htm. Not only can your child use the link on this site
to write a letter to Santa, there also is a link that will let
anyone send some of the prettiest electronic Christmas cards you'll
find on the Web. There's no cost for that service, either, and the
whole family probably will enjoy this place. The electronic
Christmas cards come in all varieties, including religious themes
and funny ones, too.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Claus Online also offers a fine way to send e-mail to the
North Pole at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .santaclausonline.com/
</P>
<P>
   santapages/letter.html.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find a form to fill out on this page. Then, just a bit
after you press the button to send your e-mail to Santa, you'll get
a canned reply. While most of the letter is traditional in nature,
some plugs for the products on the commercial site are included at
the bottom. So some parents may wish to avoid this site if the
notion of blending the commercial with the sublime bothers them.
</P>
<P>
   But don't worry. This is just a sampling of the places where
your child can write Santa. The selection is so broad you are sure
to be able to find the kind of site that appeals to your family.
Just use your favorite search engine and type in these search
terms: santa, online, letter. You'll get screenful after screenful
of sites that blend the old-fashioned spirit of the season with
this new-fangled Internet.

 &HT;    Going once, twice ... auctions to treasure
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Online auctions prove one of the basic truths of human
nature: One person's trash is another's treasure.
</P>
<P>
   The Web auction game is relatively new, and might be a little
too much for Web surfers just getting comfortable with online
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if you read the directions carefully and ignore the $250
Furbys (unless the money is going to charity), you can find your
own personal pot of gold _ or gold plate _ at an online auction.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most popular online auction houses are eBay
(http://www.ebay.com) and Yahoo! Auction (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .yahoo.com). On these sites, you'll be able to find nearly
everything your heart desires, from rare coins to collectible
Christmas ornaments, vintage Barbie dolls and Waterford crystal.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a collector, or know someone who is, purchasing a
hard-to-find treasure through an online auction can be fun and
rewarding. A quick survey of collectors of a variety of items
showed that for the most part, initial asking prices on the items
were what a person would expect to pay at a flea market, an
in-person auction or a retail store.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with all this in mind, newbies should take care to read
all the fine print before signing up or placing a bid. Once you
have purchased an item, you are conducting business with the person
auctioning the item. Yahoo! and eBay allow you to check up on both
buyer and seller. The eBay system has more checks and balances,
although problems are rare.
</P>
<P>
   There are sites such as Amazon.com, which have perfected the art
of one-click ordering, but eBay and other online auctioneers aren't
the sort of places where you log in, order up and log out. By their
very nature, these sites invite you to stay, take a look around and
see if they have any classic matchbox cars, Fiestaware soup bowls
or vintage rhinestone jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   If you see something you want to buy, that's great, but unlike
online retailers, you've got to register whether you are a buyer or
a seller. That way, if you develop a reputation as a con artist or
a welcher, the whole eBay community will find out via online
postings. And there truly is nothing worse than having a bad
reputation in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   For beginners, there's no better place to learn the ins and outs
of online auctions than eBay, which has an easy-to-follow tutorial,
a list of frequently asked questions and lots of other information
to help you before you bid. And even if you don't want to buy, it's
still fun to look. Recent items on sale at eBay included a 1983
DeLorean auto and a snuffbox featuring a painting of the Titanic
disaster. Yahoo! Auctions is equally easy to use and also requires
registration. There may be fewer items and the organization might
not be as efficient as eBay's, but if they have what you want, it
really doesn't matter what else they may have.
</P>
<P>
   With so much talk about sites that want to build community on
the Web, eBay and others create an instant community of like-minded
souls united by common interests. EBay founder Pierre Omidyar says
there may be only one or two collectors of a certain item in your
hometown, but there could be hundreds online. Here's where you can
find them and gather up some goodies along the way.

 &HT;    Altered dreams just as good as those pure ones we had as kids
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ One of the greatest things about being a
little kid is that
</P>
<P>
   nothing is impossible. Dreams are the truth of the moment and
reality is only in the perception.
</P>
<P>
   My young playmates and I operated in a world of infinite
possibilities. In the days of our youthful make-believe, we worked
hard at the fantasy of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Tootie always wanted to play opera. We'd improvise an apartment
on my front
</P>
<P>
   porch complete with a toy stove, a sink (with running water if
we filled the reservoir on the back), a tin teaset, and a toy
telephone. The oversized, cushioned glider was our bed.
</P>
<P>
   Tootie's plan was to have a penthouse (we all wanted one of
those because in the movies, truly glamourous people lived atop
buildings filled with other
</P>
<P>
   glamorous people), sing at the Met, and live in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Ann insisted we play newspaper. She wanted to be Brenda
Starr, dazzling
</P>
<P>
   girl reporter, writing and searching remote corners of the earth
for her elusive ``Mystery Man.''
</P>
<P>
   We all thought she could have made it if only her mom would have
allowed her to dye her hair copper penny red.
</P>
<P>
   My burning ambition never wavered. I was going to be a test
pilot of such fame that no matter where I happened to be in the
world, and no matter what great cause I was serving, when a new
fighter rolled out of the hangar, I'd be the one called to ``take
it up and wring it out.'' Later, I kind of lost interest when they
took the propellers off of airplanes. Jets just didn't look fierce
enough to suit me.
</P>
<P>
   Day after day, the three of us played on that porch, sharing our
dreams, confident that if we only believed hard enough, they would
all come true.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, as I was hoofing it around town, putting in my two
miles and trying to figure out what was with this spring-like
weather in December, I came upon a scene that took me back to those
times.
</P>
<P>
   Three little kids on a swingset were hollering at a fourth, a
little boy named Jimmy, who just happened to be standing in a
battered zinc washtub on top of a picnic table. ``Okay, now stay
still,'' a little girl yelled as they pumped their swings faster
and faster, stretching their toes to the limit to reach - what? In
a matter of seconds my question was answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop! Stop!'' the little girl screeched. The three swingers
dragged their heels, dug in their toes, and came to a halt. They
put their heads together and then walked over to Jimmy. ``Get out
of the tub a minute,'' the little girl ordered. Jimmy demurred but
after a brief discussion as to the possibility of moving the picnic
table closer to the swingset with him in the washtub, he gave in.
The kids put some muscle into it and began to shove the table
across the grass.
</P>
<P>
   After some dispute and a series of minor adjustments, the little
girl declared the operation a success and told Jimmy to get back in
the washtub which he did gladly, obviously enjoying his position as
top man in the tub.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy assumed an heroic stance, arms folded across his chest,
and declared
</P>
<P>
   himself ready. The kids pumped up their swings again. Faster and
higher, reaching with their toes toward Jimmy who appeared ready to
repel all encroachers on his washtub kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   But then the magic crumbled. Simultaneously and with shouts of
unbridled glee, three sets of feet collided with Jimmy's zinc
citadel and sent him flying, backside over tin tub, onto the grass.
He howled. Things hadn't quite worked as planned. Or maybe they had
- for the other three.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy wasn't hurt and I couldn't help but chuckle, thinking back
to the day I had come home from the movies with a new trick. I'd
just seen a man whip a tablecloth out from under four place
settings of fine china and crystal. I knew I could do it too, only
I wasn't dumb enough to risk smashing a table full of my mother's
dishes. Instead, I conned Tootie into standing on an old bedspread
while I snatched it out from under her. I assured her she'd be
unharmed. I was wrong. Tootie landed firmly on her backside and
went home yowling. I was in big
</P>
<P>
   trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But the dreams didn't die. Over the years we just altered them
slightly to
</P>
<P>
   fit new realities.That works too.

 &HT;    Why not pick up that new car in Europe?
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's time to face the age-old problem, what to buy as
holiday gifts. If your kids are grown, you are an empty nester or
if you have had enough of buying for buying's sake, perhaps one
major purchase for the household might be in order.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you have long thought about a European vacation for the
holidays. What could put you more in the season than to enjoy the
Old World ambience of the Yuletide? But practicality has always
dictated another option. Seems you always need more stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The one big-purchase option eliminates trips to the mall and all
that wrapping. This holiday season, Volvo is one of several
automakers that may have the answer to your dilemma. BMW,
Mercedes-Benz and Saab also offer European delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo's European delivery program, through March 31, includes
free round-trip airfare to Europe and one night's free hotel
accommodations. You must take delivery by Aug. 31. However,
customers who take delivery by this Dec. 31 will receive a second
night's hotel accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to turn the December deal into a weekend jaunt
to Europe. Just hop the red-eye out on Thursday evening, arrive in
Europe on Friday, schedule your hotel accommodations for Friday and
Saturday nights, enjoy Sunday on the Continent and then return home
on a Sunday evening flight.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the program only provides one ticket, but
sometimes alert shoppers can find a free or low-price companion
ticket. But even if you can't, you might save enough on your
purchase price to justify buying that plane ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The program guarantees as much as a 10 percent discount on the
purchase price. With pricing on all eligible models (the new S80
luxury sedan, C70 coupe, S70 sedan and V70 sportwagon) all
beginning at $35,000 or better, that's a cool $3,500 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo also promises to make the experience as hassle-free as
possible. It allows you to choose from 13 European cities in which
you may take delivery, including Berlin, Frankfurt, Geneva, London,
Madrid, Munich, Paris and Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo arranges for temporary registration and insurance, so
new-car owners can enjoy their vehicle throughout the vacation,
saving additional ground transportation costs and hassles. At the
end of the trip, Volvo will ship the new car from your drop-off
point of choice to your local retailer. Overseas freight expenses,
insurance and U.S. customs duty are among the many elements
included at no extra cost.
</P>
<P>
   Like to know more, but don't want to talk to a salesperson? Call
1-800-631-1667. Who knows, Santa just may have to look for you in
the Alps this year.

 &HT;    Article helps stamp out Windows 98 bugs
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any piece of software, no matter how good, is a work in
progress. Every company ships programs with lots of bugs, and that
includes the current operating system Microsoft Windows 98. Learn
about what bugs are in Win98 and how to fix at least some of them
in the December issue of Windows magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The December issue of Windows also includes a comprehensive
guide to Windows NT5, which is Microsoft's industrial-strength
operating system, typically used to run server computers. You'll
find a detailed discussion of NT's strengths and weaknesses as well
as a recommendation on who should use it.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   War and destruction remain popular, at least for computer game
makers. As always, many of the titles released this holiday season
feature war and are aimed at boys. Cavedog Entertainment, for
example, has released the ``Total Annihilation Commander Pack.'' It
includes ``Total Annihilation,'' a popular war game, and two
expansion sets. The pack retails for $44.99 and requires Windows 95
and a 100-megahertz Pentium computer.
</P>
<P>
   For something a little more benign, there's Wizardworks'
``Rudolph the Red-nose Reindeer's Magical Sleigh Ride.'' There's
not a single casualty in this computer CD game based on the
soon-to-be-released animated movie of the same name. In this game,
you help Santa gather toys for his ride, locate kids needing gifts
and print out holiday cards. Available for both PCs and Macs,
Rudolph retails for $19.99.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   If you are a fan of those little plastic replicas of people like
Darth Vader, check out a new site by Hasbro. It produces a lot of
these figures and now has a database of information about them
online. Called HasbroCollectors
</P>
<P>
   .com, the site will both sell these plastic figures and provide
a details about them. There are also chat rooms where collectors
can trade information and discuss their favorite figures. You'll
find the HasbroCollectors.com site at
http://www.HasbroCollectors.com.

 &HT;    Swatch branching out into pager business
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Swatch, the company that made the plastic watch cool,
has launched a line of plastic pagers. The Swatch Beep Box is round
with a regular-sized message screen placed above one round button.
</P>
<P>
   The beeper comes in three colors, airmail blue, black grape and
round table orange. Like America Online, the beeper lets you create
a ``buddy list,'' which lets you send group messages.
</P>
<P>
   The beepers are available on the Web, at http://www.swatch.com.
The Beep Boxes start at $100, which includes 1,000 pages and three
months of service. One thousand more pages cost $30. There is no
reactivation fee should you let your service lapse. The beeper
alone is on sale at electronics and Swatch retailers for $75.
</P>
<P>
   The Beep Box, made with help from Motorola, is a numeric pager.
It can store 16 messages, each with a time and date.
</P>
<P>
   A new way to attack 'mouse wrist' malady
</P>
<P>
   If the permanent aching wrist caused by keeping one hand on your
mouse all day is starting to bother you, a new device available
online might be your answer.
</P>
<P>
   Mousebar Co. out of Waterford, Wis., has a patented pad that
attaches either to your desk or your chair arm. The bar can be
moved backward and forward. It is made of plastic with a textured
surface for the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The bar, which retails for $28.95 plus $4.95 for shipping, comes
in light gray or charcoal. The bar is mounted with either a clamp
or adhesive. Both are included in the package.
</P>
<P>
   The guy who invented the bar, James Baranowski, uses computer
design tools at work and was looking for a way to ease the wrist
pain he was feeling after hours at his computer.
</P>
<P>
   The bar comes with a 30-day money back guarantee. It can be
ordered over the Internet at http://www.mousebar.com.
</P>
<P>
   Car maintenance meets the computer
</P>
<P>
   Some dads used to keep excruciatingly detailed facts about their
cars: how many miles per gallon the old Galaxy 500 got for each
fill-up dating to 1965, when the tires were bought, who from and
how much he paid. Now there's a software program to take all that
out of the glovebox and onto the PC.
</P>
<P>
   Dew Technology's Peak Performance lets the Type A types track
scheduled maintenance, unscheduled maintenance, gas mileage
performance and includes a maintenance forecast that tells you when
to rotate your tires, change your filters, tune your engine, flush
your radiator and change your transmission oil.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which retails for $49.95, lets you keep histories
of 10 vehicles. Minimum requirements are 3 megabytes of application
memory, a 486/66 megahertz processor, 8 megabytes of RAM and
Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   Peak Performance is available at the company's Web site,
</P>
<P>
   http://www.dewtech.com.
</P>
<P>
   Slice of Americana captured on CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Norman Rockwell, among the most traditional and American of
artists, has been brought into the high-tech world.
</P>
<P>
   On the 20th anniversary of his 1978 death, New Jersey's Cinegram
Media is offering an interactive CD-ROM called Norman Rockwell _
The Man and His Art. A disc of screen savers that includes more
than 30 of his better-known paintings is also available.
</P>
<P>
   The disc lets you ``tour'' Rockwell's Massachusetts studio,
``meet'' his models and view interviews Rockwell gave Edward R.
Murrow and others.
</P>
<P>
   The disc contains more than 450 images of Rockwell's paintings,
hundreds of photographs, an audio narrative, the complete series of
324 Saturday Evening Post covers and behind-the-scenes looks at his
more well-known works.
</P>
<P>
   The disc is available at software retailers, or online at
http://www.cinegram.com, for $69.95. The screen saver collection
sells for $29.95.
</P>
<P>
   Exploring the hottest Web business models
</P>
<P>
   Corporations compete with business models rather than products.
The folks at Amazon.com sell the same books as those at B Dalton
Bookseller, but Amazon.com is hot because its business model _
buying books over the Internet _ keeps you out of the malls. The
idea that models, not products, will pave the way to corporate gold
is the premise behind the cover story in the Dec. 7 issue of
Fortune.
</P>
<P>
   A special section called ``The E-Corporation: More Than Just
Web-based, It's Building a New Industrial Order,'' explores the
idea of that the ``hottest and most dangerous new business models
are out there on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   If you can't program it, just try talking to it
</P>
<P>
   After years of making VCRs that were somewhat difficult to
program, companies have been making simpler machines. Now, Zenith
Electronics has taken that one step further. The company that
brought the remote control to market is offering SpeakEZ, a way to
control the recording function of your VCR with your voice.
</P>

 &HT;    Encarta is tops, but still has errors
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Microsoft's Encarta has been at the top of the heap of
popular electronic encyclopedias since its first appearance, and
the 1999 edition will not lose that place.
</P>
<P>
   The interface has been tweaked, not all of it for the good. It
takes more mouse clicks now, in some cases, to get what you want.
But it remains easy to use, and all articles are displayed in
large, easy-to-read text.
</P>
<P>
   The deluxe version is now a three-disc set, one disc being used
entirely for installation and the inevitable attempt to stuff
Explorer down your throat. It does this with a vengeance _ no by
your leave, no ``would you like to.'' It just sets up Explorer as
your default browser. I find that infuriating.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Encarta is a fine encyclopedia, with a heavier
emphasis on the arts than most. There are, for instance, large and
well-done sections on ceramics, woodworking and furniture. All
music (that I listened to, at any rate) was presented in excerpts
from commercial recordings.
</P>
<P>
   The sections on flamenco and bullfighting remain essentially
unchanged, and quite good except for the usual incorrect captions,
questionable choice of photos and unfortunate tendency to try to
force the bullfight into the general category of sports.
</P>
<P>
   Entries on firearms, which I have not previously examined, have
some very strange problems. As curator of arms at the West Point
museum, Robert W. Fisch may not have been the best choice to write
the little section on shotguns; clearly he is out of touch when he
tells us, ``Modern pump-action and semi-automatic shotguns equally
share the field with the similar side-by-side and single-barreled
pieces ...''
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be a museum curator to know pumps and
semi-autos rule the field, and the traditional double gun is no
longer made by major manufacturers, having been largely replaced by
over-and-under guns.
</P>
<P>
   The biography of John Moses Browning, the greatest arms designer
who ever lived, is unsigned. Probably a good thing, since it
contains ludicrous errors and, for want of a better term,
understatements. It says Browning invented ``two machine guns ...
the Colt Peacemaker and the Browning Automatic Rifle.''
</P>
<P>
   Peacemaker, of course, is the popular name of the Colt's Single
Action Army, the single most popular handgun of the American West
following the Civil War, and by no stretch of the imagination a
machine gun.
</P>
<P>
   The bio goes on with the offhand statement that Browning ``also
designed an automatic pistol.'' It is for this, embodied originally
in the Colt M1911A and refined later in the Browning Hi-Power, that
Browning is chiefly known today. Both weapons have been changed but
little since their inception and remain the most popular of all
semi-auto designs.

 &HT;    Road to telecommuting more likely just a cow path
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I am telecommuting today. Instead of sitting behind my
two work computers _ a G3 Macintosh and a Pentium II PC _ that are
connected to a high-speed data line and all the various news
services that pump information into any modern newspaper, I have my
feet propped up on my desk in a spare bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   The cat is curled up in the sunshine nearby, and I am
barefooted.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommuting is fine for what I am doing at this moment:
writing a column. And if that were all I did in my newspaper job,
there would be no reason to trek into the office at all, unless
someone were retiring and chocolate cake were being served.
</P>
<P>
   But because my job involves so many different things _
discussing stories with reporters who cover technology, sometimes
talking to readers with a question and often pacing around waiting
for a reporter's story to edit _ telecommuting isn't a real
substitute for being there.
</P>
<P>
   In my old-fogey opinion, at least, that daily commute in your
car is unlikely to be replaced _ on a day-to-day basis at least _
with a cyber-office at home.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you picture regular commuting as driving along the
interstate in a modern automobile, this telecommuting stuff amounts
to pedaling to work on a rickety bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if _ despite the appeal of working from home _ it would
work for most folks I know. Among my friends are physicians who
would be hard-pressed to work in a cyber sort of way, a fellow who
installs and maintains commercial roofs (I can't picture him
pouring on an extra layer of tar this way, no matter how fast the
Internet connection) and several graduate students who spend their
days arguing in class. Typing out messages might work for them, but
it sure wouldn't work as well.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that I have spoken before at telecommuting
conferences and certainly despite the fact I like the notion that _
in just a moment or two _ I'll be able to eat some of my sister's
famous Thanksgiving fruit salad and eat it here at my desk, I have
real doubts that telecommuting represents an important future in
the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lot like wrapping a leaking radiator hose with duct tape
_ it works better than nothing but isn't a permanent solution. So
today _ forced to stay home by a stomach that is riding some kind
of internal roller coaster _ I'm glad I can sit here with the cat.
And I'm sure the reporters I edit are happy I am not pacing about
their desk, trying to look unconcerned as I wait for their stories.
</P>
<P>
   But there are so many things _ little and big _ I can't do
today. And I won't be able to see how fast the other guy is typing,
or spend a moment to ask about his Thanksgiving. The real problem
isn't goofing off _ I'm typing as fast as I can _ but work without
the human touch is a pretty bland sort of thing.
</P>
<P>
   Look, there are plenty of folks who disagree, and maybe my
telecommuting today represents some real future. But I'm glad to
tell you what I think anyway. With all the voices for change and
all those eloquent people who explain how technology will make life
better, it is good to have one lonely voice here in the
cyber-wilderness who understands the value of being a human in a
cyber world.

 &HT;    UT teaching grad students to avoid academia-speak
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ University researchers talk so much about
standard deviations, null hypotheses and scientific paradigms that
people outside the academic world have formulated their own
standard reply: ``Huh?''
</P>
<P>
   Universities are beginning to pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   As the job market for academics has tightened, the University of
Texas and other schools are training future scientists, professors
and business people to be not just good at research, but also able
to make people understand it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard people say the problem is we're cloning ourselves
at a time when the market has really changed and the world needs
different people,'' said Rick Cherwitz, UT's associate dean of
graduate studies. ``Personally, I think that goes too far ... but
there are some things we need to be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those, he said, is teaching graduate students to become
better communicators. What began as an experimental program with
three courses in the summer of 1997 has been expanded to 10 regular
courses this school year. Called the Graduate Professional
Development Program, its main focus is on writing and speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Students from the sciences, engineering and the arts have
clamored to get in, UT officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people out there are hungry for writing teachers''
whether they are in academia, business or government, said Betty
Sue Flowers, an English professor and guest lecturer at a recent
class on academic and professional writing.
</P>
<P>
   She, too, has heard the criticism about inaccessible, esoteric
academic writing. Even people inside universities complain they
can't understand their peers.
</P>
<P>
   The Boyer Commission on Educating Undergraduates in the Research
University said in a recent report:
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowhere are the failures of graduate education more serious
than in the skills of communication. Corporate leaders complain
that new Ph.D.s too often fail as communicators and cannot advance
their own careers or contribute to the success of their
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Flowers has taught writing to lawyers and judges and has trained
corporate executives, including leaders of General Motors and Shell
Oil, how to articulate their visions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes a difference in the world is not the facts as much
as how you tell the stories,'' Flowers told the class. ``If you
change your story, you can change the world. ... I think that's
what happened when our country was founded.''
</P>
<P>
   Students in the class, led by Professor JoyLynn Reed, said they
enjoyed getting feedback on their writing and learning with
students from different fields. Reed uses a tape recorder when
critiquing student papers, and students were eager to get the tapes
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great deal of jargon in the medical and health
professions, and a lot of times, individuals don't understand what
we're telling them,'' said Bobbie Sue Sterling, 50, a nurse working
on a doctorate in parent-child health. ``This course is helping me
learn how to write better to a general audience, and that will make
me a better nurse educator.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Stone, 23, who is working on a master's in accounting, said
that even though she works with numbers, words are equally
important. She must learn to write analyses of financial statements
and other reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``How to approach writing is what I have learned from this
class,'' she said. ``I've become a more confident writer, and it's
good to practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Samarth Pai, who is 23 and working on a master's in computer
science, said he has learned that some of the most successful
people are not necessarily the ones with the most ingenious ideas.
They are the people who communicate their ideas best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do a lot of writing, and I thought a writing class would be
essential so people would understand what I'm saying,'' he said.
``When you write, you learn. This helps me clarify my ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Flowers advised the class to avoid ``writing for the lowest
common denominator.'' Instead, she said, when conveying complex
ideas to a broad audience ``generalize at a level that would make
you squirm.''
</P>
<P>
   Most professors don't teach people how to write for nonacademic
audiences, said Robert King, a linguistics professor and former
College of Liberal Arts dean who also spoke to Reed's class. King
said he writes newspaper opinion pieces to share ideas with a broad
audience. Newspapers use short sentences and short paragraphs _ a
style researchers can emulate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short, good. Long, bad,'' King said. ``If you're using more
than one semicolon in a sentence, you're getting dangerously close
to the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Jules LaPidus, president of the Council of Graduate Schools,
applauded the UT program and sees it as part of a national trend to
better prepare doctoral students for work outside academia.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he said, only about half of the students who come out of
major research universities are interested in teaching. Even fewer
will get jobs as schools hire more part-time faculty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ivory tower is not the ivory tower anymore,'' Reed said.
``The walls around the university need to come down, and teaching
students to communicate to broader audiences is one way to do
that.''

 &HT;    The X factor in parenting is knowing when to say 'when'
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ I've not been in the position, only in the
breathless spectator role. But I've come to believe that only when
the baby's head peeks out through the cervix is ``push'' a
clear-cut decision.
</P>
<P>
   Mom pushes. Child responds. Don't get used to it.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a dad, you'll do lots of pushing _ strollers, swings,
merry-go-rounds. But generally it will be on the wings of your
child's desire.
</P>
<P>
   You could be a control freak and force every decision on your
child. But at some point even the sternest parent must take ``no''
for an answer. That's particularly true when the child digs canals
in your neck with purple fingernails and won't let go.
</P>
<P>
   Some will say: ``You must lay down the law.'' But at some point,
wild boars cannot pull a resistant child from your neck.
</P>
<P>
   I'm thinking of a swimming lesson in which our eldest son, then
6, absolutely, positively refused to jump into the deep end. The
instructor was just as resolute. She wouldn't take no.
</P>
<P>
   She finally convinced him that she'd be there to catch him in
the water. He flung his quivering self right on top of her.
</P>
<P>
   It was like a mackerel landing on a lilly pad. Both went under.
Both grappled for something to hold. Fully clothed, I was crouched
to leap in to save somebody when she managed to right herself.
</P>
<P>
   She should have taken ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting a child to do homework, or brush teeth, or clean up a
room is not so much the issue. These are things that must be done.
</P>
<P>
   The real issues are endeavors like youth sports, or music
lessons, or other things you consider enrichment.
</P>
<P>
   'It's good for you'
</P>
<P>
   When do you push? When do you know that a child who says ``no''
is just being lazy, backing away from a challenge, or that he or
she really, fiercely, doesn't want to do it?
</P>
<P>
   I offer no answer. Maybe you have one.
</P>
<P>
   Our youngest son is a good athlete. But he's always resisted
organized sports. He's played no Little League. He went out for
soccer at 9, but felt disadvantaged against boys who'd been playing
since they were 5. He quit.
</P>
<P>
   I knew he could compete. Should I have pushed? I mined him for
reasons, gave him several chances to change his mind. He didn't.
</P>
<P>
   From my own experience and knowing his ability, I was certain
organized sports would be fun for him. But I have never pushed.
</P>
<P>
   And what do you know. This fall at the ripe age of 11 he decided
he wanted to take basketball skills honed on the driveway against
dad and join a league, which he did Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Mom decides to push
</P>
<P>
   Our oldest son is less of a jock, but is a dynamo in a host of
creative arts. He's also got the average teen bio-rhythmic pattern,
which wavers between manic zest for life and, ``Wake me when the
world ends. On second thought, you'll be extinct . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout their school years both boys have participated in the
PTA Reflections program _ a local, state, national competition with
categories in visual arts, photography, writing and music. They've
won their share of accolades. This year Michael, the oldest, had a
great idea for a Reflections poster, but as the deadline was
approaching his lower lip was collecting cat hair in one of his low
modes. His mom, who'd purchased materials for the project, decided
not to take no for an answer when he sloughed off encouragement.
She made it an order.
</P>
<P>
   Under duress, he started to work. It wasn't long that, great
idea as it was, he got immersed. What began grudgingly turned a
Michelangelesque epic. He had pencil grime on his chin. He stayed
up all night. The result was stunning:
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks, Mom, for pushing me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And if you think that's stunning, you should see the poster. Why
doesn't someone tell us when to push?
</P>
<P>
   John Young is the opinion page editor of the Waco
Tribune-Herald. His column appears Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday.

   1. FROM BROOKLYN TO KOSOVO, WITH LOVE AND AK-47s A single
photograph decorates the office walls of Triangle Contractors in an
old house on Cortelyou Road in Brooklyn. It depicts a young man
with a Kalashnikov slung across his chest, a pistol tucked into his
belt and another automatic weapon in his hands. He is a key to
understanding the Kosovo Liberation Army, the ethnic-Albanian
guerrilla movement fighting for independence from Serbia. By Stacy
Sullivan. From The New York Times Magazine. Full-length (5,000
words) + edited article available. 2. DOROTHY DAY : TOO SAINTLY FOR
SAINTHOOD? Dorothy Day died in 1980, at the age of 83. A year ago,
to mark what would have been her 100th birthday, John Cardinal
O'Connor of New York announced he would take up the cause for her
canonization. Day was one of the greatest religious figures of the
century, and one of the most paradoxical. She founded the Catholic
Worker, a loose aggregation of ``houses of hospitality,'' communal
farms, newspapers and round-table discussions for ``further
clarification of thought.'' And if there was anything she did not
want, it was to be called a saint. By Paul Elie. From The New York
Times Magazine. Full-length (3,400 words) + edited article
available. 3. STORM IN THE ENGLISH CHANNEL : THE FIGHT OVER FEUDAL
SARK Life on the island of Sark, a speck in the English Channel not
far from the French coast, is a bizarre mix of the old and new. No
cars are allowed on the island, and a feudal-style lord still
retains archaic powers (e.g. deciding who may marry whom.) Yet Sark
and other Channel Islands have embraced the savage side of modern
capitalism by allowing dubious foreign firms to set up,''shell''
companies to avoid taxes or cover shady trade. Britain wants this
to end, but its authority to enforce change is limited. By Hans
Hoyng. From Der Spiegel. 1,000 words. (English translation
available.) 4. CARTOONIST'S SATIRE LOST ON SOME READERS Bill
Maxwell used to think that opinion columnists were the loneliest
souls at newspapers. ``I now believe that editorial cartoonists are
the ultimate outsiders,'' he writes. ``They are the most
misunderstood of all journalists because their craft - alternately
making us laugh, curse and think - is finicky and strange to us.''
From New America News Service. 1,000 words.

NEW SCIENTIST MAGAZINE (N/A Brazil, Australia, New Zealand) A.
SELLING THE FAMILY SECRETS Iceland's 270,000 citizens are a dream
come true for genetics researchers. One thousand years of
near-isolation has meant their ancestry can be traced right back to
the original Viking and Irish settlers. Now Iceland plans to put
its people's genetic history in the hands of a single company to
create a special database. The deal could put privacy at risk, with
damaging consequences for genetics research everywhere. By Andy

explains why it pays to cheat on your partner. 1,500 words. C. JUST

   December can be a frustrating month for those who want to
proclaim the joy of science along with the joy of the season. It
can be especially difficult for parents looking for gifts to please
their little ones. What follows are some of the best toys on the
market for the up-and-coming scientists in your family.
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; YEAR OF THE ROBOT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year NASA's Sojourner robot caught the world's attention as
it trolled across the Martian landscape, sniffing alien rocks and
radioing back information about their composition.
</P>
<P>
   Images of the intrepid rover at work not only gave us a new
sense of Mars _ they also conveyed a powerful message about how
robots are extending the reach of human exploration, and human
imagination, to other worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, robots are well represented among the
science-themed toys this season.
</P>
<P>
   By far the year's most radical new toy _ if it can in fact be
called a toy _ is lego's Mindstorms ($200, LEGO, 800-453-4652,
www.legomindstorms.com). This kit, the product of a lengthy
collaboration with MIT's Media Lab, lets aspiring roboticists (age
12 to very adult) build and program their own mechanical creations.
</P>
<P>
   Commands for the robot are written on a personal computer using
lego's custom-designed software. It assumes no previous programming
experience and incorporates a reassuring tutorial to guide novices
through the basics.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than writing actual lines of computer code, you string
together graphic blocks, each representing a single instruction for
the robot.
</P>
<P>
   When you are done, you download the program to the robot's
onboard microprocessor using an infrared transmitter, and it's
ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   The kit provides instructions for 12 projects, such as an
intruder alarm and a trail tracker. Two expansion packs, $50 each,
that will allow the construction of more complicated robots should
be available soon.
</P>
<P>
   Do not expect Mindstorms to be all plug and play. The print and
computer guides give you extensive help; further advice is
available on the company's Web site. But LEGO wants you to use your
brain and figure things out on your own.
</P>
<P>
   If your heart is set on actual NASA robots, Learning Curve has
the toys for you. The Robotix Mars Discovery Pack ($9.99, Learning
Curve, 800-704-8697) lets you build a tolerably accurate replica of
Sojourner, complete with antenna and alpha proton X-ray
spectrometer. You can add a power pack to make your Sojourner move
on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Learning Curve has instructions on its Web site
(www.learningcurve.com) for constructing a much more detailed
Sojourner using parts from several of the company's robot kits.
</P>
<P>
   The company also sells the Volcanic Crawler, $49.99, a
self-powered model of Dante, the volcano-explorer robot. With its
rolling, insectlike gait, the crawler conveys how Dante traversed
obstacles during its infernal mission.
</P>
<P>
   If you get bored following NASA's lead, you can snap together
the intricately molded Robotix parts into a mechanical brute of
your own design.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DYNAMICS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even the simplest mechanical toys can still provide a great deal
of enjoyment if properly designed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, you can really let your imagination go with Zoobs
($39.99 for a 120-unit set, Primordial, 415-923-1895,
www.zoob.com). These brightly colored plastic parts snap together
in ball-and-socket arrangements fashioned after the plastic models
used to represent the atoms in a molecule.
</P>
<P>
   The accompanying guidebook shows how to assemble the Zoob units
into various playful forms: a person, a Tyrannosaurus rex, a
helicopter, even a crown that looks like one of Harold Edgerton's
milk-drop photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Building the larger constructions takes some work. Fortunately,
the instructions are straightforward and the design of the zoobs is
inherently forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   In a lighter vein, Draganfly Innovations has brought to our
planet the Remote Controlled Flying Saucer ($87, 800-979-9794). The
saucer is a two-foot-wide silver Mylar balloon that must be filled
with helium. A dual-fan propulsion unit and ballast putty attach to
the balloon's underside.
</P>
<P>
   Using the remote control, you can make the saucer turn, go
forward, and ascend and descend (a breeze could quickly whisk it
away, so this toy must stay indoors).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; UPDATING THE CLASSICS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some seemingly immortal toys have recently taken on new guises.
Take the Frisbee, whose simple shape might seem immune to
modernizing. Guess again. Chuck Hoberman, the man who brought you
the expandable Hoberman sphere, now unveils the Pocket Flight Ring
($9.95, Hoberman Designs, 212-647-7656, www.hoberman.com/fold/).
</P>
<P>
   Folded, it is about the diameter of a compact disc and does in
fact fit into a large pants pocket; open it and it more than
doubles in size. Then pop it flat and _ voila _ you've got a decent
throwing ring.
</P>
<P>
   Does your kid have what it takes to strike out the likes of
Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire? He or she can find out by winding up
with the Radar Ball ($39, Rawlings, 800-729-5464,
www.rawlings.com), a softball with an electronic brain.
</P>
<P>
   A radar gun buried inside the ball measures the speed of a pitch
and indicates the results on a tiny built-in lcd screen. Serious
pitches are required to activate the circuitry, and beware: the
Radar Ball is designed for pitching only, not hitting.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NO BATTERIES REQUIRED &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alternative-energy toys eliminate the dreary holiday ritual of
running to the store to find batteries for the idle gadgets lying
amid the wrapping paper. They can also address more serious issues.
Trevor Baylis, a British inventor, hit on the idea of a windup
radio to improve communications in parts of Africa where
electricity and batteries are unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting Freeplay radio ($79.95, BayGen, 914-258-5660,
www.freeplay.net) is built in a South African factory that employs
disabled persons. A full crank provides about one hour of playing
time. Outdoors, a solar panel molded into the radio's case
generates supplemental power. A single large speaker produces fine
sound.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to do without batteries is to make your own. The
Fruit Powered Clock ($13, Schylling, 800-541-2929,
www.schylling.com) and the Two Potato Clock ($17.95, Skilcraft,
available through Edmund Scientific, 800-728-6999) use copper and
zinc electrodes to transform various fruits and vegetables into
low-voltage power supplies, sufficient to run these small LCD
clocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Fruit Powered Clock has the more dramatic look and comes
with a proper scientific explanation of how it works. The Two
Potato Clock, on the other hand, is a more reliable timepiece in
our experience, and less likely to deposit bits of rotting apple on
your coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   Happy shopping!

   The company also sells the Volcanic Crawler, $49.99, a
self-powered model of Dante, the volcano-explorer robot. With its
rolling, insectlike gait, the crawler conveys how Dante traversed
obstacles during its infernal mission.

<P>
   Even the simplest mechanical toys can still provide a great deal
of enjoyment if properly designed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, you can really let your imagination go with Zoobs
($39.99 for a 120-unit set, Primordial, 415-923-1895,
www.zoob.com). These brightly colored plastic parts snap together
in ball-and-socket arrangements fashioned after the plastic models
used to represent the atoms in a molecule.
</P>
<P>
   The accompanying guidebook shows how to assemble the Zoob units
into various playful forms: a person, a Tyrannosaurus rex, a
helicopter, even a crown that looks like one of Harold Edgerton's
milk-drop photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Building the larger constructions takes some work. Fortunately,
the instructions are straightforward and the design of the zoobs is
inherently forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   In a lighter vein, Draganfly Innovations has brought to our
planet the Remote Controlled Flying Saucer ($87, 800-979-9794). The
saucer is a two-foot-wide silver Mylar balloon that must be filled
with helium. A dual-fan propulsion unit and ballast putty attach to
the balloon's underside.
</P>
<P>
   Using the remote control, you can make the saucer turn, go
forward, and ascend and descend (a breeze could quickly whisk it
away, so this toy must stay indoors).

<P>
   &UR; UPDATING THE CLASSICS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some seemingly immortal toys have recently taken on new guises.
Take the Frisbee, whose simple shape might seem immune to
modernizing. Guess again. Chuck Hoberman, the man who brought you
the expandable Hoberman sphere, now unveils the Pocket Flight Ring
($9.95, Hoberman Designs, 212-647-7656, www.hoberman.com/fold/).
</P>
<P>
   Folded, it is about the diameter of a compact disc and does in
fact fit into a large pants pocket; open it and it more than
doubles in size. Then pop it flat and _ voila _ you've got a decent
throwing ring.
</P>
<P>
   Does your kid have what it takes to strike out the likes of
Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire? He or she can find out by winding up
with the Radar Ball ($39, Rawlings, 800-729-5464,
www.rawlings.com), a softball with an electronic brain.
</P>
<P>
   A radar gun buried inside the ball measures the speed of a pitch
and indicates the results on a tiny built-in lcd screen. Serious
pitches are required to activate the circuitry, and beware: the
Radar Ball is designed for pitching only, not hitting.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Alternative-energy toys eliminate the dreary holiday ritual of
running to the store to find batteries for the idle gadgets lying
amid the wrapping paper. They can also address more serious issues.
Trevor Baylis, a British inventor, hit on the idea of a windup
radio to improve communications in parts of Africa where
electricity and batteries are unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting Freeplay radio ($79.95, BayGen, 914-258-5660,
www.freeplay.net) is built in a South African factory that employs
disabled persons. A full crank provides about one hour of playing
time. Outdoors, a solar panel molded into the radio's case
generates supplemental power. A single large speaker produces fine
sound.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to do without batteries is to make your own. The
Fruit Powered Clock ($13, Schylling, 800-541-2929,
www.schylling.com) and the Two Potato Clock ($17.95, Skilcraft,
available through Edmund Scientific, 800-728-6999) use copper and
zinc electrodes to transform various fruits and vegetables into
low-voltage power supplies, sufficient to run these small LCD
clocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Fruit Powered Clock has the more dramatic look and comes
with a proper scientific explanation of how it works. The Two
Potato Clock, on the other hand, is a more reliable timepiece in
our experience, and less likely to deposit bits of rotting apple on
your coffee table.

   December can be a frustrating month for those who want to
proclaim the joy of science along with the joy of the season. It
can be especially difficult for parents looking for gifts to please
their little ones. What follows are some of the best toys on the
market for the up-and-coming scientists in your family.
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; YEAR OF THE ROBOT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year NASA's Sojourner robot caught the world's attention as
it trolled across the Martian landscape, sniffing alien rocks and
radioing back information about their composition.
</P>
<P>
   Images of the intrepid rover at work not only gave us a new
sense of Mars _ they also conveyed a powerful message about how
robots are extending the reach of human exploration, and human
imagination, to other worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, robots are well represented among the
science-themed toys this season.
</P>
<P>
   By far the year's most radical new toy _ if it can in fact be
called a toy _ is lego's Mindstorms ($200, LEGO, 800-453-4652,
www.legomindstorms.com). This kit, the product of a lengthy
collaboration with MIT's Media Lab, lets aspiring roboticists (age
12 to very adult) build and program their own mechanical creations.
</P>
<P>
   Commands for the robot are written on a personal computer using
lego's custom-designed software. It assumes no previous programming
experience and incorporates a reassuring tutorial to guide novices
through the basics.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than writing actual lines of computer code, you string
together graphic blocks, each representing a single instruction for
the robot.
</P>
<P>
   When you are done, you download the program to the robot's
onboard microprocessor using an infrared transmitter, and it's
ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   The kit provides instructions for 12 projects, such as an
intruder alarm and a trail tracker. Two expansion packs, $50 each,
that will allow the construction of more complicated robots should
be available soon.
</P>
<P>
   Do not expect Mindstorms to be all plug and play. The print and
computer guides give you extensive help; further advice is
available on the company's Web site. But LEGO wants you to use your
brain and figure things out on your own.
</P>
<P>
   If your heart is set on actual NASA robots, Learning Curve has
the toys for you. The Robotix Mars Discovery Pack ($9.99, Learning
Curve, 800-704-8697) lets you build a tolerably accurate replica of
Sojourner, complete with antenna and alpha proton X-ray
spectrometer. You can add a power pack to make your Sojourner move
on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Learning Curve has instructions on its Web site
(www.learningcurve.com) for constructing a much more detailed
Sojourner using parts from several of the company's robot kits.
</P>
<P>
   The company also sells the Volcanic Crawler, $49.99, a
self-powered model of Dante, the volcano-explorer robot. With its
rolling, insectlike gait, the crawler conveys how Dante traversed
obstacles during its infernal mission.
</P>

   MURRAY-COLUMN -- LUFKIN, Texas -- The big news in my little
hometown is that the interstate highway system has finally found
its way here, some 40 or 50 years after cementing together most
everywhere else in the nation. (Murray, Cox News Service). MOVED
FRIDAY.
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN -- WACO, Texas -- When do you push? When do you
know that a child who says ``no'' is just being lazy, backing away
from a challenge, or that he or she really, fiercely, doesn't want
to do it? (Young, Waco Tribune-Herald. ) MOVED.

<P>
   SKUBE-COLUMN -- Pulitzer winner Michael Skube's weekly lifestyle
commentary. (Skube, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) ETA: 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN -- GIBSONBURG, Ohio -- One of the greatest things
about being a little kid is that nothing is impossible. Dreams are
the truth of the moment and reality is only in the perception. But
as we grow older, these dreams get altered -- not a bad thing
really. (Schuett, Cox News Service). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   EZZARD-COLUMN - ATLANTA - William Bowen and Derek Bok's book,
``The Shape of the River,'' should be required reading for
policymakers. But I can say with certainty it won't be. Those who
oppose affirmative action, be they Californians or Georgians,
aren't open to real data. (Ezzard, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
MOVED
</P>
<P>
   LANE-COLUMN - I look forward to the next election with fearful
anticipation. Any battle between practical idealism and
compassionate conservatism could prove seriously amusing. (Lane,

VIRGINIA LIBRARY BOARD GIVEN LESSON IN FREE SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the

Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is

<P>
   Libraries have long been the front lines in the battle to
preserve freedom of speech and the corollary liberty, the freedom
to read. Recently, the battle intensified when libraries began
offering their patrons the use of computers with access to the
Internet. The new thrust aims at Internet smut and Web porn.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber-censors warn that such material curdles the minds of
viewers _ adults as well as children. They want to filter it out _
so that the electronic stream of Internet data that flows into a
library computer doesn't contain even tiny bits and pieces of
information about forbidden sex.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, despite claims to the contrary, no software filter
has ever been built that only blocks out material that is either
obscene, under the legal definition, or child pornography. Neither
category of speech is protected by the First Amendment and access
to such material can be legitimately prohibited. However, even the
best and most expensive filters block speech that is protected.
</P>
<P>
   To cyber-censors, that doesn't matter. To them, the First
Amendment is an inconvenience, a troublesome buzzing thing that
interferes with their control of the flow of information.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court struck down two major
provisions of the Communications Decency Act that were intended to
protect minors from ``indecent'' and ``patently offensive''
communications on the Internet. The high court said that ``in order
to deny minors access to potentially harmful speech, the CDA
effectively suppresses a large amount of speech that adults have a
constitutional right to receive and to address to one another.''
The court found the law unconstitutional. The court's opinion ended
with these words: ``The interest in encouraging freedom of
expression in a democratic society outweighs any theoretical but
unproven benefit of censorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Cyber-censors don't believe it. Or haven't read it. Or don't
know what the high court means.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no surprise that the Internet policy adopted by Loudoun
County (Va.) Library Board of Trustees in October 1997, which
required site-blocking filters on all computers with access to the
Internet, was struck down this Nov. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber-censors don't get it.
</P>
<P>
   The library purchased a commercial site-blocking software called
X-Stop manufactured by Log-On Data Corp., but the board of trustees
recognized that X-Stop might not filter out all sexual material on
the Internet. A policy was written that would plug up any holes in
the filter.
</P>
<P>
   The library's 1997 Internet policy prohibited adult patrons from
pulling up Web sites that contain material ``deemed Harmful to
Juveniles'' _ whatever that means. Would a Web site that informed a
reader of rape and violence in federal prisons be harmful to
minors?
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 policy mandated that Internet computers ``be installed
in close proximity to, and in full view of, library staff'' without
privacy screens on the computers. The policy warns that public
access to soft-core pornography ``could create an unlawful sexually
hostile environment, and might incite dangerous criminal
misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   The policy treated all the library patrons like prepubescent
children who wanted nothing so much in life as a peek at sexual
material. And it forced the librarians who worked there to act like
stern mothers who just knew their kids were trying to get away with
something naughty.
</P>
<P>
   The library receives its funding from tax dollars. The library
board is selected by elected county officials. The library is a
quasi-governmental agency _ and as such, it must abide by the U.S.
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   A group of citizens who live in Loudoun County, calling
themselves Mainstream Loudoun, filed a lawsuit in federal court
claiming that the library policy infringes on their right to free
speech under the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was joined by a number of Web site providers whose
sites were blocked by the X-Stop filter: Christopher Filkins for
The Safer Sex Page; Jeremy Meyers for Books for Gay and Lesbian
Teens/Youth; San Francisco Examiner columnist Robert Morse; artist
Sergio Arau, whose work is published on Web sites; and the American
Association of University Women.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Leonie Brinkema of the U.S. District Court of the Eastern
District of Virginia covered all the bases in declaring the library
policy and use of filters unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The library was under no obligation to provide Internet access
to its patrons, Brinkema wrote, but once it did so, the library is
``restricted by the First Amendment in the limitations it is
allowed to place on patron access.'' The government can only limit
access to protected speech if it has a compelling interest, and
then it must narrowly tailor the way it accomplishes its goal.
</P>
<P>
   Brinkema found that the library board could not support its
contention that unrestricted use of the Internet would create a
sexually hostile work environment. The library board's expert could
only find three isolated incidents nationally and one in a
different Virginia library where patrons used Internet access to
look at pornography. Nor could the expert find a single complaint
from library employees anywhere in the country that blamed
unfettered Internet access for creating a hostile workplace.
Therefore, the judge pointed out there is no compelling government
interest.
</P>
<P>
   The use of filtering software on all the library computers, the
judge wrote, isn't narrowly tailored to accomplish the library's
goal. The filter blocks too many legitimate Web sites containing
protected speech that have nothing to do with obscene material.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating a theme in the Supreme Court's CDA ruling, the judge
wrote that the policy restricts the access of adult patrons to the
level of what is deemed unfit for minors.
</P>
<P>
   The library board does not know what sites are actually blocked
by the X-Stop filter. The owners of X-Stop would not supply that
information. Therefore, the filter and the policy together created
an unconstitutional prior restraint against blocked Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, the judge granted a summary judgment against
the library so that it could not enforce its 1997 policy. It is
unlikely the library board will appeal.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 1, the library adopted a more reasonable policy that
allows patrons to use filtered or unfiltered forms of Internet
access. Internet computers may have privacy screens installed.
Parents will decide whether their children may use filtered or
unfiltered Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Brinkema's decision is a victory for freedom of speech that will
send tiny ripples out westward across the nation. Nevertheless,
cyber-censors never rest. There will be other cases, other
libraries under the gun.
</P>
<P>

Freedom To Read Foundation Board, the litigating arm of the

   National debate on gasoline additive spills into Texas
</P>
<P>
   By BILL DAWSON &QL; 
Houston Chronicle Environment Writer
</P>
<P>
   A common gasoline additive is at the center of a national
controversy now spilling into Texas, where officials are
considering a mandate that could increase its use across the
eastern third of the state.
</P>
<P>
   The complex debate, mixing an inter-industry squabble with
concerns about both air and water pollution, typifies the tough
trade-off decisions that often confront environmental
policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
   The chemical in question, usually known by the abbreviated name
MTBE, started being used in gasoline in the late 1970s as an octane
booster to replace lead.
</P>
<P>
   As a method for reducing vehicle emissions of smog-forming and
other air pollutants, more MTBE has been added in recent years to
gasoline sold in some areas with particularly bad air quality
problems, including Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   MTBE, however, is the focus of a growing outcry in parts of the
country _ mainly California and the Northeast so far _ because it
has contaminated some sources of drinking water there.
</P>
<P>
   The chemical dissolves readily in water, adding a foul taste and
odor at very low concentrations. At higher but still minute
concentrations in water, federal officials regard it as a
``possible'' cancer-causing agent.
</P>
<P>
   Texas officials are scheduled on Dec. 16 to begin considering a
rule ordering the sale of cleaner-burning gasoline in a wide region
including San Antonio, Austin, Corpus Christi and East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   As drafted, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission's
new gasoline rule for that area would not require MTBE, but it
would allow refiners to use it to meet emission-limiting
specifications.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires an oxygen-adding chemical in the even
lower-emission ``reformulated gasoline,'' or RFG, sold in the
Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth areas, and in other cities around the
country. MTBE, mainly manufactured in Texas, is the most widely
used oxygenate in RFG.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 Clean Air Act required the sale of RFG in the Houston
area; that started in 1995. Dallas-Fort Worth, with a less severe
smog problem, chose to join the program.
</P>
<P>
   The TNRCC's initiative for cleaner-burning gasoline in a wider
area of Texas is part of its regional clean air strategy, partly
intended to help Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth comply with the
national health standard for ground-level ozone smog, which they
now violate. Another aim is to keep near-violation areas such as
Austin, San Antonio and Longview-Tyler-Marshall from slipping into
violation status.
</P>
<P>
   After the state agency announced early this year that it might
decide to order oxygenate-containing RFG in that region, a
coalition was formed in response. Its members included MTBE
manufacturers, some local officials such as Harris County Judge
Robert Eckels and some environmental group leaders. It initially
supported RFG, but later voiced only generally worded support for
``cleaner-burning fuels in East Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposing it was the state's leading oil industry group, the
Texas Oil and Gas Association, which calls instead for lower-sulfur
gasoline as a way to curb smog-forming exhausts.
</P>
<P>
   Illustrating the dilemma facing the state commission, the mayors
of Longview, Tyler and Marshall last week jointly called for the
TNRCC to ban MTBE outright in any new requirement for
cleaner-burning gasoline in the region.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the three TNRCC commissioners, the mayors said
they have ``grave concerns'' about the ``disastrous consequences
for drinking water supplies'' should MTBE use be increased in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also want to assure you of our willingness to work with you
to achieve air quality goals,'' the mayors wrote. ``However, we
cannot support a strategy that seeks to achieve a short-term air
quality benefit at the risk of creating a long-term water quality
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter echoed recent developments in other parts of the
country indicating growing opposition to MTBE.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Maine became the first state, among such areas that
had joined the RFG program voluntarily, to opt out of it. A state
study had found trace levels of MTBE in 15 percent of drinking
water supplies, and officials said they would move to replace RFG
with a different, lowered-emission gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   In California, where federal law requires RFG, a bill to allow a
gasoline blend without MTBE has strong support in the congressional
delegation. Last month, a university study commissioned by state
officials concluded that MTBE was not needed to achieve clean air
goals in the state _ where the nation's worst smog levels are
routinely recorded in Los Angeles _ and the additive poses
``significant risks and costs associated with water
contamination.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to such developments, the head of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, Carol Browner, announced last week
that she was appointing a ``blue-ribbon panel'' to review the use
of MTBE and other oxygenates in gasoline and report on ``how to
ensure public health protection and continued improvement in both
air and water quality.''
</P>
<P>
   TNRCC Chairman Barry McBee said last week that he and his fellow
commissioners were ``very cognizant'' of the MTBE issue in
September when they ordered the agency staff to develop a rule that
would allow, but not require, the additive.
</P>
<P>
   McBee, who will leave the TNRCC shortly to head Lt. Gov.-elect
Rick Perry's staff, said he does not think there yet is enough
evidence to begin a serious discussion of banning MTBE in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, studies to date have not indicated any widespread
contamination of water supplies by the chemical, despite its
longstanding production and broad use in Texas, as well as the
documented presence in the state of more than 21,000 leaking
storage tanks for petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
   Such leaking tanks are widely regarded as the major potential
source of MTBE in water, and a pro-MTBE trade group, the Oxygenated
Fuels Association, has argued that fixing tank leaks, instead of
banning MTBE, is the best approach to safeguard drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   TNRCC officials began requiring water suppliers to start testing
for MTBE four years ago. To date, only 11 public and private
systems, out of hundreds in the state, have detected MTBE, mainly
at levels below the EPA's recommended limit for avoiding taste and
odor problems.
</P>
<P>
   The largest water system to discover the chemical in its
drinking water is the city of Dalhart, which serves a municipal
population of about 6,700. Officials shut down an affected well
after the finding.
</P>
<P>
   In the Houston area, two industrial wells and one municipal
utility district have found extremely low levels of MTBE, according
to the TNRCC. The city of Houston checked for MTBE most recently
this spring without detecting any amount of the chemical in water
from either underground or surface sources, a municipal official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two possible reasons that drinking water in Texas has remained
virtually free of the chemical is the depth of underground sources
of drinking water, which are situated below shallower aquifers and
protective layers of clay, and the protection afforded by
well-cased wells, TNRCC toxicologist Michael Honeycutt said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether refiners would make greater use of MTBE in the eastern
part of the state if the TNRCC adopts its draft rule for gasoline
in that region is a subject of dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The three East Texas mayors said in their letter to the TNRCC
that local refiners have told them that MTBE use is ``the most
likely scenario'' for meeting those requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Greenwood, director of government affairs for Valero Energy,
an oil refiner and major MTBE manufacturer with plants in the
Houston and Corpus Christi areas, said some companies such as his
might choose to use MTBE to meet the mandate. But he said he doubts
that a new rule would produce much more demand for the additive
among other gasoline producers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the growing debate, MTBE still has defenders who point
out that it has cut air pollution while replacing more toxic
alternatives, such as the cancer-causing benzene, in gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the two national organizations representing local and
state air quality officials have voiced such arguments in
advocating the right of areas not required by law to use RFG to
join that fuel program, as Dallas-Fort Worth did.

   SEOUL, South Korea -- The intrusion of a couple of strangers --
one, a foreign woman taking pictures -- caused an angry stir among
the homeless people camped in a city park in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving their cluster of tents, they started toward us through
the trees.
</P>
<P>
   My translator, an unemployed stock analyst, thought we ought to
cut and run. I thought the tent people would calm easily. They did,
and a few hung around to talk.
</P>
<P>
   These, after all, were not fugitives hunted by police or people
with scarred lives who belonged in mental institutions. They didn't
babble or draw knives or curse at passers-by. Nor were they
inheritors of debilitating discrimination, because they were not an
ethnic or racial minority.
</P>
<P>
   Like other homeless South Koreans we met, these were middle
class people whose world had gone topsy-turvy when the rug was
pulled out, when their country's economy failed. Their stories were
not even terribly dramatic, though most were certainly sad.
</P>
<P>
   These homeless people were impossibly clean, literate and
hopeless, at least for the short term.
</P>
<P>
   They were the most puzzling aspect of my visit to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   They were unlike any such homeless group I've encountered
elsewhere, from Bombay to Chechnya to Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Often homeless people are stranded through entrenched poverty or
personal affliction, mental or physical. Or they are victims of
disaster, whether natural or made by men.
</P>
<P>
   The South Koreans fit none of these categories.
</P>
<P>
   Seen walking the streets, they never would be pegged as
homeless. They wore clothes from the middle class lives they had
departed just months earlier. And somehow they kept everything
immaculate, even those living rough in the park.
</P>
<P>
   They also were embarrassed. Often, they blamed themselves for
landing in bad straits.
</P>
<P>
   I think that is why few wanted to tell their stories and often
refused to give their names if they did talk.
</P>
<P>
   At an all-male shelter run by a Buddhist order, the director
placed one condition: no pictures. People felt humiliated to be
there, he said, explaining that losing a job in Korea had been
rare. These people assumed they must have done something awfully
wrong to wind up on the street.
</P>
<P>
   One man who agreed to talk there identified himself only as Mr.
Oh. He refused to reveal the kind of small business he ran or to
detail its bankruptcy and the subsequent loss of his apartment. I
wondered why he was bothering to talk with me.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Mr. Oh plumbed a bruised emotional depth. He wanted me
to know that personal consequence underlies the faceless economic
charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I came here I traveled all over the country. Sometimes,
I slept in a tent, sometimes in a cheap boarding house. I traveled
to forget every miserable failure,'' he said. ``I found stability
in my heart, a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Oh, who had cleaned up for the communal dinner after doing
cemetery maintenance work, wore a spotless navy blue track suit and
cranberry sweater. Speaking with the same stoic bearing as the
American actor he remarkably resembled, Charles Bronson, he spoke
of a daughter and son who are both university graduates, whom he
had not seen since March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to show myself to my children, because I feel I'm
in a miserable condition,'' said Mr. Oh, closing his eyes,
clenching his jaw and falling silent.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the tent camp at Sosomun Park, the hostility had
evaporated fast. But there, too, people demanded no pictures of
themselves, only the bright-colored tents filled with the
possessions that were their hold on former lives.
</P>
<P>
   After the camera was capped and our talks had lasted nearly an
hour, almost everyone had returned to their routines -- playing
cards, checking the clothesline strung between trees, policing the
grounds for the few stray scraps or cigarette butts dropped by lax
campers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the last to leave was a man in his mid-30s, wearing
pinstripe pants and a button-down shirt. He hadn't said a word,
just listened.
</P>
<P>
   As we got ready to depart, I saw him sitting in his tent
cross-legged, reading one of the books he picked from the neat
piles by his sleeping bag.

REPORTING ON MITCH WAS OVERBLOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  By EDWARD HEGSTROM 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Nov. 2, as journalists streamed into Nicaragua to report a
landslide that killed nearly 2,000 people, Honduran President
Carlos Flores went on television to remind the world of the
calamity inflicted upon his country by the same storm, Hurricane
Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are corpses everywhere, victims of landslides or of the
waters,'' Flores said, making an appeal for massive international
aid. ``The most conservative calculations of the dead are in the
thousands, not in the hundreds.'' That same day, the official
Honduran death toll went from 246 to 5,000. It later reached a high
of 6,748 confirmed dead.
</P>
<P>
   Flores' impassioned speech helped shift the world's focus from
Nicaragua to Honduras, making it sound as if a perfect storm had
raked the country. The official Honduran death count also prompted
a disaster relief drive and sparked a media frenzy. Harried
reporters based in the region--such as me--embraced the idea that
this was the natural disaster of a lifetime and reported the
government's numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But new evidence suggests that the Honduran government grossly
exaggerated the death count. In a phrase, we were all had: the
press, the relief organizations, and the public. While thousands of
poor Hondurans did lose their homes in the wake of Mitch, and
survivors watched as their subsistence crops washed away, I'll
wager that an independent count would prove that hundreds rather
than thousands of Hondurans died.
</P>
<P>
   The first law of disaster reporting--as editors like to remind
writers--is that developing countries usually underreport deaths.
And, as a rule, editors insist that reporters depend on credible
sources for their stories. Since almost no one in Honduras refuted
Flores' extravagant body counts, his assertion went largely
unchecked in the early going.
</P>
<P>
   The first dispatches filed by the Associated Press and Reuters
about Hurricane Mitch's course through Central America recounted
the difficulties of collecting accurate death tolls, but neither
wire service challenged the official numbers--even though some of
their reporters on the ground thought they should have done so.
</P>
<P>
   The wire services play a key role in setting the tone for
coverage by the rest of the media. Having cut back on foreign staff
since the close of the Cold War, the major newspapers and TV
networks increasing rely on the wires to provide the basic facts of
a breaking story. They also depend on the wires in order to make
news judgments about overseas coverage. In the case of Hurricane
Mitch, assignment editors used early wire reports to decide whether
the story warranted sending reporters, photographers, and film
crews to the scene. When the wires declared 7,000 and then 10,000
dead in the region, editors sent jet-loads of journalists to
Central America.
</P>
<P>
   The press corps had little incentive to doubt the numbers once
they hit the ground. Having budgeted untold thousands to fly
himself and a crew down to the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa to
broadcast ``Nightline,'' Ted Koppel would be nuts to downplay the
storm's impact. With the pictures telling the story of the
devastation and the good people of Kansas organizing food drives,
it would seem downright churlish for a reporter to question a
Honduran official about his body-count methodology.
</P>
<P>
   The first report to question the official numbers was published
in the Miami Herald, two weeks after Mitch subsided. In region
after region, Herald reporters Juan O. Tamayo and Glenn Garvin
failed to substantiate the official numbers. Flores, however,
responded sharply to the Herald's doubts. ``When we give out
numbers, those are the dead bodies that have been actually been
counted,'' Flores told the paper. ``I have absolute confidence in
those numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   My own experience was probably typical of most reporters who
covered the storm. By the time I arrived in Tegucigalpa on Nov. 5,
Mitch was universally accepted as the hurricane of the century.
Editors phoned reporters saying they wanted ``color''--interviews
with victims--rather than numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But fanning out into the capital's neighborhoods, I found death
more rare than expected. The government said it knew of 250 dead in
Tegucigalpa, and some officials told me they believed the actual
number of dead in the city would rise to the thousands. But the
hardest hit neighborhood we reporters could find was Nueva
Esperanza, where there were 14 dead. Poor Selvin Perez, who lost
his wife and daughter in the storm, was subjected to dozens of
interviews with color-seeking reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters story from Nov. 5 quoted a government disaster
commission official, Norberto Otero, as saying that a mass grave
had been dug for 100 storm victims in Tegucigalpa. To confirm the
story, I hired a taxi driver to take me to the neighborhood where
residents said a truck had in fact dumped 20 bodies in a mass
grave. I used that fact in my report.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a couple of weeks later when I revisited the storm-ravaged
country, I consistently found that region by region, the
government's original numbers were wrong. Officials first reported
531 confirmed dead on the Bay Islands just off Honduras' Caribbean
coast. When visiting reporters found just 14 dead in the islands,
the government dropped its number to 81. Military leaders in the
region currently put the death toll on the islands at 12.
</P>
<P>
   In La Ceiba, a coastal city where the people are now busy
hanging Christmas decorations, I learned that the official death
toll is nine. The government once pegged its death toll at 979. A
new report from the government's regional disaster relief office
covering north-central Honduras shows 46 dead there. But a report
released by the federal government two days later declared 1,426
deaths in that same area. Did the federal officials never get a
copy of the report from their regional office, or did they just not
read it?
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the mountainous state of Santa Barbara, where the
Red Cross reported 50 dead but the government counted 1,124
corpses. On Nov. 27, the day after I began asking questions about
the 1,124 dead in Santa Barbara, the government released a revised
death toll of 282. Even so, it continues to report absurdly high
death numbers in other areas.
</P>
<P>
   Some reporters who covered the storm in Honduras aren't
surprised at the exaggerations. Everybody had an interest in
reporting big numbers, says the Herald's Garvin. ``If you are
reporter, you want to cover the story of the century, and that
requires lots of bodies. Editors want something they can put on the
front page. Relief agencies want more aid. And the interest of
local governments is so obvious it doesn't warrant detailing.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Flores deliberately overstate the crisis to draw
international aid? Perhaps. He's a media-savvy leader who owns one
of Honduras' principal newspapers, La Tribuna. A noted press
manipulator, he is said to dispense favors in return for favorable
stories. Flores also knows that journalists will forgive a
politician for making a natural disaster sound bigger than it is
but will crucify anyone who tries to downplay the story.
</P>
<P>
   A postscript to my own reporting about the mass grave in
Tegucigalpa: The story turns out to be false. City morgue officials
explain that the storm damaged their freezer so they dug a mass
grave to stow the corpses that had sat unclaimed in the morgue for
months before the storm. At last count, the Honduran government had
deflated its official death count to 5,657.

PETER FONDA'S UNEASY RIDE TO THE TOP

 Color slides and black and white photos of Peter Fonda and
Katherine Heigl in ``The Tempest.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    At 59 Peter Fonda has finally emerged on the Hollywood scene as
the most famous of the famous Fondas. It's taken him a long time.
 &HT;    He struggled for decades to emulate his dad Henry, Hollywood's
rock-solid attraction, who died in l982.
 &HT;    Then it was Jane's turn to become the hot Fonda: Fonda the sex
symbol, and the Oscar winner. Today Jane has taken herself out of
movies _ concentrating on her latest role as devoted wife to
entertainment mogul Ted Turner.
 &HT;    Then Bridget, Peter's daughter, had her flurry with fame and is
still going strong with her latest film ``A Simple Plan.''
 &HT;    But today it's finally Peter's turn. At last Hollywood regards
him as a star in his own right.
 &HT;    He started of course with a humdinger: He was ``Easy Rider'''s
wild Captain America in the '60s, riding a motor bike in black
leather and shades, popping LSD with cohorts Dennis Hopper and a
callow Jack Nicholson.
 &HT;    His role as the maverick biker in the l969 film mimicked his
real attitude to America in that era of Vietnam. Moviegoers around
the world loved it; Hollywood gave him the cold shoulder.
 &HT;    He continued to work in low-budget movies like ``Outlaw Blues''
(1977) and the cult film ``Love and a .45'' (1994). None of them
put him into Hollywood's actor's A-league.
 &HT;    ``I became an outsider. I moved to a ranch in Montana and did
the few films that were offered to me. I never thought I'd have a
chance to come back to the fold.''
 &HT;    Now he's an elder statesman, almost as respectable as his dad.
Last year he wrote a book about Henry Fonda called ``Don't Tell
Dad.'' Earlier this year also, he won praise and an Oscar
nomination for his role in ``Ulee's Gold.'' Jack Nicholson went
home with the best actor statuette but suddenly Hollywood was
paying attention to the former black sheep of the Fonda family.
 &HT;    Back in the early days when I interviewed him, he was troubled
young actor, caught up in the drug scene with a career as erratic
as his own behavior. But times have changed _ and so has Peter.
 &HT;    Now he's about to show up in another eye-catching serious role,
in special effects extravaganza, ``The Tempest,'' (airing on NBC
Dec. 13) an inventive retelling of Shakespeare's magical tale of
love, betrayal and freedom.
 &HT;    This time they've set the story on a mysterious isle in a
Mississippi bayou during the Civil War. Fonda plays Gideon Prosper,
who has abdicated his position as overseer of the family
plantation, choosing instead to devote his time to magic and
sorcery. The movie co-stars John Glover as Gideon's scoundrel
younger brother and Katherine Heigl Prosper's devoted daughter.
 &HT;    At 59, in blue jeans and cowboy boots with as much silver as
brown in his hair, his face handsome but leathery from long days in
the Montana Big Sky country, he sits in a suite at a ritzy hotel in
Pasadena, Calif., happily talking about his latest role and his
path in life.
 &HT;    ``I know Shakespeare's 'Tempest' and this is fairly on target
but set in a different time. It deals with deceit, brother against
brother. The special effects are really cool.''
 &HT;    It sometimes seems that Peter's acting career might have been
programmed into his DNA?. ``This is nothing genetic,'' he insists.
``The fact that my father and my sister, myself and my daughter are
all actors has nothing to do with genes. Had it something to do
with genes, I would have been manipulating them a long time ago.
But as I grew older people were saying, 'You look like your dad.'
In fact my bone structure is the same as his, but I really look
more like my mother around my eyes.''
 &HT;    Many in Hollywood said his part in ``Ulee's Gold'' _ playing a
grizzled, ex-Vietnam veteran turned beekeeper coping with his
grandkids _ was the role that has reestablished him as a leading
Hollywood star. And most also agree it was a typical Henry Fonda
role.
 &HT;    For a long time Peter might have resented that kind of talk. Not
anymore. ``I don't think of getting out from underneath the shadow
or the identity of being Henry Fonda's son. It hasn't been
something bad for me,'' he now observes.
 &HT;    ``It's an honor to be compared to his style of acting. And it's
interesting that the last thing he was seen doing was basically `On
Golden Pond' _ with a downturned mouth, grizzled and wearing wire
rimmed glasses, just like my character in `Ulee's Gold.'''
 &HT;    Growing up as a Fonda was never an easy ride for Peter. In many
ways his life was a constant struggle to win his father's approval.
The only problem was it wasn't winnable and even if it had been his
father couldn't have told him so. ``My father was a very shy man.
He didn't know how to communicate with anyone _ but particularly
with his children.''
 &HT;    Yet he was all they had. Peter and Jane were raised by their
father after their mother, socialite Frances Seymour Brokaw Fonda
committed suicide in l950 in a rest home where she was recovering
from a nervous breakdown.
 &HT;    ``My father never told Jane and I that mother had taken her own
life. We had to learn that from magazine and newspaper stories. I
know now he didn't do it to be cruel. He just didn't know how to
find the words to tell us.''
 &HT;    And just hours after his wife died Henry stepped on stage to do
a Broadway performance. That so upset Peter, who was 10 at the
time, that he shot himself through the kidney and liver with a
.22-caliber pistol.
 &HT;    Their father eventually remarried three times and with each
marriage he became further estranged from his two oldest children.
 &HT;    Peter remembers his dad as a tightlipped man who could never
express his emotions and bottled them up in a mask of disapproval.
``His silence was always a factor in our relationship. At the
dinner table not a word would be spoken.''
 &HT;    Peter and Jane, he says, thought their father was, ``this madman
who wouldn't smile or anything.''
 &HT;    In l979 Fonda was preparing to direct a low-budget film called
``Wanda Nevada.'' There was a small role in it perfectly suited to
his dad.
 &HT;    ``I literally had to cajole him into taking the role and he was
miserable the whole time. But then he sent me another of his famous
letters to tell me it had been one of the best experiences of his
41 years in the business.''
 &HT;    Peter says he worked hard to mend fences with his dad. And his
book about the man who was one of Hollywood's legends was softer
than most thought: ``I didn't have to tear his memory to shreds
because we had made our peace before he died.''
 &HT;    In ``Ulee's Gold'' he found a role that told the world that
Peter Fonda has finally grown up.
 &HT;    Now Peter has only one regret: That his dad isn't alive to see
his return to the mainstream: ``I think it would have amused him
greatly, that I have _ even in some small way _ become him. The
wonderful thing about having had Henry Fonda for a father is that
he is always within reach. I have just to turn on the TV _ and he's
there. It's a great legacy he's left me and the world.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   QUESTION: It's that home-for-the-holidays season that's supposed
to bring us joy, but it's really tough this year. Both sets of
parents live fairly close and want us with them for the holidays.
My wife thinks we should go to her family's celebration, but I say
let's be with my mom, who is alone this year for the first time. I
know my wife doesn't like Mom, but I think she's being callous and
unreasonable. _ Miami, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: I suspect this problem has been going on for a long
time, but this is the year it's chosen to roost. It sounds as
though neither of you has worked out the ``where do we spend
holidays'' blues. You have been able to finesse it so far, but
finesse time is over. If you had started with a plan, you wouldn't
be in today's pickle.
</P>
<P>
   So let's get to it: With both families close by, holidays and
weekends can be negotiated by spending Christmas Eve with one and
Christmas Day with the other. Do a Thanksgiving/Easter tradeoff.
One year you can give one family first choice and the next the
other set of in-laws. Scheduling may be a pain in the neck, but it
can avert hurt feelings, nagging and fights.
</P>
<P>
   What's changed for you this year is your mom's status. She's
lonely, sad and needy. Your wife is afraid she'll never see her
folks on holidays again. You may view it as a temporary change, but
odds are that neither your mom nor your wife is looking at it that
way. What to do now? Sit down with your wife and work out that
holiday/weekend schedule which will reassure everyone. You don't
even have to stress your mom's special needs right now if your
schedule shows your willingness to be fair and open to both your
wife's and her parents' needs.
</P>
<P>
   Since we're so close to Christmas Day, you may even be able to
negotiate a special, one-time-only joint celebration for both sides
of the family, and if you're really lucky, everybody will have such
a great time it may become an annual event!
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My wife and I have been married for 12 years and
unhappy for the last 5. We've talked divorce, but we decided to
stay together for the sake of the kids. If we have agreed that's
the only reason we're still married, is an affair legal? _ Los
Angeles
</P>
<P>
   DR.JOY: Trust me, nobody stays together for the sake of the
kids. People stay together because they're afraid to be alone, or
because it's cheaper to support one household than two, or because
they're afraid of losing contact or status or money or friends, and
sometimes because they really care for one another.
</P>
<P>
   People who say they are staying together for the sake of the
kids are kidding themselves. Kids are almost always aware of the
tension, the whispers, the fights, the secret phone conversations
and the lies.
</P>
<P>
   So let's face it: Neither of you is staying together for the
kids. To pretend that you are uses them as chess pieces and more
importantly allows both of you to ignore your real feelings, so
nothing will get resolved. You and your spouse must sit down and be
honest with yourself first and then with each other about what each
of you wants and what each of you is willing to offer in return.
</P>
<P>
   Because you do have children in common, you will always have a
bond with each other, so the more honest you can be now, the better
your long-term prospects for calm and dignified interaction and
THAT is for the sake of the kids as well as one another.
</P>
<P>
   As for an affair, no-fault divorce has made affairs less
dangerous if both of you can agree and a great deal more dangerous
if you can't. The point is an affair is only going to complicate
matters now. Work on your marriage or junk it, but don't lie to
yourself or to each other about why you're together. And involving
someone else in this mess is just plain nasty!
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I hate my body and there's lots of it to hate. I've
tried every diet known and I still look like the Titanic. My
husband nags me, my mother chides and I eat and eat and eat. Short
of having my mouth glued shut, is there any good way for me to lose
weight? _ Pelham, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: From the sound of it, you are a professional dieter.
You know better than almost anybody how to lose weight, but the
problem is keeping it off. To do that, you need a better
understanding of why you eat, what you eat, when you eat, how you
eat.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you have to understand is that you can't lose
weight for anybody but yourself. When it's just you and that jelly
doughnut, eyeball to eyeball, there is no amount of Mom or husband
that is going to keep you from blinking. It's you and only you. Ask
yourself if you are eating to assert your independence? Or to put a
buffer between you and the world? Is your weight giving you an
excuse for not finding a job or friends or clothes or being sexual?
</P>
<P>
   Start writing down everything, and I mean everything, before you
put it in your mouth. The very act of writing it down will force
you to ask yourself whether you really want it and help you
document when, why and how you eat. And put a picture of yourself
thin OR heavy on the refrigerator door for motivation (a naked
photo is best if there aren't kids around). Wait a half-hour to eat
whatever you were thinking of engulfing. Keep only good stuff _
that means non-fattening _ in the house, so you and your family
won't snack on trash. Think about getting out of the house. When
we're bored we are more likely to think about food.
</P>
<P>
   We put on weight when we take in more calories than we burn and
lose weight when the opposite is true. The former means better
eating habits, the latter means exercise. Exercise not only makes
you feel more in contract of your body and your life, but it gets
you away from the demon refrigerator and helps you metabolize food
more efficiently. If you think this is an argument for less dieting
and more exercise, you've read me loud and clear.

REPOSITIONING `IRON FELIX' 7 YEARS LATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ If you had to pick three events that symbolized
Russia's democratic revolution in August 1991, they would most
probably be 1) people putting up barricades made of buses to defend
against tanks sent into Moscow by hard-line coup plotters; 2) Boris
Yeltsin addressing supporters from atop a tank whose troops
switched sides; 3) jubilant crowds watching as a crane took down
the towering statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of the ruthless
and ubiquitous Soviet secret police.
</P>
<P>
   The coup plotters were defeated, and Russian communism hit rock
bottom. Yeltsin went on to the Kremlin, where he promised to bring
the rule of law and a market economy to Russia. One of the buses,
crumpled from a collision with a tank, went on display outside a
museum on one of central Moscow's main streets.
</P>
<P>
   And the Dzerzhinsky statue was sent off to a dumping ground for
old, unwanted monuments of discredited Soviet leaders. ``Iron
Felix's'' place in front of the KGB headquarters was occupied by a
modest monument to the millions of victims of Soviet political
purges.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone wondering about how the events of August 1991 are seen in
Russia today could do worse than to might look at what is happening
to those symbols of Russian democracy now.
</P>
<P>
   We all know about Yeltsin, the sick man of Russia's corrupt and
feckless government.
</P>
<P>
   The bus rusted away until people started to complain that it was
an eyesore amid the high-rent storefronts on Tverskaya Street. A
few months ago, it was moved to a courtyard where it can rot out of
sight.
</P>
<P>
   And if Russia's Communist-dominated lower house of parliament,
the State Duma, has its way, Dzerzhinsky is headed back to his old
spot in front of the building on Lubyanka Square now occupied by
the KGB's successor, the FSB.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Duma's 256-102 vote Friday in favor of restoring the statue
occurred at a time of heightened public criticism of Russia's seven
post-Soviet years. The farther you get from Moscow, the easier it
is to find people who think things were not so bad, or at least not
this bad, back in the USSR.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Moscow, there are few symbols of the democratic era,
just lots of statues of Vladimir I. Lenin that no one ever got
around to taking down. Now, even Lenins are going back up. A new
one was unveiled near the Arctic port of Murmansk last week.
</P>
<P>
   The wave of nostalgia for a system that killed millions of
citizens in purges and concentration camps may seem strange.
Execution sites and mass graves are still being found.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia has never fully grappled with its Soviet past. The
KGB was never disbanded or seriously reformed, just downsized,
renamed, and told to not arrest political prisoners. FSB leaders
worked in the old, repressive structure. Its archives, detailing
countless crimes against the people, are still secret.
</P>
<P>
   Each Nov. 7, when thousands across Russia celebrate the
anniversary of the Bolsheviks' takeover, some carry portraits of
Josef Stalin, whose 30-year reign of terror claimed at least 20
million lives.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has another day to commemorate victims of the purges. But
only a few hundred people gather at the memorial on Lubyanka, one
of only a handful of such monuments in the country.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One cause of the apathy is related to the reason the Duma wants
to put Iron Felix back. The terror Russians once felt that one
night agents might come knocking at the door is long gone. It has
been replaced by the fear of mafia shakedowns, remote-control car
bombs, and nighttime shootings in apartment stairwells, like last
month's murder of a prominent lawmaker, Galina Starovoitova.
</P>
<P>
   ``Replacing the statue will reassure the nation that the Russian
government is dedicated to the ongoing struggle against crime,''
said Duma member Nikolai Kharitonov.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, the Duma's communists, playing on the public's new
fear, put through a motion that also helps them forget their lowest
moment in August 1991.

JUDICIARY PANEL'S GOP DEFYING PARTY LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The math is elementary: All Bill Clinton needs to
end the impeachment odyssey is for three of the 21 Republicans on
the House Judiciary Committee to join the panel's 16 Democrats this
week in voting against charges that could end his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, it will never happen.
</P>
<P>
   In a quirk of congressional destiny, nearly all the 21
Republicans who control Clinton's immediate fate dwell to the right
of the political mainstream, representing highly conservative
districts where anti-Clinton sentiment runs deep.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans see the polls that show an overwhelming
majority of the public opposes Clinton's impeachment. But they hear
something starkly different in their districts, many of which span
the Bible Belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you, the people in my district don't feel like the
polls say what they should,'' said Representative Howard Coble of
North Carolina, echoing his GOP colleagues on the committee. ``I
think impeachment is our best course.''
</P>
<P>
   So, for the first time in a generation and only the third time
in history, the Judiciary Committee is poised to recommend that the
House impeach a sitting president, where Clinton would face a trial
that could remove him from office. The House committee is
tentatively scheduled to debate and vote on proposed articles of
impeachment on Thursday, Friday, and possibly Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A request by Clinton's lawyers to lengthen their presentation to
the committee this week from one day to three or four days raised
the possibility of delaying the final committee vote. But the
Judiciary Committee chairman, Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, says he
will ``make a sincere effort to accommodate this last-minute
request'' without affecting the Saturday deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully intend for the committee to discharge its
constitutional duties in this inquiry by the conclusion of next
week,'' Hyde said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   From the tobacco fields of Coble's district in central North
Carolina to Simi Valley in Representative Elton Gallegly's base in
Southern California, the committee Republicans sense little
resistance as they prepare to approve at least one charge of
perjury against Clinton for allegedly trying to cover up his sexual
affair with the former White House intern, Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   And they fear no backlash. In the midterm elections that were
held last month amid the impeachment inquiry, every GOP member of
the committee who sought re-election succeeded, and they won an
average of 74 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
   Even Representative Lindsey O. Graham of South Carolina, one of
the panel's more flexible conservatives, said his constituents
harbor ``no shortage of outrage over the president's conduct in
terms of him losing his job.''
</P>
<P>
   With their solid bases and shared ideology, the GOP members have
formed an impenetrable front. Despite Republican election losses,
the dumping of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and pressure from some
moderate GOP lawmakers for punishment short of impeachment, there
is no indication that a substantial number of GOP panel members
will oppose any proposed article of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, seven committee Republicans joined Democrats in
1974 in voting for some or all of three articles of impeachment
against President Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the Republicans on the committee, their political base
is the far right of the Republican Party,'' said Representative
Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat on the panel. ``I've
felt since Day 1 there was no chance that any of them would vote
for anything other than impeaching the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the mix of blacks, Jews, and women among the 16 Democrats
on the panel, the GOP lawmakers all are white Christian men, except
for Representative Mary Bono of California, who replaced her late
husband, Sonny Bono, on the commmittee after he died in a skiing
accident. Only one GOP member is from the Northeast: Representative
George W. Gekas of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not Frank Sargent or Bill Weld Republicans,'' said
Steve Schwadron, chief of staff to Representative William D.
Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat serving his first term on the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   As examples of their conservative leanings:
</P>
<P>
   --Representative Bill McCollum of Florida has led every fight in
the House against the Brady gun-control bill.
</P>
<P>
   --Represenatative Charles T. Canady of Florida has led efforts
to ban race and gender preferences in federal hiring, prohibit
late-term abortions, and formally adopt English as the nation's
official language.
</P>
<P>
   --Representative Lamar S. Smith of Texas was the only lawmaker
on an eight-member House committee last year to vote against
reprimanding Gingrich and fining him $300,000 for ethics
violations.
</P>
<P>
   --Hyde, the chairman, has compiled a conservative legacy over 24
years that includes the so-called Hyde amendment, which has banned
federal funding of abortions for Medicaid patients since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   With the committee's top Democrats as far to the political left
as Republicans are to the right, the panel was considered the most
polarized in Congress even before the impeachment proceedings
began.
</P>
<P>
   For every liberal Democrat such as Representative Barney Frank
of Massachusetts, there is a GOP conservative such as McCollum or
Representative Bob Barr of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, who began calling for impeachment hearings long before the
Lewinsky scandal, clashed last week with two Harvard law
professors, Alan M. Dershowitz and A. Leon Higginbotham Jr., after
a battery of legal scholars told the committee that Clinton's
actions, while possibly criminal, were not impeachable.
</P>
<P>
   In an exchange that epitomized differences between the
committee's partisan factions, Barr said ``the real America,''
which he described as ``unlike some of our law professors here
today,'' agrees with his position that Clinton should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Dershowitz, who is Jewish, said Barr's reference to ``real
Americans'' was a code word for ``racism'' and ``bigotry.''
</P>
<P>
   And Higginbotham, a retired federal appellate judge who is
black, told Barr: ``My father was a laborer. My mother was a
domestic. I climbed the ladder, and I did not come to where I am
through some magical band. So I am willing to match you any hour
any day in terms of the perception of the real American.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank, who has stuck bipartisan deals in the committee over
issues such as intellectual property rights, argued later that Barr
is not typical of the committee's GOP majority. ``I wouldn't defame
the Republicans by raising him as representative,'' Frank said.
``He's kind of a strange guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Frank was not entirely conciliatory. ``I thought from the
start they would be for impeachment,'' he said of the committee
Republicans. ``But I underestimated the right wing's ability to
keep them from behaving rationally.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank was referring to moves in recent weeks to expand the
inquiry into seveal areas beyond the Lewinsky matter, which also
irked some moderate Republicans who do not sit on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Graham defended the committee's actions, saying the Republicans
are keeping faith with their constitutional duty rather than their
constituents' outrage toward Clinton. ``I want to a be a good
congressman who, 30 years from now, not just 30 days from now,
people thought did the right thing,'' he said. ``And the right
thing is to take this seriously.''

CONNECTICUT COMMISSIONER HOLDS THE LINE AGAINST ATM FEES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ John P. Burke is an unlikely hero in the
long-shot campaign against banks that seek to impose automated
teller machine surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   Burke is the banking commissioner in Connecticut, part of a
Republican administration that prides itself on being friendly to
business. (Just ask Robert Kraft and the Patriots.) Prior to taking
the commissioner's post four years ago, Burke was a banker for 30
years, and his philosophy hasn't changed much. He still opposes
government meddling in marketplace decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet almost singlehandedly Burke has prevented Fleet Financial
Group, First Union and BankBoston from imposing a surcharge on
noncustomers who use their ATMs in Connecticut. The fees would
bring in an estimated $1.5 million a year to the three banks, which
together own 60 percent of the state's ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Iowa, where lawmakers passed a bill barring
surcharges, Connecticut is the only state in the nation where the
fees are not allowed. (However, banks in Connecticut as elsewhere
can charge their own customers when they use another bank's ATM.)
Surcharges spread throughout Massachusetts several months ago after
House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran refused to let a ban come up for a
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a major crusade on my part,'' said Burke. ``My job
is not to be a crusader, but to enforce the law.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no law on ATM surcharges in Connecticut. And that,
according to Burke, is why he ruled in 1995 that surcharging was
not allowed. ``If it doesn't say you can do it, you can't do it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet has been battling Burke ever since, in and out of court.
The bank got his ruling overturned in federal court in September
and started imposing a $1 surcharge Oct. 23. But on Nov. 9 the
federal court's decision was set aside by an appeals court, which
held that the issue belonged in state court.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet is now back in federal court accusing Burke and the state
of Connecticut of violating its civil rights. The bank is also
trying to get Burke's order to cease and desist surcharging
revoked, saying it would be irreparably harmed if it is unable to
collect $15,000 a day from noncustomers who use its machines.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Shepker, a Fleet spokesman, said Burke's interpretation of
the law is wrong. He said banks need surcharge revenue to avoid
losing money on their ATM networks. The fact that state law doesn't
mention surcharging means it is not prohibited, he said. ``We
believe we're on very, very solid ground,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet so far has not attempted to win passage of a law allowing
surcharging. Surcharge opponents, meanwhile, have failed to get a
surcharge ban passed.
</P>
<P>
   As in Connecticut, the statutes in Massachusetts dealing with
ATMs don't address the surcharge issue. Thomas J. Curry, the
Massachusetts banking commissioner, has not attempted to use that
omission to ban the fees administratively, even though his boss,
Governor Paul Cellucci, opposes them. Curry's spokesman said
legislative action is necessary because state law is too vague on
the fee issue.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview in his office, Burke stressed that he was
not taking sides on the ATM-surcharge issue, merely interpreting
the law as his job requires. Yet his perspective on the issue,
given his banking background, was interesting.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he thinks the banks' argument that surcharges are
needed to avoid losing money is overblown. He said ATMs save banks
money on tellers and allow them to serve customers around the
clock. ``I think what they've discovered (with surcharges) is
another way to make money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burke, who banks at a small bank with no ATMs of its own,
recognizes he may not win in court, but he says his ruling will
have forestalled the fees for more than four years. ``Even if we
lose, I think the consumer has been helped,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Ruthauser of Cromwell, a lawyer who commutes to Hartford on
a daily basis, would agree with that. After withdrawing money from
a Fleet ATM downtown, he told us he hopes Burke prevails. ``The
banks are just looking for a windfall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A sticky problem
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of tiny but annoying problems, some readers have
been asking us why it seems every piece of fruit or vegetable in
the grocery store has a small sticker. They say removing each
sticker is tedious and they often end up scraping up some fruit or
vegetable peel in the process.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out these stickers, which contain PLU (Produce Look-Up)
codes, are part of voluntary industry standards adopted by produce
farmers in the early 1990s to help store cashiers.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Humfeld, vice president of the Produce Marketing
Association in Newark, Del., said grocery stores were complaining
that clerks were not ringing up the right prices. They might look
at a nectarine and ring up the price of a peach. Or a higher-priced
Royal Gala apple, for example, might be sold at the lower-price of
a Red Delicious apple.
</P>
<P>
   ``It enables the retailers to find an easy way to ring up the
proper price at check-out,'' Humfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   Humfeld said that in 1993, only about 10 percent of produce
distributers were using the PLU stickers, which contain a code that
marks the particular type of fruit or vegetable. As of this year,
57 percent of produce distributers use these stickers, and Humfeld
said he expects the sticker use to only expand.
</P>
<P>
   Every industry has its quirky problems, and produce distributers
apparently are always looking for better glues that will keep
stickers on produce at the store, but also allow for easy removal
once the produce is brought home.
</P>
<P>
   What if you accidently eat a sticker? It's obviously not meant
to be eaten, but Humfeld said stickers are designed to pose no
health hazard.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Odds &AMP; Ends
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --MCI minimum charges. MCI WorldCom, blaming the cost of
servicing customer accounts, is following AT&AMP;T's lead. Starting
next month, MCI plans to impose a minimum charge of $3 to $5 on all
residential customers, depending on their calling plans. That means
you pay $3 to $5 if you fail to make at least that much in long
distance calls in a given month. People who make few calls _ and
MCI says only 10 percent fall in this category _ oppose the minimum
charges, in part because the fees can trigger the imposition of
additional monthly government fees. Those fees can transform a $3
charge into a $4.31 charge.

   BOSTON _ Once again, Xu Jin is watching as her father is taken
from her.
</P>
<P>
   The first time, she was eight years old, standing in her
nightgown as Chinese soldiers dragged him off in the middle of the
night. What's wrong, she asked him. He smiled, trying to comfort
her. Nothing's wrong, he said, go back to sleep. The next day, he
was gone.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 12 years, she lived without him.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Xu, 26, watched on the news as her father, Xu Wenli,
one of China's leading dissidents, was dragged to prison in Beijing
this week. Xu is in Boston, where she is a graduate student at
Boston University, studying fine arts.
</P>
<P>
   Her father's crime: Creating a democratic political party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not surprised,'' Xu said in an interview Thursday, her
eyes brimming with tears. ``He kept a bag filled with things like
his toothbrush behind the door. He expected this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Carr, chairman of the advisory board for Harvard's Human
Rights Initiative, compares Xu Wenli to Nelson Mandela. Xu Jin said
Mandela is a friend of her father's, and said the two men agree
with the comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Even though she spent much of her childhood without her father's
direct presence, Xu said his letters to her, and his example,
taught her about standing up for your beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Following in his footsteps, she wrote a letter to the Chinese
government this week, condemning them for her father's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father has ideas about democracy and freedom but he has no
soldiers and no secret police,'' she wrote. ``He cannot hurt you.
Let him go.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu can't go home to be with her mother, He Xintong, because she
fears she will not be allowed to leave China again. Xintong can't
come to Boston to be with her daughter because she fears she won't
be allowed to return to China. Xu is an only child, and her mother
is very ill.
</P>
<P>
   Xu attends school in Boston because she is forbidden from
attending universities in China. ``It's not a written law,'' she
said. ``But it's understood that because of who my father is, I'm
not to be educated.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview Thursday, Xu recalled a very happy early
childhood. She remembered marching with her father in protests, and
dancing and entertaining adults who had gathered at her family's
house to hand-write and hand-publish a pro-democracy magazine
called April 5th Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were always lots of people in the house,'' Xu said,
smiling with the memory. ``It was quite wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu's father was born and raised in Southern China, one of five
children. His father died when he was nine years old. Raised
alternately by his mother, an older sister, and his grandmother, Xu
Wenli became very interested in politics and history while he was
in high school, according to his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school, Xu Wenli made the decision
not to attend college, which broke his mother's heart. But he
believed ``he would learn more by studying the government and
talking to people,'' his daughter said.
</P>
<P>
   He served five years in the Chinese army, and then took a job as
an electrician at a factory in Beijing, where he met He Xintong, an
accountant, fell in love, and married.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Xu Wenli became involved with a fledgling democracy
movement, his daughter said. He began producing the magazine in his
house, and his daughter remembers how happy he seemed when he would
go with his wife and daughter to the central wall in Beijing to
sell the magazine on the street.
</P>
<P>
   It was around that time that Xu Wenli's friend Wei Ginsheng put
up a poster asking for democracy. He was arrested. Xu Wenli
organized a group of people to sneak a tape recorder into the
trial, and then published a transcript of the trial to show it was
unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Xu Jin's father was charged with stealing state secrets, and
taken away. It was a full year before Xu Jin or her mother even
knew if he was alive or dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother took me to every prison, everywhere she could think
of where he might be, asking for him,'' she said. ``I didn't want
her to know how scared I was, so when I started to feel afraid, I'd
say I was going to go outside to look at the cars.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first arrest, Xu Jin said, her elementary school
teacher harassed her, humiliated her in class and made sure ``I
didn't laugh so much anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu Jin's middle and high school teachers were more
understanding, she said. Nonetheless, she grew up very alone. Her
mother worked three jobs. After school, Xu came home to an empty
house. She had no close friends, because she could not let anyone
know about the truth of her father's imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would tell them he was on a business trip,'' she said. ``It
seemed safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu and her mother were allowed to visit her father in prison
every two months, for 40 minutes, with the exception of three years
in which he was allowed no visitors. It was the only human contact
he had for 12 years, as his captors were not allowed to speak to
him. For much of his sentence he was kept in a room ``not much
wider or longer than a coffin''.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Xu saw her father after his arrest, she said he
was huddled on the floor of a large room where 20 or so prison
officials sat at a large table.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't allowed to talk about politics, or the trial,'' she
said. ``And my mother wasn't allowed to touch him. When I was
little I could sit on his lap, but after a while that stopped
too.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Xu Wenli was released to house arrest after the United
States government demanded his release in exchange for economic
investment.
</P>
<P>
   When her father emerged from the prison, he was a changed man,
physically. ``His hair was white, his teeth were rotted out,'' said
his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   His spirit, however, remained intact. ``He just started talking
and wouldn't stop,'' his daughter said. ``I had cooked a whole
table of his favorite foods, but he wouldn't stop talking to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu had only a few months with her father after his release from
prison before she was to head to the United States, to attend Bard
College.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad, he's against college,'' she said. ``But he understood.
He wants me to have a better life.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu hopes to finish school, take a job in graphic design
somewhere in the United States, and continue to support her mother.
But her father's activism has also worn off on her.
</P>
<P>
   In her letter to the Chinese government, Xu said that computers
confiscated from her father's house were bought with money she
earned ``by washing dishes and waiting tables. Why are you afraid
of me and my father?''

HOW DOES THE GOVERNMENT CALCULATE THE CALORIES IN FOOD? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. How are the calories on food packages figured?
</P>
<P>
   L.M., Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. That's a timely question, because a lot of folks will pack in
a lot of calories during the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   A calorie is the amount of energy (calor means heat in Latin) it
takes to heat one gram of water one degree Celsius. But how do we
figure how many units of heat energy are in a candy bar or can of
soup?
</P>
<P>
   For that, you can thank Wilbur Olin Atwater, an American chemist
credited as the first scientist to apply chemistry to agriculture.
In the 1890's he developed a calorimeter to measure the calories in
the components of foods _ carbohydrates, proteins, fats. He heated
them with a known quantity of energy and measured how much heat was
produced.
</P>
<P>
   Atwater also figured that some of the energy in the food we eat
never gets absorbed in the body; it's lost in our solid and liquid
waste. With his calorimeter he measured how much of what goes in,
stays in, and how much comes back out. With those adjustments,
known as Atwater factors, we know that when we eat 1 gram of
carbohydrates we absorb 4 calories; 1 gram of protein, 4 absorbed
calories; 1 gram of fat, 9 absorbed calories.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers know how much of each component a food product
contains, so the calorie number on the package is: grams of
carbohydrates X 4; grams of protein X 4; grams of fat X 9.
</P>
<P>
   For those who take in alcohol, multiply grams consumed times 7
for your caloric intake.
</P>
<P>
   See you in the gym in January.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do all living things share the same basic DNA? What
determines that something will turn out a jellyfish or a human?
</P>
<P>
   B.P., Beverly, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. According to Walter Gilbert, a Harvard molecular biologist
who shared the 1980 Nobel prize for his work on DNA, everything
from bacteria up, with the exception of some viruses, shares some
similar DNA.
</P>
<P>
   There are many genes, in many species, that create proteins that
have the same biochemical function. In some cases, those genes are
identical; sometimes they're very similary. That leads us to
believe that all living things probably trace back to a single
ancestral DNA, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The divergence that led in one direction to single-celled
bacteria and in another to humans probably occurred 4 billion years
ago, though some think it was only 2 billion years ago, Gilbert
says.
</P>
<P>
   People and fish probably diverged from a a common ancestor about
400 million years ago. People and cows, as recently as 150 million
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But while many human genes are similar to those in other life
forms, each species has evolved enough unique genes to distinguish
itself on life's family tree. Birds evolved genes for wings. Fish
evolved genes for gills. Humans evolved genes for golf.
</P>
<P>
   One big DNA difference among species is quantity. Our genome is
3 billion chemical units long and has about 100,000 genes. E. coli
bacteria have about 3,000 genes. And along a strand of human DNA,
while sections called exons turn into genes that make proteins we
need, other sections, called introns, don't code for genes at all.
Scientists aren't sure what introns do.
</P>
<P>
   Simple organisms have less waste. The DNA of the tiny worm C.
elegans is only 100 million units long and is almost all exons.
</P>
<P>
   There are obvious genetic differences even within species. In
humans, DNA disparity determines gender, race, or susceptibility to
certain diseases. People differ from each other by about one tenth
of 1 percent. We differ from our closest genetic relatives,
chimpanzees, by about 2 percent, Gilbert says.
</P>
<P>
   So why don't we look 98 percent like a chimpanzee? Gilbert says
that even small differences in genotype (an organism's genetic
code), can translate into big differences in phenotype (the
physical form the organism takes).
</P>
<P>
   Once development gets started, the hormones and tissues and
organs and proteins in the embryo, plus the environment it's in,
start to interact with each other and with our DNA as the organism
develops.
</P>
<P>
   Genes are recipes, or prescriptions, for doing things, he says.
They're almost never absolute statements. The environment shapes
how they end up doing their job.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert says we understand the molecular biology of DNA a lot
better than we do the developmental biology of how we get from
genotype to phenotype. He says we'll have to understand that
process much better before we can turn what we know about DNA into
genetic engineering techniques that can grow new human organs or
eliminate disease.

BUCKING BUREAUCRACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN MCNAMARA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What would it take it prove your existence?
</P>
<P>
   For Martha Ghosen Goose, it took five months, 126 telephone
calls, 63 letters, a dozen faxes, the determination of her
75-year-old employer, and the intervention of a congressman and the
Bureau of Indian Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the bureaucrats in the passport office in Boston
finally acknowledged what the 56-year-old member of the Seneca
Nation has been telling them since July: She is an American.
</P>
<P>
   The $1,000 spent for phone calls, postage, administrative fees,
and legal advice to prove the obvious is incidental to the
emotional toll exacted on an elderly couple and a Native American
woman who was forced, in her words, ``to dig up the dead just to
prove I am alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Martha Goose's saga began simply enough last summer with the
desire of a devoted husband to give his ailing wife the trip of her
dreams. Mary and Edward Perry of Stow had spent much of their life
together under sail, over the years navigating 90,000 miles on a
40-foot sailboat. All that ended two years ago, when Mary, now 75,
suffered a paralyzing stroke that left her in need of constant
care. Goose is her nurse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't ones for cruising, but now that would be the only
way for Mary to get back on the water,'' says Edward Perry, the
still vigorous half of the sailing duo, who surprised his wife and
her nurse with two tickets for a cruise in January from Florida,
around the Caribbean, along the coast of South America, and through
the Panama Canal to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Securing a passport for his wife's caregiver seemed a
straightforward enough proposition at the start. Goose had no birth
certificate, but her driver's license, her Social Security card,
her marriage certificate, her two children's birth certificates,
and her Seneca Nation identification card all listed her date and
place of birth, Buffalo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Not good enough, said the bureaucrats. ``All the documents
submitted were issued after your 20th birthday, and the information
regarding your place of birth was supplied by you,'' reads an Oct.
8 letter to Goose from the passport agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``First I don't exist, and then I am a liar'' is how Goose says
she read that letter, which insisted upon a record of her birth.
</P>
<P>
   That was not an easy, or painless, order to fill. Goose had been
abandoned at birth and adopted by relatives, who soon returned her
to the care of a grandmother on the Cattaraugus Indian Reservation
in Erie County, N.Y. The hospital where she was born is closed, its
records lost; her biological and adoptive parents and her
grandmother are all dead.
</P>
<P>
   The Vital Records Bureau for the state of New York sent the
passport agency a letter stating it had no record of Martha's
birth. But a 93-year-old aunt sent a sworn handwritten affidavit,
noting her presence at St. Mary's Hospital when Martha was born to
her sister, Albertine, and Thomas Ghosen. Goose and Perry even
tracked down one of her teachers from the reservation school.
</P>
<P>
   Not good enough, said the bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It now appears that each and every time I send some document
along to your office, I receive a reply asking for yet another,''
Goose wrote in exasperation Oct. 16.
</P>
<P>
   After dozens more letters and telephone calls, Goose wrote again
to the passport agency on Oct. 21, enclosing grammar school records
from the Buffalo school system, documenting her transfer from the
Indian school to the public school when she was 13.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no passport.
</P>
<P>
   The understandable mistake of Perry and Goose was thinking that
government bureaucracy responds to logic and common sense. But what
it does respond to is political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Only after US Representative Martin Meehan notified the Bureau
of Indian Affairs of the obstacles being placed in Goose's path did
Edward Perry began to think that maybe his wife and her nurse would
get to take their cruise, after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know which was worse,'' says Perry, ``the idea of
disappointing my wife or seeing poor Martha crying every time she
had a conversation with that awful woman from the passport
agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Goose describes the bureaucrat as ``a woman with charcoal in her
blood.'' But a conference call with the recalcitrant bureaucrat,
the congressman, and an incensed representative of the Office of
Tribal Services in the Bureau of Indian Affairs broke the logjam.
</P>
<P>
   Goose's passport arrived last week. The cruise ship leaves Fort
Lauderdale Jan. 20.

CANADA TORIES HOPE TO ASCEND WITH REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA _ Once there was a political powerhouse in Canada called
the Conservative Party. It won elections, produced prime ministers,
set national agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the tattered Tories hold just 19 of the 301 seats in
Canada's House of Commons. The party is the smallest and least
consequential of the five in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But now there is a serious movement afoot to fuse the
once-mighty Conservatives with the upstart, Western-based Reform
Party, a marriage of convenience that supporters hope will produce
Canada's first formidable party of the right.
</P>
<P>
   The effort arises as Canada courses toward the 21st century,
essentially as a one-party state. The Liberal party is the
governing party and seems likely to remain the governing party for
decades to come, since it no longer faces any real rival for power.
</P>
<P>
   There are opposition parties, of course, but they are too
regional or too ideologically extreme to attract a wide spectrum of
voters from Newfoundland to British Columbia. No party except the
Liberals has a broad national base.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal majority in Commons may be slim, 156 of 301 seats.
But the second-largest party, Reform, holds only 59 seats. The
third largest party is the separatist Bloc Quebecois, which has 45
members in Parliament but no support beyond the restive
French-speaking province.
</P>
<P>
   Even the far-left New Democratic Party carries more
parliamentary heft than the Conservatives, with 21 seats. And yet,
there is talk of a Conservative comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something has to be done to unite the right,'' said Alberta's
premier, Ralph Klein, one of Canada's few remaining high-profile
Conservative Party leaders. ``If we don't, none of us will ever
live long enough to see anything other than a Liberal government
governing Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein, whose tight-fisted policies have made Alberta a byword
for lean government, startled observers last month by agreeing to
preside over a controversial ``united conservative alternative''
convention to be held by members of the Reform Party and
Conservatives next February.
</P>
<P>
   The convention represents the first major step in the merger of
parties whose members tend to regard each other with far more
suspicion and loathing than they usually muster for the Liberals.
</P>
<P>
   For in politics, as in love, nothing is more bitter than a
breakup. And the Reform Party is the product of divorce, founded
earlier this decade by breakaway Conservatives convinced that
Canada's grand old party had become too spendthrift, too prone to
leftist social agendas, too felicitous of minorities and, above
all, too willing to make constitutional compromises in order to
keep Quebec separatists in the federal fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who couldn't stay together in the first
place,'' said Allan Tupper, professor of political science at the
University of Alberta. ``For many in Reform, Conservatives have
dangerously liberal tendencies. To many traditional Tories, the
Reformers are right-wing zealots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might seem that nothing would be more obvious or natural
than a joining of forces between Reform and the Conservatives,''
Tupper said. ``But the right has never been fertile soil in
Canadian politics. Forming a major conservative bloc will be a very
difficult undertaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives produced Canada's first prime minister, John A.
Macdonald. When the country was born in 1867, and for 126 years,
the party served as the main political foil to the Liberals, a bit
like Republicans to Democrats in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the elections of 1993, in which Conservatives, after
nearly a decade in power under Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, were
not just defeated but nearly obliterated, and reduced to just two
seats in the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
   The disaster partly reflected voter discontent with the Mulroney
government, widely perceived as corrupt, callous and, worst of all,
cravenly toadying to the United States. But a deeper problem was
that Liberals and Conservatives had become indistinguishable. Both
were committed to keeping Canada a social welfare state like the
nations of Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate Tory supporters switched in droves to the Liberal
Party, which is basically Canada's party of the middle, while
hard-core conservatives bolted to create the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Popular in Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan but unable
to entice voters anywhere else, Reform is Canada's closest
equivalent to an American-style right-wing movement with its blend
of conservative Christian moralizing and strident attacks on big
government. It opposes abortion, gay marriages, increased immigrant
quotas, and, above all, the granting of special constitutional
status to Quebec, which many Canadians believe is the only way to
keep the province from seceding.
</P>
<P>
   Reform is led by Preston Manning, a polarizing politician whom
people either adore or detest. Voters in the Canadian Rockies and
the prairie provinces mostly fall into the first camp. Voters in
Ontario, Quebec, and the Maritimes seem almost universally put off
by his preachy, hectoring style.
</P>
<P>
   Manning is a pragmatist who recognizes that Reform will never
break from its regional base to become a major national force
without the Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sincere attempt to build a movement that can lead
the country,'' he said recently, pressing for a united right front
against the Liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Conservative Party is at once suffering from an
identity crisis and an almost total lack of national leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Until eight months ago, the party boasted at least one precious
political asset in the form of its boss _ a vigorous, eloquent and
highly visible Quebecer named Jean Charest, popular from
Newfoundland to British Columbia. Charest's charisma is widely
credited for the Conservatives' ability to crawl back from the 1993
debacle and regain ``major party'' status, which requires 10 seats.
</P>
<P>
   But Charest stunned Conservatives in April by quitting to join
the Liberals in a high-risk effort to unseat separatist Lucien
Bouchard as premier of Quebec. He failed in that mission, losing
the Nov. 30 vote to the separatists, but is expected to remain in
Quebec as head of the Liberal Party in order to wage a long-term
campaign against the secessionist movement.
</P>
<P>
   In a Conservative Party convention last month that drew mostly
yawns and derision, the Tories tapped former prime minister Joe
Clark as their new leader. The 59-year-old Albertan headed a
lackluster national government for a few months in 1979-80, and has
been seldom heard from since. It is as if US Republicans tried to
project a bold new image by recalling Gerald Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond being a nostalgia candidate, I don't see the electoral
appeal of this particular product,'' said Darrell Bricker,
executive vice president of the Angus Reid Group, a polling firm.
</P>
<P>
   Clark and his moderate-to-liberal-leaning ``Red Tory''
supporters adamantly oppose joining forces with the Reform Party,
which many Conservative loyalists see as a dangerous group of
right-wing renegades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conservatives, before they consider any united alternative,
will want to hear a different speech from the Reform Party
regarding homosexuals, visible minorities, and Quebec,'' said
Senator Pierre-Claude Nolin, a powerful Tory. ``I have some
profound problems with their positions on these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alberta Premier Klein and other Conservatives believe
drastic measures are necessary if the party is to be salvaged.

MASSACHUSETTS LAGS WAY BEHIND ON WELFARE REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On their recent co-jaunt to Israel, I am willing to bet Paul
Cellucci and President-in-waiting George W. Bush did not discuss
one fact that underlines the backward character of Massachusetts
these days.
</P>
<P>
   It concerns welfare, and the gulf between Massachusetts and many
other states as well as Uncle Sam on the vital subject of making
welfare reform work, not merely to ride out a solid economy and
Draconian rules that slash the rolls, but to make better lives
possible for former recipients of cash assistance and their young
children.
</P>
<P>
   In the all-important area of state effort to assist the
transition from welfare to full-time training and work, Texas under
Bush had received some $76 million from the federal government as
of Labor Day. Significantly, it was putting up half again as much
of its own money to fund the aglomeration of school, job-training,
transportation help, child care, and job placement services that
constitute real welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   By embarrassing contrast, the $20 million Massachusetts has
received is leveraging only a piddling 20 percent effort by the
state, a mere $5 million. And this comparison can be made with many
states, where time limits, the gradual end of cash aid to mothers
with young children, and other steps are being matched by all-out
state efforts to make sure that poor people with huge problems are
not simply dumped.
</P>
<P>
   But our state's record in the 1990s has been marked by an
embarrassing combination of recklessness and indifference. In the
Weld-Cellucci era, aggressive efforts have been made to take
advantage of opportunities spawned here in health care, but the
welfare record stinks. Earlier in the process, there was even an
occasion when the state did not bother applying for some $10
million it could have received to help families ease their
transition to work.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Massachusetts is a benefits-slasher, on the strength of
the economy and its often cruel rules. The state's idea of
``generosity'' was the recent decision to suspend the expiration of
time limits on assistance to the end of the Christmas holidays.
These non-actions miss the central point that with exceptions too
miniscule to mention, there is no mother on welfare who wants that
life, who won't respond in an instant to a set of real opporunities
for life in the workforce. Many simply need a job, but for tens of
thousands with no skills, with no way to get child or health care
for their kids, the transition threatens to be brutal.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there is a federal government, and a remarkable
network of community and business organization trying to fill some
of the void left by the state's abysmal failings.
</P>
<P>
   No one noticed, but late last month, Senator Edward Kennedy made
sure that a serious chunk of change was provided to _ among others
_ that very network in the Boston area. Out of roughly $4 million,
there will be a marriage between services and education on the one
hand and jobs on the other.
</P>
<P>
   On the services side are Boston's venerable and acclaimed
antipoverty organization, Action for Boston Community Development,
in partnership with Morgan Memorial Goodwill Industries. And on the
jobs side is the Boston Technology Center, where there is some
state involvement, that is going to be target welfare recipients
for high-tech production jobs in Dorchester and South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In securing the money, Kennedy notes that as the rolls are
pared, the people who remain are almost all the toughest to train,
the least educated, and the least work-experienced. Getting such
casualties of lousy education and family catastrophes into position
to work is hard enough, but there also have to be jobs that can
actually support a struggling family. And all of this takes serious
investments of professional time and public money.
</P>
<P>
   It is being done, to an extent anyway, nationally via $250
million in welfare-to-work grants as well as via President
Clinton's private sector jobs crusade. And it is being done
vigorously in numerous states with Republican governors _ from
Bush's Texas to Tom Ridge's Pennsylvania to Tommy Thompson's
Wisconsin, even to David Beasley's South Carolina and Fob James's
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   But Massachusetts lags way behind.
</P>
<P>
   ABCD President Bob Coard said that the expiring time limits in
the state are occurring at a time that makes the affected familes
unusually vulnerable. ``We're talking about something like 100,000
people, including children, who are already at the bottom of the
opportunity pile,'' he said. ``And in addition to this, they are
facing new pressures from housing costs and availability and from
the rising prices of other necessities.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's tireless work has made it possible for groups like
ABCD to make a real difference in filling the void. But the void
will remain and the embarrassing fact is that in welfare reform,
Massachusetts is a follower not a leader.

LEADERS WILL GAUGE SOCIAL SECURITY TROUBLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``The crisis is here, and it's very real,'' says
Economic Security 2000, a citizens group pushing to overhaul the
Social Security program. ``Social Security is going broke,'' says
the Cato Institute. ``The system is broken,'' says a group called
Third Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton and congressional leaders gather Tuesday
and Wednesday to discuss the financial health of Social Security,
one of the first issues they must decide is whether the problem is
really this bad. There is no question that the system needs more
money. But reasonable estimates range widely, from $3 trillion to a
devastating $10 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Is the nation's retirement program in crisis, or just hitting a
few bumps?
</P>
<P>
   The answer will bear directly on whether and how lawmakers
revamp the nation's most popular domestic program. If Americans
become convinced that Social Security is in crisis, they may be
more open to dramatic changes. Chief among them: allowing workers
to pay Social Security taxes to personal stock and bond accounts,
rather than to the government.
</P>
<P>
   But if the program is only a bit wobbly, the public might oppose
anything more than minor tinkering.
</P>
<P>
   That explains the ongoing battle over how to describe the
urgency of the problem. Groups that want to create private accounts
_ such as Economic Security 2000, the Cato Institute and Third
Millennium _ say Social Security is in dire straits. Members of all
three groups are among the 250 people invited to the first day of
the White House conference, and the director of Third Millennium
will be a featured speaker.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis school has some prominent economists on its side.
``Yes, it's a crisis,'' said Laurence Kotlikoff, a Boston
University economist who has written on the subject. ``When you're
talking about something that would take a 50 percent tax hike to
fix, it's a real crisis. . . . . It's a terrible problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a coordinated campaign, prominent left-of-center
activists have begun a counteroffensive to say the problems are
overstated. ``Social Security is in fact in remarkably good
shape,'' the Rev. Jesse Jackson asserted last week during the
kickoff of a group that aims to block any move to private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the cover of a fantasy funding crisis . . .
conservatives want to revise or even eliminate Social Security,''
said Patricia Ireland, president of NOW, who criticized the
``Chicken Little atmosphere'' surrounding the program.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters is that groups on all sides of the issue
fear that lawmakers will avoid making any changes to the
politically hypersensitive program unless the threat of a crisis
hangs over them. And almost everybody agrees that some type of
change is needed, or else Social Security will be unable to pay all
its promised benefits in about 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no short-term crisis,'' said Kenneth Apfel,
commissioner of the Social Security Administration. ``But it's a
hard issue because without that `crisis' word, the question is
whether we can actually bring the country forward to resolve this
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Reasonable people, making defensible economic assumptions,
arrive at different views of Social Security's financial health.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security raises money though a 12.4 percent tax on wages,
paid half by workers and half by employers. For years, the tax has
raised more money than Social Security pays out each year in
benefits to retirees. The surplus goes to the Treasury for general
purposes, and the Treasury in return gives Social Security special
bonds, which are held in a trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   The trust fund has collected $655 billion in bonds so far, and
it will add more in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   But soon, the nation's 76 million Baby Boomers will begin to
retire. By about 2013, so many Boomers will be drawing retirement
benefits that the system has to cash in some of the Treasury bonds.
And by about 2032, all the bonds will be gone.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean the system will be bankrupt. Even with no
trust fund, the 12.4 percent tax will produce enough money each
year to cover about three-quarters of the benefits for retirees.
The problem is the remaining one quarter. The question facing
policy-makers is whether paying for that one quarter will be
relatively painless or catastrophically expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably as many answers as there are people looking
at it,'' said Michael Tanner of the Cato Institute, a libertarian
think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Three factors have shaped the debate over the scope of the
Social Security problem: whether the goal is to fix the system
forever or for only a set number of years; forecasts of future
economic growth; and the reliability of the Social Security trust
fund.
</P>
<P>
   When economists add up all the income and obligations of the
system over 75 years, the shortfall comes to about $3 trillion.
That shortfall could be wiped out if payroll taxes were raised
today, and permanently, by about 2.2 percentage points. The tax
increase would erase the shortfall for 75 years, the longest time
horizon that many economists are willing to consider.
</P>
<P>
   But others say the nation should put Social Security into
balance forever. Social Security's own advisers have noted that the
nation will still have a growing number of retirees in 75 years,
and that a tax increase of 2.2 percentage points allows the system
to fall into deficit in year 76.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should you stop at 75 years and ignore the huge deficits
in year 76, 77, 78?'' asked BU's Kotlikoff.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing Social Security forever, he said, would take a huge tax
increase of 4.7 percentage points. ``How would you like to give up
a nickle of every dollar you earn, every day, for the rest of your
life, and your kids and grandkids have to do it, too?'' Kotlikoff
asked. ``That's the nature of our problem here.''
</P>
<P>
   The news gets worse, according to some analysts.
</P>
<P>
   To arrive at its estimate of a $3 trillion shortfall, Social
Security's internal analysts make certain economic assumptions.
They assume that the economy will grow by about 2 percent annually
in the next decade, down from about 3.8 percent last year. They
assume that inflation will rise to about 3.5 percent, up from about
2.3 percent today. By the year 2070, they say, women will live on
average to age 84, and men to age 79.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawmakers accept these numbers, but a vocal minority says
Social Security has a poor record for accurate predictions. They
favor using more conservative forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner, for example, says the Census Bureau has predicted that
people will live two years longer than the Social Security
projections say, requiring the program to pay out more money in
benefits. Kotlikoff says the Social Security numbers overstate
future increases in worker paychecks, so they give an overly
optimistic view of tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   If lawmakers accept conservative forecasts, it would take a tax
hike of six percentage points to fix Social Security for 75 years,
Kotlikoff said _ far more than the 2.2 percent hike under the more
optimistic assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also take different views on the Social Security trust
fund, the pool of Treasury bonds worth $655 billion.
</P>
<P>
   To some, it is real money that can be relied on to pay benefits
for future retirees. But others say the trust fund is merely a pile
of IOUs that can be paid off only by future tax increases or
spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
   If the cost of paying off the IOUs is included, these analysts
say, it would take a 6 percent payroll tax hike to fix Social
Security for 75 years. ``The trust fund is key,'' said Tanner.
``How you view the trust fund tells you whether you have a problem
in 15 years or in 34 years, and whether it's a 2 percent problem or
a 6 percent problem.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some say there is not much of a problem at
all. Last week, Jackson and Ireland said the nation could grow its
way out of its Social Security problem. If economic growth remained
at it current pace, they said, more people would work and would
earn more money, allowing the system to raise enough tax revenue to
cover its costs.
</P>
<P>
   Crisis or not, many lawmakers say that problems will only get
worse if they do not settle on a solution now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people want to define the problem as very doomsday in
order to support a radical overhaul,'' said Representative Earl
Pomeroy, Democrat of North Dakota. ``The fact is we've got the Baby
Boomers right now in their earning years, and we've got a federal
budget surplus. This is a problem we can fix, and we don't have to
scrap the system to do it.''

`PRIVATIZING' SOCIAL SECURITY CAN MEAN MANY THINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the lobbyists who want to make big changes to
Social Security get together, they sometimes try to dream up a new
term for what it is they are trying to do. ``Everyone wants to come
up with a word that means the same thing as `privatization,' but
which isn't such a liability,'' says Marty Regalia, chief economist
for the US Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   It is a big, ominous, and vague word _ but we can expect to hear
a lot more about privatization in the next few days. On Tuesday and
Wednesday, President Clinton and congressional leaders will meet at
the White House to begin working out a plan to stave off financial
problems that might cripple Social Security early in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   As they struggle toward a solution, many politicians will argue
that Social Security can be saved by some form of privatization.
Others will argue that privatization would completely destroy the
program.
</P>
<P>
   And that should provoke an immediate question from those
watching the debate: What kind of privatization do they mean?
</P>
<P>
   Most often, but not always, privatizers like the Chamber of
Commerce want to give people the right to invest some of their
Social Security taxes in their own private accounts _ accounts
owned by them and not the government. But how would the accounts
work? Would there be limits on how we could use our savings? And
what would happen to people who are already retired?
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone tells me they're in favor of privatization, it
doesn't tell me much until I hear lots and lots of details,'' said
Joseph Quinn, an economics professor at Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   If the the politicians remake Social Security, they will be
drawing up a new contract for our financial future, and no one
should sign a contract without reading the fine print. Precision in
language will be important. What follows is a guide to help make
sense of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --When someone supports or attacks privatization, which kind are
they talking about?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To pay for Social Security benefits, the government imposes a
12.4 percent tax on the wages of nearly every worker. The tax is
split evenly between employer and employee.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the tax raises more money than Social Security needs
each year to pay benefits. The surplus money is given to the
Treasury for use in general government, and the Treasury in return
gives the Social Security system bonds that yield about 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When lawmakers talk about privatization, they most often mean
that people should be able to divert some of the 12.4 percent
payroll tax into privately owned, individual accounts in the
worker's own name. In their view, we would become investors instead
of just taxpayers, building individual wealth by buying stocks and
bonds of our own choice.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers sometimes use privatization to refer to something
else: allowing the Social Security system itself to buy stocks,
without creating a private account for each worker.
</P>
<P>
   Under this idea, Social Security itself would use tax money to
buy stocks on behalf of the system as a whole. The stocks
presumably would yield more than the 6 percent Treasury bonds _ but
there are no guarantees. If the stocks rise in value, the system
would have more money to spend on benefits for future retirees,
delaying financial problems that are scheduled to hit after the
year 2030. If the stocks fall, the loss would be shared by everyone
together.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --How ``individual'' would the individual accounts be?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under some plans, one person's account could look far different
than another person's.
</P>
<P>
   These plans see Social Security becoming like  &UR; today &LR; 's IRAs, or
individual retirement accounts, where people can buy pretty much
any type of investment they want from whomever they want _ banks,
brokerages, insurance companies, or mutual fund firms.
</P>
<P>
   The drawback, however, is that the government might find it hard
to supervise 148 million accounts spread among thousands of
financial firms, some of which might be pushing risky investments.
That is why some lawmakers favor individual accounts that look like
 &UR; today &LR; 's 401(k) plans, which businesses commonly offer to workers.
</P>
<P>
   In this system, workers would have as few as two or three
investment options, maybe only a single bond fund and a single
stock index fund. The government would choose two or three
investment firms to manage the 148 million accounts, probably
picking ones that offer the lowest management fees.
</P>
<P>
   --Would there be restrictions on using the savings?
</P>
<P>
   Someone who owns a television is free to sell it for cash at any
time, or to give it to the kids. It is unlikely people would
``own'' their Social Security accounts in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, after all, is to make sure that people save for
retirement _ not for other purposes _ and that people use their
savings to avoid falling into poverty and onto welfare. But those
goals might conflict with giving people full ``ownership'' of their
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   For example, some lawmakers say the system should bar people
from withdrawing money from their accounts until retirement. On the
other hand, how can Congress say no to people who want to use their
savings for current medical or college costs? Lawmakers have
already loosened the rules on the use of IRA and 401(k) money for
medical care, college tuition and home purchases.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear at this point whether ``ownership'' would mean that
people have the right to withdraw all their savings at once on
retirement. Congress might decide that it is better to limit people
to withdrawing only a certain amount each year.
</P>
<P>
   Under some plans, workers are forced to use their accumulated
savings to buy an annuity _ a contract, generally sold by insurance
companies, to pay a person a set amount of money for the rest of
his or her life. This would ensure that a person's retirement
savings produce income until his or her death. But it would also
deprives Americans of a key element of ``ownership'' _ the right to
leave money in the account for their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --How much would a system of private accounts cost?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Listen for whether a speaker is talking about private accounts
as a ``carve out'' or as an ``add on.'' In a ``carve out'' plan,
people divert _ or carve out _ a portion of the 12.4 percent Social
Security tax and invest it in their own private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Some people say ``carve out'' plans won't work, because they
divert money that is needed to pay for  &UR; today &LR; 's retirees and for
people who are close to retirement. Some say that private accounts
can be created only as an ``add on'' to the current system. In
other words, workers could start private accounts, but any
contributions would come in addition to paying the current Social
Security tax.
</P>
<P>
   Can we afford to start private accounts while maintaining
benefits for people who are in retirement, or for future retirees?
Some ``carve out'' supporters say that creating private accounts
will require additional taxes to help pay for current retirees, or
that retirees will have to accept benefit cuts. Others say the
transition will not cost much, because the government will have
fewer obligations to workers once they build up sizeable savings in
their private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners will have to decide which group sounds more credible.
And even if there is some pain involved in moving to private
accounts, listeners will have to ask if it is greater than the tax
increases or benefit cuts that might be required to fix Social
Security without creating private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   William Shipman, a principal with State Street Global Advisors
in Boston and a leading proponent of private accounts, compares the
transition to refinancing a home mortgage. Sure, you have to pay
closing costs, attorneys' fees and points, but getting the lower
interest rate means you are better off in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --What happens to the poor and vulnerable?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Social Security has been called the most successful social
program in the country, cutting the poverty rate among seniors
during the past 40 years from 35 percent to 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It has done this because it redistributes wealth: from
high-income to low-income workers, and from single people to
traditional families with stay-at-home moms. It also pays
disability benefits to injured workers and survivor benefits to
workers' families.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see Social Security as a low-risk, low-return
retirement system,'' said Sharon Daly of Catholic Charities USA.
``But really it is a mutual insurance program'' where we insure
each other against death, disability and poverty in old age.
</P>
<P>
   Private account plans might weaken this aspect of the program.
Currently, millions of stay-at-home parents (almost all of them
women) earn retirement benefits merely because they are married to
someone with a paying job. If workers save for their own
retirement, what happens to the mother who never joined the paid
work force?
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Social Security has been a good deal for low-income
workers. Compared to wages they earned when they were working,
low-income retirees get more from Social Security than do their
high-income counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Private accounts could change this feature. If everyone sets
aside 2 percent of wages for retirement, the low-wage worker will
accumulate far less money over a lifetime than would a high-wage
worker.

<P>
   NANTUCKET, Mass. _ Thomas Johnson went underground 10 years ago
to bury his rage against the corporate vipers, clock-punching
consumers, and environmental rapists he saw in society.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, he separated himself from all but a few close
friends, afraid that living in a world he loathed would be
dangerous for him and for the people he encountered.
</P>
<P>
   Eight feet underground, Johnson says, he found a peace in
solitude that had eluded him throughout a tempestuous childhood and
a short-lived but frenzied criminal life.
</P>
<P>
   But now, his home discovered at last, Johnson says he is more
frightened of the future than of anything he has known. And this
man of the earth, as he sees himself, is afraid that rejoining
society may rekindle the rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``God told me it was time to come out of the hole,'' Johnson
said. ``But I don't know if I have the energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his fears, Johnson hopes his reemergence will be a
cathartic opportunity to share his thoughts with a world he sees
rushing pell-mell toward an empty future.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Johnson's neighbors in Nantucket's winter community
seem more inclined to view him as a charming eccentric, rather than
their version of the angry survivalists who take to the land in
more rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   As he fights to keep his underground home, Johnson has become a
local celebrity, the embodiment of the spirit of those who choose
to live year-round on an island.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happiness must be found in the moment, at the moment,''
Johnson said, resting his lanky 6-foot-4 frame against a bunker
wall. ``We must have a sense of rapture.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 38, says he carries that sense of wonder whenever he
walks among the bayberry bushes, scrub oak, blueberries, and scrub
pine of the remote corner of the Boy Scout camp he calls home.
</P>
<P>
   Since the recent discovery of the hideout by a deer hunter who
stumbled on its stovepipe, Johnson's peace has been shattered.
Police have inspected the three-room home. Federal and state agents
have demanded he return hawk talons and owl wings, which are
illegal to possess but which Johnson says were road kill.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Johnson said, a deputy sheriff served him with a 30-day
eviction notice.
</P>
<P>
   The Nantucket health inspector also has scoured the dwelling,
calling it a marvel of craftsmanship but issuing 23 code violations
nonetheless. Richard Ray, the health officer, has cited the Boy
Scouts for having a dwelling on their property that does not meet
state code for human habitation.
</P>
<P>
   The Nantucket district of the Scouts, which had been unaware of
Johnson's home, has until Dec. 23 to resolve the code violations,
which target Johnson's toilet, water, heating, ventilation and
exit, among other complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Graves, chairman of the Nantucket Boy Scout district,
declined to answer questions. Ray said that if the Scouts do not
evict Johnson and the code violations are not addressed, a health
board hearing will be held that could result in an order for
Johnson to vacate.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, for his part, said he is prepared to dig elsewhere on
Nantucket. And Dr. Timothy Lepore, a well-known physician on the
island, has even invited Johnson to dig a home in his backyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he should be left alone,'' Lepore said. `I don't think
he represents a threat to the community or the environment. If you
want an archetypal, low-impact guy, he's the one.''
</P>
<P>
   Lepore, who treats Johnson for free and receives advice on how
to make arrowheads in return, is concerned about Johnson's ability
to readapt to society.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is frightened of the walls closing in on him, and also
of the inner demons that he says drove him to international drug
smuggling. If he had not withdrawn to his bunker, Johnson believes,
``there was enough rage in me that I could have been a thorn in
society.''
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of that rage germinated in Binghamton, N.Y., where
Johnson says he grew up as one of seven children of a city judge.
``By the time I was 18, I was convinced I'd be the Antichrist,''
Johnson recalled. ``I was an arrogant little S.O.B. I wasn't born
with a silver spoon in my mouth _ I gagged on it.''
</P>
<P>
   For emotional release, Johnson would retreat to the banks of the
Susquehanna River, whose beauty he describes as the defining
influence on his life. Nearby, in Pennsylvania, he built his first
log cabin as a teenager. Alone in the woods, his interest in nature
blossomed with the remarkable outdoor skills and craftsmanship he
taught himself.
</P>
<P>
   He attended community college, but lasted one semester,
scribbling only the words ``When Johnny comes marching home again,
hurrah, hurrah'' on every test and paper he was given.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, at 20 years old, Johnson held his father in his arms
as he died of colon and liver cancer. The family fell apart,
Johnson says, his siblings scattering from the home as he stayed
behind to care for his grieving mother.
</P>
<P>
   About this time, drug use became a sinister, integral part of
his life, growing from mind-altering recreation into an opportunity
for easy but dangerous money. Johnson says he made three trips to
Europe, where he acted as a courier for Thai heroin. On the last
journey, carrying 2 kilograms of heroin stitched in a suitcase,
Johnson says he was met in Rome by machine-gun-toting policemen as
he exited a train from Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-seven days of solitary confinement followed, he says, and
then a seven-year sentence in a Rome prison. There, Johnson says
with a slight smile, he earned a doctorate in human relations from
a global stew of criminals who hated him for his middle-class,
American background.
</P>
<P>
   (Marco Bovo, attached to the Italian consulate in Boston, said
he could not confirm that Johnson had been imprisoned in Italy from
1983-1985 and has asked officials in Rome to check their records.)
</P>
<P>
   After 2 1/2 years in prison, Johnson says, he was released to
house arrest in the countryside. He soon fled Italy, Johnson
continued, and embarked on a three-month spree of check-kiting and
bank fraud before returning home to Binghamton.
</P>
<P>
   After an attempt to fashion a mainstream living, even taking
insurance courses, Johnson decided to move to Nantucket, where he
believed the quiet pace would help him write a book about his
prison experience.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after arriving in Nantucket, a radically different Johnson
went underground, building one dwelling that was unearthed during
housing construction and then relocating to the Boy Scout land at
Camp Richard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The genie was out of the bottle, and there was no putting it
back in,'' Johnson said. ``I decided to live in a hole in the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing his materials in by hand, digging a hole by shovel, and
keeping the entire enterprise a secret both exhausted and thrilled
Johnson. He alternated his approach to the hideout by using 15
different trails, walking one foot in front of the other to mimic
animal tracks, fashioning shoes that resembled deer hooves to hide
his presence, and confounding deer hunters who tried to use
unauthorized land by plundering their platforms.
</P>
<P>
   He had found the solitude he craved, but the isolation came with
a price.
</P>
<P>
   ``This home cost me nothing to build, but it cost much that's
dear to me to stay here,'' Johnson said. Chief among those
sacrifices has been the love of a woman, he continued, because no
one he has loved has been willing to share life underground.
</P>
<P>
   His health has been taxed, with high stress, joint pain, and a
sciatic nerve problem among Johnson's complaints. Lepore, the
doctor, says Johnson also is at tremendous risk to contract Lyme
disease because of the many deer ticks in the brush surrounding the
home.
</P>
<P>
   With a weary sigh, Johnson says he is unsure if he can withstand
the physical punishment of building another home like this. ``In
some ways, I don't want to pound another nail,'' he confided,
recalling the other underground homes he says he has built in
Pennsylvania, Colorado, and the Catskill Mountains of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson knows he will be a much more visible presence on an
island he loves. And despite the risk of ``becoming a cartoon,''
Johnson said he will spread his message of slowing down,
appreciating nature, and leaving less of a mark upon the earth.
</P>
<P>
   If forced to move, Johnson says, he will build another home. And
with offers like Lepore's, Nantucket's underground man may have
several sites from which to choose.
</P>
<P>
   When asked where Nantucketers should expect him next, Johnson
replied with a smile: ``Coming to a patch of woods near you.''

KEVIN ZEGERS AND ``BUDDY' IN ``AIR BUD: GOLDEN RECEIVER.''

   NEW RELEASES: ``The Parent Trap'' _ A remake that works. Disney
charm combined with solid performances makes this one of the
studio's best live action movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Air Bud: Golden Receiver'' _ The Disney sequel fails to
measure up to the comic originality of ``Air Bud.'' Of course,
knowing that the original basketball playing retriever died of
cancer doesn't help the illusion, but, even so, this football-based
retread can't score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweet Ecstasy'' _ When the Elke Sommer film was first released
in 1962 it created quite a sensation with the star dancing nude.
Those sorts of things were rarely done back then. Now, it would be
rated PG-13. For fans of camp, it's worth seeing as an archival
piece, but it's rather dumb and tame for those who are not scholars
of the genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sour Grapes'' _ Larry David, cocreator of ``Seinfeld,''
strikes out with his first feature. Too long and not enough pep for
a story that starts with a jackpot in Atlantic City. Star Craig
Berko does a very poor impersonation of Albert Brooks.

A YOUNG TAKE ON LOVABLE OLD   MEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By M.R. MONTGOMERY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kirk Jones, first-time feature-film writer and director (auteur,
as the snobs used to say), did not set out to make a geezer movie.
But when you come up with two lead actors whose combined age is
over 150 years (but who's counting?), you have not made the
ordinary narcissistic about-my-life First Film.
</P>
<P>
   His comedy ``Waking Ned Devine'' was a quiet smash at Cannes
earlier this year. It is Irish, it is about a wake, but it really
is about the human condition, with an emphasis on the geriatric
imperatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' Jones said, ``I didn't set out to write a movie
about old men.'' The plot revolves around who bought, and who's
going to cash, a winning ticket that's a huge hit on the Irish
National Lottery. ``The lottery idea was the beginning, and it just
made sense for them to be older. That's who buys the tickets. I do
think,'' he added, ``that some of the characteristics of one of my
grandfathers are in the film _ he was a little cheeky, and
mischievous, like Ian and David are.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Ian Bannen, a Scot who plays the first lead, Jackie
O'Shea; and David Kelly, a Dublin native who plays the second lead,
the master scene-stealer Michael O'Sullivan. Bannen is a veteran
stage and screen actor; so is Kelly, but he's something of a
Scarlet Pimpernel, always well disguised. He has never been less
disguised than in ``Ned Devine,'' including a motorcycle ride when
he is in, so to speak, a state of nature. Not only no makeup, no
costume.
</P>
<P>
   Director Jones is a young veteran of the television advertising
business, working out of London. Making the shift from 30-second
ads to 90-minute films was, he allowed, ``relatively easy. This is
simply because I worked so long and so hard on the script that
whenever a question came up, I knew the answer. I could be very
focused and very clear. After all, I'd been living with this for
more than four years and I just flat knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   Living with the script, and almost growing old with it in his
hands, he could have added. No one wanted to finance a film about
two geezers. Jones could have sold it a half-dozen times if only
he'd agreed to make the leads young and sexy. (They're old and
kinda sexy, by the way.) ``When I finally convinced one producer
that it would work with old actors, they got back to me. `Great
idea. Old guys. Now, Jones, all you have to do is change the
location from Ireland to Canada, and we'll get Jack Lemmon and
Matthau.' Well,'' Jones recalled, ``I knew it wasn't `Grumpy Old
Men 3.' And they're not grumpy, they're happy old guys having a
childhood they never had, growing up poor in rural Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sticking wth the script
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jones offered that just as every newspaper reporter has a novel
in his or her desk (that's the old days; now it's a novel on his or
her disk), every advertising filmer has a movie script. ``The
mistake they make,'' he said, ``is they have lunch. You know, the
deal lunch. I wrote a script and I stuck with it. I could have sold
the script, but I wanted to direct. I hadn't spent four years just
to hand it over and walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   Bannen and Kelly, who came through Boston earlier this fall on a
promotion gig, made nice about Jones without being prodded. Bannen
(like his movie character) did most of the talking and suggested
that they, and the movie, benefited from the ``absolute luxury of
spending two weeks on location before we started to film.'' That
was two weeks of walking through the scenery and the scenes,
talking through the script and the characters with Jones. They did
hit on a concept of their roles that works: Bannen is the
ringleader of this gang of two, Kelly is the comic sidekick. They
stay in character, even when the film approaches deep emotional
levels that might tempt another pair of actors to play for a quick
and cheap catharsis. They both remarked that the touching moments
in the funeral elegy scene (which is not exactly an elegy for Ned
Devine, who is not precisely dead) could have been played with
actors' tears running down their cheeks. ``But,'' as Kelly put it,
using a metaphor from the stage, ``we thought the tears should be
out front. This film required a balance between the emotions, and I
think it balanced out very well.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bannen and Kelly remember the two weeks on the Isle of Man
(an Irish dependency between northern Ireland and Wales) as the
time and place ``where the chemistry got going'' between them,
Jones remembers when and where the chemistry got started between
him and his actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent three days in Dingle, southern Ireland,'' Jones
explained, ``in part to help Ian with his accent. Frankly, I was
pretty nervous approaching these two great actors, and we had a
great time; I think we began to be friends there. We'd go to a pub.
Now, neither Ian or Michael drinks, not a drop, not even a lemonade
if they're in a barroom, and Ian would tape-record people talking.
He'd get some odd looks _ you have to imagine him with this hidden
tape recorder and the microphone under his shirtfront, so he's
going around the bar talking to people and sticking his chest out
so that the microphone would pick up what they were saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Myself, I would sit there and try to drink enough Guinness to
make up for them, and get quietly drunk, I suppose. But,'' Jones
summed up, ``because of Dingle and the two weeks on Man, where we
cemented the friendship, we started filming with no egos, no
stress. I got everything in just two or three takes, which,
considering the budget, was a blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost everything. There was the motorcycle problem. It
begins with a skinny-dipping scene and proceeds logically enough
from that state of undress. After remarking on how remarkably cold
that scene was, Bannen felt obliged to say how careful they had all
been to make sure that ``Waking Ned Devine'' didn't end up being
regarded as ``Geezers Drop Trou.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't let them take publicity stills during the
skinny-dipping, or Michael's motorcycle ride. This movie is not a
farce,'' Bannen intoned.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bike and the body stocking
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's ride, for plot reasons, requires him to be extremely
afraid about being delayed. Scared to death of being late, you
could say. And his expression, the wide eyes, the clenched jaw, the
fixed smile of desperation, is completely believable.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't acting,'' Jones agreed, ``that was pure terror on
Michael's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motorbike,'' he explained with enthusiasm, ``is something
new. It's on hydraulics, so it looks like you're really riding it.
And it feels like it. We were filming him in a body stocking,
trying to preserve a little of his dignity, and my cameraman would
say `Great shot, but I can see the stocking.' I did have to ask him
to take it off. He didn't mind at all; he didn't care a whit about
being stark naked if that meant we could finish the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   The one indisputable fact about ``Waking Ned Devine'' is that
the casting is a success. Bannen and Kelly, after untold years in
serious parts and minor roles in thrillers and dramas and even
Modern Existential Theater, are allowed to be very subtly funny.
``This is not a movie about avarice,'' Bannen said firmly. ``In
less sensitive hands, it could have been about the money. But it is
about these two old men. They are old children. They have come at
last, at this point in their lives, to where they can go out and
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly nodded agreement; he and Bannen agreed about everything.
``The nicest thing about our acting that any one said,'' Kelly
offered, ``and it's the nicest that anyone could say, is that it
was one performance.''
</P>
<P>
   The guy who played Ned Devine wasn't bad, either. You could say
the three of them gave one performance, although Ned Devine, for
most of the movie, is a prop. But that's the way it is when you're
at your own wake.

   Contemplating the millennium can be a cruel pastime for
ministers of culture, filling them with self-regard and a tendency
toward pop revisionism. (Y2K notwithstanding, it will only get
worse.) As the light fades over the 20th century, trend-spotters,
journalists, and other ne'er-do-wells begin to make even more lists
than usual _ groupings of cataclysmic events, great leaps forward,
novels momentous but unread. I refer in particular to this year's
stunningly aggrandized contribution from Random House's Modern
Library, which nudged its editorial board into naming (and ranking)
the 100 best English-language novels of the century. Sales of
``Ulysses,'' which headed the list, no doubt enjoyed a brisk little
field day, though I suspect few people rushed out to get ``The
Magnificent Ambersons,'' unless it was to rent the video. Then the
Radcliffe Publishing Course, determined not to be outdone in
quasi-democratic literary pursuits, countered with its own list,
including two titles by (!) Ayn Rand.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, well. This donnybrook was great fun for the arguments it
inspired, among them Richard Ford's dismissing the Joyce choice as
(sniff) the triumph of academic modernism. You will see no such
fur-flying here, if only because this list is both humbler
(bookended around a mere 12 months) and more grandiose (decided by
a voting jury of one). First, though, to the year itself _ which
promised much, delivered less, but still managed to slightly
enhance and advance the state of fiction.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been the gentlest of times, what with Wal-Mart suing
Amazon.com, Amazon.com appropriating the palpable art of browsing,
and Barnes &AMP; Noble trying to take over the world. Certainly 1998
had its share of dramas, amusements, and upsets. In an odd act that
seemed part misguided hubris and part bad taste, Pat Conroy snared
the assignment of writing the sequel to ``Gone with the Wind.''
Gordon Lish, a master of hubris and bad taste in his own fiction,
was reported to have had more creepy control over Raymond Carver's
stories than anyone, including Carver, would have liked. The fatwah
against Salman Rushdie was lifted just long enough for him to
exhale and lose his British police guard; then a new edict
announced he was still under death threat, probably forever.
</P>
<P>
   The complete Oxford English Dictionary went online, making those
of us with old-fashioned, clutterbug libraries feel more Luddite
than ever. Brit babe Bridget Jones, Helen Fielding's fictional
creation who can't find her pantyhose or a boyfriend, grabbed her
15 minutes in the sun (and on the bestseller lists), even if her
diary did induce the mildly amused horror of half the women in
America. Tom Wolfe's long-awaited ``A Man in Full'' enjoyed a
seven-figure printing and a National Book Award nomination before
the damn thing was even in the stores. Wolfe, who in those 700-plus
rip-snorting pages lets his own red dog off the leash, still
couldn't stop the quieter animal of Alice McDermott, whose upset
win at the National Book Awards was a sweet victory for literary
fiction.
</P>
<P>
   And that, really, suggested the kind of year 1998 was: full of
big old novels and graceful surprises, where the acknowledged
masters had to make room for the exquisite promise of newer
applicants. Rarely have so many stars in contemporary fiction
published in one season; rarer still was the number of
disappointments from within that lofty realm. Russell Banks and
Jane Smiley both turned their considerable sights toward the Civil
War, but their efforts failed to sway this reviewer: Banks's huge
novel about John Brown, ``Cloudsplitter,'' while passionately
wrought, lacks the grace and inner dimension of his previous work.
Smiley's ``The All-True Travels and Adventures of Lidie Newton''
achieves an intelligently realized picaresque ode to the
19th-century novel, but just isn't very captivating. Richard
Powers, whose cerebral gifts can either dazzle or dismay, mostly
accomplished the latter in his commerce-ridden novel, ``Gain.''
Anne Tyler wrote a Sweet 'n' Low story in ``Patchwork Planet'';
Nadine Gordimer composed a morally resonant but dry treatise in
``The House Gun.'' In a misfire attempt to go existential
tough-guy, Martin Amis wrote a miserable little mystery in ``Night
Train.'' Combining his sui generis brilliance with a gotcha subtext
mirroring his personal life, Philip Roth blended history and malice
in ``I Married a Communist.'' And Tim O'Brien, who also ought to
know better, created one of the most unsavory characters in recent
memory in ``Tomcat in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   All was not lost among such high elevations: Toni Morrison's
``Paradise,'' about the emotional legacies of an insulated Oklahoma
community, is a complex, rhapsodic novel. William Trevor's
inimitable sensibility hovers throughout the chilling story of
``Death in Summer.'' In ``Damascus Gate,'' Robert Stone wrote an
intellectually rich novel about the madness _ religious, political,
emotional _ of modern Jerusalem. John Updike finished off his
satin-smooth, half-melancholy trilogy about Henry Bech, his Jewish
doppelganger, in ``Bech at Bay: A Quasi-Novel.'' Cormac McCarthy
completed his Border Trilogy, on the mythic West of mid-century
America, with ``Cities of the Plain.'' And Richard Price surely
produced the most high-throttle novel of the summer with his story
about a child's disappearance in ``Freedomland.''

THE SINGULAR SOLMAN 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``You've got to have the matzoh ball soup,'' Joseph
Solman declares. ``It's the best in the city. There's a special
today: You get half a sandwich, too. Go for the pastrami or corned
beef.''
</P>
<P>
   Solman is seated at a table in the Second Avenue Deli. A New
York landmark, the restaurant doubles as an East Village monument
to ethnic chic and the best-known remaining outpost of the old
Lower East Side world of Jewish immigration. It's also just around
the corner from the apartment where Solman and his wife, Ruth, have
lived for the past 46 years.
</P>
<P>
   They just don't make places like this anymore _ the Second
Avenue Deli or New York _ and, at an astonishingly vigorous 89, Joe
Solman is living testimony to that. In everything from his
seltzer-out-of-a-siphon speech to his steadily sturdy percolation,
he conjures up a long-lost Gotham, a lower-slung, higher-minded
city, one of bracing promise as well as brutal reality, the New
York of May Day demonstrations and automats, of the Third Avenue El
and a period when, as Solman recalls, ``all the galleries were on
57th Street . . . and there wasn't room for contemporary American
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as now, the whereabouts of New York's art galleries
mattered a great deal to a man who has plied the painter's trade
for nearly seven decades. Solman, whose work is held by such
institutions as the Phillips Collection, the British Museum, the
Whitney Museum of American Art, the Corcoran Gallery, and the
Hirshorn Museum, remains very much a part of ``contemporary
American stuff.'' He averages 20 paintings a year, as well as
numerous drawings, monotypes, and gouaches. A selection of his
recent work in all those media, except monotypes, opened Dec. 5 at
the Robert Brown Gallery in Washington, D.C. Starting Saturday,
it's Solman's past that will be showcased, in ``The Ten: Rothko,
Solman and the Birth of the American Avant-garde,'' which runs
through Feb. 20 at the Mercury Gallery at 8 Newbury St. (see box).
</P>
<P>
   His age notwithstanding, Solman is no nostalgist or art-world
fossil. ``When I see something good, I'm still as excited as when I
was young,'' he says. ``You don't see something good every day, but
I still see it.'' He gets on the bus to make his rounds of
galleries and exhibitions and is eager to discuss what's currently
on view. ``I just spent two afternoons looking at shows at
Sotheby's (a wonderful Monet's there) and Christie's (what a
Vuillard they've got!).''
</P>
<P>
   Each of those canvases would go for several million dollars at
auction, yet Solman remembers a day when paintings by the giants of
modern art seemed inducements to revolution (artistic and
otherwise) rather than contributors to eight- or nine-figure
investment portfolios. Certainly, there can't be many other people
alive who attended the inaugural show at New York's Museum of
Modern Art in 1929. ``That was some revelation,'' Solman says. ``I
was still a student at the National Academy of Design. I'd seen
some modern art, but that show was such an eye-opener. Gauguin
especially appealed to me, but also Cezanne, van Gogh. And Seurat:
He looked like a madman to me _ that huge canvas covered with all
those dots! Now I understand. That he should have died at 32 _ what
a loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Boredom is something alien to Joe Solman generally, but a
special ebullience and even wonder fill his voice when he recalls
the New York art world of the years before the war. ``It animates
me, the memory of those adventurous days,'' he says. There was ``a
tremendous sense of ferment and excitement at that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all in the same boat,'' he explains, ``and it was kind
of a leaky boat. There's no camaraderie anymore. Money makes a big
difference. People think they can make it overnight. Painters seem
to think they'll hit some style and make it'' _ he snaps his
fingers _ ``like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember at a party once, in the early '70s, there was this
well-dressed young man there, a yuppie we'd call him now, I guess,
and we got to talking. `One thing I admire about you guys,' he said
to me, `was you never thought of money.' We sure didn't! We didn't
know you could make any (by) painting.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Artists, photographers, critics
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was an art world in which everyone seemed to know everyone
else, and Solman's friends included Stuart Davis, Willem de
Kooning, and Mark Rothko, fellow member of the art group the Ten
(``He was a figure painter, with some pizazz, influenced by
Picasso, but no one would have dreamt he'd become what he later
did''); the photographers Berenice Abbott and Aaron Siskind; the
critic Meyer Schapiro. While he didn't really know Jackson Pollock,
Solman worked alongside him on a Works Projects Administration
assignment. ``We snuck out for a beer and talked about Henry
Miller. He was a dipsomaniac, you know, and tried to get me to buy
him some more beer. I said no, I have to go home to my wife, and
that was that.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Pollock, or Rothko and de Kooning, Solman never abandoned
representational painting for abstraction. He's too much a man of
the city, too much smitten with its variousness and the visual
possibilities it presents. ``The subway is a universal studio,'' he
says. He's also kept faith with portraiture (``A face interests me
or it doesn't,'' he shrugs), and portraits rival cityscapes for
pride of place among his work. Not that Solman's any hidebound
realist: He plays with shape and form and color, even in his
portraits, with a freedom and daring that announce his avant-garde
roots. But always there must be that recognizable attachment to an
external world.

 UNDATED: ... in ``Freedomland.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ian McEwan, who won England's Booker Prize this fall for
``Amsterdam,'' a smaller work, wrote a gorgeously creepy novel
about obsession in ``Enduring Love.'' In ``The Antelope Wife,'' set
among Native American generations in the Midwest, Louise Erdrich
braided time and myth with love and tragedy. David Gates, acclaimed
for the world-weary narrator of his first novel, ``Jernigan,''
returned with equally wry mastery in ``Preston Falls.'' John Edgar
Wideman produced his usual mix of intelligence and passion in ``Two
Cities,'' set in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, while Barbara
Kingsolver, in her vast story about the former Belgian Congo,
delivered her best novel in years in ``The Poisonwood Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Hamilton's ``The Short History of a Prince'' captures her
lovable protagonist _ a gay man who has returned home to the
Midwest _ with prismatic depth. Widely admired for her story
collection, ``The Family Markowitz,'' Allegra Goodman turned her
sights to a summer community of Orthodox Jews in upstate New York
in her first novel, ``Kaaterskill Falls.'' Ethan Canin managed an
excellent friendship between a dentist and a self-destructive
blackguard in ``For Kings and Planets,'' while Dorothy Allison
followed a rock 'n' roll star home to Georgia in ``Cavedweller.''
The Irish playwright Sebastian Barry wrote a hauntingly mythic
little novel about a man trying to find his way in from the seas of
exile in ``The Whereabouts of Eneas McNulty.'' And Daniel Menaker,
beloved from his years as fiction editor of The New Yorker, wrote
an uproarious portrait of a Freudian shrink and his mostly helpless
analysand in ``The Treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   For the crowd who likes its fiction cerebral, the year also
offered intellectual bonbons from Peter Carey (``Jack Maggs,'' an
homage to ``Great Expectations''), Andrea Barrett (``The Voyage of
the Narwhal,'' where science and self-awareness collide in the
Arctic), Maureen Howard (``A Lover's Almanac,'' an ode to time and
modernity), and Cathleen Schine (``The Evolution of Jane,'' where
Darwin has a hand). There were new novels from old favorites, most
notably Joyce Carol Oates's ``My Heart Laid Bare,'' John Irving's
``A Widow for One Year,'' and Patrick O'Brian's ``The Hundred
Days,'' as well as the prolific Louis Begley (``Mistler's Exit'')
and Beryl Bainbridge (``Master Georgie''). Edwidge Danticat
revisited Haiti for the bracing truths of ``The Farming of Bones,''
while Gayl Jones, in ``The Healing,'' returned with her first novel
in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the heroes were local in 1998, for New England had a
pack of authors making welcome appearances, among them Howard
Norman's ``The Museum Guard,'' Elinor Lipman's ``The Inn at Lake
Devine,'' Eileen Pollack's ``Paradise, New York,'' George Packer's
``Central Square,'' Roland Merullo's ``Revere Beach Boulevard,''
Jill McCorkle's ``Final Vinyl Days,'' and _ oh, guv'nor! _ William
F. Weld's ``Mackerel by Moonlight.'' But most of us can't succeed
in (commercial) art and politics alike, so we are forced to rely
upon the mere sustenance of literature. Thank heavens, then, for
the fine harvest of 1998: for the creative challenges sought and
met, the ordinary moments exalted by such prose, and the splendid
traces left across the sky.
</P>
<P>
   To the richest legacies _ the finest fiction _ of 1998, we offer
these grateful accolades.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``The Hours''  &LR; by Michael Cunningham (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux,
$22). In this lovingly rendered homage to Virginia Woolf's ``Mrs.
Dalloway,'' Cunningham weaves the discrete stories of three women
into a subtle and stunning commentary on the power of art to
influence and guide our paths. You get to reread ``Mrs. Dalloway,''
too.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``This Side of Brightness''  &LR; by Colum McCann
(Metropolitan/Holt, $23). Opening with the exquisitely realized
days of a homeless man in modern New York, McCann then cuts to the
building of the subway tunnels at the start of the 20th century.
The novel feels both monumental and luminescent, with a richness of
physical and emotional detail that captures the span (and cruelty)
of history within one man's story.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Charming Billy''  &LR; by Alice McDermott (Farrar, Straus &AMP;
Giroux, $21). Admirers of ``That Night'' and ``Weddings and Wakes''
were thrilled when McDermott won the National Book Award for this
novel, which possesses her usual stylistic resonance as well as her
regard for the lure of the past. Billy himself is an Irish-American
raconteur of heart-swelling proportion, not least because his story
opens at his funeral.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Evening''  &LR; by Susan Minot (Knopf, $23). However commendable
her previous work, ``Evening'' is a quantum leap for Minot,
returning to the choices and passions of a woman's life through her
stream-of-consciousness memories on her deathbed. The novel renders
these two modes of being _ the life lived and the death faced _
with equal authority, and with a beauty that eulogizes both.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Birds of America''  &LR; by Lorrie Moore (Knopf, $23). Shimmering
with the reality of contemporary America, this collection of
stories is by turns hilarious and profound; the dialogue is nearly
always pitch-perfect, and at least two stories are on their way to
being classics. ``Birds of America'' accomplishes that task which
is the ineffable joy of art: It makes your life feel a little bit
wider when it's over.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``The Love of a Good Woman''  &LR; by Alice Munro (Knopf, $24).
Canada's great architect of the short story (in her hands, a
cathedral) has given us eight powerful stories that owe their
artistic mettle to Flannery O'Connor and William Faulkner as well
as to Chekhov. All set in the hinterlands of Ontario, they are
thick as stone, and just as strong, and they have at their dark
center a searingly truthful blend of chaos and grace.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``A Man in Full''  &LR; by Tom Wolfe (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux,
$28.95). Oh, that Virginia Tory turned double-agent. Nobody in
Atlanta can trust Tom Wolfe anymore, nor should they: ``A Man in
Full'' is a scarily precise, epic portrayal of Georgia-cracker
provincialism _ the New South in all its failed glory and comic
disrepair. It also rides roughshod over the rest of contemporary
America, from its high-rise boardrooms to the inside of a
California prison. Say what you will about the man's high-lit
pretensions: No other novel this year is as funny, exacting, or
cursedly ambitious.

 UNDATED: ... the movie.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The performing arts are always popular subjects for the
publishers of gift books. Pride of place this year should go to
``Seiji: An Intimate Portrait of Seiji Ozawa,'' edited by Caroline
Smedvig, with photographs by Lincoln Russell (Houghton Mifflin,
$40). This is a celebration of Ozawa's 25 seasons as music director
of the Boston Symphony, with tributes from several of his prominent
friends, associates, and colleagues, including John Williams, Peter
Serkin, Mstislav Rostropovich, Jessye Norman, Yo-Yo Ma, Andre
Previn, whom you would expect to find; the BSO's legendary
tympanist Vic Firth, a refreshing choice; and some genuinely
surprising figures like James Taylor, William M. Bulger, and Bob
Kraft. The most moving contribution comes from Nobel Prize-winning
novelist Kenzaburo Oe, who describes Ozawa's electronically
world-spanning performance of the finale of Beethoven's Ninth
Symphony at the opening ceremonies of the Nagano Olympics, placing
it in the context of the rising tide of Japan's new nationalism.
``Against this backdrop, Ozawa daringly joined the Japanese town
with diverse areas around the globe and conducted one of the finest
musical works of all humankind. I saw Seiji Ozawa in prayer.'' Some
of Russell's photographs are occasional and illustrative; the best
of them are profoundly revealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tributes: Celebrating Fifty Years of the New York City
Ballet'' (Morrow, $50) collects tributes to George Balanchine,
Lincoln Kirstein, Jerome Robbins, and Peter Martins by other
artists _ poets, writers, painters, designers _ who were drawn into
the orbit of this great institution these men created and curated.
There's not much, really, about ballet, but there's a lot about how
important this company has been in the lives of those who
experience it.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Somerset-Ward's ``The Story of Opera'' (Abrams, $49.50),
lavishly illustrated, comes equipped with a preface by Dame Kiri te
Kanawa. Somerset-Ward is an intelligent, careful, comprehensive and
mostly accurate historian (How could he have omitted Magda Olivero
from the list of great Adrianas?), but his footing becomes less
secure as he approaches the present, where he finds himself
discussing works as diverse as ``West Side Story,'' ``Die
Soldaten,'' ``Einstein on the Beach,'' and ``Nixon in China,''
which he calls ``one of the most revolutionary operas ever
created.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two big books from the world of rock music. ``The
Billboard Illustrated Encyclopedia of Rock'' (Billboard Books, $45)
is exactly what it says it is and comes from an authoritative
source; the tone is reference-book neutral even when the subject is
Barry Manilow. The hyperactive designers were not concerned about
keeping the text readable. This was also obviously not an issue for
the designers of ``The Rolling Stones: A Life on the Road,'' which
even at $50 (Penguin Studio) is cheaper than a ticket to a Stones
concert. The pictures are spectacular, and the apparently unedited
interviews by Jools Holland and Dora Loewenstein sometimes push
beyond routine, but design overrules content rather than
contributing to it.
</P>
<P>
   The illustrations in ``It Happened on Broadway,'' by Myrna Katz
Frommer and Harvey Frommer (Harcourt Brace, $35), are not the
reason to acquire the book; they are poorly reproduced in
unglamorous sepia. But the text is highly entertaining in an
anecdotal way _ like a convivial evening at Sardi's, or a talk show
without the interruptions of commercials or an imbecile host. The
authors, oral historians, interviewed 107 figures connected to the
Great White Way, ranging from famous stars from several generations
(Delores Gray, Celeste Holm, Elaine Stritch, Gwen Verdon, John
Raitt, Donna McKechnie, Betty Buckley, Judy Kaye) to publicists,
designers, directors, stage managers, and critics; their
recollections have been pieced and quilted into thematic patterns.
The best story repeats the devout Ethel Waters's response to the
way Mahalia Jackson rhythmed religious music, and her comment on
how Jesus would respond if He were ever to run into Mahalia on the
street.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Wallace employs a similar technique in ``The
Autobiography of Baseball: The Inside Story from the Stars Who
Played the Game'' (Abrams, $35). This is a collage of anecdote and
advice culled from a whole shelf's worth of biographies,
autobiographies, and interviews in newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Travel is another staple of the gift-book business, and Italy,
Greece, Ireland, and Mexico are all represented again this year.
Tibet is a destination as much spiritual as physical, and Peter
Sis's extraordinarily beautiful and uplifting ``Tibet: Through the
Red Box'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $25) celebrates this fact. In
1956, Sis's father, a Czech documentary filmmaker, was one of the
last visitors to the old Tibet; Sis has illustrated fragments of
his father's diary in a tribute to a vanished world that still
lives in spirit. ``The Tibetans: A Struggle to Survive'' (Red
Wheelbarrow, $45) has a more directly political purpose. The
photographs by Steve Lehman depict the despoiling of a great
culture, and its indestructibility; there is oral history, an
essay, and a preface by Robert Coles.
</P>
<P>
   Two new cookbooks are too beautiful to bring anywhere near the
Cuisinart or the stove. ``Ducasse: Flavors of France'' by Alain
Ducasse (Artisan, $60) is the first English-language cookbook by
the most celebrated chef in contemporary France, who has earned six
Michelin stars. Despite an editor's appendix of suggested
substitutions and techniques, the recipes don't look very practical
for an American home kitchen dependent on the American supermarket.
Still, Ducasse's book isn't just a collection of recipes but also a
gastronomic memoir (``Desserts unlock memories . . .'') and a
celebration of basic principles (``My cooking is about clarity of
taste, precision in execution, and respect for the product, which
to me means retaining its original flavor'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Culinaria: The United States: A Culinary Discovery''
(Koenemann, $39.98) introduces a prominent German art-book
publisher to the US market by surveying American food both
geographically and historically _ there are Native American recipes
here, and a tribute to the Korean market; there are recipes from
diners, brew pubs, and Delmonico's; you can find everything here
from bison chili to Buffalo wings. There are dishes you wouldn't
necessarily want to try (emu steaks with bacon molasses sauce, or
fried Rocky Mountain oysters), but nearly all the sumptuous
photographs look good enough to eat.

<P>
   Art lovers didn't rack up as many frequent-flier miles to see
shows this year as they did to check out new museum buildings.
Everybody who could went to Richard Meier's Getty, in Los Angeles,
and Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Bilbao, in Spain. The really with-it
also made a pilgrimage to Helsinki, to see Kiasma, the dazzling new
contemporary art museum by another American architect, Stephen
Holl. All these peregrinations have made Victoria Newhouse's
``Towards a New Museum'' (Monacelli Press, $45) the most
thumbed-over and valuable of this year's art books. She offers an
opinionated analysis of what the museum's role is and should be _ a
big topic, given that the last three decades have seen more than
600 art museums spring up in the United States alone.

<P>
   Art travelers on a less global level will appreciate John
Villani's ``The 100 Best Small Art Towns in America'' (John Muir
Publications, $16.95), which ranks Northampton number one.
</P>
<P>
   Travel of a grimmer sort sparked ``Vietnam: Reflexes and
Reflections'' (Abrams, $45), with essays by Eve Sinaiko and Anthony
Janson and reproductions of 200 works of art by men and women who
served in that war whose memory still rattles uncomfortably in the
national consciousness. Some of the work is cathartic; an important
exception is by the Boston-based sculptor Ken Hruby, whose ``War
Trophy'' invites meditation and multiple interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   Moments before a devastating 1997 earthquake caused incalculable
damage to the art-rich Italian town of Assisi, Ghigo Roli completed
the most extensive series of photographs ever made of the famous
frescoes of the town's 13th-century church. Those priceless photos,
on which the restoration will now depend, make up ``The Basilica of
St. Francis of Assisi: Glory and Destruction'' (Abrams, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, little was published in the West on Russian
art. That's changed. Among the best new books on this big field is
``The Russian Museum: A Centennial Celebration of a National
Treasure'' (Abrams, $60), with authors Vladimir Gusyev and Yevgenia
Petrova leading a tour through collections that extend from
medieval icons to Kandinsky and Malevich. The Russian Museum has
always played second fiddle to the Hermitage; this book shows why
it deserves to be better known in the West. Mikhail Guerman's
``Russian Impressionists and Post-Impressionists'' (Parkstone
Press, $55) is particularly valuable for its dramatic close-ups of
brushwork. And Matthew Cullerne Bown offers an astute examination
of art of the Soviet era in ``Socialist Realist Painting'' (Yale
University Press, $75).
</P>
<P>
   A sea change in politics also inspired ``German Art from
Beckmann to Richter: Images of a Divided Country'' (Yale University
Press, $65), edited by Eckhart Gillen. This massive tome tracks the
responses of German art to Nazi rule, the Holocaust, and the
nation's division into two separate countries.
</P>
<P>
   Authors with Boston connections contributed heavily to the
year's list of choice art books. Helaine Posner, former curator at
MIT's List Visual Arts Center, has produced an opulent monograph,
``Kiki Smith'' (Bulfinch Press, $60), about one of the most
significant artists on the scene. Posner's essay is a perceptive
gem. In ``Pictures of People: Alice Neel's American Portrait
Gallery'' (Brandeis University Press/University Press of New
England, $45), art historian Pamela Allara has written an excellent
account of an artist whose scatological content sometimes
anticipated Smith's by half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Higonnet, who teaches at Wellesley College, has written a
fascinating history of images of childhood, from innocent to
eroticized, in ``Pictures of Innocence: The History and Crisis of
Ideal Childhood'' (Thames and Hudson, $39.95). Richard Kendall's
``Degas and the Little Dancer'' (Yale University Press, $50)
examines in depth another image of childhood, Degas's iconic
``Little Dancer Aged Fourteen,'' a sculpture we think of as merely
sweet: Kendall explores its complexity, both physical and
psychological.
</P>
<P>
   Wellesley College architectural historian Alice Friedman offers
a new angle on familiar modernist landmarks in ``Women and the
Making of the Modern House'' (Abrams, $39.95), in which she
examines six houses by architects including Frank Lloyd Wright and
Robert Venturi, each commissioned by a strong-minded and
independent woman.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University Africanist Suzanne Preston Blier also mixes
art and sociology in ``The Royal Arts of Africa: The Majesty of
Form'' (Abrams, $24.95), an exploration of the court art traditions
that flourished in West and Central Africa in the centuries just
before and after those kingdoms' first contact with Europe. In
``The Tribal Arts of Africa'' (Thames and Hudson, $50),
Jean-Baptiste Bacquart takes an even broader look at the continent,
dividing it into 49 areas and offering examples of art from each,
all gorgeously photographed. And in ``Ancient West Mexico: Art and
Archeology of the Unknown Past'' (Thames and Hudson/The Art
Institute of Chicago, $50), editor Richard Townsend presents an
array of intricate earthenware tomb sculptures made by a society
whose sophistication we're only now discovering.
</P>
<P>
   Two titans of 20th-century abstraction are the subjects of 1998
retrospectives accompanied by important books. Both Kirk Varnedoe's
``Jackson Pollock'' (Museum of Modern Art, $75) and David Anfam's
``Mark Rothko: The Works on Canvas'' (Yale University Press, $125)
are opulent as well as scholarly. In ``Anish Kapoor'' (University
of California Press/Hayward Gallery, $35), Pier Luigi Tazzi and
Homi K. Bhabha document the work of one of the finest of mid-career
sculptors. Kapoor plays with perception, making walls and floors
bulge or disappear, posing teasing questions about spatial depth.
But his work transcends mere trickery: It belongs to a spiritual
realm.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Sutton, former curator at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts and
now director of Hartford's Wadsworth Atheneum, pays homage to a
17th-century Dutch master who has long languished in the shadow of
Vermeer in ``Pieter de Hooch'' (Yale University Press, $45.) The
book accompanies the first-ever de Hooch exhibition, which opens at
the Wadsworth Dec. 17. Another artist coming in for overdue
attention is post-Impressionist Pierre Bonnard. In ``Bonnard''
(Abrams, $60), John Elderfield and Sarah Whitfield place a painter
who has been on the periphery smack in the center of 20th-century
art. The many color reproductions are luscious; so many are of
Bonnard's wife in the bathroom that you can imagine her saying,
``Could I please get in here alone just once?''
</P>
<P>
   Another particularly lush book is Torsten Gunnarsson's ``Nordic
Landscape Painting in the Nineteenth Century'' (Yale University
Press, $65), which looks at landscape art in the nature-worshiping
nations of Scandinavia. Most of the names will be unknown to
general readers; one that is familiar is August Strindberg, a
gifted painter as well as a great writer.
</P>
<P>
   Among the oddities the art book trade has produced this season
is Gillian Riley's ``A Feast For the Eyes'' (Yale University Press,
$25), which pairs paintings in London's National Gallery with
appropriate recipes: Cezanne gets a compote with apples, and so on.
Riley stops short _ but just barely _ of sunflower soup to go with
van Gogh.
</P>
<P>
   RoseLee Goldberg has a long history with performance art: Her
1979 book ``Performance: Live Art 1909 to the Present'' is the
bible of this most ephemeral form of visual art. She's come up with
a valuable sequel, ``Performance: Live Art Since 1960'' (Abrams,
$60), just when the field is under fire, its chances for federal
financing diminished by the ``decency clause'' Congress has imposed
on the National Endowment for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   With sexual prudery gripping America and art, so that sexual
content is once again under attack, John Clarke offers a book that
puts things into perspective. In ``Looking at Lovemaking:
Constructions of Sexuality in Roman Art 100 B.C. - A.D. 250''
(University of California Press, $39.95), Clarke looks at a
sophisticated civilization's enjoyment of all manner of erotic
pleasures, as recorded in paintings and sculptures so graphic
they're a how-to. What a delightful irony that this book comes out
just in time for the holiday that celebrates the birth of the
religion that, in its more unfortunate forms, has done so much to
make us feel bad about our bodies.

   Again, though, listen to Joel on the subject. ``I got into a big
fight with Barbra Streisand's manager before her last tour,'' he
says. ``We were sitting around the table late night in New York
somewhere, and Barbra was talking about how she's going to tour.
The manager then said what they were going to charge and I said,
`Well, that sucks, what about all those little girls from places
like Brooklyn where Barbra grew up, who don't have that kind of
money?' And he looks at me and says, `Oh, I heard about you. You're
one of those troublemaker guys,' because I was telling Barbra it
was a rip-off. Here she was going around telling everybody to vote
for the Democrats, and then in the meantime, she's selling tickets
to Republicans. I thought that was a little hypocritical.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Jam
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Besides Joel, Pearl Jam is another act that keeps ticket prices
within reach of the general fan. ``The band remembers how
frustrating it was for them to get into shows as kids, so they keep
the prices low,'' says Pearl Jam manager Kelly Curtis from his
Seattle office. ``We were told (by promoters) that we could get
away with $5 more per ticket this summer, but we said no. We get
crap from people within the industry who are tired of our moral
standards, but that's what we believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Jam also keeps its T-shirt sale prices refreshingly low _
only $18 per shirt, compared with an industry average of $25 to
$27. And the group has battled venue operators who expect to get 40
percent of those sales because they provide the band a place to
sell merchandise on site.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Dallas this summer, the (arena operators) were shocked when
we said we wouldn't do it for more than 20 percent,'' says Kelly.
``So we ended up selling our stuff across the street from the
venue. We did that once in Toronto, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Some acts, in truth, can make as much in merchandise sales as in
ticket sales, if not more. And the greed award for merchandise has
to go to Kiss, which has more than 1,000 licensed items to sell.
When a TV interviewer once asked Kiss's Gene Simmons about the
merits of a $700 Kiss tour jacket, Simmons replied, ``If you don't
want a Rolls-Royce, then don't go into the showroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Such arrogance is totally foreign to country singer Garth
Brooks, who freaks out when anyone suggests raising the prices of
his tour merchandise. He's the exact opposite of greed when it
comes to his audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll explain it this way,'' Brooks says. ``On our live tour,
the most expensive thing we've got is a jacket. And we were told we
could sell it for $120-something. But that was just going to kill
me. So I basically asked how much is it costing us? And they said,
well, it costs $40 or $45. And I said, well, you know, I was always
taught by the guys in retail when I was in college that if you just
double what it costs you, that's a fair thing to do. And they said,
we can't because we won't be able to keep them in stock. I said,
well, order more of them, then. So that's why our most expensive
thing out there is $80. And the next closest thing to it is $20.
I'm just not a fan of the bigger-priced stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Observers worried
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I commend Billy Joel and Garth Brooks for doing what they do,
but, unfortunately, there are very few who do that,'' says Bob
Grossweiner, senior editor of Performance magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The future of the touring industry also has some observers
worried, especially since corporate giant SFX has spent $600
million to buy up many promoters and venues around the country.
There's a fear that SFX will inflate ticket prices, though
spokesman Tim Klahs says that won't be the case overall. He does
say, however, that at SFX's amphitheaters, which now include Great
Woods in Mansfield, there will be an increased number of
ticket-price points, meaning there will be five to seven different
prices per show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high end will be higher, and the low end will be lower,''
says Klahs. Asked if the high end would be in the $100-plus range,
he responds that this estimate is ``premature and speculative.''
</P>
<P>
   SFX is planning to increase advertising and sponsorship of its
tours and venues, as well as merchandising. ``We're talking to
large corporations who want to be associated with a very attractive
audience,'' says Klahs. ``We're talking to apparel manufacturers,
athletic shoe companies, financial service companies, credit
companies, and soft-drink companies. You'll find that all
entertainment is getting more and more associated with sponsors.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there's been any artist resistance to these plans,
Klahs replies, ``We haven't heard of any yet. That's not to say
that the more idealistic performers won't have a problem with some
of this.''
</P>
<P>
   And did we mention that the Rolling Stones are being sponsored
by Tommy Hilfiger on the arena tour, as if the group needs a
sponsor, given that ticket prices are so high?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I knew when I first got into the music business, this was
definitely not the Boy Scouts,'' Joel says in conclusion. ``There
was always greed. It just seems, though, that what was an
artist-driven business has not been like that for a long time. So
I'm not surprised that the bean counters have come in and found
ways to squeeze even more money out of the music lover.''

GATES OF EDEN 
By Ethan Coen 
Rob Weisbach/Morrow, 261 pp., $24 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a filmmaker, Ethan Coen has always possessed a pungent
inclination for the horrid, heartbreaking, and hilarious. He
embraces strange, battered souls skittering precariously on the
planet's fringe, forgotten people whose little lives are ever
cartwheeling wildly out of control. These aren't just dark lives;
they're so pitch-black it's as if they never enjoyed an honest
day's sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   They reside in Coen's funny, frightful hell of vengeful
husbands, bounty hunters, and inept hit men. Think of the ex-con
and police-officer couple so desperate to become parents they swipe
one of the newborn quintuplet sons of an unfinished-furniture
magnate in ``Raising Arizona.'' Or the blindfolded housewife, clad
in pajamas and slippers, running a frantic, futile dash in the snow
as kidnappers, hired by her weasel of a husband, gawk with glee in
``Fargo.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with his older brother, Joel, Coen is half of the
acclaimed filmmaking Coen brothers, responsible for some of the
most quirky, original films of the past 15 years, including ``Blood
Simple'' and ``Miller's Crossing'' as well as ``Raising Arizona''
and the Academy Award-winning ``Fargo.'' From screwball comedy to
film noir, their work been an intoxicating brew of the grisly and
farcical, the grotesque and comic.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the case with Ethan Coen's first collection of short
stories, ``Gates of Eden.'' It's an uneven but fearless offering
about the disillusioned and damaged among us, lives marked by
false, sometimes fatal moves. A chill of horror lurks beneath the
surface of Coen's worlds, where anything can go wrong and usually
does. There are tomato-can college-boy boxers, Hebrew-school
troublemakers, fast-talking show-biz types, and an unfortunate
woman who may have been a nag but certainly didn't deserve to be
sprawled in a yard with her head lopped off.
</P>
<P>
   Coen employs a variety of styles for his collection, from linear
narrative to wordy soliloquies and confessional, fever-dream
monologues, even mini-plays complete with stage directions. At
their best, the stories are so vivid the stench of stale smoke and
sweat seems to waft from the pages.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Destiny,'' there's Joseph Carmody, a sweet kid trying his
hand as a boxer. Never mind that he calls his fights ``beatings,''
since ``fight implies an exchange of blows'' and all Joey does is
catch punches and kiss the canvas. He half-jokingly considers
promoting himself as ``The Human Speedbag.'' Believing he might be
better suited for a more delicate line of work, he foolishly
accepts a job as a private eye bent on snapping a shot of his
client's wife in an act of infidelity. It proves to be an even
worse career move.
</P>
<P>
   It's vintage Coen _ funny, violent, and a little sad.
Unrestricted by the natural limits of screenplays and moviemaking,
Coen has more room to flex and to develop his characters, who are
revealed in the dead-on dialogue that has always been a hallmark of
the Coen brothers' scripts.
</P>
<P>
   Coen has a field day with staccato, almost Mamet-esque
gangster-speak in the book's best story, ``Cosa Minapolidan.'' It's
a sort of ``Miller's Crossing'' meets ``Fargo,'' with a dim-bulb
Cleveland goodfella who, wanting to be a player, decides to set up
shop in Minneapolis. As Coen describes it, de Louie's reason for
moving to the ``virgin turf'' of mild-mannered Minneapolis (which
de Louie mangles into ``Minapolis'') is the gangster's
misinterpretation of the city's name as Chippewa for ``New Naples''
_ and he missed his native Italy.
</P>
<P>
   As his native state, Minnesota becomes a character in some of
Coen's work, especially the examples that seem more like personal
essays than short stories. In ``The Old Country,'' Coen writes of
Michael Simkin, a 10-year-old rabble-rouser. ``He was a Hammer of
God, defying not Rome or the crown, but the Hebrew school
principal. Like the great scourges of history _ Genghis Khan,
Oliver Cromwell, Omar Mukhtar _ he seemed invulnerable, in his case
perhaps because he was too young to execute. Or so we believed.''
Coen gently examines growing up Jewish in a land dominated by
Swedes, Poles, and German Lutherans, and how quickly individuality
can be silenced.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as anyone familiar with Coen's movies knows, there's
always a wild hit-or-miss quality to his work _ for every ``Raising
Arizona'' and ``Fargo,'' there's ``The Hudsucker Proxy'' and ``The
Big Lebowski.'' Still, even when his stories don't cut it, it's
usually because Coen has leapt too far or reached too high for a
memorable touch. He doesn't fail because he chose a safe, well-worn
path. His juicy, pulpy writing style simmers on a medium flame, but
it never boils over into cliche. And as with his films, his
failures are often almost as interesting as other writers'
successes.

 UNDATED: ... to New York.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I shacked up with an old girlfriend and just completely
thought that I had run away from my life's calling. I called my dad
and said, `Dad, I don't know what to do. I left this play and I
don't ever want to get out of bed. And he said, `Well, son, I'd
like to help you, but I'm worried that your brother is going to
take his own life.' I flew down to Texas and took my brother up to
New York to live with me. By getting involved with my brother, I
got out of my own malaise over a period of months, which I think is
good advice to anyone who is prone to depression!''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Paxton was hired by James Cameron as a set
decorator on a Roger Corman film, ``Galaxy of Terror.'' ``The job
interview was something like, `Have you had some experience?' I go,
`Yeah, I worked for Roger in the past.' He said, `Well, can you
start now?' I said, `You mean right now?' He said, `Yeah. See that
wall over there? Go paint it brown.' I adore Jim. I know there are
a lot of stories about him, but he's got more integrity than just
about anybody I've met in California.'' The working relationship
has continued. Cameron cast Paxton as a punk offed by Arnold
Schwarzenegger in ``Terminator.'' He then appeared in Cameron's
``Alien,'' ``True Lies,'' and ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Another crisis
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While at work on ``Alien,'' Paxton underwent his second crisis
of confidence. ``I was playing the hysteric in the group. I
remember literally my guts would ache at the end of the day. It was
a tough energy to maintain over a 14-week shoot. I felt I had
completely overdone my character. I had another one of those, you
know, emotional situations, where I thought I had to do something
to change my life radically. I thought of joining the French
Foreign Legion as the most radical way I could change my life and
keep it romantically interesting. But they had a two-year waiting
list. Meanwhile, the film opened, and my character turned out to be
one of the most relatable characters. It was great, a real lift up
the ladder for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of anxiety between the time a shoot is finished
and the time a film is released. Jim said he read that I had a lot
of anxiety and he said, `You know, you never confided in me.' I
told him I would never have told him of these insecurities I had. I
think Sigourney (Weaver, the film's star) spotted it. She was
always introducing me to people and saying I was doing a wonderful
job. I thought, `Is it that apparent that I'm screwing up?' I
almost did an Oliver Stone movie, `U-Turn' _ I found him to be kind
of impenetrable and, ah, someone who wants to invite confrontation,
which is not my style.
</P>
<P>
   ``About two weeks away from starting, I felt like I was facing a
firing squad. Couldn't get my grip on the character. I'd probably
worked more on that part than on any I'd ever did, but I didn't
feel that our chemistry was such that it was gonna be a good
experience for me. He was grateful enough to replace me with Sean
Penn and that sent me crashing. I mean, here I told myself that I
had the lead in an Oliver Stone movie. My agency, I've got
everybody scratching their heads like this is the follow-up to
`Twister.' So I told myself, this isn't the time for a nervous
breakdown. But my heart was in pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The pain continued with the soft landing of Paxton's pet
project, ``Traveller,'' in which he played a gypsy scamster. The
story was discovered by his wife, Louise. They met when he
approached her on a London bus during a break from shooting ``The
Lords of Discipline'' (1983) and almost scared her off. They
weathered five off-and-on years, then married 11 years ago. They
have two children, James, 4 1/2, and Lydia, born last Dec. 19, the
day, Paxton reminds us, ``Titanic'' opened.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Twister'' sequel?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Twister,'' Paxton says he loved doing it and would do a
sequel if the script was good. ``Would I have liked more character
development? Sure, I was ready to weigh in big time with that. I
grew up in north central Texas. Twisters were a big part of, you
know, the lore of the land. I've only seen the preludes of a
twister. The whole atmosphere changes. Dark clouds come over and
they almost start turning this kind of gangrene green color. All
the grass kind of starts to glow in the late afternoon, and the
atmosphere starts to thin out and the birds sit on the ground. You
hear the telephone wires start to hum. You see the whole change in
the air and that was something we did not capture, I thought. But
that's what I remember as a kid before we went down into the storm
shelters.''
</P>
<P>
   Paxton exchanged twister stories with Ben Johnson, the original
star of ``Mighty Joe Young,'' who began as a real cowboy delivering
horses to Howard Hughes, then went from stuntman to movie cowboy.
He and Paxton met in the '80s, got reacquainted on the set of
``Evening Star,'' Johnson's last film. ``We filmed `Twister' about
15 miles from his hometown _ Pawhuska, an Indian name _ in
Oklahoma. He told me stories of twisters there, told me about John
Ford and John Wayne. Now here I was, filming `Mighty Joe Young,'
playing the part he played in 1949. I play this guy from an animal
conservancy who tries to persuade Charlize Theron, this
primatologist, that the big gorilla's best chance of survival lies
in being taken back to the conservancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe's about as big as a live oak tree or a dump truck. He's
kind of a miniature King Kong. It really is a Beauty and the Beast
story. She's this beautiful siren who's soothed the savage beast,
and there's this love triangle that sort of forms. I'm trying to
work my way in, but she's so concerned about Joe, I can't get her
to notice me. Every time I turn around, I've got Joe staring at me,
which is a nice fun dynamic. Rick Baker, a famous guy, did an
animatronic. For the most part, we just had to pretend Joe was
there. That was an RKO picture, and Howard Hughes owned RKO and we
filmed part of it in the huge aircraft plant where he built his
famous Spruce Goose that only flew once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry Moore, who was in the original, and Ray Harryhausen, who
built the original Joe, are in this film, playing cameos in the
nightclub scene where Joe goes on a rampage. Terry told me Howard
Hughes gave her flying lessons in the parking lot. I told Ron
Underwood, the director, that we had to get Ben in for karmic
reasons, if for nothing else. So in one scene, if you look fast,
you'll see in a kiosk window a poster for `Wagon Master,' one of
Ben's films. First doing this brother movie with my father, then
reprising Ben Johnson's role in this other film has been a
wonderful twister of fate.''

ROCK 'N' GREED 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rolling Stones once sang ``Street Fighting Man,'' a
signature song recalling their scruffy, working-class days. That
was a long time ago, for the Stones are now fighting another fight
by pushing rock 'n' roll ticket prices to stratospheric levels. The
Stones are charging up to $300 a ticket for their upcoming arena
tour _ a gesture that has made them the new poster boys for a
runaway greed that is infecting the music industry and changing its
very fabric.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Stones are still street-fighting men,'' says Michael Cohl,
the Toronto promoter who is booking the band's 20-city tour. ``I
would think that street-fighting men would still charge the
wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but are they giving back to the poor? The answer is no, not
on this tour, Cohl admits, though he says the Stones do
occasionially contribute to charities in a ``private manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stones actually played a single Atlantic City show 10 years
ago for a $300 ticket. ``Another way to look at it,'' says the
brash Cohl, ``is that how come 10 years later we haven't raised
ticket prices?''
</P>
<P>
   Such spin control is becoming common in a music industry where
the rich are getting richer through fat contracts, compounded by a
self-indulgence that causes them to drop many filler-type products
on the public. These range from endless live albums (the Stones
just released their seventh) and greatest-hits packages to
outtake-filled boxed sets that clog the media's attention and
squeeze out new bands.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an incredible sense of entitlement right now,'' says
Tim White, editor of Billboard magazine. Consumers ``are being
driven to the superstar acts to the exclusion of other things. The
marketing dollars are not going to the baby acts. They're going to
the superstar who is on a major tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the business needs to realize this and needs to stop
being so greedy,'' adds White. ``We've come to a crossroads in
terms of fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stones tour has been called the ``Millionaires Watching
Millionaires'' tour by Variety magazine, which estimates the Stones
could get $30 million from their 20-city jaunt. And that follows
$150 million from their last stadium tour, which carried a $65
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   At Boston's FleetCenter, a $300 price applies to 3,000 seats
sold for each show to suite holders and other premium seat holders
(prices for the general public are $150, $90, and $50, with a token
400 seats priced at $39.50, says a box-office source). The $300
seats will account for a $900,000 gross all by themselves _ and
even more when you realize that 500 of those are going for $650,
which covers a pre- and post-concert party (beware: the Stones
haven't actually agreed to attend), parking, and some kind of tour
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's also a $20 service charge, so anyone with a $300
ticket is actually paying $320 a ticket,'' says Dennis Arfa, an
agent with New York-based QBQ Entertainment, which represents Billy
Joel, Metallica, Luther Vandross, and Motley Crue.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that unprecedented service charge will go to the Stones,
says Arfa. ``They're going to walk away with the same (financial
grosses) as when they played stadiums,'' he adds. ``It's greed, but
the Rolling Stones can get away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Stones and some other acts from the '60s and '70s used to
do drugs, but now they're doing money,'' says Tim Collins, the
former Aerosmith manager who now teaches at Berklee College of
Music. Collins is refusing to see the Stones, though he was offered
a free ticket. ``It's out of control and it takes the soul right
out of it,'' he says of the pricing. ``It makes it only for the
wealthy. How can kids go to see this? It's alienating kids from the
whole concept of rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many acts have a fear that they're going to be gone soon,''
Collins says, explaining the cash-in mentality that now often
prevails. ``They're worried about all the consolidations and
mergers in the industry, and what that might do to them. It's just
money driving it now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been greed in this business _ and nothing
surprises me about it,'' says Billy Joel. ``I just feel bad for the
people who love music. I think in a way that all of this is causing
people to turn away from rock 'n' roll and popular music in droves.
I know I have. I'm just tired of being demographed and marketed to,
and spoon-fed and ripped off.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel, along with Pearl Jam and Garth Brooks, is among a
vanishing breed of superstar acts that keeps ticket prices down.
Joel's top ticket at the Fleet is $39.50, while Pearl Jam's last
tour had a top of $24, and Brooks's last stop at the FleetCenter
had a top ticket of just $17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to keep the ticket price under $40,'' says Joel,
``because now a lot of these buildings have a building surcharge on
the ticket. And this is on top of the rent that the artist is
paying in the first place. So then you get that added to the
ticket. And then there's the ticket agencies. And there's scalpers
and whatever they want to charge. And then there's the parking
fees. I mean, by the time some poor guy gets into the arena, he's
been hit 50 ways from Sunday. And who else is going to look after
the audience except for the artist? The building doesn't care. The
managers don't care. The booking agents don't care. The promoters
don't care. The scalpers and the ticket agencies don't care. It's
the artist. That's his bread and butter. If he doesn't look after
them, then who will?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The scalper defense
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A frequent defense of escalating ticket prices _ you've heard it
ever since the Eagles charged $100 four years ago, which really
broke the ice in this regard _ is that scalpers are going to get
these prices anyway, so why shouldn't the acts get the extra
dollars instead?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but two wrongs don't make a right,'' says Joel. ``Who
would you rather get ripped off by _ the scalpers or us? That's
just too much money. And you know what? Maybe (the Stones) are
worth it to enough people who want to pay that much money, but
that's not what the essence of rock 'n' roll is about. It seems
like you're cashing in your chips there, guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's another reason that I keep my ticket price under
$40,'' Joel says. ``It's so younger people can afford to get in.
The scalpers actually changed the nature of the show by disallowing
people under a certain age to be able to afford to buy tickets.
That dictates that the audience will be older; and I'm sorry, but
an older audience is just not as enthusiastic as a younger
audience. It's just a matter of physical energy. I used to look
down in the old days and see all of these fat cats in the good
seats, and we got around that by not putting them on sale. We'd
send the roadies to the back of the room and give those kids the
front-row seats.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stones' camp, however, rationalizes that Barbra Streisand
charged up to $350 a ticket at Madison Square Garden a few years
ago. Why shouldn't they follow suit? ``And she didn't average $75
for the other tickets, which is what we're averaging,'' says Cohl.

   !!! ``Hard Core Logo'' This mockumentary about a
self-destructive punk band reunited for an ill-fated tour will
likely draw comparisons to ``This Is Spinal Tap,'' but it's a far
different film. While there are laughs, it's a much more poignant
look at four band members trying to hold onto their unruly youth,
even as they edge toward middle age. (Unrated) (Renee Graham)

! 1/2 ``Shattered Image'' Parallel-lives Hollywood gothic,
involving William Baldwin's obvious schemer and Anne Parillaud in
her ``Femme Nikita'' mode as a Seattle hit woman and,
alternatively, as a honeymooner in Jamaica menaced by ominous
portents. Which is real? You won't care. Filmmaker Raul Ruiz's
surrealist touch seems to have deserted him here, which is
understandable, given Duane Poole's pedestrian script. (Unrated)

STAYING SANE AT CHRISTMAS IS NOT SO SIMPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps you haven't noticed because you've been busy having your
annual pre-holiday walking nervous breakdown, but there's a move
afoot to simplify the holidays, to pare down the preparations, cut
spending to a minimum, reduce the whole shebang to its essentials.
</P>
<P>
   There are several books on the subject of seasonal
simplification, among them Elaine St. James's ``Simplify Your
Christmas,'' and Bill McKibbem's ``Hundred Dollar Holiday.'' What
does it say about us, as a people, that the notion of simplifying
Christmas is so complicated that we need to buy a book, or two, to
tell us how to go about it? That we're nuts? Well, we may be,
especially at this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   St. James is the queen of the simplicity movement. She's written
a couple of hot-sellers on the how-to-simplify theme, ``Simplify
Your Life,'' and ``Living the Simple Life,'' plus a title that must
be a foray into fiction: ``Simplify Your Life With Kids.'' The
proceeds have enabled St. James to live as simply as she likes, in
Santa Barbara, Calif., where the living is simple but far from
inexpensive.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not knocking St. James. She has some good ideas. And she
makes it all sound so . . . simple. One of the first things to do,
she advises, is tell family and friends you won't be giving gifts,
entertaining, sending cards, etc. ``You might be surprised at the
responses,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I wouldn't be at all surprised at the responses.
But, says St. James, you can't allow the expectations of others to
dissuade you from pursuing simplicity. ``Remember,'' she writes,
``the first year will most likely be the hardest. After that the
delight of celebrating a simpler, happier Christmas will quickly
minimize the guilt other family members try to lay on you. Then
you'll simply rise above it.'' Rise above family-induced guilt?
That truly would be a Christmas miracle for some of us.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want not just to rise above but to transcend the
commercialization of Christmas may find inspiration in McKibben's
``Hundred Dollar Holiday.'' McKibben, a former staff writer for the
New Yorker, lives in the Adirondack Mountains of New York, where
he's active in the Methodist church. A few years ago he and some
fellow church members decided to make Christmas more fulfilling by
limiting the amount of money each family would spend on the holiday
to $100. The result was a more joyous, family-centered, spiritually
meaningful holiday, ``a time of calm and happiness, a season to
linger in and not `get through.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It goes without saying there will be no Furby under the McKibben
tree this Christmas morning. There will be a tree, though. The day
before Christams the whole family trudges out in snowshoes into the
mountains to choose and cut the perfect tree. There will be
homemade gifts and goodies galore, candelit suppers, carol singing,
a midnight service at church. It all sounds idyllic, like some sort
of Christmas fantasy, which is what it must remain, for most of us.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you have to reach the point at which you're so fed up with
holiday excess that you're willing to go cold turkey, like the
Chicago woman who describes in St. James's book how she and her
husband cut back on Christmas. They figured they spent $2,500 each
year on the holiday, money they couldn't afford to squander. So one
year they decided to do nothing. No cards, no gifts, no
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Day they visited a relative's house: ``The moment
of truth came when we saw the pile of gifts addressed to us. `We
didn't bring gifts. Remember, we're simplifying this year,' I
announced cheerfully. To my delight, my brother-in-law piped up and
said, `That's what we all should do.' We spent the next half hour
discussing ways to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's one of those heartwarming, inspirational holiday stories
that would make me go warm all over, if I had the time. But I'm due
at the mall.

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When 85-year-old Josephine Amenta tumbled from a stepstool at
her daughter's home last Oct. 12, a vertebra in her aged and
weakened spine collapsed on itself like a bony pancake.
</P>
<P>
   The painful ``crush'' fracture ``was like a toothache that aches
and aches,'' said Amenta, a stoic Peabody woman who likes to rake
leaves, sweep and ``keep the place nice.'' Medication didn't help.
Even a skin patch constantly releasing strong drugs couldn't blank
out the pain:
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't walk and I couldn't sleep,'' she recounted
recently.
</P>
<P>
   The standard treatment for such injuries is bed rest,
painkillers and a back brace, but it can take weeks for the pain to
subside. But at the Lahey Clinic in Burlington, Mass., amenta was
offered a relatively new nonsurgical procedure that has been
gaining popularity, though not universal acceptance, in which
radiologists inject a quick-drying bone cement inside the vertebra,
calming the hurting nerves and beefing up the bone.
</P>
<P>
   The next day she was sitting up and even walking a bit, and the
pain had all but vanished, said Amenta. By last week, she said, she
was ``almost back the way I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Enthusiasts say the procedure, called vertebroplasty, can
dramatically speed recovery from crush, or compression fractures,
as they're also known, which are common in women with bone-thinning
osteoporosis. By one estimate, osteoporosis causes 700,000
vertebral fractures every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you pick the right people, the results are awesome,'' said
Dr. Joshua Hirsch, an interventional neuroradiologist at Lahey who
has done vertebroplasty on seven patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're fixing a fracture from the inside, like putting a cast
on the arm,'' but in this case, strengthening the vertebra from
inside, said Dr. Mary E. Jensen. She is a radiologist at the
University of Virginia Health Sciences Center, whose team has the
largest US experience with it.
</P>
<P>
   The best candidates for the procedure, say Hirsch and Jensen,
include:
</P>
<P>
   --Older people whose bones have been weakened by osteoporosis
and either suffer compression fractures in a fall or in whom a
vertebra sometimes simply gives way under their own weight. Jensen
says at present it should be done only on patients for whom
conventional therapy hasn't worked. But she's about to begin a
study using vertebroplasty as a primary treatment right after a
fracture has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   --Transplant patients and others taking large doses of steroid
drugs, which can lead to weakened and crushed vertebrae.
</P>
<P>
   --Patients with primary or metastasized cancer in the spine.
</P>
<P>
   When it's successful, vertebroplasty can reduce the need for
strong painkillers that can have unwanted side effects,
particularly in older people. However, it can't correct the spinal
curvature or shortened stature that osteoporosis can cause, Jensen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-year-old Santa Floridia of Quincy, Mass. suffered a
compression fracture in early October when she fell while climbing
into a van. Her daughter, Connie McGillicuddy, said the pain ``was
just unbelievable, and the pain medication made her kind of out of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Floridia had been bedridden eight weeks when McGillicuddy heard
about the procedure and contacted Hirsch at the Lahey. The next day
_ during Thanksgiving week _ Floridia underwent vertebroplasty, and
that same day ``stood up and had no pain,'' said McGillicuddy.
</P>
<P>
   Floridia is getting physical therapy to strengthen her legs
after so much bed rest, but her daughter said the vertebroplasty
``was wonderful for her.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of injecting bone cement into crushed vertebrae
originated with French doctors in the 1980s, but didn't catch on in
the United States until it was described at a 1993 neuroradiology
meeting, said Jensen, who heads the UVA interventional
neuroradiology section. Interventional neuroradiologists use
techniques and devices similar to those for diagnosing nerve
problems to carry out certain procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial element is to have state-of-the-art imaging machines
to enable the doctors to guide the needles to precisely the right
spot, said Jensen.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia specialists began doing vertebroplasties in 1994
and to date have treated more than 200 vertebrae (sometimes more
than one in a patient), according to Jensen. The interest is so
keen, she said, that ``I've trained 60 people in the last year and
there's a big waiting list'' of radiologists from across the
country wanting to learn the technique.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Lahey Clinic appears to be the only center in the
Boston area performing vertebroplasty.
</P>
<P>
   But some specialists, including an orthopedic surgeon at the New
England Baptist Hospital, say they're not convinced that the
procedure will have a large role.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Banco said most patients with vertebral compression
fractures ``do quite well'' with the standard treatment, though he
agreed that some need hospitalization and aggressive pain
management in the first couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Severe fractures aren't amenable to vertebroplasty, he added. In
some of those cases, it's necessary to perform a complicated spinal
fusion.
</P>
<P>
   While vertebroplasty ``is a good procedure,'' said Banco, it
``is basically to get rid of pain for mild and moderate compression
fractures. Who is the right patient to have this thing done? There
may not be many of them out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch said vertebropolasty takes about two hours to perform.
</P>
<P>
   The patient, who must be able to lie prone for up to three
hours, is given a sedating drug and a local anesthetic. The
radiologist then makes a small X-shaped incision over the bony
protrusion of the damaged vertebra, and, while watching
continuously on a fluoroscope (an X-ray machine that shows moving
images) and a CT scanner, inserts the needle into the center of the
vertebra.
</P>
<P>
   A larger needle, with a bore about the size of a ballpoint pen
tip, is slipped over the needle that's already in the vertebra, and
the smaller one is withdrawn. The large needle is the conduit into
the bone _ first for an injection of dye, then the bone cement. As
the dye flows out of the needle and spreads through the crushed
interior of the vertebra, ``you make a road map for yourself'' that
shows where the cement will end up, said Hirsch.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, technicians mix up the cement, called
polymethylmethacrylate or PMMA. It is is routinely used for bone
repairs, including to glue artificial hip joints in place. PMMA
powder and a solvent are combined, along with a powder that makes
the cement visible in an X-ray.
</P>
<P>
   There is no time to waste: The cement hardens in 10 minutes. The
radiologist injects the mixture through the needle and it spreads
throughout the fractured vertebra.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest risk is that the cement will ooze into the wrong
places and compress the spinal cord or a nerve root. If that
happens, emergency surgery is necessary to relieve the pressure,
said Jensen, but it is rare. She quotes a complication rate of
under 1 percent for vertebroplasty.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, she said, the cement gets into a blood vessel and
goes to the lung, but she's never seen that cause a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The CT and X-ray machines show whether the cement is correctly
placed. If so, the patient simply lies prone long enough for the
cement to set. Many patients go home the same day, some stay
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   While many patients get immediate pain relief, the procedure
isn't guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 101 fractures in 84 patients treated at the
University of Virginia, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, and
Tampa General Hospital in Florida, Jensen said, there were
statistically significant improvements in activity and in reducing
medication. The only failures were in 12 fractures (not 12
patients) in which there was no response, and three that reported
worsening pain.
</P>
<P>
   Before treatment, only 3 percent of the patients said they could
do everything they wanted, compared to 35 percent after treatment,
said Jensen. And 50 percent of patients improved two or more steps
on a pain scale after treatment, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ordinarily, I'm a skeptic,'' said Jensen. ``But I'm a believer
in this.''

LITTLE HEED PAID TO WOMEN'S SEXUAL PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISA VALDES-RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Bonnie Myers, 41, Viagra is the miracle drug that rescued
her libido. No, her husband Russell doesn't swallow the blue pills.
Bonnie does. And for the first time in 10 years, the Maryland
day-care worker is having orgasms.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary studies, including one at Boston University, show
Viagra can affect sexual response in women much the same way it
affects men. Spurred by requests from women for the drug,
scientists said they have come up with a Viagra-like topical gel
for women.
</P>
<P>
   While these efforts represent a beginning in addressing female
sexual dysfunction, they are just that, and no product is likely to
get FDA approval before 2002. Even though drug companies and
medical device makers have worked for years to devise ways to treat
male impotence, female sexual dysfunction is only now being seen as
a medical and not just emotional problem.
</P>
<P>
   It is emblematic of medicine's neglect of female sexual
dysfunction that an October conference on the subject that the
Boston University School of Medicine sponsored was the first of its
kind ever.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Irwin Goldstein, the Boston University urology professor who
led development of the gel, said that women's sexual dysfuntion is
``an immature field. A naive field. Not because women don't have
these problems, but because medicine has not addressed their
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not until the October meeting that the medical community
even reached consensus on what female sexual dysfunction is. Now
there are several new classifications, including one called sexual
arousal disorder, caused by hysterectomy, menopause, and vascular
disorders like diabetes; this is the condition apparently aided by
Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists in women's health, sexuality, and history say the
ignorance of female sexual dysfunction stems from a long history of
fear, denial, and misunderstanding of women's sexuality and
anatomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our understanding of female sexual anatomy and physiology has
really lagged behind that of the male,'' said Dr. Jennifer Berman,
a urologist at BU Medical Center. Berman and her sister Laura, a
sex therapist, teach at BU and are leading one of the first studies
of women and Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Said Jennifer Berman, ``There has been very little support for
research from universities and foundations. The reason is probably
multifaceted, but stems from social taboos about women's sexuality,
and the myth that female sexual dysfunction is an emotional issue
rather than a physical problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though women also become ``erect'' when sexually aroused,
that fact is less known, even by women themselves, according to
Carol Queen, a San Francisco author who has written about culture
and sex and has taken Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women's sexuality is less culturally important,'' Queen said.
``A woman can have sex and procreate without being turned on. She
might not like it, but it's possible. Male sexual arousal, on the
other hand, is quite obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   Queen pointed out that the majority of men getting Viagra
prescriptions do it not to reproduce, but rather ``to have a good
time.'' Queen doubted HMOs would be as willing to pay for
``pleasure drugs'' for women, and said their reluctance to cover
birth control medication demonstrated her point.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA took six months to approve Viagra for men. But a lack of
basic sexual dysfunction research in women means the FDA will not
be in a position to begin considering Viagra for women until 2001
or 2002, say Goldstein and the Bermans.
</P>
<P>
   Once Viagra for men was approved by the FDA, many insurance
companies sped through the approval process to pay for it. Tufts
Health Plan, for instance, took only one month to decide to cover
Viagra for men, citing demand as the reason. The usual drug
approval time for the HMO is three to six months.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokeswoman for the HMO said it would likely take longer
to approve coverage for women, because of the lack of documented
research.
</P>
<P>
   The basic problem, the Bermans and others said, is that so
little work has been done on the physiology of female sexual
response and orgasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most research on women's sexual dysfunction has been done in
the field of psychology,'' Jennifer Berman said. ``The thought of
having women stimulate themselves in a clinical setting has been
very disturbing to people when we've applied for grants.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason such a prospect is disquieting to people is a
cultural tradition of desexualizing women, according to Mary Daly,
a feminist author and assistant professor of theology at Boston
College.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein dismissed this view as ``a bunch of feminists making
statements,'' saying most research in sexuality was done on women
in the 1960s and 1970s. The focus shifted to male sexuality, he
said, only with the advent of the penile implant.
</P>
<P>
   But Jennifer and Laura Berman agreed with Daly, saying modern
attitudes about women's sexuality date from the Victorian era.
</P>
<P>
   The Bermans, Queen, and Daly said that when the topic of Viagra
for women has been discussed by the media, Victorian notions of
women's sexuality have surfaced with an obvious taboo surrounding
the clitoris.
</P>
<P>
   The clitoris, the external organ responsible for female orgasm,
contains the same number of nerve endings as the penis and also
becomes erect with arousal. In utero, the penis and clitoris form
from the same tissue.
</P>
<P>
   The Bermans have found in their research that Viagra makes
orgasm easier for women by increasing blood flow to the pelvic
area, as it does in men, and specifically by causing the clitoris
to become erect, as well as by causing other reactions.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bermans say they have been forbidden to use the word in
many television interviews, including recent ones with network
anchors Dan Rather and Peter Jennings. They say they are annoyed
that many print articles dance around the scientific facts by using
vague descriptions of women's sexual response, while specifics
about the penis seem to be fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating and difficult to speak about a medical topic
without being able to speak clinically and anatomically,'' said
Jennifer Berman.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a long history of the clitoris being despised,'' Daly
said, noting that forced removal of the organ is common practice in
much of Africa and the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 130 million women alive today have experienced the
removal of their clitoris in a procedure its proponents liken to
circumcision, but its critics say is more analogous to castration.
</P>
<P>
   Daly said, ``What not many people know is that an English
gynecologist named Isaac Baker Brown invented the clitoridectomy in
1858, as a cure for female masturbation.'' The procedure was common
in the United States and England until the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're up against centuries of misinformation,'' said Jennifer
Berman, adding that the open discussion of women's sexuality is
``the final frontier feminism has yet to cross.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's what's really exciting about the hype around
Viagra,'' she said. ``It's opening up lines of communication. If
nothing else, we're talking about it now.''

TIME IS DEFINITELY ON 26-YEAR-OLD'S SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 26. My wife and I rent an apartment and don't foresee a
house purchase in the next four years. We would like to get serious
about retirement planning, our goal being to retire with $1.5
million in 35 years. We also want to save a healthy down payment
for a home, $70,000 to $90,000, four years from now. I don't have a
401(k) program through my employer, but my wife will have access to
one in January. Her company will match up to 5 percent of her base
salary, which would represent $1,850 a year. Right now we have
$13,000 in savings. After all of our expenses, including leisure
money, we are left with $1,400 a month. This amount has been
increasing, and should continue to increase, at a rate of $300
annually. What's the best way to reach our goals?
</P>
<P>
   S.C., Woburn, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Your goals should be easy to achieve _ probably too easy. A
$1.5 million retirement pool looks pretty big today, but it's not
likely to seem as grand in 35 years. If inflation averages 4
percent during that period, it would have the buying power of
$380,123 in today's money; even if inflation were only 3 percent,
it would still be worth but $533,075 in 1998 bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as you'll see, this isn't something that should daunt
you.
</P>
<P>
   First, you and your wife will want to grab that free $1,850 a
year her employer offers beginning in January. To provide the funds
to achieve that 401(k) match, she will have to commit $155 a month
of your free money.
</P>
<P>
   But with such a long investment period, she will have begun a
significant savings program. If she and her employer were to
continue to each contribute $1,850 a year for 35 years (presuming
monthly contributions and 10 percent average returns) the pool
would grow to $1,048,776.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't leave you needing a great deal more to get to $1.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Going back to the real estate savings, let's put your $13,000
savings in this pool. After your wife's $155 monthly 401(k)
contributions, you would have $1,145 free. If you were to add
$1,045 of this to your savings each month, the sum would reach
$26,477 after a year.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, when you'll have another $300 monthly available,
let's add another $250 to the real estate savings pool, bringing
contributions up to $1,295. If you continue that pattern, the total
pool should be roughly $90,123 after four years. This presumes that
you use a mutual fund money market account and achieve average 5
percent returns.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened to the $100 extra, and the $50 in additional
savings you would achieve in each of those four years? I set this
aside as the beginning of your own retirement savings. You're
probably eligible for a Roth IRA, and I suggest you use this
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   If you were to begin Roth IRA accumulations at a rate of $100 a
month, increasing the contribution by $50 a year annually, you
would amass $9,846 over four years. Not a huge amount, but consider
this: To fill the gap between the $1.5 million target and the
$1,048,776 from your wife's 401(k) plan, you would need to
contribute but $115 a month over the next 31 years.
</P>
<P>
   OK, now the scary part. Let's assume that what you really want
in 35 years is the equivalent of $1.5 million in today's dollars. I
ran this calculation at 3.5 percent presumed inflation, and the
number came out to a horrifying $5,000,385.
</P>
<P>
   But time is on your side. Remember, after you buy your home in
four years you will have $2,145 of ``free'' money in your monthly
budget. So how much of that $2,145 would you have to save to build
that $9,846 retirement account to $3,451,609? Only $1,428 per
month, presuming you achieve average 10 percent returns from the
retirement portfolio.

60 STARS IN THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `How many stars do you think there will be in the American flag
25 years from now?'' asks Juan Enriquez, a researcher at the David
Rockefeller Center at Harvard University. ``A case can be made that
there will be 60, perhaps more.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of his adult life, Enriquez has immersed himself
in the study of borders. He is currently writing a book on the
subject. The first draft, three-quarters complete, is spell-binding
and authoritative. His data do not lie. Globalization and
technology are changing the world's boundaries in ways that would
have seemed unimaginable 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   What was once the Soviet Union is now a collection of nation
states. The borders of what was once Czechoslovakia no longer
exist. The creation of the European Union makes possible the
emergence of independent states in Wales, Scotland, and the Basque
region of Spain. In the far East, everyone wonders what nations
will emerge after the inevitable collapse of the People's Republic
of China.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, Mexico is a nation of contradictions, capable of
splitting into three distinct parts. Its northern third is already
part of the fabric of south Texas. Puerto Rico will soon cast a
definitive vote for or against US statehood. The future of Cuba
awaits the end of Fidel. It is thought by most Americans that after
Castro departs the stage, Cuban Miami will move back to Havana. The
more likely scenario is that Cuban Havana will move to Miami. In
Florida and New Jersey, Cuban constituencies will lobby hard for
``the big island's'' inclusion into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   To the north, Monday's provincial elections left unanswered the
question of an independent Quebec. As Steven Pearlstein reported in
The Washington Post, ``Quebec separatists had looked on (these)
elections as the springboard for the final push toward independence
from Canada. Canadian federalists had sent in what they thought was
their best man to finally rout the separatists from power.
</P>
<P>
   ``About the only thing they agreed on was that neither side won.
(P)oliticians and pundits . . . saw in the final election tallies a
mandate from voters to let the question of Quebecs independence
simmer on the back burner for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   But for how long? English-speaking Canada is, in Pearlstein's
phrase, ``tiring of the seemingly endless dance with Quebec.'' A
top strategist for the separatists agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a bad marriage where one spouse wants to leave,''
Parti Quebecois adviser Jean-Francois Lisee opined in advance of
Monday's vote. ``Obviously we need to arrange joint custody of the
kids which in this case is the dollar, the national debt, certain
assets. But it's over. The truth is we will be better as courteous
neighbors than quarreling spouses.''
</P>
<P>
   Enriquez thinks it possible that English-speaking Canada could
separate from Quebec before Quebec separates from it. He notes that
the Northeastern governors of the United States have actively
engaged the Maritime provincial governments on trade, agriculture,
energy, and immigration issues.
</P>
<P>
   What prevents them from confederating with the United States,
first as protectorates, then as territories and finally as states?
For that matter, what prevents the western provinces of Canada from
confederating with the United States in like fashion? Culturally,
they are closer to the western United States than they are to
Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   How many stars will there be on the American flag in 25 years?
In 1776, there were 13. In 1876, there were 36. In 1976, there were
50, including the addition of Alaska and Hawaii in the 1950s.
America is unique among nations in this respect; it is the only one
that has grown steadily over the last 200 years.
</P>
<P>
   Before he got caught lying, President Clinton attempted to open
a dialogue on the subject of race as a means to discussing the
larger issue of national identity, borders, and ``immigration
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   America suffers from periodic outbreaks of xenophobia. We are in
the froth of such an outbreak now. The Immigration and
Naturalization Service employs more people than the FBI, more
people than the State Department, thanks to recent legislation. Pat
Buchanan and Ross Perot roil the waters with nativist appeals.
``Protecting our borders'' is proffered as political argument.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not how we ``control'' our borders. The issue is
how we erase them; how we add stars to the flag. The infrastructure
is there. Modern telecommunications obviates many boundaries. Free
trade agreements integrate territories. Economic growth eases
racial and ethnic tensions. Freedom begets possibility, which
begets hope.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration policy, as it is currently discussed, is largely
irrelevant. Integrating new states is the real issue. How we do
that will define the future of the United States.

SEND INDEPENDENT PROSECUTORS BACK WHERE THEY CAME FROM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; While Kenneth Starr's four-year inquisition against President
Clinton and his friends is enough to warrant outright elimination
of the independent counsel law, the case of former Agriculture
Secretary Mike Espy is even more compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Espy's acquittal last week provides more evidence that the
independent counsel law is out of control and wreaking havoc not
only in Washington but also across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Any law that allows an independent counsel to spend four years
and $20 million on an investigation of a cabinet official based on
questionable, if not petty, charges is a law that is ill-conceived
and as dangerous as the Spanish Inquisition. Fortunately, that is
the way the jury saw the case against Espy.
</P>
<P>
   His acquittal further erodes the already waning strength of
Starr's and the GOP's case for impeachment against Clinton. The
charges against the president in the Monica Lewinsky probe appear
to be far less serious than the charges of conflicts of interest _
including accepting gifts from companies that his cabinet oversees
_ that were brought against Espy.
</P>
<P>
   Further evidence of how out of control the independent counsel
effort has become can be seen in the cases against other former and
current members of Clinton's cabinet. The list includes Labor
Secretary Alexis Herman, former Housing and Urban Development
Secretary Henry Cisneros and, before his death, Commerce Secretary
Ron Brown.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the independent counsel law even more chilling is the
way it has been used _ perhaps disproportionately _ against the few
people of color who have been able to rise to a level of power in
this administration. In addition to Espy, Herman, and Brown _ all
African-American _ and Cisneros, who is Hispanic, a case that
involved an African-American from the Reagan administration, former
HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce, is still open, even though Pierce
himself has been dropped from the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who support the independent counsel law, and how
Starr used it to go after Clinton, can argue that it was a Clinton
appointee, Attorney General Janet Reno, who appointed seven
independent counsels, or prosecutors, during her tenure. Thus far,
some 20 independent prosecutors have been appointed, at a cost of
more than $140 million, since the law was enacted in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who also has turned down several requests for independent
counsels, has incurred the wrath of both Democrats and Republicans
for her decisions. Democrats, for example, have been furious over
Reno's appointment of independent counsels to investigate Clinton
cabinet officials, while Republicans were infuriated with her
decision not to appoint an independent counsel to investigate Vice
President Al Gore's campaign fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps feeling pressure from both sides, Reno requested and was
granted a 60-day extension of her deadline for deciding whether to
appoint an outside prosecutor to investigate former White House
deputy chief of staff Harold M. Ickes's dealings with the Teamsters
Union.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno is not the problem. In an apparent effort to maintain
her own integrity and credibility on the job, she has used the only
law available to her that provides for an outside and independent
counsel. But Reno, the presidency, and the nation itself would have
been far better off if there were no such law.
</P>
<P>
   Since its beginning in the Watergate years, the law has served
no useful purpose; it has not enhanced, nor even maintained, the
nation's system of justice nor the integrity of the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   In the wrong hands, such as Starr's, it can be used as a
political weapon aimed at removing a president the opposing party
could not defeat at the polls. If anything, the law has hindered,
if not diminished, the nation's ability to maintain a judicial
system that is fair to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the creation of an independent counsel law seemed to be
the right thing to do during the era of Watergate, when the crime
in question could do far more damage to the foundation of American
justice than the current ``sexgate'' scandal.
</P>
<P>
   But as impartial as the work of independent counsel Archibald
Cox was before President Nixon resigned, it is easy to see what
happens when the same law is in the hands of an unrestrained
partisan on behalf of conservative Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has aptly demonstrated that the law, with its unlimited
time and resources, goes too far and must be reined in. Perhaps
after this impeachment inquiry is finally over, Congress will take
the time to review the independent counsel law and decide that
simply imposing limitations on it may not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   In the wrong hands, a weapon that can fire bullets, whether
legal or lead, can be just as damaging at 50 yards as 100 yards The
prudent choice would be to eliminate this law before it destroys
our system of justice, and ultimately, our nation.

SWISS BANKS PAID UP _ NOW WHAT HAPPENS TO THE MONEY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a headline to gladden the heart of an anti-Semite. Sunday
New York Times, Page 1: ``Jewish Groups Fight for Spoils of Swiss
Case.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course the $1.45 billion paid by Swiss banks to settle
Holocaust-related claims is not ``spoils'' but restitution for
stolen assets. And of course if Jewish groups had not brought the
lawsuits and raised the stink that shamed Switzerland into
admitting its financial semi-collaboration with the Nazis, nobody
would have. But what do the bigots care about that? All they will
see _ and it is a sight they will relish _ is a lot of Jews
quarreling over money.
</P>
<P>
   This litigation began as something fine: an effort to win
justice for Jews who had been victimized, with Swiss cooperation,
during the Nazi years.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland was neutral during World War II, but in several ways
it colluded in the Third Reich's thievery and persecution. Gold,
art, and real estate looted by the Nazis were safeguarded in Swiss
bank accounts. Tens of thousands of Jewish refugees were sent back
to Germany. At Switzerland's request, the passports of German Jews
were stamped with a ``J'' _ to keep them from fleeing to safety in
Switzerland. When the war ended, Swiss bankers slammed the door on
Jewish survivors trying to reclaim deposits left by their murdered
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   For 50 years the Swiss stonewalled, refusing to acknowledge the
stolen Jewish property. Only now, under a barrage of lawsuits, bad
publicity, and the threat of sanctions, have they agreed to make
restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, returning from eight days of discussions in
Switzerland, I wrote, ``Switzerland's moral failings during the
Hitler years require compensation, but it would be dreadful if the
whole issue came down to a question of dollars and cents . . . . A
pot of money should not be the goal.'' But now a pot of money is on
the table, and the fight over how to divide it has turned vulgar.
</P>
<P>
   The World Jewish Congress, which first focused attention on the
Swiss banks' behavior, insists on a central role in parceling out
the settlement. Two warring camps of lawyers representing Jewish
heirs and survivors _ one led by Edward Fagan, the other by Michael
Hausfeld _ claim that they deserve the lead role. Then there are
the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany and the
World Jewish Restitution Organization. Both have previously been
involved in allocating money to Holocaust victims; both would like
to be involved in disbursing the big Swiss settlement fund.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these parties are now bad-mouthing the others. Fagan
calls the World Jewish Congress ``pigs'' and accuses the Hausfeld
lawyers of scheming to steal his clients. One of Hausfeld's
consultants berates Fagan for profiteering off survivors and
treating them like ``chattel.'' The Claims Conference is denounced
as so incompetent that applicants have died while waiting to
receive financial aid. The World Jewish Congress snorts that the
lawyers had nothing to do with winning the case, and rejects using
any of the funds for legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   If this is how the parties speak for the record, imagine what
they say in private.
</P>
<P>
   Now, lawyers and organizations everywhere squabble over money.
But when they are Jewish lawyers and Jewish organizations, they
feed an ugly anti-Semitic stereotype. The demand for restitution
from the Swiss was intended to reclaim a measure of dignity for
survivors of the most horrific crime of the 20th century. But there
is no dignity in a ``fight for spoils'' on the front page of The
New York Times. If it is going to end like this, it would have been
better to let the Swiss keep the money.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous ideas are being floated for the more than $1 billion
that will be left after those with provable claims against the
Swiss banks are reimbursed. Some want it distributed to Holocaust
survivors. Others suggest a fund for only the neediest survivors.
Still others propose using the money on education, or for Holocaust
research.
</P>
<P>
   I propose an entirely different idea, one that emerged in a
conversation with Dennis Prager, an Los Angeles broadcaster
renowned for his writings on ethics and Judaism: Once the cheated
depositors have been paid, let the Jewish people relinquish any
claim to the balance of the money. Let it be used instead to help
human beings whose lives have been shattered by genocide and ethnic
slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than earmarking the money for Jewish causes, spend it to
heal the still-suffering survivors of the Rwandan massacre. Or the
deeply scarred victims of the Cambodian holocaust. Or the Bosnian
women brutalized in Serbia's rape camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Jews wanted to awaken the world to what the Swiss did,''
Prager says. ``We don't want to profit by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly. The litigants who prevailed against the Swiss banks
have it in their power to show that the Jewish nation cares far
less for money than it does for truth and justice. They can halt
the arguing, give the money away. It would be an act of tremendous
moral beauty. And it would teach the world a powerful lesson in
compassion.

</P>
<P>
   Come to Germany in December, and you'd think this was the place
that invented Christmas. And in some ways, you'd be right.
</P>
<P>
   After all, didn't the Christmas tree arise from the medieval
German custom of draping evergreen branches in the home with
sausages and apples? And doesn't our image of Santa Claus stem
largely from the pen of Thomas Nast, the 19th-century political
cartoonist who was born in Landau, Germany?
</P>
<P>
   One of Germany's most endearing Christmas customs remains the
Christmas Market, outdoor fairs where ornaments, toys and
gingerbread burden stalls, and the bracing perfume of sizzling
sausages and mulled wine laces the cold air.
</P>
<P>
   German cities vie for the loveliest Christmas Market, and
certainly Munich is a leading contender. Christmas in Munich is
also a time for music, when musicians perform the ``Christmas
Oratorio'' by Bach and churches resound with carols.
</P>
<P>
   There is more, of course, to Munich than the sights, sounds and
smells of Christmas. The city has some of Europe's finest museums,
and picturesque neighborhoods, like the old Bohemian quarter in
Schwabing, invite exploration. When snow begins to fall, Alpine ski
resorts lie at the city's doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   After Christmas, Munich quickly turns to very different
celebrations _ the raucous and rousing merriment of Fasching, the
Bavarian variety of Mardi Gras, that in 1999, officially starts
Jan. 7 and ends on Feb. 16, the eve of Ash Wednesday, when the
women who tend the stalls at the Viktualienmarkt, the city's vast
outdoor food market, perform their traditional Fasching dance.
 &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The official start of the Christmas Market, in the heart of the
city at Marienplatz, was on Nov. 28, with the lighting of an
88-foot Christmas tree. The market is open weekdays 10 a.m. to 8:30
p.m. (Sundays until 7:30 p.m.), and closes on Christmas Eve at 2
p.m. Admission is free.
</P>
<P>
   Performances of Christmas music are given daily at 5:30 p.m. at
the balcony of the Altes Rathaus, the Old Town Hall, on
Marienplatz.
</P>
<P>
   Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve in Munich's splendid Gothic
cathedral, the Frauenkirche, is preceded by music at 9:45 p.m.
Seating is first-come, first-served, so it's wise to be there at
least a half-hour early.
</P>
<P>
   Munich has also assembled a program of concerts and exhibits for
the season. In the week before Christmas, the Munich Symphony will
present a Christmas concert at 8 p.m. on Dec. 17 in the
Prinzregententheater, at 12 Prinzregentenplatz, east of the Isar
River, and at 4 p.m. on Dec. 20 in the rococo Peterskirche, or
Church of St. Peter, just off Marienplatz. Tickets cost $16 to $45
(at 1.66 marks to the dollar); call (49-89) 5481-8181.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 20, Bach's ``Christmas Oratorio'' will be performed at
the Philharmonie am Gasteig, 5 Rosenheimer Strasse, by the Munich
Bach Orchestra. Cantatas Nos. 1 to 3 are at 5 p.m., and Cantatas
Nos. 4 to 6 at 8 p.m. Tickets, which must be bought separately for
each performance, cost $34 to $60; (49-89) 5481-8181.
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Eve, the Munich Philharmonic under the direction
of Milan Horvat will perform Beethoven's Ninth Symphony at the
Philharmonie am Gasteig, at 5 p.m. Tickets: about $17.50 to $71.
</P>
<P>
   In December and January, the Bavarian State Ballet will perform
the ``Nutcracker Suite'' by Tchaikovsky in the Bayerische
Staatsoper, the national opera, at 2 Max-Joseph-Platz. Performances
are on Dec. 18, 22, 26 and 29, and Jan. 1, 14 and 17. Tickets: $6
to $67; (49-89) 2185-1920.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hansel and Gretel,'' by Humperdinck, also fun for children,
will be performed at the Prinzregententheater on Dec. 10, 16, 17
and 18. Tickets: $18 to $45
</P>
<P>
   The expressionist paintings of Lyonel Feininger are featured in
an exhibit ending Jan. 24 at the Gallery of Modern Art in the Haus
der Kunst, 1 Prinzregentenstrasse. Another show there, closing Feb.
7, has the somber theme of ``Night in European Painting'' _ with
works by Caravaggio, Rembrandt, Goya and Caspar David Friedrich.
Admission: $7.25, and $2.40 for ages 6 to 18, or $10.85 and $3.60
for both shows; (49-89) 2112-7115.
</P>
<P>
   Lola Montez, the notorious dancer (buried in Green-Wood Cemetery
in Brooklyn), whose affair with King Ludwig I of Bavaria was a
factor in his abdication of the throne in 1848, is the subject of
an exhibit at the Munich Stadtmuseum, 1 Sankt-Jakobs-Platz, through
Jan. 31. Tickets: $4.80; (49-89) 2332-2370.
 &UR; SIGHTSEEING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A quick walk through the center of town leads to some of
Munich's most magnificent rococo churches, among them the
Asamkirche, the Church of St. Peter (or Peterskirche) and the Holy
Ghost Church. Of these, the Asamkirche is the most splendid.
</P>
<P>
   Situated along Sendlingerstrasse, it is officially named for St.
John of Nepomuk, the 14th century Czech martyr, but is better known
by the name of Asam, for the brothers, star architects and
sculptors of the Bavarian rococo.
</P>
<P>
   The interior, which should be viewed in the early morning, when
light streams in the enormous facade window, is an explosion of
decorative splendor.
</P>
<P>
   The Peterskirche, the oldest in Munich, contains a magnificent
rococo altar and statuary, though its upper reaches are now hidden
by scaffolding, as work proceeds on the re-creation of 18th-century
ceiling frescoes by the artist Johann Baptist Zimmermann that were
destroyed in World War II. Entry is free.
</P>
<P>
   A short walk from the Peterskirche is the Spielzeugmuseum, or
Toy Museum, on several floors that are reachable by a narrow,
twisting stairway of a tower in the Old Town Hall. It features a
delightful collection of 19th- and 20th-century playthings, with
wood-carved figurines and windup Popeyes; the Barbie dolls include
first-generation models from the 1950s. Tickets: $3, 60 cents for
children; (49-89) 271-1969.
</P>
<P>
   Another fascinating place for young and old is the Deutsches
Museum of science and technology, 1 Museumsinsel on an island in
the Isar River.
</P>
<P>
   There are hundreds of exhibits, many of them mechanical, that
illustrate mining and steel making, bridge building and computer
technology. Press a button and watch a car being assembled.
Admission: $6; (49-89) 21791.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide on a day of skiing in the nearby Alps, trips are
organized by several large sporting goods stores, like Schuster,
just off Marienplatz. Day trips by bus cost about $42, including
lift ticket. Details are available at Schuster Treffpunkt Sport, 4
Rosenstrasse; (49-89) 237-070.
</P>
<P>
   From mid-December, the Bundesbahn, the railway, also offers
one-day round trips, with ski pass, to nearby ski areas like
Garmisch-Partenkirchen, and Osterhofen. Tickets: $36 to $54;
(49-89) 1308-5846.
</P>
<P>
   For general information, the main tourist office is downtown at
1 Sendlingerstrasse; (49-89) 233-0300, fax (49-89) 2333-0233.
 &UR; WHERE TO STAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given Munich's excellent subway system, you don't have to stay
downtown. But if you do, one choice is Hotel am Markt, at 6
Heiliggeiststrasse, a narrow lane behind the Church of the Holy
Ghost. It offers 30 recently renovated if small, rooms, and not all
with bathrooms and showers. Doubles: $66 to $96; (49-89) 225-014,
fax (49-89) 224-017.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of town, and slightly more expensive, is the Hotel
Excelsior, in the pedestrian mall at 11 Schutzenstrasse, which has
113 rooms comfortably furnished in a vaguely Alpine style. Doubles:
$180 to $225; (49-89) 551370, fax (49-89) 5513-7121.
</P>
<P>
   Budget: The Pension Agnes, 58 Agnesstrasse, about a 10-minute
walk from a subway stop, has 26 rooms spread over several floors of
an old walkup on a tree-lined side street. Doubles: $62 to $65;
(49-89) 123-9450, fax (49-89) 129-1764.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel am Goetheplatz, 33 Waltherstrasse, at the Goetheplatz
subway stop on a line to Marienplatz, offers 20 simply decorated
rooms that look out onto a tree-lined square. Doubles: $60 to $90;
(49-89) 530-306, fax (49-89) 5303-0624.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury: The Hotel Vier Jahres zeiten, at 17 Maximilianstrasse
amid elegant stores and restaurants, is the queen of Munich
hostelry. A five-minute stroll from the neo-classical opera house
and former residence of the kings of Bavaria, it has 318 sumptuous
rooms with equally splendid bathrooms. Doubles: $307 to $487;
(49-89) 21250, fax (49-89) 2125-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Elegant, yet with more rustic Bavarian flavor, is the
Bayerischer Hof, 2-6 Promenadeplatz, with Alpine antiques in its
hallways and 409 rooms. Doubles: $287 to 407; (49-89) 21200, fax
(49-89) 212-0906.
 &UR; WHERE TO EAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bavaria is largely pork-and-potato territory, which doesn't mean
that it cannot be done imaginatively and tastefully. It is also
serious beer country, and the favorite is Weissbier, a flavorful,
cloudy type of brew taken in bulbous tankards of at least a
half-liter in size.
</P>
<P>
   Many restaurants have the character of beer halls, with noise,
bonhomie and often music.
</P>
<P>
   Elegant fare can be enjoyed a stone's throw from the
Viktualienmarkt, at Grune Gans, which seats about 30 in a homey,
dark wood atmosphere at 5 Am Einlass.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner for two _ a first course of light potato pancakes with
caviar of trout in creme fraiche followed by roast pheasant,
cranberry sauce and champagne kraut, and by a desert of crepes
filled with apple ragout _ with wine, comes to about $90.
Reservations required. Closed Sundays; (49-89) 266-228.
</P>
<P>
   In the shadow of the Cathedral, 9 Frauenplatz, is the
justifiably well-know Nurnberger Bratwurst-Glockl am Dom, a cozy
place with dark wood walls and pewter plates that specializes in
delectable pinky-sized sausages from Nuremberg, charcoal-grilled
and served with steaming sauerkraut.
</P>
<P>
   A meal for two of beef broth with whole egg yolk and a platter
of six sausages with sauerkraut, washed down by a glass of beer or
white wine, comes to about $33; (49-89) 220-385.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best-known restaurants for dressing up basic Bavarian
ingredients is the cozy Weinhaus Neuner, at 8 Herzogspitalstrasse,
in warm and inviting rooms that have served as an inn for four
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   A meal might begin with homemade blood wurst on creamed
sauerkraut with a truffle sauce, followed by venison calf filet in
juniper flavored cream sauce with red cabbage, cranberry sauce and
freshly prepared potato noodles. Dinner for two, with wine: $105.
Reservations are recommended; (49-89) 260-3954.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Munich's best cooking is Italian, given the city's
proximity to northern Italy. A recent entry is La Grotta, 24
Schraudolphstrasse, a bright little place on the edge of the lively
Schwabing neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner for two with wine _ consisting of shrimp and chanterelle
mushrooms, followed by grilled scampi, and profiterole for desert _
costs about $72; (49-89) 271-6363.
</P>
<P>
   For a totally different experience with the whole family, try
the Movenpick Marche Restaurant, at 19 Neuhauser Strasse, which
offers a big assortment of fresh fish, meat, sausages and pizza,
served cafeteria-style. Lunch or dinner for two, with beer or wine,
comes to about $18; (49-89) 230-8790.
</P>
<P>
   Most fun, however, is to drop by the Viktualienmarkt. A variety
of stalls offer freshly prepared Bavarian specialties, like
leberkas, a flat liver patty, or the deservedly famous weisswurst,
plump white veal sausages served with sweet mustard. Weisswurst for
two, with a pretzel and beer, costs about $10.

(49-89) 530-306, fax (49-89) 5303-0624.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury: The Hotel Vier Jahres zeiten, at 17 Maximilianstrasse
amid elegant stores and restaurants, is the queen of Munich
hostelry. A five-minute stroll from the neo-classical opera house
and former residence of the kings of Bavaria, it has 318 sumptuous
rooms with equally splendid bathrooms. Doubles: $307 to $487;
(49-89) 21250, fax (49-89) 2125-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Elegant, yet with more rustic Bavarian flavor, is the
Bayerischer Hof, 2-6 Promenadeplatz, with Alpine antiques in its
hallways and 409 rooms. Doubles: $287 to 407; (49-89) 21200, fax
(49-89) 212-0906.
 &UR; WHERE TO EAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bavaria is largely pork-and-potato territory, which doesn't mean
that it cannot be done imaginatively and tastefully. It is also
serious beer country, and the favorite is Weissbier, a flavorful,
cloudy type of brew taken in bulbous tankards of at least a
half-liter in size.
</P>
<P>
   Many restaurants have the character of beer halls, with noise,
bonhomie and often music.
</P>
<P>
   Elegant fare can be enjoyed a stone's throw from the
Viktualienmarkt, at Grune Gans, which seats about 30 in a homey,
dark wood atmosphere at 5 Am Einlass.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner for two _ a first course of light potato pancakes with
caviar of trout in creme fraiche followed by roast pheasant,
cranberry sauce and champagne kraut, and by a desert of crepes
filled with apple ragout _ with wine, comes to about $90.
Reservations required. Closed Sundays; (49-89) 266-228.
</P>
<P>
   In the shadow of the Cathedral, 9 Frauenplatz, is the
justifiably well-know Nurnberger Bratwurst-Glockl am Dom, a cozy
place with dark wood walls and pewter plates that specializes in
delectable pinky-sized sausages from Nuremberg, charcoal-grilled
and served with steaming sauerkraut.
</P>
<P>
   A meal for two of beef broth with whole egg yolk and a platter
of six sausages with sauerkraut, washed down by a glass of beer or
white wine, comes to about $33; (49-89) 220-385.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best-known restaurants for dressing up basic Bavarian
ingredients is the cozy Weinhaus Neuner, at 8 Herzogspitalstrasse,
in warm and inviting rooms that have served as an inn for four
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   A meal might begin with homemade blood wurst on creamed
sauerkraut with a truffle sauce, followed by venison calf filet in
juniper flavored cream sauce with red cabbage, cranberry sauce and
freshly prepared potato noodles. Dinner for two, with wine: $105.
Reservations are recommended; (49-89) 260-3954.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Munich's best cooking is Italian, given the city's
proximity to northern Italy. A recent entry is La Grotta, 24
Schraudolphstrasse, a bright little place on the edge of the lively
Schwabing neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner for two with wine _ consisting of shrimp and chanterelle
mushrooms, followed by grilled scampi, and profiterole for desert _
costs about $72; (49-89) 271-6363.
</P>
<P>
   For a totally different experience with the whole family, try
the Movenpick Marche Restaurant, at 19 Neuhauser Strasse, which
offers a big assortment of fresh fish, meat, sausages and pizza,
served cafeteria-style. Lunch or dinner for two, with beer or wine,
comes to about $18; (49-89) 230-8790.
</P>
<P>
   Most fun, however, is to drop by the Viktualienmarkt. A variety
of stalls offer freshly prepared Bavarian specialties, like
leberkas, a flat liver patty, or the deservedly famous weisswurst,
plump white veal sausages served with sweet mustard. Weisswurst for
two, with a pretzel and beer, costs about $10.

   &UR; (PLEASE NOTE: This article has been transmitted twice _ into the

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   It's a white-on-white day with snow dusting the hoarfrost and
fog layering the horizon line. The only hues breaking the
monochromatic color scheme are startling ski jackets, teasing
tassels on striped mufflers, wild woolen caps and rosy cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, we visited Jackson Hole, Wyo., a place we thought
we'd never spend any winter days. We don't do snow any more _ not
since our early years in Minnesota and Kansas. We never have
learned how to glide down a hill on two pieces of wood with any
grace.
</P>
<P>
   So what's there to do in Jackson if you don't ski and aren't a
snow lover? Try the nature show:
</P>
<P>
   How about a sleigh ride near a herd of 8,000 elk?
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for this winter-wonderland ride can be purchased at the
National Museum of Wildlife, (307) 733-5771. The vastness of the
white landscape is reduced to Lilliputian size beneath the craggy
Gros Ventre mountain backdrop. Thousands of elk spread across the
valley floor, moving in slow motion, as your sleigh steadily enters
their midst with a creak and lurches over the rutted valley floor.
</P>
<P>
   One ambles slowly toward you, stopping to paw the snow for a bit
of food.
</P>
<P>
   Crack! Two bulls butt antlers in a ballet of sorts, while others
lie on the snow-covered field saving their strength to forage for
food later.
</P>
<P>
   The National Elk Refuge just north of Jackson, Wyo., protects
8,000 to 10,000 elk each winter. The daily sleigh rides for
visitors grew out of early efforts to feed the elk.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, horse-drawn hay wagons were used to distribute
food to the elk, and an occasional visitor was taken along. In
1965, sleigh rides for visitors were started officially, and now
from December through March visitors climb aboard haywagon sleighs
to spend about an hour in the middle of the migrating herd.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for the first-come, first-serve elk refuge rides cost
about $10.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ON SAFARI &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the museum and refuge have whetted your appetite to talk to
the animals, a Wildlife Discovery Safari aboard Serengeti-style
vehicles will bring you even closer to nature.
</P>
<P>
   With sliding windows, opening roofs and binoculars at the ready
for all participants, the safari ride will let you ``play biologist
for a day'' says Tom Segerstrom, founder of the Great Plains
Wildlife Institute. (And you'll keep warm, too!) The institute
operates in Jackson with safaris throughout the surrounding area.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo, moose, whitetail mule and bighorn sheep get up close
and personal as Segerstrom explains why ``The more diverse the
ecosystem, the healthier it is'' and that ``bison are not
endangered any more. Your grandchildren will always be able to come
here and see them ...''
</P>
<P>
   Segerstrom lectures every step of the way, letting the
half-dozen people in the van know that ``the best way to be around
wildlife is do what they expect.'' However, he does offer one
warning: Don't force animals up and out of their beds.
</P>
<P>
   The full-day adventure, which is priced at $140 per person,
allows participants the time to locate more species, help with
hands-on wildlife research projects and share stories over lunch.
</P>
<P>
   And if you choose, you can join a brief snowshoe expedition that
may help find, count or track species that are included in the
institute's stewardship projects. Some winters the institute also
offers a shorter sunset or sunrise safari for $80.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call (307) 733-2623; write P.O. Box 7580,
Jackson Hole, Wyo. 83002; or visit www.wildlifesafari.com on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MUSH! &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some of our travel companions raved about their dog-sled tours
aboard modern sleds. Musher-guides signaled the sights of wildlife
with the shussing sounds of winter _ wind in their faces, dogs
panting and the sled's runners streaking across the snow.
</P>
<P>
   Full-day dog-sled tours travel 20 to 22 miles round trip for
$225 per person, while half-day tours are 10 to 12 miles for $135
per person.
</P>
<P>
   My friends traveled from Granite Creek Hot Springs trailhead to
the springs, where they took a soak. On their return they ate lunch
in front of a fire in the Granite Creek Ranch lodge.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call (800) 554-7388 or write Jackson Hole
Iditarod Sled Dog Tours, P.O. Box 1940, Jackson Hole, Wyo. 83001.
</P>
<P>
   Other dog-sled adventures are available at Grand Targhee, (800)
827-4433; $115 for an adult.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PARKS VIA SNOWCOACH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 1968 yellow Bombadier snowcoach is not a quiet nor peaceful
ride with its clackety-clack skis and tank-style tracks, but it is
a guaranteed sightseeing route in Yellowstone Park in winter if you
don't cross-country ski.
</P>
<P>
   For $100 a person, the interpretive tour leaves Flagg Ranch just
south of Yellowstone's South Gate at 8 a.m. with stops at Moose
Falls, Tom Thumb Geyser Basin and views of even more wildlife. It's
a round trip totalling 80 miles.
</P>
<P>
   As you and nine others make your way through the park at a top
speed of 35 mph, you find yourself waving at snowmobilers on the
road or sitting within your own cocoon of silence as you get a
glimmer of Mother Nature's artistry in winter _ snowy ermine drapes
on the evergreens and frozen ``statues'' beside the waterfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked into unlikely places are hard-to-spot creatures such as
bison waiting until the warm days of spring.
</P>
<P>
   Time is of the essence as you near Old Faithful, since the
geyser now spouts on a less predictable schedule. When the coach
arrives, head for the geyser, since you'll get only one chance per
tour to see it erupt.
</P>
<P>
   To study Jackson Hole's wildlife more closely, try Elderhostel
programs at Targhee Institute. They stress topics such as wildlife
tracking and snow travel. The price for the week is $400, including
meals.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, contact Elderhostel Inc. at (877)
426-8056.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ON THE WALL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Wapiti Gallery at the National Museum of Wildlife Art is an
interpretive center for the National Elk Refuge. This jewel is
tucked into a jagged landscape and showcases more than 100 artists'
impressions of North American animals in its permanent collection.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling exhibits each year expand on Western and wildlife
themes. Admission is $5 for seniors, $1 off the regular price. For
more information, call (307) 733-5771.
</P>
<P>
   There's lots to see and do in Jackson _ from art galleries and
shops, to the Cowboy Bar, where you can climb into a saddle aboard
the bar stool to sip your beverage. Energetic types can try ice
skating ($5), hot-air balloon rides ($185) or dinner sleigh rides
in the moonlight (about $50). So what if you don't do snow, you can
still do Jackson in winter.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you DO do snow, there are senior ski values to
explore. A broad range of special packages throughout Jackson Hole
are available through Central Reservations, (800) 443-6931. Call
the Jackson Chamber of Commerce at (307) 733-3316 to get your copy
of the area's ski and vacation planner.

<P>
   Gone are the days when a hotel could get away with simply
offering a room for the night. In an ongoing attempt to attract
guests, many hotels have added special services that go way beyond
overnight shoeshines and in-room coffee makers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hilton Hotels &LR;  (9336 Civic Center Drive, Beverly Hills, Calif.
90210; 800-HILTONS) has been a leader in adapting rooms to better
suit guests.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, they introduced Sleep-Tight Rooms, which feature
blackout drapes, a light box to help adjust circadian rhythms and
noise machines to block out unwanted sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company is testing 16 Health-Fit Rooms and Stress-Less
Rooms in nine properties, including the Hilton Chicago O'Hare
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The Health-Fit Rooms come with a Reebok Cross Conditioning
System, an SPRI Xertube for in-room exercises as well as a
20-minute in-room workout plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Stress-Less Rooms boast an in-room fountain to provide
soothing noises, a Massaging Seat Topper seat pad to massage the
body and a Living Yoga beginner's yoga video, among other
amenities.
</P>
<P>
   New York City's chic  &UR; Soho Grand Hotel &LR;  (310 West Broadway, New
York, N.Y. 10013; 800-965-3000) is owned and operated by Hartz
Mountain Industries. Not surprisingly, dogs and cats are not only
welcome but are catered to with an in-room menu.
</P>
<P>
   A bowl of dry dog food with a bowl of water is $10, a full-body
pillow is $20 while assorted toys are $8 for three toys.
</P>
<P>
   Cat owners can rent a litter pan with liner for $10 per day, and
dog-walking and cat visitations can be arranged. For guests who
arrive without a pet but would like one, a goldfish is delivered to
their room.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast is considered to be the most important meal of the
day, so Norma's, the new restaurant at  &UR; Le Parker Meridien &LR;  (118
West 57th St., New York, N.Y. 10019; 800-543-4300), serves it all
day long.
</P>
<P>
   Chef David Rangel provides Molten Chocolate French Toast with
Pineapple Chutney in addition to Krispy Kreme Donuts, H&AMP;H Bagels
and McCann's Irish Oatmeal.
</P>
<P>
   At  &UR; The Mark Hotel &LR;  (25 E.77th St., New York, N.Y. 10021;
800-THE-MARK) on New York City's Upper East Side, there's a free
shuttle twice a morning downtown to Wall Street and a shuttle to
the theater district on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Complimentary cellular-phone rental with call forwarding is
available, with per-minute charges billed at $1.75.
</P>
<P>
   For skiers who need to be pampered, Aspen's  &UR; Little Nell &LR;  (675
E. Durant St., Aspen, Colo., 81611; 888-THE NELL) boasts a ski
concierge to store and warm skiers' boots and have guests' skis
ready the next morning. They can warm up with free coffee cake and
hot chocolate before taking what the hotel says are just 17 steps
to the Aspen Mountain gondola.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimpton Hotel Group, which has 24 hotels in San Francisco,
Seattle, Portland, Tacoma, Denver and Chicago, is known for their
innovative design and guest amenities.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at the  &UR; Hotel Monaco Denver &LR;  (1717 Champa St.,
Denver, Colo. 80202; 800-397-5380) there are guest rooms set aside
for tall guests. These are high-ceilinged rooms with 90-inch-long
beds and raised showerheads. A pet-friendly hotel, the Monaco also
provides guests with a pet goldfish during their stay.
</P>
<P>
   Bemoaning the poor quality of airline food,  &UR; The Peninsula
Beverly Hills &LR;  (9882 Santa Monica Blvd., Beverly Hills, Calif.
90212; 800-462-7899) offers a Pen-Air In-flight Menu that's in the
shape of an airline ticket. It's a selection of food to-go from the
hotel's kitchen that's meant to be consumed on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The Peninsula's club sandwich is $11.50 while a chocolate walnut
brownie is $5.25.
</P>
<P>
   At the  &UR; Four Seasons Resort and Club &LR;  in Dallas at Las Colinas
(4150 North MacArthur Blvd., Irving, Texas, 75038; 800-332-3442),
guests are offered complimentary tai chi, yoga and meditation
classes as well as workout clothes and tennis shoes in case they
forget their own.
</P>
<P>
   Fussy sleepers will be happy to hear that the first menu they'll
see upon arrival at  &UR; Cotton House &LR;  (Mustique, W.I. 800-826-2809) on
the Caribbean island of Mustique is a pillow menu. There are nine
free choices, including a Snore Stoppers Pillow, a Maternity Pillow
and a Bed Rest Pillow ideal for reading in bed.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Schrager, who runs such chic hotel properties as the
Royalton, Morgans and the Paramount in New York City; the Delano in
Miami's South Beach; and the Mondrian in Los Angeles, has carefully
chosen the room amenities in his hotels.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at the  &UR; Mondrian &LR;  (8400 Sunset Blvd., West
Hollywood, Calif., 90069; 323-650-8999) guests will find a minibar
that includes what the hotel calls an Intimacy Kit featuring two
condoms, lubricant and a towelette. The price? $11.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Colorado's  &UR; Best Western Movie Manor Inn &LR;  (2830 W. US
160, Monte Vista, Colo., 81144; 800-771-9468) has the ultimate
in-room movie. The hotel, 100 miles west of Pueblo, provides
virtually every guest with complimentary access to a first-run
movie at the Star Drive-In Movie Theater _ without leaving their
room.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of the hotel's guest rooms have picture windows
that face the movie screen, and there's a speaker next to the bed.
</P>
<P>
   Movies are shown nightly during the summer and on weekends
during the spring and fall. (Popcorn is extra!)

DNC'S GROSSMAN GOES OUT ON TOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN C. MOONEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve Grossman's sense of timing may be even better than his
political instincts.
</P>
<P>
   After a boffo two-year run, the Newton businessman-activist
announced this week that he will step down as chairman of the
Democratic National Committee. He's going out on top.
</P>
<P>
   When he assumed the post, the party was staggering from a
fund-raising scandal, an $18 million debt, and the prospect of a
blowout in the 1998 election.
</P>
<P>
   When he departs next month, the fund-raising base will be
broader, the debt $5 million, and the party poised to reclaim a
majority in the US House of Representatives in 2000 after the
improbable successes in last month's election.
</P>
<P>
   In this space last May, Grossman cheerily predicted the 1998
congressional elections would be a win for Democrats because of
strategic targeting of resources and organization at the local
level. We thought he was delusional. Every so-called expert did.
</P>
<P>
   After all, only once since the Civil War had the party of the
president gained congressional seats in a mid-term election. After
all, the Monica Lewinsky scandal was gripping the country.
</P>
<P>
   But after all, Steve Grossman was right. Democrats picked up
five seats in the House and broke even in Senate fights.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is nothing self-aggrandizing in the timing of
Grossman's exit. That wouldn't be his style anyway. His 79-year-old
father, Edgar, is ailing, and Grossman wants to spend more time
with his wife, Barbara, a theater professor-historian, and
9-year-old son, Joshua, youngest of their three boys.
</P>
<P>
   He's earned the respite. In two years at the DNC, he logged at
least 300,000 miles in flight as prolific fund-raiser and
ambassador to the Democratic Party's core constituency groups.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman's done his job (foregoing a $136,000 salary, we would
note), served his party and his president remarkably well, and is
coming home to concentrate on his family, his business, the
Massachusetts Envelope Co., and many other interests. He sits on 16
civic, cultural, and philanthropic boards. They include the Museum
of Fine Arts, Brandeis University, Beth Israel Deaconess and
Children's hospitals, Combined Jewish Philanthropies, the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, and the Robert F. Kennedy
Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   In an increasingly grubby, grasping, and cynical business, this
52-year-old retains his idealism. He is partisan and passionate
about his politics, but he plays by the rules. And he plays to win.
</P>
<P>
   To anyone who observed Grossman's work as chairman of the
Massachusetts Democratic Party in 1991-92, the national party's
successes on Nov. 3 should have been no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived after the Democratic disaster of 1990, when
Republicans were elected governor, lieutenant governor, and
treasurer and knocked off six Democratic state senators to win
enough seats to sustain Governor William F. Weld's vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   For the '92 election cycle, Grossman zeroed in on those key
districts, recapturing four of the lost seats and ousting two other
veteran GOP senators in the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   He was dogged. On the Sunday before the election, Grossman, an
aide, and son Josh, then age three, tailed Weld's Republican
caravan across the state into five contested senate districts. At
each stop, he offered reporters the Democratic counterpoint.
</P>
<P>
   As the day wore on, the Republicans' pique grew, finally
exploding late in the day in Weymouth, when GOP congressional
hopeful Dan Daly angrily upbraided Grossman in front of the TV
cameras. That prompted young Josh to break into tears.
</P>
<P>
   Why was his son was crying, a reporter asked Grossman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joshua always cries when Republicans lie,'' he responded,
creating the sound bite that topped the nightly news.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the DNC does not mean Grossman is retiring from the
game. He continues to be a major donor to the Democratic Party,
giving about $100,000 each of the past two years. (Is it any wonder
he supports public financing of campaigns?) Once he steps down, he
said he will end his strict neutrality and become an advocate for
Boston, over Denver and Los Angeles, as the site of the 2000
Democratic National Convention. And he remains active locally. On
his resume, between former state party chairman and director of
Combined Jewish Philanthropies, he lists ``Member, Ward 7, Newton
Democratic Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, last month, at a National Association of Secretaries
of State subcommittee meeting on presidential primaries, he
proposed a bipartisan commission, on which he'd be willing to
serve, to study ways to increase voter participation.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone should welcome that because politics needs people like
Steve Grossman.

PAXTON'S `PLAN' 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a story about fathers and brothers and fate and
gorillas. They all come together in the person of the quietest guy
on the A-list, Bill Paxton. When he was growing up in Fort Worth,
he ruefully admits, there was a Wild Bill Paxton stage. These days
he's content to soft-pedal his rise to stardom, describing it as an
up-the-back-stairs climb. In the last few years, he's appeared in
as many blockbusters as anyone: ``Apollo 13,'' ``Twister,''
``Titanic.'' We'll see him in two holiday movies. On Friday, he'll
be the farm-town Everyman who stumbles on a bag of dirty money in
``A Simple Plan.'' On Christmas Day, he'll be the save-the-gorilla
character in Disney's remake of ``Mighty Joe Young.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, he's sitting at a hotel dining room table in Boston,
too good a Texas storyteller to get around to eating, effortlessly
and fluently forging the links any good actor finds between his
material and his life. His own father was his link to acting,
Paxton says, and to ``A Simple Plan.'' Five years ago, his father
read Scott Smith's dark moral allegory, and told Paxton, ``You
gotta play this part.'' ``I said, `Dad, that's great, but they're
not going to be calling me. I know there's gonna be guys fighting
to play it.' There were. Nicolas Cage was the first choice to star,
Mike Nichols to direct. But when the Hollywood roulette wheel
stopped spinning, Paxton was aboard with Sam Raimi directing.
</P>
<P>
   Paxton's father, John, a retired traveling salesman for his
family's hardwood lumber business, is in the movie, too. He plays a
testy farmer who comes to the feed store where Bill Paxton's
character works, grumbling about being overbilled, only to be told
that the month he's complaining about had five Mondays in it.
``It's my dad's sixth or seventh picture,'' the younger Paxton
says. ``I got him a Screen Actors Guild card in `Brain Dead.' In
`Last Man Standing,' the remake of `Yojimbo' shot in Texas, my dad
was the town undertaker. He keeps tipping his hat to Bruce Willis,
who keeps his business flourishing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the connections are only just beginning. The linchpin
relationship in ``A Simple Plan'' is between Paxton's charater and
his older brother, who, to put it softly, has been less favored by
life. The discovery of the money does not promote harmony between
them. Billy Bob Thornton plays Paxton's brother in a remarkable
turn, and, Paxton says, a satisfying follow-up to their
collaboration in a breakthrough film for both of them and director
Carl Franklin, ``One False Move.'' Because Thornton had the
narrowest window of time, they had to shoot the scenes with him _
the film's most intense _ first.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Jumping right in
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only their mutual familiarity made it possible to jump into the
sturm und drang they had to whip up on the wing. Something else
helped. The brothers' relationship in the film paralleled that of
his own life, Paxton says. ``My brother Bob is not unlike the
character Billy plays, which made the experience an intensely
personal one for me. We were always very close. We grew up
together. We shared a room together. We went to camp together. My
brother right now lives in a school in Kentucky. He's very bright.
He does volunteer work. He puts components together in a factory
there and he's kind of the unofficial mayor of the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother was really the emotionally sensitive child. When he
was 24, he was in a horrendous car accident. He had severe trauma
which left him with permanent damage. He damaged his optic nerve
and lost about 95 percent of his vision, so this compounded an
already emotionally sensitive person. So I can relate to the
situation with these two brothers. Also, in the film, the guy I
play is married and had a young family. I'm in a similar situation.
A lot of people say Bridget (Bridget Fonda, who plays Paxton's wife
in the film) kind of turns into a Lady Macbeth and all that. But in
my own relationship with my wife, there have been moments of
emotional crisis where I have been indecisive, and she has risen to
the occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, Paxton was taken to more movies and plays and art
galleries by his father than to football games. Unlike, say,
``Twister,'' in which he costarred against a screenful of
computer-generated wind, ``A Simple Plan'' is much more an actor's
piece, probably the most subtle he's done. The 43-year-old actor
reaches into the world of art to describe the changes in his
acting. ``When you start out, you're always saying, `Hey, look at
me! Look at my choices!' As you get older, you think more like a
craftsman. You kind of want to find a subtler way, to create more
impact with minimal effort. I admire artists like Picassso and
Matisse, who as they get to the end of their lives, start doing
line drawings, very minimal.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A leap of faith
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn to trust the audience more. Without giving too much
away, in this film I do something bad, but I want the audience to
make a leap of faith with me and still hope we come out OK. I said,
`Sam, what if I just look away and try to think that I'm on a beach
in Mexico with a pina colada and I'm not really doing this? This
isn't me really doing it.' I sometimes try and remove myself from
the action, and that seemed to work a lot better, although I could
have used a little more finesse. It helped that this movie only
cost $15 million, so there was less pressure, and I could
experiment with trying to ask for sympathy while I was doing
something bad.''
</P>
<P>
   There were times when Paxton, who started in Hollywood in 1974
as a set dresser on the strength of a letter his father wrote to a
producer, actually did remove himself from the action. After moving
to New York to study acting, he returned to Los Angeles and got
what could have been his first break when, as understudy, he
inherited the lead in the West Coast premiere of Sam Shepherd's
drama, ``Curse of the Starving Class.'' ``Suddenly I was thrust
center stage,'' Paxton recalls. ``All I could think was that I
should be better. I literally pressured myself right out of the
part. I ended up literally running away from Hollywood and going
back to New York.

   TAKE-BOS  
 NEW YORK: ... external world.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I don't know what a lot of these characters are painting these
days,'' Solman notes of abstractionists. ``They take one symbol and
just use it again and again: painters who know more and more about
less and less. I like artists who are moved by subject matter.
That's why I never went for abstraction: The (external) subject has
more interest than any shape we might invent. I take what's out
there, and that's what lights up my imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Art has been a part of Solman's life since boyhood. ``I always
loved pictures,'' he explains. ``I remember drawing kids on my
block when I was 12 or 13 years of age. When I went to the National
Academy, I had to ride the elevated trains from Jamaica, on Long
Island, then change to the subway, up to 110th Street, to the
academy, which would take a couple of hours. (I never dreamed I'd
later become treasurer of the academy. I looked down on the place:
It was academic, so stultified.) I drew on my pads during the ride
back and forth. On the way back it would be late at night, 10-ish,
and people would be asleep. That meant they would be posed
perfectly. So I learned more to draw on the subway than I ever did
in the academy!''
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, Solman held various jobs to support his
painting. He worked as a night-elevator operator in the '20s and
first part of the '30s. The WPA let him work full time as an artist
during the Depression. Later, he'd work six months a year as a
parimutuel clerk at various New York racetracks. ``That was more
romantic to my son than my being an artist,'' Solman laughs. (That
son, Paul Solman, is economics correspondent for PBS's ``NewsHour
with Jim Lehrer'' and helped organize the Mercury Gallery show.) He
also taught, giving private lessons during the '50s and '60s, and
then served on the faculty at the City University of New York.

</P>
<P>
   Negative on art criticism
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Especially during his WPA days, Solman wrote extensively on art.
He was coeditor, with Schapiro and Harold Rosenberg, of Art Front
magazine and was one of the first writers in English to discuss the
great French photographer Eugene Atget. Still, he professes
bewilderment at the vagaries of critical taste and contends that
art criticism holds little value for the artist. During his
teaching days, Solman had a standard response when students asked
him what to read: ``Pick a book where you like the pictures and the
text is in a language you don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Solman's ``main focus'' these days is that supremely New York
subject, the skyscraper. The buildings used to intimidate him, he
says, but now he's made hundreds of drawings of them, the shifting
visual relations among the towers, and the way they relate to the
sky, making for a subject of endless variety and intricacy. ``I
like to go out making notes,'' he says of these drawings. ``It's
part of the adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   He has a regular route, heading up to 59th or 60th Street, then
over to Fifth Avenue, where he takes the bus down to 38th Street.
All the while he works his sketch pad. ``The skyscrapers form a
pattern with the sky in between that at different times of the day
creates these sky shapes, surrounded by the canyons of the big
buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Solman distills the drawings for a much smaller group of
paintings. ``In some cases,'' he explains, ``I do it almost as
silhouettes painted against a strange sky, a lavender sky or a
yellow sky, something like that. With these paintings, I feel like
I'm at the beginning of a long trek, a new career. This new theme,
I feel I've hardly explored it. It's going to take a few years to
develop.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not the sort of thing one expects to hear from a man who
turns 90 next month. Solman laughs. ``When I was 79, I bragged a
bit _ that seemed like a pretty substantial number. When I hit 80,
though, it was kind of a solar plexus punch. Now I've gotten used
to it. I don't think of age any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THE TEN OPENS IN NEW YORK &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ten: Rothko, Solman and the Birth of the American
Avant-garde,'' now at the Mercury Gallery, marks the 60th
anniversary of the New York exhibition ``The Ten: Whitney
Dissenters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dissenters'' was the right word. The Ten, comprising such
painters as Mark Rothko, Joseph Solman, Ben-Zion, Ilya Bolotowsky,
and Adolph Gottlieb, had one thing in common: a devout opposition
to the art establishment of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were important because, in the late '30s, when they were
painting and exhibiting together, there was not too much
avant-garde in New York,'' says Isabelle Dervaux, a curator at
Washington's National Gallery of Art. ``The Ten were among the few
artists who wanted to go against the dominant position of, for
instance, the Whitney Museum.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ten was founded in 1935, when it had its first exhibition. A
combination of political tensions and the growing success of
individual members led in 1939 to the group's demise. The only
thing that had united them was iconoclasm. Among the Ten, one can
find traces of Cubism, Surrealism, and Expressionism, and the
influence of artists as diverse as Milton Avery and Chaim Soutine.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't really have a leader, says Dervaux, ``but Solman and
Rothko were more active in keeping the group together and
organizing exhibitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothko, of course, went on to become one of the most famous
Abstract Expressionists. Solman, the youngest of the group, is its
sole surviving member.

THE QUALITY OF MERCY IN `VENICE' 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Imagine any contemporary legal proceeding _ say, a
scene from a high-profile criminal trial, or a snapshot of the
Judiciary Committee's impeachment hearings, or a glimpse of
testimony in the Justice Department's suit against Microsoft. The
opposing sides are lined up as usual; the lawyers are there,
starched and pressed and ready to pounce. And then in walks a
surprise witness, an unknown scholar who silences the room with an
unexpected plea. ``The quality of mercy is not strained,'' the
witness says, softly. ``It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
upon the place beneath.''
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, mayhem would ensue. The prosecution would surely
object. Who is this anachronistic soul, daring to wax eloquent
about the concept of mercy in a court of law? Surely, this person
must be either painfully naive or soft on crime. After all, the
dirty rotten rascals get away with it all the time and they deserve
what they get.
</P>
<P>
   Compassion? Mercy? Irrelevant. Next witness, please.
</P>
<P>
   In these cynical, litigious times, such a scene seems highly
unlikely, but it lies at the heart of director Andrei Serban's
production of ``The Merchant of Venice'' for the American Repertory
Theatre, which begins previews Friday at the Loeb Drama Center in
Cambridge and opens Dec. 16. This controversial drama, one of
Shakespeare's ``problem'' plays, is disturbing to contemporary
audiences for many reasons, most notably for the anti-Semitism
surrounding Shylock, the Jewish moneylender who demands a pound of
flesh from the errant borrower Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also a study of clashing cultures, of a world in which
the characters are so caught up in the nail-breaking, back-stabbing
struggle for money and power and acceptance that they lose sight of
the simple notion of forgiveness. That is what fascinates Serban
about the play, and he seems to be driving the actors to explore
the possibility of compassion in a merciless society where sides
are drawn quickly and firmly in even the most ambiguous of court
cases. He views the play as an allegory, and his rehearsal process
is raising painful questions for the actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rattling,'' says Kristin Flanders, who as Portia delivers
that beautiful speech about mercy. ``I find that my own issues of
faith are surfacing in ways that they haven't since I was very
young. I mean, really, what your beliefs are. It rattles. It
resonates. It forces you to ask really difficult questions about
cultural difference, and in America, that's very, very hard. It's
hard for us to have those conversations.'' She pauses, drops her
head into her hands, and stares long and hard at a spot on the
floor. For the actress who conquered Kate in last season's ``The
Taming of the Shrew,'' the words don't come easily. ``What am I
talking about? I'm talking about faith, about one's earliest
development. Because it's an allegory, it takes you back to that
simplest point, that place where faith first springs, which is very
young. I can't be more specific, and I don't want to be more
specific. It's just faith. Blind faith.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A challenging position
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Loeb, men with jackhammers are tearing up the brick
sidewalk. The ground rattles. It shakes.
</P>
<P>
   Like Flanders, Jonathan Epstein is also finding himself in a
disturbing yet challenging position as he prepares for the role of
Antonio. This summer, he played Shylock in Shakespeare &AMP; Company's
acclaimed production of ``Merchant,'' and he spent the summer
getting under the skin of a man who is taunted and persecuted in
Venice and who, as a result, becomes hardened and cruel. Epstein
found his own way for the character to make peace with himself and
with his God, but after spending so much time ``loading the dice''
for Shylock, he now finds himself on the other side. As Antonio, he
is the taunter, and he needs to grasp the roots of his character's
prejudice. For someone who has experienced anti-Semitism in his own
life, that's not particularly easy. It rattles. It resonates. ``As
a Jew in the everyday world, I spend more time thinking about how
not to be brought down by prejudice than I do about how to
understand it,'' Epstein says. ``I don't know if this will lead to
some great sense of forgiveness, but at least I'm beginning to
understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Understanding has a price. ``Both roles are painful to play,''
Epstein says. ``It's not difficult to depict the behavior of
someone who says these things, but it's difficult to allow that
spirit to possess my own spirit. It takes courage to let them in
all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   In letting those feelings in, the actors hope to make a bigger
point. ``The reason for doing the play is to get at a universal
truth about mercy and compassion _ or the lack of it,'' says Will
Lebow, the actor playing Shylock at ART.
</P>
<P>
   All the actors, interviewed separately, are speaking the same
language, wrestling with the same question in their own way. Serban
is driving that struggle. ``A man who cannot find mercy in himself
is a man who has no heart,'' the director says quietly. ``From that
point of view, it is a morality play that teaches us that we have
to find mercy, which is higher than any law or logic of the mind.''
The director exudes a sort of calm in the uncommon quiet of the
Loeb lobby, but outside, the jackhammers do their dance of
destruction, rattling the foundation below the ground.

DALLAS WORRIED JFK A YEAR BEFORE ASSASSINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHRISTOPHER MATTHEWS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A year before his Nov. 22, 1963, assassination in
Dallas, President John F. Kennedy chatted on the telephone with
Texas Gov. John Connally about the hostile political situation he
faced there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why we do anything for Dallas,'' JFK said after
reviewing the midterm election results of the day before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you,'' the Texas governor responded, ``they just
murdered all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Connally was unaware his blunt remarks were being taped. Twelve
months later, both men would be shot riding in an open car through
the same Texas city where right-wing politics had caused Kennedy
such concern.
</P>
<P>
   In the Nov. 7, 1962, tape, recently made available at the John
F. Kennedy Library in Boston, we hear the reason for Kennedy's
frustration. He was watching Texas, especially Dallas, as it began
the conservative drift that continues to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Connally chalked up the shift to economics. ``They're just a
bunch of ... junior executives ... and these society gals,'' he
said of the voters in booming Dallas. ``They just got 'em a crusade
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy: ``What did we, what did we lose Dallas by _ do you
remember? _ in 1960?''
</P>
<P>
   Connally: ``You lost (by) over 60,000 votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy: ``60,000 votes! Hell, I got ... You know they're up
there talking to me about having that federal building down there
and all the rest of that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Connally: ``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy: ``I don't know why we do anything for Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, talking about the bad Democratic showing in the 1962
election, Connally warned Kennedy about the dire political
situation he would face in Texas seeking re-election in 1964: ``I'm
telling you, they just murdered all of us. Our party's gone down in
the past six years. They had a hate campaign going, very frankly.
They were running against Cuba and against you and the vice
president ... It was a protest, a helluva protest vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Connally was referring to Fidel Castro's Cuba, which recently
had tried to deploy Soviet missiles aimed at the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The following November, history grimly would record, JFK
traveled to Texas in hopes of healing the political damage that had
cut the president's statewide approval rating to 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As Kennedy drove from Fort Worth to the airport that morning for
the short flight to Dallas, Jim Wright, then the local Democratic
representative, recalled Connally giving the president the same
analysis he had given him on the phone the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Riding alongside Kennedy, Connally _ then a Democrat but later a
party-switcher _ explained the rightward shift in Dallas politics
to the city's economic structure. He said the city had become a
high-rise boom town of banks and insurance companies, all filled
with men in white shirts who increasingly identified with the
Republican Party.

   TAKE-BOS  
 BOSTON: ... the ground.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Merchant of Venice'' was originally written as a comedy,
with Shylock portrayed as a commedia dell'arte clown, the perennial
outsider striving to fit in. You may remember the story. Shylock
lends 3,000 ducats to Bassanio, a Venetian gentleman down on his
luck. Bassanio's friend Antonio (the merchant of the title) agrees
to give a pound of his flesh if the bond is not repaid. Meanwhile,
Bassanio woos and wins Portia in her bucolic home in Belmont, which
is far removed from the mercantile world of Venice. When Antonio
cannot repay the money, Shylock sticks to the letter of the law and
demands the pound of flesh. Portia disguises herself as a man and
goes to court to plead for Antonio's life; Shylock refuses to
listen and is ultimately destroyed. His daughter rejects him and he
is forced to convert to Christianity. But Portia is also betrayed
by Bassanio.
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying the anti-Semitism in this ``comedy.'' In the
world of the play, Shylock is a ``devil'' and a ``dog,'' driven to
assert his own humanity in his moving ``Hath not a Jew eyes?''
speech. Given the atrocities of the 20th century, it is simply
impossible to see the play as Shakespeare wrote it. But while
Serban acknowledges the anti-Semitism running through the story, he
is not making that brand of hate the centerpiece of his production.
``I'm not at all interested in doing what many contemporary
productions have done, which is to emphasize and exaggerate the
racist aspect of the play by making the tension between the
Christians and the Jews more acute than it is,'' Serban says. ``I'm
not trying to apologize for Shylock. I think our world today is a
much more fragmented world than Shakespeare's world. It's much more
alienated. One feels exiled from one's own home, from one's own
parents. That kind of alienation, that kind of loneliness at the
end of the 20th century, is so apocalyptic. In that sense, we are
all Shylock. And where, in the middle of all this, can we find our
hearts?''
</P>
<P>
   This is the question that is rattling the actors. Flanders is
questioning her faith. Epstein is trying to understand the source
of prejudice he's faced all of his life. And Lebow, who considers
himself an ``ethnic Jew,'' is recalling his childhood growing up in
Richmond Hill in Queens, which was 90 percent Catholic, 8 percent
Lutheran, and 2 percent ``Other.'' He fit into the category of
Other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Literally, we were the only Jewish family within, I don't
know, a couple of miles,'' Lebow says. ``My whole life was about
fitting in _ or I guess the new politically correct word is
`assimilate.' I actually had a couple of years in elementary school
where I was _ what's the word? _ I was taunted, persecuted by a few
of my fellow students. I would get letters signed `Adolf Eichmann,'
and I would get printed invitations to barbecues where they said
they would be roasting the Jews. I dealt with this for a couple of
years and then, finally, I went to the principal and the assistant
principal of the school, and they investigated it.''
</P>
<P>
   We are all Shylock.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the kinds of memories that lurk beneath the surface of
any production of ``Merchant,'' but Lebow and the others contend
that the point is not to pound home the obvious anti-Semitism but
rather to explore the possibility of an alternative. And let's not
be naive: Possibility is not the same thing as probability.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `A beautiful hell'
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Venice is like hell,'' Serban says. ``It's a beautiful hell,
but it's hell just the same. And that's very much our world.
Belmont, on the other hand, is a utopia, an arcadia, the place we
would all wish to live. That's the paradox of the play. Belmont is
a place of possibility. It doesn't exist, for sure, but it's
something we are all longing for. It's the island that we all hope
we can go to.''
</P>
<P>
   Serban is known for imposing his concepts through startling
visual images. In his 1989 production of ``Twelfth Night,'' he
juxtaposed a tomb and a tavern, creating a haunting world where
love can be as soothing or as fierce as waves on a beach, depending
on your point of view. Last season, he transformed ``Shrew'' into a
rock-'em-sock-'em boxing match, turning the play into an
unforgettable if ambiguous experience. And he says he is thinking
about ``Merchant'' like a dramatic canvas, set ``vaguely'' in the
20th century with the usual mix of eclectic costumes. ``It's like
an abstract painting with splashes of red and gold for Venice,'' he
says. ``The red is the passion, and the gold is, well, obviously
the gold. For Belmont, the colors are beautiful van Gogh yellows
and greens, like daylight. It's full of life and full of vibrant
color, which is almost like a Garden of Eden of our imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Belmont is precisely that: a figment of our imagination. It is
there that mercy ultimately comes into play. After the characters
utterly destroy Shylock, they all head back to Belmont, where
Portia is faced with a decision about Bassanio. He has betrayed her
by declaring his love for Antonio. Can she forgive him? Can she let
her husband _ and his lover _ into her heart and into her home? In
this imagined arcadia, can she practice what she preached in court?
If mercy eludes us in our civic lives, how can we embrace it in our
domestic lives?
</P>
<P>
   Those are the questions that are rattling the actors,
particularly Flanders. ``The notion of compassion is the most
important notion we have,'' she says. ``Portia goes from the
political conflict in court to the domestic conflict of her
husband's relationship with a gay man. Can she, in fact, accept the
Other in her own house? I mean, who is this woman? It's rattling me
because compassion is so _'' A pause. ``It's so hard. We live in a
world that's very severe. We keep drawing harsh lines. We're all
working. We're all stressed out. This play asks really big, big
questions about what we're capable of.''
</P>
<P>
   In the play, she's the one who pleads so eloquently for mercy,
but in this world, she's not so sure it's possible. She keeps
coming back to that speech _ ``The quality of mercy is not
strained.'' She's reminded of her conflicted reaction to the O. J.
Simpson verdict. She's reminded of the hearings in Washington, D.C.
She can't imagine strolling into a contemporary courtroom and
speaking those words. It's rattling, rattling like the clang of a
jackhammer digging at the neurons in her brain.

MIKE ESPY: NO MODEL FOR PUBLIC SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy last week
was exonerated of criminal charges of corruption by a federal court
jury, an action he naturally hailed as a vindication of himself and
a tacit endorsement of his behavior while in office.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. Although the jury in Washington, D.C., had trouble
sorting out criminal and ethical violations, Espy's conduct in
office hardly qualifies him as a paragon of a worthy public
servant.
</P>
<P>
   Actions that he has acknowledged, while found not to have been
criminal offenses, nevertheless reveal a languid respect for
self-evident elementary ethics.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take a saint to comprehend that a person serving in
the Cabinet should not be taking or soliciting costly gifts from
anyone, even though the laws and regulations may be ill-defined and
even contradictory.
</P>
<P>
   Espy had been the target of an investigation by yet another
indefatigable independent counsel, Donald C. Smaltz, who spent four
years and more than $17 million pursuing the corruption
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the finding of not guilty on each of 30 counts of
taking gifts or goods from business people and lobbyists, who had
interests and activities that came under the purview of the
Department of Agriculture, gave additional aid and comfort to those
who want to do away with the Office of Independent Counsel.
Opponents of that particular post-Watergate reform were already
turned off by the conduct of Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel
assigned to hunt down President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The overkill of the Smaltz prosecution does not validate Espy's
conduct in office. He was openly contemptuous of ethical strictures
governing federal employees, according to the testimony of a fellow
presidential appointee.
</P>
<P>
   His disregard of the rules that exist in statute and that
decency itself prescribe was demonstrated by the dollar value of
the gifts, tickets to sporting events as well as other goodies that
came to him or his girlfriend. Adding them all up, they amounted to
$35,000.
</P>
<P>
   Espy argued in his defense that the gifts came from friends and
as such were not illegal (although federal rules don't appear to
make that distinction).
</P>
<P>
   But it takes an uncommon kind of friendship that would produce
that scale of largess over a couple of years. Most friends are
inclined to send a buddy the occasional birthday card; they don't
shower a pal with thousands of dollars worth of freebies.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, a friendship in which gift-giving of this magnitude
was part of the relationship would seemingly call for the
benefactions to flow both ways, in roughly equitable measure. This
did not appear to have happened with Espy and his friends in the
large food companies that were regulated by the Agriculture
Department.
</P>
<P>
   It is plain that a government executive should be circumspect in
all relationships to guard against favoritism. With old friends,
there is a need for particular rectitude to assure that the
continuing relationship is kept above reproach and untainted by
cronyism.
</P>
<P>
   Espy's attorneys further argued, with apparent success, that the
independent counsel did not and could not show any tit for tat for
the gifts. A different court, a federal appeals court, had ruled
that such a tradeoff would have to be shown for a proper
prosecution on corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other ways for a government executive to help out
his friends, by supporting policies and decisions that make them
friends in the first place. This is not a new practice in
Washington, and the point is not to make Espy the scapegoat for a
political culture that has had a long history, with many
distinguished participants in one form or another. After all,
Ronald Reagan's friends bought him a very expensive house as soon
as he left the presidency, and George Bush received astronomical
honoraria for speechmaking once out of office.
</P>
<P>
   But the Espy case highlights the necessity to examine the
political culture that tolerates the kind of mutual back
scratching, which, without exception, interferes with the public
being well served. That culture also embraces the scandalous manner
in which political campaign contributions are raised and used.
</P>
<P>
   Espy is far from the worst offending freeloader in the nation's
history. A host of miscreants have committed not only ethical but
also criminal violations of the public trust, for which some were
disgraced while others also went to the slammer.
</P>
<P>
   But his victory in court is not entirely a matter for rejoicing
that still another heavy-handed prosecutor has fallen on the sword
of his overwrought ambition. It is even more a signal indicating
how much the public needs to insist on maintaining high standards
for public service, and not be discouraged by how frequently that
appears daunting.

THE YEAR'S BEST GIFT BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gift books represent a special category of Christmas present _
each requires a sizable cash or credit investment and a full sheet
of wrapping paper, not to mention a strong back if you plan to buy
more than one or two. Gift books are easier to receive than give.
Some of them thrive on display, others offer pride of ownership;
some provide luxurious opportunities for the pleasures of leisurely
poring; and a few of the best may prove truly useful.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas celebrates a birth, so ``Babies Celebrated'' by
Beatrice Fontanel and Claire d'Harcourt (Abrams, $39.95) makes a
particularly appropriate choice. With the help of an international
team of 16 enthnologists, the authors and photographers document
how babies are cherished, and how the problems they present are
dealt with, in many world cultures. There is nothing sentimental
about this, and some of the images are heart-stopping; all of them
are pictures of love.
</P>
<P>
   David Macaulay's ``The Way Things Work'' has sold more than 1
million copies since it was first published, a decade ago. Now it
has been reprinted as ``The New Way Things Work'' (Houghton
Mifflin, $35). What makes it new is a chapter in which an amiable
mammoth, prehistoric and therefore no more slow-witted than the
average reader, explores the wonders of ``The Digital Domain,''
which include the digital thermometer, the fax machine, the swipe
card, the bar code, the CD, e-mail, the cash dispenser, the flight
simulator, and the supermarket checkout and inventory system.
``Tools: Making Things Around the World'' by Hubert Comte (Abrams,
$75) is a less individual and original book, but it makes a nice
complement, using photographs, paintings, and text to show some of
the implements people have devised throughout history to make their
jobs easier _ or even possible. Here you can see how a barrel is
made, or examine a Tibetan knife, the small, utilitarian blade
attached to a totemic tiger's tooth.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Tabori &AMP; Chang has reprinted Thomas Bulfinch's
pioneering collection of Greek and Roman myths from 1855 as ``The
Illustrated Age of Fable,'' with 100 ``illustrations'' of the
mythological stories drawn from the works of Michelangelo,
Botticelli, Titian, Rubens, and others down through the
pre-Raphaelites ($40). The reproductions are unfortunately
sometimes too small for mythic detail to register.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Folk: Classic Tales Retold'' by Charles Sullivan,
with watercolor illustrations by Warren Infield (Abrams, $39.95),
collects 60 folk tales from various regions of our country and
periods of our history. Some are invented, some are embroidered on
historical figures and incidents, on good guys (and gals) like Davy
Crockett, Paul Bunyan, Pocahontas, and the unsinkable Molly Brown,
or on bad guys like Billy the Kid and Jesse James, along with Rip
van Winkle, Johnny Appleseed, and Br'er Rabbit and Br'er Fox. It's
nice to have all these stories in one place, but Sullivan is more
inhibited by political correctness than any authentic folklorist
would be, and he provides no survey of his sources.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Bill created his own myth, and much of the myth of the
Wild West. ``Buffalo Bill's Wild West: An American Legend'' by R.
L. Wilson with Greg Martin (Random House, $60), entertainingly
shows us how he did it, with many illustrations drawn from the
Michael Del Castello Collection of the American West. Annie Oakley
gets her own chapter, and there is a photograph of her shooting an
apple off the head of her fearless English setter Dave.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, two kids from Cleveland, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster,
created one of the most popular modern American myths. Superman's
exploits have earned him a splendid new illustrated history by Les
Daniels, ``The Life and Times of the Man of Steel'' (Chronicle
Books, $29.95). This includes many reproductions of rare comic
books, and Daniels tells the story of the many metamorphoses of the
caped and almost-invincible hero with a light touch, always
remembering what is worth taking seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Marco Tosa's ``Barbie: Four Decades of Fashion, Fantasy and
Fun'' (Abrams, $19.95) depicts the history of a doll introduced to
the marketplace in 1959 (when it sold for $3). Barbie has been best
known as a fashion model, but she has been a rock star, a
pediatrician, a scuba diver, a firefighter, a paleontologist, a
Rockette, and a baseball player. She has become more anatomically
correct, and her features have adapted themselves to different
cultural values, with particular success in Japan. Tosa is nothing
if not serious about his work, introducing chapters with quotes
from Emily Dickinson, H. P. Lovecraft, and Marilyn Monroe. One
wishes he thought this was amusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Versace: The Naked &AMP; the Dressed'' (Random House, $50)
presents 20 years of the extravagant photographs Richard Avedon
took to promote the extravagant collections of designer Gianni
Versace. ``This is a glimpse of the impassioned, shameless,
opulent, titillating sewmanship of that daredevil magician of art
and artifice who was and will always be Gianni Versace,'' read the
few lines of text. Rock and pop stars mingle with the models, and
nothing is more alarming than the cover photograph of Elton John
throwing a bejeweled punch in high heels and an off-the shoulder
beaded black gown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confessions of a Window Dresser: Tales from a Life in
Fashion'' (Penguin Studio and Callaway Editions, $40) by Simon
Doonan, ``the Mercedes of window dressing,'' is a volume that
touches on real issues without taking itself too seriously. The
author describes his book as ``a celebration of my alternative
sensibility and validation for everyone who feels dissed by moral
majority norms,'' which are not often represented in his windows
for Barney's in New York. A papier-mache Jesse Helms adorned with
Santa Claus hat sat in a post-nuclear junkyard with a book of
Robert Mapplethorpe's opened on his lap; his reindeer were named
Homophobia, Racism, and Bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   In the field of history, two books stand out. Susan Watkins's
``The Public and Private Worlds of Elizabeth I'' (Thames and
Hudson, $40) treats a familiar, perpetually popular subject in a
fresh way by approaching it through the visual record left by
Elizabeth's world _ not simply portraits of the monarch but of her
homes, her collections, her possessions (her riding boots, her
saddle, her gloves); impersonal historic grandeur becomes immediate
and intimate here. ``Nicholas &AMP; Alexandra: The Last Imperial Family
of Tsarist Russia'' ($75) is the illustrated catalog of an
exhibition organized by the Hermitage Museum and the State Archive
of the Russian Federation that documents the life of the doomed
czar and his family in gorgeous and sometimes heartbreaking visual
detail; the book is better than the movie.

CHILDREN: THE ULTIMATE `LEARNING SYSTEM' 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Here's all you need to know about Microsoft: The
company calls its line of high-tech toys ``learning systems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Go to your room and interact with your learning systems.'' It
doesn't sound right, unless you're talking to Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   At FAO Schwarz, 18-month-old Connor Patrick Kelly toddled up to
two of Microsoft's $109.95 Actimates learning systems, the
Interactive Barney and the Interactive Arthur. He pointed at each
and said ``Arthur'' and ``Barney'' for the benefit of his mother,
Berni Kelly of Turlock, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Connor then pressed a sample button under an Arthur doll (a PBS
aardvark with glasses that bears a resemblance to Gates). Arthur
said, ``Hey, let's say the alphabet backwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur is aimed at kids between 4 and 8, but it also could be a
great learning system for adults who get pulled over by the police
and need backwards alphabet skills.
</P>
<P>
   As Connor pushed other buttons, Arthur kept suggesting memory
and self-esteem exercises. The furry little Windows-compatible
peripheral tried to make stilted conversation about arithmetic and
spelling with preprogrammed phrases from its 512 kilobyte memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me wonder how we survived childhood,'' said Connor's
grandmother, Betsy May. ``We always had to make both voices.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, our toys left a lot to the imagination, rather than being
programmed with exercises to teach ``creativity and imagination,''
like Arthur. They were toys, not ``learning systems'' or
``interactive'' stuffed animals like Furby ($34.99), Interactive
Winnie-the-Pooh ($109.95) or Real Live Babe ($39.95).
</P>
<P>
   The latter's box has a photo showing a girl patting Babe and a
boy operating the toy with a remote. What does that teach? I
thought that holding remotes was innate in males.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Vaughn of Gilbert, Ariz., was buying a $29.99 Sonic
Driver for a friend's 2-year-old. It's an ``interactive'' toy
steering wheel for a car seat. A kid can press buttons and it makes
the sounds of a siren, a horn and an engine turning over badly. It
also emits a few strange sentences like, ``Bye, bye, champion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep, it's made in China,'' said Vaughn, looking at the box.
She wanted one with a box in perfect condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two-year-olds love playing with things like this,'' she said,
``but they'll end up liking the box just as much.''
</P>
<P>
   This got me thinking how I can make millions and defeat Gates
and his fuzzy henchbots Arthur and Barney _ maybe even the highly
prized Furby with its idiotic language called Furbish, which sounds
like a phony preacher speaking in tongues.
</P>
<P>
   I'm putting out my own learning systems, a line of interactive
toys called NonRoboMorsimates, each one priced at 99 cents, plus
shipping and handling.
</P>
<P>
   First we have Boite for a Tot. It's a learning system to get a
child through the important developmental stages of, one, thinking
inside the box, two, thinking outside the box and, three,
destroying the box.
</P>
<P>
   It's made of rugged cardboard, and with no chatty animal inside
to disturb adults and bore children. It's a car. It's a house. It's
anything when interfaced with your child.
</P>
<P>
   Fuzzby the Interactive Sphere can provide hours of fun. It can
interact with walls, Golden Retrievers and any number of children.
It always bounces back, has a huggable fuzzy finish and comes in
two distinctive colors, Wilson white and Dunlop yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Interfaced with Fido the family dog, Fuzzby is reliably
downloaded at your child's feet, and magically gets wetter.
</P>
<P>
   Third, we have Interactive Pointy, the toy of the past and the
toy of the future. It teaches fine motor skills like whacking,
aiming and not poking eyes out.
</P>
<P>
   It grows on trees, but it's been selected by experts in child
development. Besides, my child's Pointy can beat your child's Furby
into plastic pulp.
</P>
<P>
   At FAO Schwarz, Adrienne Berlin, a psychiatric social worker
from La Jolla, Calif., was telling me about her 2-year-old Bryan.
He likes boxes and balls, but he also has a little Playskool
computer. In fact, when he wants to play with it he can say the
word ``computer.''
</P>
<P>
   The very first word he learned was ``agua,'' from his Mexican
nanny. ``He pronounced it `awa,''' Berlin said. ``Actually that's
phonetically correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that was an accident of child language, but it's no
accident Bryan is growing up bilingual. Understandably, his
favorite word is ``zapatos'' for shoes. He can code-switch between
Spanish and English, and when he goes to a store, he'll wave from
his seat in the shopping cart and say ``Hola'' to Latino shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   That's the true meaning of interactive, and Bryan already knows
more about cultures in California than any Microsoft
learning-systems designer suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how children learn, from their environment and from
exposure to languages and cultures,'' Berlin said. ``That's the
essence of it, to go where the child is going, not to say `Today
we're going to learn colors.'''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, children are the ultimate learning systems.

MEDIA BLITZES GIVE BIRTH TO SANTA'S HOTTEST TOYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DIANA WALSH  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Tickle Me Elmo and Furby didn't get to be toy
sensations purely by accident. As with many of the hit toys of
recent years, their star status was largely planned.
</P>
<P>
   While the craze for the once-popular Cabbage Patch dolls grew
gradually in the early 1980s, these days frenzies are carefully
cultivated by teams of publicists and marketing experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who stand in line and get in fistfights,''
said Diane Cardinale, assistant communications director for the Toy
Manufacturers Association, the national trade group for the toy
industry. ``They can say, `I have what 100,000 Americans want and
can't have.' And you know the silly thing is, after the holidays
nobody cares.''
</P>
<P>
   The birth of the ``it'' toy phenomenon can be traced to 1983,
when girls bombarded Santa Claus with requests for the homely
Cabbage Patch dolls _ orders that, for the first time, couldn't be
filled.
</P>
<P>
   Other generations had their fad toys _ Chatty Cathy, Hula Hoops
_ but nothing came close to the adoptable doll craze. In their
debut year, Cabbage Patch dolls raked in $60 million; just three
years later in 1986, they were earning $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   Not all popular toys have produced lines of lathered parents:
Trolls in 1992 were plentiful and cheap at $2 each; Super Soaker
water guns at $15 to $25 remain a year-round favorite.
</P>
<P>
   But the marketers' goal is always the same: create a must-have
craze. That job begins in February at the annual Toy Fair in New
York City, and continues through summer with freebies to the news
media, without which no craze can be born.
</P>
<P>
   Magazines print their lists of hot toys in early fall, stories
that were written way back in June. Newspapers and television
report the hot picks, and soon there's a shortage.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, Tyco Toys Inc. can thank talk show host Rosie
O'Donnell for Tickle Me Elmo. Hasbro Inc. can thank Wired Magazine
for Furby.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, O'Donnell was the proud mom of a recently adopted
child, and kept cute toys on her television studio desk to play
with between chats with guests. One day O'Donnell came out
chortling over a Tickle Me Elmo, and the rest is retail history.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell proclaimed Elmo the cutest toy she had seen. ``Adults
just fell in love with it,'' said Gene Gilligan, executive editor
of Playthings Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Cartier jewelers began offering a Tickle Me Elmo free with the
purchase of a $1 million diamond necklace and bracelet set, and
mobster son John Gotti Jr. was tracked on a late-night shopping
spree to buy _ you guessed it _ Tickle Me Elmo. Each fuss became a
national story, creating more demand.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Furby got off to a slow start until Wired magazine,
a must-read for the on-line computer culture, in September declared
it the hot toy of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Plush and gremlin-like on the outside, inside the 5-inch stuffed
animal a computer chip programs it to snore, giggle, ask for food
and burp, among other skills.
</P>
<P>
   The Wired article greased the way for Furby's national debut on
NBC's ``Today Show'' on Oct. 2, live in front of New York's famed
FAO Schwarz toy store.
</P>
<P>
   Publicists and show producers left nothing to chance, said Joan
Verdon, a columnist for the Bergan County (N.J.) Record, who
attended the event. They brought in 50 kids from nearby Public
School 59, and coached them on just the right smiles, just the
right way to wave their arms. ``OK kids, listen up. We're going to
practice again,'' Verdon recalls a production assistant saying,
``because that was pretty good but it wasn't really, really
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The columnist overheard one kid tipping another: ``If you don't
smile and jump around a lot, you won't get on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   The hype worked instantly. When the show began, three people
waited in line for FAO Schwarz to open. Within an hour, 200 more
people had joined the queue. Many confessed to Verdon that they had
no idea what the electronic animatronic was, but if it was hot,
they had to buy one for their daughter or nephew.
</P>
<P>
   Now, three weeks before Christmas, Furbys are so scarce that FAO
Schwarz keeps a waiting list and one Toys R Us manager in San
Francisco said each new case sells out within 15 minutes of hitting
the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Already, manufacturers and publicists are working on next year's
hit toy. Guessing in advance which toy is going to be a hit is like
trying to win the lottery, said Scott Krugman, spokesman for the
National Retail Federation in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   After all, some 5,000 new toys are launched each year. So the
experts can't offer many tips from the lessons of Tickle Me Elmo or
Furby.
</P>
<P>
   Except this: ``If it's on the `Today Show,' stock up,'' Krugman
said, laughing. ``If we learned anything, it must be that.''

   (EDs: With SHOPPER-TIPS)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As the holiday shopping season heats up, things
get a little surreal for personal shopper Jane Matsui. An emergency
phone call for a black bow tie comes on the heels of an incoming
fax requesting 10 manicure sets. She quickly adds these items to
today's shopping list, which already includes a gold bustier, size
8 slacks and underwear for a mother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Part shopper, part image consultant, part gofer, part therapist,
Matsui shops for people who have more money than time. An anxious
client recently left a message explaining that her husband had just
asked her what she wanted for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ```So could you call and tell me what I should want?''' the
client asked Matsui.
</P>
<P>
   Matsui, 47, has built a career out of helping the have-alls
figure out what they want. She grooms their tastes, throws herself
in front of oncoming fashion disasters and provides a refuge from
the hectic shopping world by offering a form of retail therapy.
</P>
<P>
   One of her clients calls it ``Jane Time.'' It costs a $130 an
hour _ not far off the mark for traditional psychotherapy _ and
that doesn't include the cost of purchases.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent shopping excursion in downtown San Francisco, Matsui
has her mission clearly defined along with the order of attack.
</P>
<P>
   The gold bustier must match her client's pale blue satin Bill
Blass jacket (the one with Oriental embroidery). There are a few
returns to make, along with several Christmas gifts to pick out for
another client. And the bow tie call came just before she left her
office in Union Square.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a neat, gray trouser suit and sensible black oxfords,
Matsui trots off to Macy's to return six of nine watches she had
picked out for a client.
</P>
<P>
   Returning items with a professional is very different than what
most of us experience. No receipts, no credit cards, no hassle. She
just hands the bag back to a personal shopping assistant at Macy's
By Appointment, who appears to know her well.
</P>
<P>
   Matsui explains that it is so easy because she takes merchandise
out of the store ``on memo,'' meaning the store will let her walk
out with items and return whatever the client rejects. Whatever is
purchased will be charged to the client's credit card account.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll walk in and say I need six sable coats and they'll say
OK,'' she said, still amazed at the level of trust.
</P>
<P>
   Neiman Marcus is like a second home to Matsui; she worked there
as an in-house personal shopper for about five years before
starting her own business three years ago. There, she has her own
dressing room in the personal shopping area and ventures into stock
areas off limits to the public.
</P>
<P>
   This morning's fax order was for a unisex manicure kit a client
saw in Neiman's catalog. The 10 sets (at $75 a pop) were waiting
for Matsui.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are these all takes?,'' asks an assistant at Neiman's, using
personal shopping lingo to ask whether Matsui's client will
purchase the items. ``All takes,'' Matsui confirms.
</P>
<P>
   The next mission: underwear for a client's 80-year-old
mother-in-law. Matsui has known the client for about 10 years and
describes her as a self-employed French history scholar.
</P>
<P>
   Matsui has about 30 clients in the San Francisco Bay area and
has no plans to take on any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship between a personal shopper and a client is so
intimate _ it's the closest thing to being married,'' she said,
adding that she probably knows every item in her clients' closets.
``Most of my clients are petrified to go into a store without me.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Matsui is clearly protective of her clients' privacy, but said
they are predominantly women. Some have drivers, cooks or nannies;
other clients are busy professional women who don't have time to
shop.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't usually charge for what she calls ``pull time'' _
time spent perusing the racks, choosing merchandise her clients
requested or that Matsui thinks they might like. She only charges
for the time she spends with clients while they try on and select
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   She meets individually with her clients, either at their homes
or in rooms set aside in the personal shopping sections available
in department stores such as Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue and
Macy's. There, the clients can try on selected clothes without
having to weed through stacks of merchandise with the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Since department stores provide personal shopping services for
free, Matsui relies on her clients' loyalty and the advantage of
not being tied to one particular store's merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of her work involves convincing people not to buy the
wrong thing. And when she knows something isn't right, Matsui
doesn't sugarcoat the news: ``I say, `That looks dreadful.'''
</P>
<P>
   In Neiman's lingerie section, before she reaches the
mother-in-law underwear, Matsui's eye catches Italian art-inspired
nightgowns by Mary Jo Bruno, which may be perfect for the teen-age
daughter of another client. Matsui throws them over her arm.
</P>
<P>
   Then she spies a slinky black negligee by the same designer
lined with marabou, feathers from a large African stork.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want this,'' she said, pulling the last one in the size she
needs right off the mannequin. (She took time to redress it _
``It's rude to leave them naked.'')
</P>
<P>
   Back to the mother-in-law underwear. ``Marabou won't do. She's
80,'' Matsui said as she selected a handful of Hanro high-rise
briefs for $24 a pair.
</P>
<P>
   The same client wants to buy a pair of slacks as a Christmas
gift for her friend. Matsui selected a few matching sweaters to
create an ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a head for miscellaneous, stupid details for
this job,'' Matsui explained. ``I can't remember anything that is
important or life threatening because my head is full of stuff like
this person's friend is a size 8.''
</P>
<P>
   When Matsui combs the racks, she appears to go into a sort of
shopping trance. Normally gregarious, she becomes quiet as she
scans the selections, caresses the fabrics, ponders and dismisses
items before returning to her fitting room to store the
merchandise. She's fast, moving from department to department with
determination.
</P>
<P>
   Retail runs in Matsui's veins. Originally from Boston, her
family owned a now-defunct women's and children's clothing store in
Massachusetts and later in Los Angeles, where she remembers playing
as a child and making announcements about specials over the
loudspeaker.
</P>
<P>
   She was an elementary school teacher for seven years before
realizing that retail was her calling. She ran an accessories
boutique for nine years in Santa Barbara, Calif., and later,
between stints at Neiman's, a clothing store in Burlingame, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, she doesn't like shopping for herself. Accepting that her
job requires her to be a fashion ambassador of sorts, she shops
lower-priced stores for designer knock-offs. But Matsui does that
only out of necessity and as little as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want anything. The stuff I want, I make my clients
buy,'' she said.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Personal shopper Jane Matsui's rules of the
register:
</P>
<P>
   _ Make lists, and stick to them. Don't meander. Stick to the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rely only on yourself. It can be a waste of time to call a
store to ask whether a particular item is in stock. Sales people
are often so busy they don't have the time to check, or may say
anything to get you off the phone. Go there.
</P>
<P>
   _ While shopping, keep in mind a list of generic gift items.
This year, Matsui favors bath items in fancy packages, books,
gourmet foods, fun jewelry and hair accessories. They can come in
handy for last-minute and hostess gifts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Buy the best quality you can afford instead of going for
quantity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid logos on clothes _ let the companies do their own
advertising.

Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, Dec. 8:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CELLS (Undated) _ A look at human embryonic stem cells, the
cells that caused a furor when scientists said they could culture
and grow them in the lab, with all sorts of interesting potential
uses. By Nicholas Wade. (1600 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DENTISTRY (Undated) _ A combination of new technology and
new treatments _ laser beams that work on the hard enamel of teeth
and computerized x-rays _ are promising patients a freedom from
drilling, freedom from anesthesia and freedom from pain. The
treatments appear, in their initial stages, to be safer, more
accurate and faster than traditional methods. By Holcomb B. Noble.
(1300 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SPACE-STATION (Undated) _ Far above the earth, test pilots,
engineers and scientists have begun practicing the building trades
as they tackle the mammoth job of assembling an international space
station at a truly remote site. The space shuttle Endeavour,
launched Friday with a crew of six, began one of the most
challenging construction jobs in history on Sunday when it joined
the first two pieces of the station together while orbiting 240
miles above the Earth. By Warren E. Leary. (1350 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-JOURNALS (Undated) _ In recent years, scientific journals
have become big business, with large commercial publishers entering
a scene once dominated by nonprofit scientific societies whose only
goal was to disseminate scientific information. It is a change that
many academics say has sent prices skyrocketing _ with some
journals now costing libraries more than $15,000 a year. By Carol
Kaesuk Yoon. (1350 words)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   SCI-PREHISTORIC-MEDICINE (Undated) _ A traveler out of the past,
the Iceman whose mummified body was discovered in the Tyrolean Alps
in Northern Italy in 1991 has given archeologists and other
scientists a lifelike picture of what people wore and ate and
carried with them on treks into the Alps 5,300 years ago, at the
end of the Stone Age and beginning of the Copper Age in Europe. An
anthropologist reported last week that the Iceman is also providing
a rare glimpse of prehistoric medicine, including his apparent use
of a natural laxative and antibiotic. By John Noble Wilford. (800
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MALTHUS-POPULATION (Philadelphia) _ Two-hundred years ago
the Rev. Thomas Robert Malthus, an English economist and
mathematician, anonymously published an essay predicting that the
world's burgeoning human population would overwhelm the earth's
capacity to feed it. His gloomy forecast, called ``An Essay on the
Principle of Population as It Affects the Future Improvement of
Society,'' was condemned by Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and many
other theorists, and it was still striking sparks at a meeting of
the American Anthropological Society. Despite continuing
controversy, it was clear that Malthus's conjectures are far from
dead. By Malcolm Browne. (1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Science questions answered: Can cats get

usually disappear once patients leave the ICU confines. By Sandeep
Jauhar, M.D. (1065 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Personal Health: Treatments,
including a recently approved drug with relatively few side
effects, are available that can significantly reduce if not
eliminate the distress, discomfort and inconvenience associated
with an overactive bladder. By Jane E. Brody. (1385 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FITNESS-ABS (Undated) _ With abdominal training it appears
there is no middle ground. Exercisers are often confused about the
best way to strengthen and tone the midriff. And for good reason:
experts can't seem to agree either. Even the research isn't
definitive. By Liz Neporent. (800 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-OSTEOPOROSIS-MEN (Undated) _ New research is challenging the
medical textbook view of osteoporosis as a largely women's disease
linked to the singularly female experience of menopause. It now
seems that osteoporosis is more common in men than previously
thought and that, although men do not go through menopause, the
main cause of the degenerative bone disorder is the same in both
men and women: an age-related drop in estrogen. By Susan Gilbert.
(600 words)

   With graphic.

<P>
   SCI-SKIN-HERBS (Undated) _ A Westchester (N.Y.) County

with other medicines. By Nancy Beth Jackson. (800 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ Shorts on health and fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ Yawning, frowning, sneering and teeth picking are all weapons
in the battle of the sexes, or, to use their scientific name,
female nonverbal courtship rejection behaviors. According to a new
study, they work _ except with some real jerks or when the
lighting's too dim. (425 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Most lightning injuries occur in summer and the majority are
suffered by golfers, fishermen, hikers and others enjoying warm
weather sports. But according to a report the Lightning Data Center
in Denver, Colo., winter sports enthusiasts also are at risk,
albeit, a small one. (350 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Shoehorning exercise into the schedule by doing small amounts
several times a day improves fitness as much as a single daily
workout of the same total time, according to research in the last
few years. Now a new report says that the multiple-dose plan also
helps lower blood fats _ which are associated with heart disease _
as much as a one-shot session. (270 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare
Organizations has compiled statistics on major medical mishaps.
Leading the list is patient suicide, followed by medication errors.
(300 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SEX-HEALTH (Undated) _ Among sexually transmitted diseases,
syphilis, herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhea and HIV are probably the
best known. However, a report released last week shows that two
lesser known infections _ human papillomavirus and trichomoniasis _
actually account for two-thirds of new cases of the diseases. By
Linda Villarosa. (500 words)

ADVENT OFFERS ESCAPE FROM HOLIDAY COMMERCIALISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GINGER BRISTOW  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Nathan Ferretti, an agile 2-year-old, leans
across the dining table to touch the carved wooden cross on the
Advent wreath as his parents, Lisa and David, gather their five
children for their evening Advent celebration.
</P>
<P>
   No greens adorn the simple wooden wreath, but as Christmas gets
closer, a poinsettia will be added and a red candle will be placed
in the center.
</P>
<P>
   This is the sixth year the Schenectady family has made the
Advent candle lighting and reading of family prayers part of their
Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
   The three oldest children _ Zachary, 12, Amber, 9, and Jacob 6 _
take turns reading a scripture, then a short lesson or prayer. The
night that each child reads, he or she lights the candle. On the
first Sunday of Advent, they light one purple candle, then add one
each Sunday until Christmas. The wreath of three purple candles and
a pink one focuses the family, they say, on a spiritual Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   With stuffed Santas and twinkling bulbs on store shelves by
October, the commercial Christmas season gets started earlier each
year. But some families and churches are returning to the
traditional Advent season as a time of preparation for Christmas,
and the start of a sacred season beyond the glare of the holiday's
flashier lights.
</P>
<P>
   For people busy car pooling, shopping, working and preparing for
Christmas Day, the growing custom of celebrating Advent seems to
offer an avenue of tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of our church members are aware of the need to do
something this season rather than just shop and drop,'' said the
Rev. Linda Ruby of the First Presbyterian Church in Ballston Spa.
</P>
<P>
   Advent is the period including the four Sundays just before
Christmas. At the Ballson Spa church, members started on a journey
to Christmas called, ``How to transform trivial pursuits into
meaningful celebrations.''
</P>
<P>
   The sermon each week from now until Christmas will be on this
theme, with parishioners encouraged to continue this spiritual
journey throughout the week in their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, a commercial component to the spiritual
reflection: Advent candles, wreaths, books and calendars are
available at bookstores and other outlets. There is also the
potential of a subtler trap in allowing the candles and Advent
wreaths themselves to become a focus of the celebration, cautioned
Sister Pat Mood, program director at the Dominican Spiritual Life
Center here.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sister Pat, quiet reflection is important for
spiritual peace at this time of year. The meaning of ``Advent'' is
waiting _ for the birth of Christ _ and she sees morning prayer and
just being as the focal point of her pre-Christmas days. In the
early morning while it is still dark, she lights a single candle,
spends a few minutes sipping a cup of coffee, just being. This
helps her focus on the reason for the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Ferretti family received its meditation and prayer book from
St. Paul the Apostle Church in Schenectady, as part of the parish's
Advent celebration, to encourage families to focus on this season
of waiting. The parish also lights the candles weekly, culminating
in a celebration on Christmas Day, when only one white candle is
lighted, symbolizing the birth of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   The family has taken the church tradition into its home, adding
special touches to make it unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children now insist that we leave the candle burning all
through the meal,'' said Lisa, who is excited that her children are
involved in this quiet evening time in their home. ``Benjamin, our
4-year-old, and Nathan, are allowed to put the candle out at the
end of the meal with a small candle snifter with an angel on top.''
</P>
<P>
   Christmas Eve, at the evening meal, the children and parents
will have a birthday cake and sing ``Happy Birthday to Jesus.''
Lisa said many parishioners of St. Paul the Apostle follow some
type of similar celebration during the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at this as a time for deepening our faith with God.''

ROSEMARY TOPIARY REQUIRES SUNLIGHT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I bought an expensive rosemary shaped like a Christmas tree.
How can I keep it alive?
</P>
<P>
   A: During the holidays, rosemary topiaries are popular miniature
Christmas trees. They're available at numerous nurseries. These
topiaries can be displayed at the front door or used indoors as
centerpieces, by stairways or in kitchen windows. Simply snip to
keep the conical shape, and use trimmings in holiday dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Indoors, place rosemary in a bright area. This herb likes
sunlight. Keep the soil on the moist side, but do not over-water.
Do not allow the soil to become so dry the plant wilts, either.
Avoid heating vents, as the warm air will dry the plant. Place the
plant outdoors for fresh air when possible. After the holidays,
find a place in the garden or on the patio for your rosemary.
</P>
<P>
   If you use the topiary outdoors from the start, give it sunlight
if possible, but some shade is acceptable. Follow the same watering
program. Rosemaries demand excellent drainage. They are best in a
more alkaline soil.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary, the herb of remembrance, friendship and love, is
steeped in myth, magic and medicinal use. Like the poinsettia, this
Mediterranean native carries religious significance during the
holiday season. One story originated in Spain. As the tale goes,
rosemary flowers were once white. When the holy family fled to
Egypt, the Virgin Mary spread her cloak over a rosemary bush and
hid behind it as soldiers passed. When she removed her cloak, the
rosemary flowers had turned blue. The herb is used in flavoring
meat, fish, potatoes, egg dishes, salads, vinegars and other foods.
Rosemary also is used in hair rinses, in baths to encourage better
blood circulation, in insect repellant and in potpourris. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to grow climbing roses. What are the best three
varieties? When is the best time to plant?
</P>
<P>
   A: Each gardener who grows roses will likely give you a
different ``three best'' list, so I'll give you the names I most
often hear as reliable favorites:
</P>
<P>
   _ `Blaze,' c. 1932, popular ever-blooming red climber.
</P>
<P>
   _ `Climbing Cecile Brunner,' c. 1881, heavy spring and fall
pink, fragrant flower.
</P>
<P>
   _ `Don Juan,' c. 1958, large, fragrant, dark-red repeat blooms.
</P>
<P>
   _ `Dortmund,' c. 1955, crimson single blooms with white center
and yellow stamens. Cut spent flowers to encourage reblooming.
</P>
<P>
   _ `Lady Banks' Rose,' c. 1807, double yellow spring blooms.
Rarer white form.
</P>
<P>
   `` `LaMarque,' circa 1830, an ever-blooming climber with white
flowers with yellow centers, bears the blooms in fragrant clusters.
</P>

   Q: I am planning a tropical garden in a courtyard. I would like
to include bamboo as a background accent, but I've heard that it
can be extremely aggressive. Is there a way to contain bamboo?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are clumping and running bamboos, and some maintain the
clumping types are less aggressive than the running types, which
send underground stems to various distances from the mother before
the vertical shoots appear. Clumping bamboos produce rhizomes that
grow only a short distance from the mother plant before sending up
shoots.
</P>
<P>
   Bamboo is the tallest member of the grass family. There are
about 100 bamboo genera and more than 1,000 species. Water is a
natural barrier for running bamboos, as they dislike it. There are
80 millimeter plastic barriers, and some synthetic products are
chemically treated to divert roots. You can always cut new shoots
when they pop through the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Bamboos vary greatly in height, so you'll want to do a little
research before planting. Clumpers such as `Golden Goddess' mature
to only 10 feet in height while `Giant Timber' maxes out at 55
feet.  &QL;

CAMELLIA'S BLOOMS SO PERFECT THEY HARDLY LOOK REAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Given the interest in heirloom plants today, one
aristocrat of the Southern garden should not get lost in the
shuffle: the camellia.
</P>
<P>
   Large, handsome evergreens with blooms so perfect they hardly
look real, camellias have long been the calling cards in South
Carolina gardens. Camellia ``allees'' on Georgia plantations fill
winter with bloom. Alabama tapped the camellia as its state flower.
Louisiana, too, has reason to be proud of its camellia heritage.
</P>
<P>
   All along the southeast Gulf Coast, camellias thrive in
well-draining, acidic soil, abundant rainfall and high humidity.
</P>
<P>
   East of the Sabine River, one may joke, there's a camellia in
every yard. But, camellias in Texas? You bet.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have done their horticultural history say camellias
were actually in Houston before the 1900s. Thanks largely to the
River Oaks Garden Club's annual Azalea Trail, the plants gained
significant attention in the 1930s. Camellias are still grown at
one perennial trail highlight, Bayou Bend, the 14-acre estate on
the banks of Buffalo Bayou. Camellias seem to like gardens along
the waterway, where the earth is more acidic and better draining
than in those gardens with heavy gumbo for soil.
</P>
<P>
   But those with gumbo can get around that by growing camellias in
raised beds or containers of highly organic, acidic, well-draining
soil.
</P>
<P>
   Greg and Rosamay Davis have more than 200 camellias, in the
ground and in containers, at their southwest Houston home. The
couple, longtime members of the Houston Camellia Society, have been
accumulating camellia know-how for about 30 years. Greg Davis is
the chapter's president.
</P>
<P>
   Camellias are members of the tea family; in fact, commercial tea
comes from the leaves of ``Camellia sinensis,'' a plant that will
reach 30 feet in height.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 250 species in the Camellia genus, Greg
Davis says, but for the most part, ``Camellia japonica,'' which
flowers late fall/early winter into spring, depending on the
variety, and the fall-flowering ``C. sasanqua'' are the two species
most easily grown here. ``C. reticulata'' and hybrids also may be
found here, especially in the enthusiast's garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``C. japonica'' is a large species and is considered the
``traditional'' or ``common'' camellia. The shrubs are dense with
foliage and therefore ideal as specimen plants, in the garden or in
large containers. Gardeners like japonicas because they have large,
showy blooms. Old shrubs in some areas may tower to 20 feet, but
many here are in the 6- to 10-foot range.
</P>
<P>
   The sasanquas, on the other hand, have smaller foliage and
flowers that are attractive but not that suitable for cutting as
they quickly shatter. The shrubs, however, make handsome hedges or
background plants, and they can be espaliered on a fence or wall.
This species is more cold-hardy than the japonicas, and grafted
camellias are often grown on sasanqua root stock. Mature height is
approximately 14 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Camellia nomenclature includes thousands of varieties. Blooms
vary in form, and the flowers may be single, semidouble, anemone
form, peony form, rose form double or formal double.
</P>
<P>
   Camellias also vary in size and are classified as miniature when
blooms are 2 1/2 inches or less, small when 2 1/2 to 3 inches,
medium if 3 to 4 inches, large if 4 to 5 inches and very large if
more than 5 inches in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   The largest, Davis says, are reticulatas in the 7-inch range.
But this species can be testy here, since these camellias like cool
nights and dislike humid, 90-degree days. San Francisco, he says,
is the place for reticulatas. Gardeners here do best sticking to
japonicas and sasanquas. Besides, the rewards of growing these two
species is great enough.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Vietnam War, Davis says, China has released a yellow
camellia. But the home gardener will find camellias in the
white-to-red color range, and there are a number of variegated
varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Davis recommends a raised bed of equal parts topsoil, sand and
pine bark to help ensure good camellia health and growth. A
slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5-7 is important. Garden centers
sell soil meters that read alkalinity/acidity. Build the raised
beds right on top of the gumbo. Get them up 8 to 12 inches. This
will hold you for about five years, he says. By then the pine bark,
if not replenished, will have disappeared. This organic matter is
important as it boosts soil porosity, crucial to camellia health,
as well as acidity as the pine bark breaks down.
</P>
<P>
   Camellias grow well in containers, too.
</P>
<P>
   Camellias need a moist but not soggy soil. City water is
alkaline, and when used on camellias, it often becomes necessary to
counteract the alkalinity by adding agricultural sulfur or a
quicker-acting chemical such as iron sulfate to acidify the soil.
Yellow, chlorotic foliage is a symptom of a too-alkaline soil.
Yellow leaves also can be a sign of poor drainage or too much sun.
</P>
<P>
   November to March is the ideal time to plant camellias. It's a
good idea to buy camellias at this time, while they are in bloom,
to be sure of color and flower form. The Houston Camellia Society
recommends that newcomers stick with proven varieties, selecting
healthy, vigorous plants _ 2-year-old grafts or 2-year-old plants
grown on their own roots. Look for clean, dark green foliage on
well-shaped, dense shrubs.
</P>
<P>
   A well-draining spot that receives morning sun and some filtered
shade is ideal. Pine trees create an excellent environment for
camellias. It's best to protect the plants from cold winds and hot
afternoon sun.
</P>
<P>
   Planting depth is crucial, too. Do not plant too deep. The roots
need a lot of air, and the crown should be at least a couple of
inches above ground level, Davis says. Mulch with pine needles,
pine bark or shredded oak leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Camellias are slow growers and therefore do not require heavy
fertilization. Rosamay Davis emphasizes the importance of not
overfertilizing. Do not fertilize the first year after planting.
Fertilization schedules then vary from gardener to gardener, and
those who grow to show may fertilize until August or September. But
for the general gardener, the Houston Camellia Society suggests
using a commercial camellia fertilizer after flowering and again
around mid-May. A light application of cottonseed meal, a
slow-release organic nitrogen fertilizer, is helpful in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   Prune camellias after flowering.
</P>
<P>
   Proper culture will help keep camellias healthy, but pests can
attack. Scale, the white or brown insects found on foliage
undersides or stems, where they deplete plant juices, may be
controlled with oil sprays. Ask your nurseryman about products. The
Davises keep a clean garden to discourage outbreaks of petal
blight, immediately removing any fallen blooms. &QL;

THESE CENTERPIECE IDEAS DON'T ADD TO HOLIDAY STRESS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MADELEINE McDERMOTT HAMM 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Centerpiece. Just the word sounds so intimidating, so
grand.
</P>
<P>
   But the dictionary puts a manageable handle on it: an ornament,
bowl of flowers, etc. for the center of a table. It's as if Webster
is saying, ``Don't be afraid. You can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the message from designer Debbie Mumm, whose line of
Mummford holiday products is available in Mervyn's California
stores nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all stressed during the holidays,'' Mumm said during a
visit to Houston. ``That's why I have come up with some simple and
inexpensive holiday centerpieces that can make anyone look like a
decorating expert. They don't cost a lot of money or take much
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of Mumm's easy centerpiece ideas you can borrow or
incorporate into your own creations. Some feature Christmas themes,
while others just reflect the season of goodwill and abundance:
</P>
<P>
   _ Table of Plenty: Dry rolls and breads from the bakery for
about four days, then spray them with a varnish finish. Line a
large wooden bowl or basket with a cloth or napkins and fill with
the bread. Add apples, tangerines, gourds, nuts, cinnamon sticks,
autumn leaves or whatever goodies you can find. For a more elegant
look, spray the autumn leaves with gold metallic paint.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kids' Table: To make certain the children feel included in the
holiday dinner, set their own table with a theme tree and table
favors using their favorite collections. For the tree, adorn a
small artificial tree with items such as stuffed animals, baseball
cards, etc. Add candy canes and tinsel. For table favors, buy a few
more stuffed animals, cards or whatever is on the tree, wrap them
in cellophane or colorful paper, and tie with a ribbon and candy
cane.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cedar Bouquet: Collect mixed fresh greenery in the yard or at
a nursery. Mix red carnations, fresh cut poinsettias or even red
roses with the greenery in a water-filled vase for a simple but
festive look. Set the arrangement on a holiday napkin or cloth and
ring it with votive candles. You might want to spread a little more
greenery and holiday potpourri around the candles.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful to keep potpourri off the wood dining table top, as
it will damage the finish.
</P>
<P>
   And from decorative arts designer Louis Nichole comes the Handy
Dandy Decorator, a patented series of four clever wire style forms
for creating lavish centerpieces like the pros turn out.
</P>
<P>
   Put the wire form in a bowl or basket and fill it in with fresh
or dried fruits, vegetables, flowers, greenery, stems and vines.
The forms can be reused every season. For the holidays, try apples,
pine cones, holly and berries in a clay pot painted gold. In the
spring, imagine fresh plums arranged with dried hydrangeas and
gold-painted leaves, arranged in an antique urn.
</P>
<P>
   The Handy Dandy Decorator forms series includes a topiary, a
wreath, an oblong centerpiece with candles and a set of two mini
candelabra. The wire forms, which range from $19.99 to $24.99 and
come with instructions, can be ordered by calling (toll free)
877-289-5684. &QL;

TAPES SHOW JFK QUESTIONING NIXON'S MENTAL STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHRISTOPHER MATTHEWS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a taped 1962 telephone conversation between
then-California Gov. Edmund G. ``Pat'' Brown and President John F.
Kennedy, the two discussed the mental stability of Richard Nixon,
the man they had both defeated in back-to-back elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``You reduced him to the nut house,'' the 35th president said of
Nixon, the man who would be the 37th. ``That last farewell speech
of his ... it shows that he belongs on the couch.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Kennedy's reaction to Nixon's infamous ``last press
conference,'' during which he declared, ``You won't have Nixon to
kick around anymore.'' The former vice president gave the speech
the morning after his 300,000-vote loss to Brown in the 1962
California governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   The JFK-Brown conversation about that outburst was among the
tapes released late last month by the John F. Kennedy Library in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Not knowing he was being recorded by the president, Brown
responded to Kennedy's comment about Nixon being driven ``nuts'' by
saying that humiliating his opponent was exactly what Kennedy had
wanted Brown to do: ``But you gave me instructions, and I follow
your orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy took great pleasure in Brown's victory, JFK's White
House press secretary, Pierre Salinger, recalled Friday. ``I
remember a lot of excitement at the White House that Nixon had lost
that election,'' said Salinger, who was later appointed to a
vacancy in the U.S. Senate by Brown.
</P>
<P>
   When Kennedy asked Brown in the taped conversation what he
thought would be Nixon's political future in California, the
governor said that the former vice president's ``terrible''
performance of that morning had doomed him in the state. ``I don't
see how he can ever recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Nixon carried California in his successful bid
for the White House against Hubert H. Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very peculiar fellow,'' Brown continued. ``This is a
very peculiar man. I really think that he is psycho. He's an able
man, but he's nuts!''
</P>
<P>
   Brown went on to say that the man he had just beaten was ``like
a lot of these paranoids.''
</P>
<P>
   After discussing a possible Kennedy trip to California, Brown
asked the president to say hello to his son, Jerry, who had
returned from Yale Law School to help his father's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll take California by 10 times as much as you did
before,'' said the younger Brown, when the phone was passed to him.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that Kennedy had lost California to Nixon in 1960,
Jerry Brown, then just 24, said he meant to say that Kennedy would
do much better in '64.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to the tape of himself, his father and JFK
talking 36 years ago, Jerry Brown, the mayor-elect of Oakland, said
last week that he has never forgotten that phone call. He added
that no one since has matched Kennedy's force of personality, his
``charisma.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon lost the 1960 presidential election to Kennedy 34,226,731
to 34,108,157 votes _ though the margin was wider in the Electoral
College.
</P>
<P>
   According to his last White House chief of staff, Gen. Alexander
Haig, Nixon ``believed until the day he died that Kennedy had
stolen the election.''
</P>
<P>
   That Wednesday in November 1962, the day of his speech, Nixon
was harboring two reasons for bitterness: his resentment of the
news media, which he believed had taken a dislike to him because he
accused Alger Hiss, an aide to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, of
being a communist agent in 1948, and his never-ending feud with the
Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that all the members of the press are so delighted that I
lost,'' a red-eyed Nixon said at the opening of the news conference
the morning after his 1962 defeat. ``And as I leave the press, all
I can say is this: For 16 years, ever since the Hiss case, you've
had a lot of fun _ a lot of fun _ that you've had an opportunity to
attack me, and I think I've given as good as I've taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``One last thing. What are my plans? Well, my plans are to go
home. I'm going to get acquainted with my family again. And my
plans, incidentally, are, from a political viewpoint, of course, to
take a holiday. It will be a long holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I leave you gentleman now, and you will now write it. You will
interpret it. That's your right. But as I leave you I want you to
know _ just think how much you're going to be missing me. You won't
have Nixon to kick around anymore, because, gentlemen, this is my
last press conference.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The more extensive, and more notorious tapes made by Nixon
during his presidency, now at the National Archives, show the
extent to which he blamed the Kennedys for his defeat, not just for
the presidency in 1960, but also for the governorship in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon believed Kennedy and his brother, Robert, the attorney
general at the time, had used files from the Internal Revenue
Service to leak the fact that Nixon had signed a ``restrictive
covenant'' _ one that banned resale to blacks or Jews _ when buying
his house in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you remember when the Kennedys ordered them to go after me
and that goddamned house I bought? Huh?'' he demanded of his chief
of staff, Bob Haldeman, in a conversation recorded in May 1971.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, Nixon was still angry about the Kennedys' role in
his California defeat. ``Look in '62, best test we ever had. How'd
I lose? They had access to every goddamned thing you could
imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   It was at this point, a year before the Watergate bugging and
break-in, that Nixon ordered his all-out campaign of snooping and
surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't be on and off. I mean, that's something we can
afford. Maybe we can get a scandal on any, any one of the leading
Democrats.''

CONNECTICUT COMMISSIONER HOLDS THE LINE AGAINST ATM FEES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ John P. Burke is an unlikely hero in the
long-shot campaign against banks that seek to impose automated
teller machine surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   Burke is the banking commissioner in Connecticut, part of a
Republican administration that prides itself on being friendly to
business. (Just ask Robert Kraft and the Patriots.) Prior to taking
the commissioner's post four years ago, Burke was a banker for 30
years, and his philosophy hasn't changed much. He still opposes
government meddling in marketplace decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet almost singlehandedly Burke has prevented Fleet Financial
Group, First Union and BankBoston from imposing a surcharge on
noncustomers who use their ATMs in Connecticut. The fees would
bring in an estimated $1.5 million a year to the three banks, which
together own 60 percent of the state's ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Iowa, where lawmakers passed a bill barring
surcharges, Connecticut is the only state in the nation where the
fees are not allowed. (However, banks in Connecticut as elsewhere
can charge their own customers when they use another bank's ATM.)
Surcharges spread throughout Massachusetts several months ago after
House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran refused to let a ban come up for a
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a major crusade on my part,'' said Burke. ``My job
is not to be a crusader, but to enforce the law.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no law on ATM surcharges in Connecticut. And that,
according to Burke, is why he ruled in 1995 that surcharging was
not allowed. ``If it doesn't say you can do it, you can't do it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet has been battling Burke ever since, in and out of court.
The bank got his ruling overturned in federal court in September
and started imposing a $1 surcharge Oct. 23. But on Nov. 9 the
federal court's decision was set aside by an appeals court, which
held that the issue belonged in state court.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet is now back in federal court accusing Burke and the state
of Connecticut of violating its civil rights. The bank is also
trying to get Burke's order to cease and desist surcharging
revoked, saying it would be irreparably harmed if it is unable to
collect $15,000 a day from noncustomers who use its machines.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Shepker, a Fleet spokesman, said Burke's interpretation of
the law is wrong. He said banks need surcharge revenue to avoid
losing money on their ATM networks. The fact that state law doesn't
mention surcharging means it is not prohibited, he said. ``We
believe we're on very, very solid ground,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet so far has not attempted to win passage of a law allowing
surcharging. Surcharge opponents, meanwhile, have failed to get a
surcharge ban passed.
</P>
<P>
   As in Connecticut, the statutes in Massachusetts dealing with
ATMs don't address the surcharge issue. Thomas J. Curry, the
Massachusetts banking commissioner, has not attempted to use that
omission to ban the fees administratively, even though his boss,
Governor Paul Cellucci, opposes them. Curry's spokesman said
legislative action is necessary because state law is too vague on
the fee issue.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview in his office, Burke stressed that he was
not taking sides on the ATM-surcharge issue, merely interpreting
the law as his job requires. Yet his perspective on the issue,
given his banking background, was interesting.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he thinks the banks' argument that surcharges are
needed to avoid losing money is overblown. He said ATMs save banks
money on tellers and allow them to serve customers around the
clock. ``I think what they've discovered (with surcharges) is
another way to make money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burke, who banks at a small bank with no ATMs of its own,
recognizes he may not win in court, but he says his ruling will
have forestalled the fees for more than four years. ``Even if we
lose, I think the consumer has been helped,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Ruthauser of Cromwell, a lawyer who commutes to Hartford on
a daily basis, would agree with that. After withdrawing money from
a Fleet ATM downtown, he told us he hopes Burke prevails. ``The
banks are just looking for a windfall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A sticky problem
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of tiny but annoying problems, some readers have
been asking us why it seems every piece of fruit or vegetable in
the grocery store has a small sticker. They say removing each
sticker is tedious and they often end up scraping up some fruit or
vegetable peel in the process.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out these stickers, which contain PLU (Produce Look-Up)
codes, are part of voluntary industry standards adopted by produce
farmers in the early 1990s to help store cashiers.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Humfeld, vice president of the Produce Marketing
Association in Newark, Del., said grocery stores were complaining
that clerks were not ringing up the right prices. They might look
at a nectarine and ring up the price of a peach. Or a higher-priced
Royal Gala apple, for example, might be sold at the lower-price of
a Red Delicious apple.
</P>
<P>
   ``It enables the retailers to find an easy way to ring up the
proper price at check-out,'' Humfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   Humfeld said that in 1993, only about 10 percent of produce
distributers were using the PLU stickers, which contain a code that
marks the particular type of fruit or vegetable. As of this year,
57 percent of produce distributers use these stickers, and Humfeld
said he expects the sticker use to only expand.
</P>
<P>
   Every industry has its quirky problems, and produce distributers
apparently are always looking for better glues that will keep
stickers on produce at the store, but also allow for easy removal
once the produce is brought home.
</P>
<P>
   What if you accidently eat a sticker? It's obviously not meant
to be eaten, but Humfeld said stickers are designed to pose no
health hazard.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Odds &AMP; Ends
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --MCI minimum charges. MCI WorldCom, blaming the cost of
servicing customer accounts, is following AT&AMP;T's lead. Starting
next month, MCI plans to impose a minimum charge of $3 to $5 on all
residential customers, depending on their calling plans. That means
you pay $3 to $5 if you fail to make at least that much in long
distance calls in a given month. People who make few calls _ and
MCI says only 10 percent fall in this category _ oppose the minimum
charges, in part because the fees can trigger the imposition of
additional monthly government fees. Those fees can transform a $3
charge into a $4.31 charge.

LEADERS WILL GAUGE SOCIAL SECURITY TROUBLES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``The crisis is here, and it's very real,'' says
Economic Security 2000, a citizens group pushing to overhaul the
Social Security program. ``Social Security is going broke,'' says
the Cato Institute. ``The system is broken,'' says a group called
Third Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton and congressional leaders gather Tuesday
and Wednesday to discuss the financial health of Social Security,
one of the first issues they must decide is whether the problem is
really this bad. There is no question that the system needs more
money. But reasonable estimates range widely, from $3 trillion to a
devastating $10 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Is the nation's retirement program in crisis, or just hitting a
few bumps?
</P>
<P>
   The answer will bear directly on whether and how lawmakers
revamp the nation's most popular domestic program. If Americans
become convinced that Social Security is in crisis, they may be
more open to dramatic changes. Chief among them: allowing workers
to pay Social Security taxes to personal stock and bond accounts,
rather than to the government.
</P>
<P>
   But if the program is only a bit wobbly, the public might oppose
anything more than minor tinkering.
</P>
<P>
   That explains the ongoing battle over how to describe the
urgency of the problem. Groups that want to create private accounts
_ such as Economic Security 2000, the Cato Institute and Third
Millennium _ say Social Security is in dire straits. Members of all
three groups are among the 250 people invited to the first day of
the White House conference, and the director of Third Millennium
will be a featured speaker.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis school has some prominent economists on its side.
``Yes, it's a crisis,'' said Laurence Kotlikoff, a Boston
University economist who has written on the subject. ``When you're
talking about something that would take a 50 percent tax hike to
fix, it's a real crisis. . . . . It's a terrible problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a coordinated campaign, prominent left-of-center
activists have begun a counteroffensive to say the problems are
overstated. ``Social Security is in fact in remarkably good
shape,'' the Rev. Jesse Jackson asserted last week during the
kickoff of a group that aims to block any move to private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the cover of a fantasy funding crisis . . .
conservatives want to revise or even eliminate Social Security,''
said Patricia Ireland, president of NOW, who criticized the
``Chicken Little atmosphere'' surrounding the program.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters is that groups on all sides of the issue
fear that lawmakers will avoid making any changes to the
politically hypersensitive program unless the threat of a crisis
hangs over them. And almost everybody agrees that some type of
change is needed, or else Social Security will be unable to pay all
its promised benefits in about 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no short-term crisis,'' said Kenneth Apfel,
commissioner of the Social Security Administration. ``But it's a
hard issue because without that `crisis' word, the question is
whether we can actually bring the country forward to resolve this
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Reasonable people, making defensible economic assumptions,
arrive at different views of Social Security's financial health.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security raises money though a 12.4 percent tax on wages,
paid half by workers and half by employers. For years, the tax has
raised more money than Social Security pays out each year in
benefits to retirees. The surplus goes to the Treasury for general
purposes, and the Treasury in return gives Social Security special
bonds, which are held in a trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   The trust fund has collected $655 billion in bonds so far, and
it will add more in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   But soon, the nation's 76 million Baby Boomers will begin to
retire. By about 2013, so many Boomers will be drawing retirement
benefits that the system has to cash in some of the Treasury bonds.
And by about 2032, all the bonds will be gone.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean the system will be bankrupt. Even with no
trust fund, the 12.4 percent tax will produce enough money each
year to cover about three-quarters of the benefits for retirees.
The problem is the remaining one quarter. The question facing
policy-makers is whether paying for that one quarter will be
relatively painless or catastrophically expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably as many answers as there are people looking
at it,'' said Michael Tanner of the Cato Institute, a libertarian
think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Three factors have shaped the debate over the scope of the
Social Security problem: whether the goal is to fix the system
forever or for only a set number of years; forecasts of future
economic growth; and the reliability of the Social Security trust
fund.
</P>
<P>
   When economists add up all the income and obligations of the
system over 75 years, the shortfall comes to about $3 trillion.
That shortfall could be wiped out if payroll taxes were raised
today, and permanently, by about 2.2 percentage points. The tax
increase would erase the shortfall for 75 years, the longest time
horizon that many economists are willing to consider.
</P>
<P>
   But others say the nation should put Social Security into
balance forever. Social Security's own advisers have noted that the
nation will still have a growing number of retirees in 75 years,
and that a tax increase of 2.2 percentage points allows the system
to fall into deficit in year 76.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should you stop at 75 years and ignore the huge deficits
in year 76, 77, 78?'' asked BU's Kotlikoff.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing Social Security forever, he said, would take a huge tax
increase of 4.7 percentage points. ``How would you like to give up
a nickle of every dollar you earn, every day, for the rest of your
life, and your kids and grandkids have to do it, too?'' Kotlikoff
asked. ``That's the nature of our problem here.''
</P>
<P>
   The news gets worse, according to some analysts.
</P>
<P>
   To arrive at its estimate of a $3 trillion shortfall, Social
Security's internal analysts make certain economic assumptions.
They assume that the economy will grow by about 2 percent annually
in the next decade, down from about 3.8 percent last year. They
assume that inflation will rise to about 3.5 percent, up from about
2.3 percent today. By the year 2070, they say, women will live on
average to age 84, and men to age 79.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawmakers accept these numbers, but a vocal minority says
Social Security has a poor record for accurate predictions. They
favor using more conservative forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner, for example, says the Census Bureau has predicted that
people will live two years longer than the Social Security
projections say, requiring the program to pay out more money in
benefits. Kotlikoff says the Social Security numbers overstate
future increases in worker paychecks, so they give an overly
optimistic view of tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   If lawmakers accept conservative forecasts, it would take a tax
hike of six percentage points to fix Social Security for 75 years,
Kotlikoff said _ far more than the 2.2 percent hike under the more
optimistic assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also take different views on the Social Security trust
fund, the pool of Treasury bonds worth $655 billion.
</P>
<P>
   To some, it is real money that can be relied on to pay benefits
for future retirees. But others say the trust fund is merely a pile
of IOUs that can be paid off only by future tax increases or
spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
   If the cost of paying off the IOUs is included, these analysts
say, it would take a 6 percent payroll tax hike to fix Social
Security for 75 years. ``The trust fund is key,'' said Tanner.
``How you view the trust fund tells you whether you have a problem
in 15 years or in 34 years, and whether it's a 2 percent problem or
a 6 percent problem.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some say there is not much of a problem at
all. Last week, Jackson and Ireland said the nation could grow its
way out of its Social Security problem. If economic growth remained
at it current pace, they said, more people would work and would
earn more money, allowing the system to raise enough tax revenue to
cover its costs.
</P>
<P>
   Crisis or not, many lawmakers say that problems will only get
worse if they do not settle on a solution now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people want to define the problem as very doomsday in
order to support a radical overhaul,'' said Representative Earl
Pomeroy, Democrat of North Dakota. ``The fact is we've got the Baby
Boomers right now in their earning years, and we've got a federal
budget surplus. This is a problem we can fix, and we don't have to
scrap the system to do it.''

`PRIVATIZING' SOCIAL SECURITY CAN MEAN MANY THINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the lobbyists who want to make big changes to
Social Security get together, they sometimes try to dream up a new
term for what it is they are trying to do. ``Everyone wants to come
up with a word that means the same thing as `privatization,' but
which isn't such a liability,'' says Marty Regalia, chief economist
for the US Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   It is a big, ominous, and vague word _ but we can expect to hear
a lot more about privatization in the next few days. On Tuesday and
Wednesday, President Clinton and congressional leaders will meet at
the White House to begin working out a plan to stave off financial
problems that might cripple Social Security early in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   As they struggle toward a solution, many politicians will argue
that Social Security can be saved by some form of privatization.
Others will argue that privatization would completely destroy the
program.
</P>
<P>
   And that should provoke an immediate question from those
watching the debate: What kind of privatization do they mean?
</P>
<P>
   Most often, but not always, privatizers like the Chamber of
Commerce want to give people the right to invest some of their
Social Security taxes in their own private accounts _ accounts
owned by them and not the government. But how would the accounts
work? Would there be limits on how we could use our savings? And
what would happen to people who are already retired?
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone tells me they're in favor of privatization, it
doesn't tell me much until I hear lots and lots of details,'' said
Joseph Quinn, an economics professor at Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   If the the politicians remake Social Security, they will be
drawing up a new contract for our financial future, and no one
should sign a contract without reading the fine print. Precision in
language will be important. What follows is a guide to help make
sense of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --When someone supports or attacks privatization, which kind are
they talking about?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To pay for Social Security benefits, the government imposes a
12.4 percent tax on the wages of nearly every worker. The tax is
split evenly between employer and employee.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the tax raises more money than Social Security needs
each year to pay benefits. The surplus money is given to the
Treasury for use in general government, and the Treasury in return
gives the Social Security system bonds that yield about 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When lawmakers talk about privatization, they most often mean
that people should be able to divert some of the 12.4 percent
payroll tax into privately owned, individual accounts in the
worker's own name. In their view, we would become investors instead
of just taxpayers, building individual wealth by buying stocks and
bonds of our own choice.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers sometimes use privatization to refer to something
else: allowing the Social Security system itself to buy stocks,
without creating a private account for each worker.
</P>
<P>
   Under this idea, Social Security itself would use tax money to
buy stocks on behalf of the system as a whole. The stocks
presumably would yield more than the 6 percent Treasury bonds _ but
there are no guarantees. If the stocks rise in value, the system
would have more money to spend on benefits for future retirees,
delaying financial problems that are scheduled to hit after the
year 2030. If the stocks fall, the loss would be shared by everyone
together.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --How ``individual'' would the individual accounts be?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under some plans, one person's account could look far different
than another person's.
</P>
<P>
   These plans see Social Security becoming like  &UR; today &LR; 's IRAs, or
individual retirement accounts, where people can buy pretty much
any type of investment they want from whomever they want _ banks,
brokerages, insurance companies, or mutual fund firms.
</P>
<P>
   The drawback, however, is that the government might find it hard
to supervise 148 million accounts spread among thousands of
financial firms, some of which might be pushing risky investments.
That is why some lawmakers favor individual accounts that look like
 &UR; today &LR; 's 401(k) plans, which businesses commonly offer to workers.
</P>
<P>
   In this system, workers would have as few as two or three
investment options, maybe only a single bond fund and a single
stock index fund. The government would choose two or three
investment firms to manage the 148 million accounts, probably
picking ones that offer the lowest management fees.
</P>
<P>
   --Would there be restrictions on using the savings?
</P>
<P>
   Someone who owns a television is free to sell it for cash at any
time, or to give it to the kids. It is unlikely people would
``own'' their Social Security accounts in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, after all, is to make sure that people save for
retirement _ not for other purposes _ and that people use their
savings to avoid falling into poverty and onto welfare. But those
goals might conflict with giving people full ``ownership'' of their
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   For example, some lawmakers say the system should bar people
from withdrawing money from their accounts until retirement. On the
other hand, how can Congress say no to people who want to use their
savings for current medical or college costs? Lawmakers have
already loosened the rules on the use of IRA and 401(k) money for
medical care, college tuition and home purchases.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear at this point whether ``ownership'' would mean that
people have the right to withdraw all their savings at once on
retirement. Congress might decide that it is better to limit people
to withdrawing only a certain amount each year.
</P>
<P>
   Under some plans, workers are forced to use their accumulated
savings to buy an annuity _ a contract, generally sold by insurance
companies, to pay a person a set amount of money for the rest of
his or her life. This would ensure that a person's retirement
savings produce income until his or her death. But it would also
deprives Americans of a key element of ``ownership'' _ the right to
leave money in the account for their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --How much would a system of private accounts cost?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Listen for whether a speaker is talking about private accounts
as a ``carve out'' or as an ``add on.'' In a ``carve out'' plan,
people divert _ or carve out _ a portion of the 12.4 percent Social
Security tax and invest it in their own private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Some people say ``carve out'' plans won't work, because they
divert money that is needed to pay for  &UR; today &LR; 's retirees and for
people who are close to retirement. Some say that private accounts
can be created only as an ``add on'' to the current system. In
other words, workers could start private accounts, but any
contributions would come in addition to paying the current Social
Security tax.
</P>
<P>
   Can we afford to start private accounts while maintaining
benefits for people who are in retirement, or for future retirees?
Some ``carve out'' supporters say that creating private accounts
will require additional taxes to help pay for current retirees, or
that retirees will have to accept benefit cuts. Others say the
transition will not cost much, because the government will have
fewer obligations to workers once they build up sizeable savings in
their private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners will have to decide which group sounds more credible.
And even if there is some pain involved in moving to private
accounts, listeners will have to ask if it is greater than the tax
increases or benefit cuts that might be required to fix Social
Security without creating private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   William Shipman, a principal with State Street Global Advisors
in Boston and a leading proponent of private accounts, compares the
transition to refinancing a home mortgage. Sure, you have to pay
closing costs, attorneys' fees and points, but getting the lower
interest rate means you are better off in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --What happens to the poor and vulnerable?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Social Security has been called the most successful social
program in the country, cutting the poverty rate among seniors
during the past 40 years from 35 percent to 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It has done this because it redistributes wealth: from
high-income to low-income workers, and from single people to
traditional families with stay-at-home moms. It also pays
disability benefits to injured workers and survivor benefits to
workers' families.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see Social Security as a low-risk, low-return
retirement system,'' said Sharon Daly of Catholic Charities USA.
``But really it is a mutual insurance program'' where we insure
each other against death, disability and poverty in old age.
</P>
<P>
   Private account plans might weaken this aspect of the program.
Currently, millions of stay-at-home parents (almost all of them
women) earn retirement benefits merely because they are married to
someone with a paying job. If workers save for their own
retirement, what happens to the mother who never joined the paid
work force?
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Social Security has been a good deal for low-income
workers. Compared to wages they earned when they were working,
low-income retirees get more from Social Security than do their
high-income counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Private accounts could change this feature. If everyone sets
aside 2 percent of wages for retirement, the low-wage worker will
accumulate far less money over a lifetime than would a high-wage
worker.

GIFTS OF GAB FOR '99 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Dec. 13)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``One original thought,'' said Diogenes in the fourth century
B.C., ``is worth a thousand mindless quotings.''
</P>
<P>
   You can find that selfless-serving blast at quotations in the
Random House Webster's ``Quotationary,'' by Leonard Roy Frank ($45,
but it's more than a thousand pages with index and claims to
contain ``more new quotes than any other book.'')
</P>
<P>
   The neologism  &UR; quotationary &LR;  is a nice coinage, instantly
conveying the meaning of ``dictionary of quotations.'' Frank's
collection is rich in fresh quotationage, much more than a rehash
of Bartlett's, grandfather of quotationaries.
</P>
<P>
   This valuable aid to speakers and writers cites sources and
dates of the original comment or at least a recent quoting, so
necessary to scholars. The above selection from Diogenes, for
example, is attributed to a column that appeared in this space on
April 7, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I forgot where I found it. It could be that one
day long ago, in my search for an honest man in Washington, I shone
a light in the face of an old guy who said, ``One original thought,
etc.'' (No; I really looked it up somewhere.)
</P>
<P>
   This is by way of introducing the annual column about gifts of
gab. As the Christmas holidays approach, language mavens everywhere
look for guidance on what new books to give to literate friends. A
gift of a word book conveys more than words can say. Here are two
more:
</P>
<P>
   A Dictionary of Modern American Usage, by Bryan A. Garner, is an
excellent work to complement your hairsplitting heir's copies of
Robert Burchfield's third edition of Fowler's Modern English Usage
and the loosey-goosey but most informative Merriam-Webster's
Dictionary of English Usage.
</P>
<P>
   In some entries, Garner's work extends the reach of the
prescriptive Fowler and the descriptive Merriam-Webster: In
 &UR; about &LR; , for example, the American usage book deals with (and
frowns on my outdated use of)  &UR; about the head &LR; , where blows are
sometimes dealt. He's right; rather than sound like a bully out of
the '60s, I would now use the Southernism  &UR; upside the head &LR; , which
Garner should include in a future edition.
</P>
<P>
   I think that the difference between  &UR; enormity &LR; , in the sense of
``outrageousness'' and  &UR; enormousness &LR; , ``hugeness,'' has broken
down and that  &UR; enormity &LR;  has taken over both meanings, though it is
used more often for size than depravity. E. Ward Gilman of
Merriam-Webster agrees, but Garner, up there on the ramparts with
Burchfield-Fowler, gutsily holds that ``the historic
differentiation between these words should not be muddled.'' As
long as you put some thought into your decision, you pays yer money
and you uses yer usage.
</P>
<P>
   (This book sells for $30 until Jan. 1, 1999, but the publisher _
Oxford _ warns that it will be $35 thereafter. I am planning a
similar marketing campaign for a future word book of my own,
penalizing buyers an additional $5 for every month they fail to
make their purchase. Subtle literary sales pitch: ``This
short-lived book is getting rarer and more valuable every day _
grab it while it's cheap.'' Does that really fool book buyers?)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Book of Beastly Mispronunciations,'' by Charles
Harrington Elster, is not coming out until next month (Houghton
Mifflin, $14, and months after that, still $14, until _ like all
the others _ it's remaindered at Strand Book Store in New York for
half price).
</P>
<P>
   But if you get a gift certificate to a bookstore, invest in this
pronunciation guide in January; it's the best survey of the spoken
field in years, and includes some original research. Take
 &UR; short-lived &LR;  and  &UR; long-lived &LR; : ``The  &UR; i &LR;  is long, as in  &UR; alive &LR; .''
That's because they come not from the verb  &UR; live &LR;  but from the noun
 &UR; life &LR; . When you hear a television pundit pronounce the  &UR; i &LR;  as in
 &UR; give &LR; , go livid.
</P>
<P>
   Rhyme helps orthoepists. (Go pronounce that.) ``There is no
 &UR; day &LR;  or  &UR; dem &LR; , in  &UR; academia &LR; ,'' writes Elster. The word should
rhyme with  &UR; anemia &LR;  and  &UR; Bohemia &LR; . And  &UR; fellatio &LR;  should rhyme with
 &UR; Horatio &LR; ,'' he rhymes, taking note of a form of what has come to
be known widely as ``oral sex.'' ``Anyone who says fuh-LAH-tee-oh
is speaking another language (and a dead one, too),'' the author
opines, ``treating the word as a foreignism when it is not. That
strikes me as ostentatious.''
</P>
<P>
   And Elvis is found at last. Is his name PREZ-lee or PRESS-lee?
Northerners tend to prefer the Z, as did early TV impresarios Ed
Sullivan and Steve Allen, but the author spoke to the lady who runs
the Elvis Presley Birthplace in Tupelo (TOO-puh-loh), Miss., as
well as the people in Graceland, the opulent Elvis estate in
Memphis, Tenn., and all agreed on PRESS.
</P>
<P>
   He then viewed Elvis TV documentaries and heard it from the
name-owner's mouth: ``In a comedy skit with Milton Berle, Berle
mistakes Elvis for an importunate fan, and the King has to set him
straight. `I'm Elvis PRESS-lee,' he says.''
</P>
<P>
   How come there is an  &UR; ee &LR;  sound in the middle of  &UR; prestigious &LR; ,
when there is none in  &UR; litigious &LR; ,  &UR; religious &LR;  and  &UR; prodigious &LR; ?
Because  &UR; prestigious &LR;  has an accompanying noun,  &UR; prestige &LR; ,
pronounced pre-STEEZH, and there ain't no nouns  &UR; litige &LR; ,  &UR; relige &LR; 
or  &UR; prodige &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Now let's get down to basics: how to pronounce  &UR; the &LR; . We all
know that you say THEE in emphasis: ``Are you THEE Elwood P.
Dowd?'' But how else do you differentiate between THEE, preferred
by Quakers and some announcers at all times, and the less assertive
THUH, finished with a shy schwa?
</P>
<P>
   When this was put to Elster by the cameraman on a TV set, he
replied: ``Say THUH before words beginning with a consonant: You
are THUH camera operator for THUH TV show. Say THEE before words
beginning with a vowel sound: THEE operator wins THEE
around-the-world tour.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's THUH gift list for THEE earnest giver of a language
book. ``Words _ so innocent and powerless as they are, as standing
in a dictionary,'' wrote Nathaniel Hawthorne, but ``how potent for
good and evil they become, in the hands of one who knows how to
combine them!''

IN HIGH SCHOOL, IT WASN'T MEANT TO BE; 50 YEARS LATER, SHE FINALLY
SAYS YES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In California, Pat tells our story and her friends are
rhapsodic. It's the most wonderful, most beautiful thing they've
heard.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, I tell our story and people suspect I'm making it up.
I'm not, although Pat feels betimes that I exaggerate. Her memory,
though, is less keen than mine.
</P>
<P>
   Even before our July wedding, various friends _ hers, mine, ours
_ were urging me to write ``our love story'' from the very
beginning ...
</P>
<P>
   The beginning is Dec. 31, 1939. As footnote to the Great
Depression, we're refugees from Texas, newly arrived in Los
Angeles: my parents in their late 30s; my teen-age brother and
sister; and myself, rather small for 10 1/2 years. On this last day
of the year that is our first full day of California residence,
we've rented a two-bedroom house with sleeping porch ($30 per
month), and I have walked with my mother and sister several blocks
to a supermarket on Wilshire Boulevard to buy our first groceries.
</P>
<P>
   My mother liked to relate her version of that shopping spree.
Our four full sacks of groceries came to no more than $5, because
that's how much money my father had given her. But my mother soon
forgot all about the happening on the sidewalk that is forever
etched in my memory ...
</P>
<P>
   As we came out of the market with those full sacks, a little
girl on roller skates took a bad spill and hurt herself. She began
to cry, and someone sought to assist her. She wouldn't be helped.
With eyes ablaze, she said ``I'm all right!'' rather defiantly, and
picked herself up. She was about my own size; and as I watched her
skate away, I already admired her.
</P>
<P>
   She had her very own look, not to be mistaken for anyone else.
So I recognized her immediately a few days later, when I enrolled
in Mrs. Fullenwider's fifth-grade class at Brockton Avenue School
in West Los Angeles. We may not have exchanged words that spring
semester, nor does she recall my arrival at the school. In my view,
though, she was a roller-skating heroine. She was Patricia Ann
Volder _ a name quite lovely, I thought.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, when we were actually taught by Our Miss Brooks in
sixth grade, Pat and I became fast friends. She was quite saucy,
the first truly witty child I knew, terrific even then with
one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   I recall sixth grade so much better than she. Pat does not
remember that I was class president, leading the Pledge of
Allegiance every morning. She does remember passing my house every
day at lunchtime, on her way home. I could look up a paved alley
adjacent to my house and see hers, a long block away. Yet I was
never in her house, nor she in mine; sometimes we were together in
a neighborhood play group but always out of doors.
</P>
<P>
   Our romance _ please, let me call it that _ flourished in the
1941 summer before our seventh-grade assignment to Emerson Junior
High in Westwood. Twice, Pat and I made an eight-block walk to a
public library, where each of us would return 10 books and check
out 10 more (the maximum allowance). She remembers that; and she
recalls our attempt to play doubles tennis with Billy and Cherry on
the court at our eventual high school.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Bernhoft was my closest friend and Pat's was Cherry
Yamada, a vibrant Japanese girl. When we started at Emerson (which
collected pupils from seven elementary schools), I was disappointed
not to have any classes with Billy or Pat, but I was in homeroom
and all other classes with Cherry. She and I would cling to one
another, but her perception _ and mine _ was that Pat was my
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Pat believes otherwise. The minister who performed our wedding
ceremony articulated that although Larry considered Pat his
sweetheart, Pat denied having a boyfriend _ I was merely the best
friend she had among boys she knew at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Pat was in Cherry's home on the Sunday of Dec. 7, 1941, when
they heard via radio of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The
next morning I was with Pat and Cherry at the bus stop at Wilshire
and Westgate, and the three of us wondered what would happen to
Cherry and her family.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry and our other Japanese friends all left Emerson four
months later to be interned at Manzanar _ a concentration camp by
any other name. When we lost Cherry, I lost a part of Pat; and I
supposed I was losing all of her forever in the following October.
My family moved to Santa Monica and I was withdrawn from Emerson,
soon after having started eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   As we got off the bus after my last ride home from Emerson, I
bade Pat farewell. I was 13, as she soon would be, and I requested
a goodbye kiss. It was accomplished ever so quickly, on the exact
spot where a little girl on skates had fallen almost three years
earlier. I thought I felt her lips on mine for hours afterward.
</P>
<P>
   My family's stay in Santa Monica lasted only three months. We
were back in West Los Angeles, but in a different neighborhood. I
was at Emerson again, but not riding the same bus with Pat; and our
reconnection on campus certainly was awkward. In those three months
away, I had gained 6 inches in height; and Patricia Volder was no
longer a child but a beguiling young lady, sublimely proportioned.
</P>
<P>
   From that point onward we were only casual acquaintances. From
Emerson we advanced to University High School, so named for its
proximity to UCLA _ where, eventually, we also would be students
together.
</P>
<P>
   Pat did not suspect the torch I carried. As we progressed into
the dating experience, she seemed beyond my reach. What little
social congress I managed with girls was on a double-date basis
requiring someone else's car. Pat dated boys more spectacular than
I perceived myself to be; one was Don Stewart, star second baseman
on the baseball team I failed to make. In college, she was
``pinned'' to Jack Miller, who had been the premier miler at our
high school.
</P>
<P>
   But I was hanging in there. In our senior year at Uni, we
finally had a class together. It was the a cappella choir and I
contrived to be near Pat, once managing to sit with her on a bus
trip to one of our singing engagements. She was friendly enough but
not aroused, because I was old news.
</P>
<P>
   At graduation time, we both squeaked into the top 10 percent. In
a class of 469, I ranked 45th scholastically, but there was Pat's
name, just ahead of mine at No. 44. Pat had prominence in our
class, was president of this and that, so was privileged to sit on
the front row at commencement, right next to Jane Powell. I was
several tiers back, clutching the diploma I had just received, when
I heard the name of Cherry Yamada called ... and saw a gorgeous
Japanese girl stride across the stage to accept her diploma. I had
not known of Cherry's return.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   In the summer after graduation, Pat and I had jobs at the same
place _ the Sears store in Westwood Village _ and she turned me
down when I invited her on a theater date. A few years later, at
UCLA where she worked in the student store, I made a vain bid to
take her to a football game. Pat says now that if she ever refused
a date with me, it was because she was otherwise engaged; but I
would not risk being a three-time loser.
</P>
<P>
   At UCLA I met the girl who, after my military conscription
during the Korean War, would become my wife and the mother of our
five children. As a GI in Germany, I wrote to Eleanor Eby every
day, and I was a letter-writing fool, corresponding with a
multitude of friends. I had lost touch with Pat but wished to write
to her, and enlisted aid in LA trying to finding her.
</P>
<P>
   No one did, although a friend sent a newspaper photo identifying
Patricia Volder as a model for Saks Fifth Avenue. When I married
Ellie in the fall of 1954, I did not know that Pat had married
fellow UCLA grad Carl Haag a year earlier, nor did I have any idea
where she was.
</P>
<P>
   But I never forgot her. There was the time when my wife and I,
snowbound in a Yonkers, N.Y., apartment while awaiting our first
child, got to talking for the only time about our bygone loves. I
told her of a childhood sweetheart who had not known the extent of
my affection. Ellie said, ``She was your Marjorie Morningstar,''
referring to Herman Wouk's then-current bestseller about the girl
who got away. True enough, there's a Marjorie Morningstar in almost
every man's life.
</P>
<P>
   Years passed _ 44 of them, from the last time I saw Pat at UCLA
until June 3, 1996, when I was surprised to receive notice of a
Unihi 50-year reunion in planning for the Class of 1947. Surprised,
because I had long been completely lost from my high school class
and had not known of reunions that occurred incrementally _
reunions Pat had attended. But somehow they had found me at last,
in Fort Worth, and I knew I would attend the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   The classmate maintaining the data base was a long-ago friend _
Sam Haver, who beat me out of the tenor lead in the high school
operetta. I telephoned Sam to request addresses he might have for
persons with whom I wished to resume contact.
</P>
<P>
   He provided six addresses. Pat Volder was now Pat Haag, living
in Moraga in the Bay Area, across from San Francisco and close to
Oakland. Because Sam did not indicate that she was no longer
married, I wrote to Pat somewhat guardedly, encapsulating my
post-college history and telling of my beloved Ellie's death in
1983.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reply from Pat, although others responded
quickly to my letters. Bill Bernhoft got me on the phone. From ages
11 to 14, when baseball was the rhythm of our summer, Billy and I
went with our fathers to Pacific Coast League doubleheaders every
Sunday. Billy was the star of my California boyhood, and nowadays
we get on the phone and talk for hours. Cherry, too. She said in a
very touching letter that I have recaptured for her a girlhood she
lost. We're pals again, and Cherry's friendship with Pat is
redeemed.
</P>
<P>
   The reunion was only two months away when Pat finally answered
my letter in March 1997, having deliberated for nine months. Some
time later, she said the reason for her uncertainty in answering my
letter was that she felt instinctively she would be in my life
again, and wasn't sure either of us wanted that.
</P>
<P>
   Pat hadn't planned to attend the reunion in Culver City; but
after reading her six-page handwritten letter (which detailed the
end of her marriage after 23 years), I reached her by phone and
talked her into coming.
</P>
<P>
   The class reunion changed our lives forever. I expected nothing
beyond restoring a friendship, and Pat certainly ``wasn't
looking.'' But things happen. There really were two reunions _ for
the class, and just for us.
</P>
<P>
   She was white-haired glamorous. I was enraptured in the moment
of our meeting, and our time together was mutually stimulating.
After the buoyant three-day reunion ended with a Sunday brunch, I
drove Pat and her longtime friend/classmate Ellen Sherriffs Sparks
to the Los Angeles airport for their return flight to San
Francisco. Our farewell embrace carried a silent message to both of
us to want to be together again.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Pat telephoned my hotel, hoping to resume
conversation; but I was out to dinner with a friend, telling him I
was in love. When I returned to Fort Worth, a letter from Pat was
waiting for me. After several exchanges of mail, we resorted to the
telephone with increasing frequency.
</P>
<P>
   Our first post-reunion rendezvous was in Albuquerque, N.M., two
months later. After my romantic greeting at the airport, Pat noted
that it was the first time I had ever kissed her. Reminded of our
goodbye kiss in eighth grade, she wondered why I should remember
what she could not. The long-ago event surely meant more to me than
to her.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage was an early prospect, but we didn't rush matters. Over
most of a full year we contrived to be together often, hardly
intimidated by the 1,600 miles between us. On an October day in Los
Angeles, we visited every school we had attended together; and we
floated in nostalgia that evening, sharing a glorious dinner
occasion with Cherry Yamada Uyeda and with Bill Bernhoft.
</P>
<P>
   We were married on July 25 in Moraga, in the serene home of a
friend of Pat's. Preceding the wedding ceremony was the playing of
Walter Huston's fabled recording of Kurt Weill's ``September Song''
_ ``our song,'' quite appropriately. Most of the 75 people who
attended have expressed what Pat and I believe _ that the ceremony
could not have been more heartfelt and meaningful. All of my
children were there with their families, and Pat's wonderful son
managed the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Pat and I are presently living in two states in an arrangement
that's working quite well. We manage to be together about
two-thirds of the time, and exploit the telephone when we're apart.
Soon, we'll be together full time.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Garcia Marquez's ``Love in the Time of Cholera'' tells
of a woman and man who finally get together after 50 years of his
longing. We've surpassed those lovers, and Pat and I believe
absolutely that God brought us back together.
</P>
<P>
   Ours is not a placid convenience of companionship for two people
knocking on the door of 70. It is love in every romantic and
spiritual manifestation. We thrive in our today and rejoice in our
tomorrow _ certain, however, that both are inexorably attached to a
many-splendored childhood we shared.

A KINDLER, GENTLER, BETTER-ARMED IRS?

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Internal Revenue Service is trying to improve
its image, but the agency is not winning any friends in some
circles by stocking up on shotguns and semiautomatic handguns.
</P>
<P>
   IRS contracts recently discovered by anti-tax activists give the
agency the option of buying $200,000 worth of Remington Model 11-87
shotguns and $1 million worth of Sigarms' Sauer semiautomatic
pistols.
</P>
<P>
   IRS officials said they have no intention of spending that much,
but they have ordered about 620 handguns and 175 shotguns, at a
total cost of about $448,000. A spokesman said that most of the
guns replaced aging weapons in an IRS arsenal that includes 3,000
pistols and 900 shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year contracts, awarded in 1994 and 1995, came to light
when a conservative columnist discovered them on a government
Internet site. The Web site is no longer accessible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something smells worse than second-hand tobacco smoke here,''
Jon E. Dougherty wrote in a July column in USAJournal, a
conservative Internet newsletter. ``IRS agents, who are already
operating under a prejudicial mindset against taxpayers, do not
need firepower to help enforce tax laws.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written response prepared for members of Congress, the IRS
explained that the $1.2 million figure is a high-end estimate that
includes possible weapons purchases for the Secret Service and the
Drug Enforcement Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS assigns the weapons to special agents, whose duties
include arresting tax evasion suspects and executing search
warrants. Agency spokesman Steve Pyrek said the IRS has about 3,000
pistols, one for every special agent, and 900 shotguns that are
issued as needed for raids and other law enforcement activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any plans to buy any more shotguns or
handguns,'' Pyrek said. ``We have enough right now.''

PERSONAL HEALTH: TREATMENTS OFFER PROMISE FOR EMBARRASSING
AILMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last decade, Susan, a Long Island businesswoman who
recently turned 50, has been plagued by an annoying and potentially
humiliating problem: She has to empty her bladder a dozen or more
times a day and several times a night, or risk an embarrassing
accident. When she has to go, she has to go, and soon. Fortunately,
Susan is not shy about seeking out lavatories wherever she may be.
</P>
<P>
   But for more than 17 million Americans who share her problem of
an overactive bladder, opportunities to urinate at a moment's
notice are often limited, forcing them to restrict their
activities, including their employment, to places and circumstances
where lavatories are immediately available. Some become homebound,
going out only when they can be certain of quick access to a
bathroom. Many are forced to wear adult diapers, dressing in loose
clothes to hide the bulge and tell-tale signs of an occasional
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep is often disturbed by the need to urinate often during the
night, resulting in daytime fatigue that can impair work and social
activities. Sexual activity may be avoided for fear of an
embarrassing loss of bladder control.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is far more challenging than the more common
condition of stress incontinence, where a small amount of urine can
escape when a sneeze, cough, hearty laugh or vigorous exercise puts
pressure on the bladder. When a person with an overactive bladder
loses control, the entire bladder is likely to empty at once. And
while stress incontinence is primarily a problem for women,
especially as they age, overactive bladder afflicts men and women
in nearly equal numbers, and can occur at any age.
</P>
<P>
   Although an overactive bladder is hardly rare and often has
costly emotional, social and occupational consequences, most people
with the condition accept it as a normal part of aging, which it is
not, and sometimes are too embarrassed to tell even their doctors
about it. Others remain silent because they believe _ or have been
told _ that nothing can be done to control the problem.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, treatments, including a recently approved drug with
relatively few side effects, are available that can significantly
reduce if not eliminate the distress, discomfort and inconvenience
associated with an overactive bladder.
</P>
<P>
   The bladder has an elastic wall containing a smooth muscle, the
detrusor muscle, which in adults can tolerate a large increase in
urine before a signal is sent to the brain that the bladder is
about three-fourths full and needs to be emptied. Until that time,
signals from the brain suppress contractions of the detrusor
muscle, and thus inhibit emptying of the bladder.
</P>
<P>
   People with normal bladder function usually register a need to
void at a bladder volume of about 250 milliliters, or about 8
ounces, of urine. If voiding is not convenient at that point, it
can usually be delayed through voluntary control until the volume
of urine is about double that amount.
</P>
<P>
   However, an overactive bladder in an adult behaves somewhat like
the normal bladder of babies and young children, whose brains
cannot yet control the time and place of voiding. In those with an
overactive bladder, a sense of urgency typically occurs at a urine
volume of about 150 milliliters. Inhibitory signals from the brain
fail to suppress the overactive detrusor muscle and it contracts
inappropriately during the bladder-filling phase, causing
involuntary voiding.
</P>
<P>
   People with overactive bladders experience at least two of three
major symptoms: a need to empty the bladder more than eight times
in 24 hours, sometimes soon after they have done so; sudden
sensations of urgency, and urge incontinence _ a leakage of urine
or total bladder emptying if the urge is very strong or the person
cannot reach the toilet quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the underlying cause is unknown. However,
overactive bladder sometimes results from certain neurological
disorders, including multiple sclerosis, stroke, Parkinson's
disease, spina bifida and spinal cord damage.
</P>
<P>
   Most important in arriving at a correct diagnosis of an
overactive bladder is obtaining a thorough history of urinary
symptoms and eliminating other possible causes. The most common is
a urinary tract infection, typically determined by a urine culture
and often by the presence of blood in the urine. The doctor should
also perform an abdominal and pelvic examination, looking for such
anomalies as tumors, an enlarged prostate gland, a dropped uterus
or other abnormal sources of pressure on the bladder or urinary
tract.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor may also ask the patient to keep a daily chart of
urinary output to determine whether the bladder empties fully
during voiding since there may be an obstruction or inadequacy of
the detrusor muscle resulting in poor bladder emptying.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a doctor will need to directly record bladder pressure
during filling and voiding, a measurement known as cystometry. In
an overactive bladder, peaks of increased pressure by the detrusor
muscle are recorded during the filling phase, indicating periods of
involuntary muscle contraction at a time when a normal muscle
remains relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   There are two main approaches to treatment: bladder training and
drug therapy. Bladder training aims to restore bladder control by
increasing the capacity of the bladder before it registers the urge
to void. The patient keeps a record of the frequency and volume of
output, gradually increasing the time between voidings by 15
minutes until an interval of two to four hours is reached without
leakage.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor may also ask a patient to keep a record of fluid
intake, in case excessive fluids are contributing to the problem.
However, most patients with overactive bladders have already cut
back on the amount of fluids they consume, and some actually become
seriously dehydrated. Bladder training is very demanding and must
be maintained indefinitely to remain effective.
</P>
<P>
   For those reason, patients much prefer drug treatment. However,
until this year, the available drugs brought side effects like dry
mouth, constipation, blurred vision, confusion and urinary
retention that prompted most patients to stop taking them. Drugs
that are effective against overactive bladder are known as
antimuscarinic agents because they hook up with muscarine receptors
in the bladder and other organs throughout the body.
</P>
<P>
   The newest such drug, tolterodine, has a stronger attraction for
the receptors in the bladder than those in other organs. Thus,
bothersome side effects are much reduced and patients are more
likely to continue therapy. Bettye Roussos, a 57-year-old
saleswoman from Ormand Beach, Fla., says the drug, under the trade
name Detrol, has given her back her life.
</P>
<P>
   She once had a voiding accident while on a podium to receive an
award. She regularly soaked through large protective pads. She
feared going anywhere that was more than an hour's drive, and she
began emptying her bladder hourly in the hope of avoiding
accidents. The urge to void awakened her four or five times a
night, leaving her exhausted every morning.

   With Detrol, taken twice a day, her bathroom visits have been

<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last decade, Susan, a Long Island businesswoman who
recently turned 50, has been plagued by an annoying and potentially
humiliating problem: She has to empty her bladder a dozen or more
times a day and several times a night, or risk an embarrassing
accident. When she has to go, she has to go, and soon. Fortunately,
Susan is not shy about seeking out lavatories wherever she may be.
</P>
<P>
   But for more than 17 million Americans who share her problem of
an overactive bladder, opportunities to urinate at a moment's
notice are often limited, forcing them to restrict their
activities, including their employment, to places and circumstances
where lavatories are immediately available. Some become homebound,
going out only when they can be certain of quick access to a
bathroom. Many are forced to wear adult diapers, dressing in loose
clothes to hide the bulge and tell-tale signs of an occasional
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep is often disturbed by the need to urinate often during the
night, resulting in daytime fatigue that can impair work and social
activities. Sexual activity may be avoided for fear of an
embarrassing loss of bladder control.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is far more challenging than the more common
condition of stress incontinence, where a small amount of urine can
escape when a sneeze, cough, hearty laugh or vigorous exercise puts
pressure on the bladder. When a person with an overactive bladder
loses control, the entire bladder is likely to empty at once. And
while stress incontinence is primarily a problem for women,
especially as they age, overactive bladder afflicts men and women
in nearly equal numbers, and can occur at any age.
</P>
<P>
   Although an overactive bladder is hardly rare and often has
costly emotional, social and occupational consequences, most people
with the condition accept it as a normal part of aging, which it is
not, and sometimes are too embarrassed to tell even their doctors
about it. Others remain silent because they believe _ or have been
told _ that nothing can be done to control the problem.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, treatments, including a recently approved drug with
relatively few side effects, are available that can significantly
reduce if not eliminate the distress, discomfort and inconvenience
associated with an overactive bladder.
</P>
<P>
   The bladder has an elastic wall containing a smooth muscle, the
detrusor muscle, which in adults can tolerate a large increase in
urine before a signal is sent to the brain that the bladder is
about three-fourths full and needs to be emptied. Until that time,
signals from the brain suppress contractions of the detrusor
muscle, and thus inhibit emptying of the bladder.
</P>
<P>
   People with normal bladder function usually register a need to
void at a bladder volume of about 250 milliliters, or about 8
ounces, of urine. If voiding is not convenient at that point, it
can usually be delayed through voluntary control until the volume
of urine is about double that amount.
</P>
<P>
   However, an overactive bladder in an adult behaves somewhat like
the normal bladder of babies and young children, whose brains
cannot yet control the time and place of voiding. In those with an
overactive bladder, a sense of urgency typically occurs at a urine
volume of about 150 milliliters. Inhibitory signals from the brain
fail to suppress the overactive detrusor muscle and it contracts
inappropriately during the bladder-filling phase, causing
involuntary voiding.
</P>
<P>
   People with overactive bladders experience at least two of three
major symptoms: a need to empty the bladder more than eight times
in 24 hours, sometimes soon after they have done so; sudden
sensations of urgency, and urge incontinence _ a leakage of urine
or total bladder emptying if the urge is very strong or the person
cannot reach the toilet quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the underlying cause is unknown. However,
overactive bladder sometimes results from certain neurological
disorders, including multiple sclerosis, stroke, Parkinson's
disease, spina bifida and spinal cord damage.
</P>
<P>
   Most important in arriving at a correct diagnosis of an
overactive bladder is obtaining a thorough history of urinary
symptoms and eliminating other possible causes. The most common is
a urinary tract infection, typically determined by a urine culture
and often by the presence of blood in the urine. The doctor should
also perform an abdominal and pelvic examination, looking for such
anomalies as tumors, an enlarged prostate gland, a dropped uterus
or other abnormal sources of pressure on the bladder or urinary
tract.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor may also ask the patient to keep a daily chart of
urinary output to determine whether the bladder empties fully
during voiding since there may be an obstruction or inadequacy of
the detrusor muscle resulting in poor bladder emptying.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a doctor will need to directly record bladder pressure
during filling and voiding, a measurement known as cystometry. In
an overactive bladder, peaks of increased pressure by the detrusor
muscle are recorded during the filling phase, indicating periods of
involuntary muscle contraction at a time when a normal muscle
remains relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   There are two main approaches to treatment: bladder training and
drug therapy. Bladder training aims to restore bladder control by
increasing the capacity of the bladder before it registers the urge
to void. The patient keeps a record of the frequency and volume of
output, gradually increasing the time between voidings by 15
minutes until an interval of two to four hours is reached without
leakage.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor may also ask a patient to keep a record of fluid
intake, in case excessive fluids are contributing to the problem.
However, most patients with overactive bladders have already cut
back on the amount of fluids they consume, and some actually become
seriously dehydrated. Bladder training is very demanding and must
be maintained indefinitely to remain effective.
</P>
<P>
   For those reason, patients much prefer drug treatment. However,
until this year, the available drugs brought side effects like dry
mouth, constipation, blurred vision, confusion and urinary
retention that prompted most patients to stop taking them. Drugs
that are effective against overactive bladder are known as
antimuscarinic agents because they hook up with muscarine receptors
in the bladder and other organs throughout the body.
</P>
<P>
   The newest such drug, tolterodine, has a stronger attraction for
the receptors in the bladder than those in other organs. Thus,
bothersome side effects are much reduced and patients are more
likely to continue therapy. Bettye Roussos, a 57-year-old
saleswoman from Ormand Beach, Fla., says the drug, under the trade
name Detrol, has given her back her life.
</P>
<P>
   She once had a voiding accident while on a podium to receive an
award. She regularly soaked through large protective pads. She
feared going anywhere that was more than an hour's drive, and she
began emptying her bladder hourly in the hope of avoiding
accidents. The urge to void awakened her four or five times a
night, leaving her exhausted every morning.
</P>

PEEK INTO THE ICEMAN'S PREHISTORIC MEDICINE KIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Kan., Texas)   (af)  
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A traveler out of the past, the Iceman, whose mummified body was
discovered in the Tyrolean Alps in Northern Italy in 1991, has
given archeologists and other scientists a lifelike picture of what
people wore and ate and carried with them on treks into the Alps
5,300 years ago, at the end of the Stone Age and beginning of the
Copper Age in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   An anthropologist reported last week that the Iceman was also
providing a rare glimpse of prehistoric medicine, including his
apparent use of a natural laxative and antibiotic.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Iceman's possessions were two walnut-size lumps with a
consistency somewhere between cork and leather. Each lump was
pierced and tied to a leather thong, perhaps so it could be
fastened to some part of his clothing or belt. At first, the
material was mistakenly described as tinder for starting fires.
</P>
<P>
   But Austrian microbiologists have identified the lumps as the
fruit of the birch fungus, Piptoporus betulinus, which is common in
alpine and other cold environments. If the fungus is ingested, it
can bring on short bouts of diarrhea. It also contains oils that
are toxic to certain parasitic bacteria, thus acting as a form of
nature's own antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have not yet been able to determine the cause of the
Iceman's death, but studies of his body have yielded a picture of a
man stiff with arthritis who had not eaten in his last eight hours
and may have died of exhaustion in a sudden snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy of the well-preserved body has at least revealed the
apparent reason the fungus was among the Iceman's remedies of the
road. British scientists found in the man's colon the eggs of a
parasitic whipworm, Trichuris trichiura. This infestation causes
diarrhea and acute stomach pains. It can also bring on anemia,
which might explain the evidence of low iron content in some of the
mummy's muscles.
</P>
<P>
   In the current issue of the British medical journal Lancet, Dr.
Luigi Capasso, an anthropologist at the National Archeological
Museum in Chieti, Italy, reviewed the evidence and concluded, ``The
discovery of the fungus suggests that the Iceman was aware of his
intestinal parasites and fought them with measured doses of
Piptoporus betulinus.''
</P>
<P>
   As Capasso pointed out, the birch fungus contains toxic resins
that attack parasites like whipworm and another compound, agaric
acid, which is a powerful laxative. The combined properties of the
fungus could have brought at least temporary relief by purging the
Iceman's intestines of nearly all of the worms and their eggs.
</P>
<P>
   The birch fungus, Capasso wrote, was probably the only such
remedy available in Europe before introduction of the far more
toxic chenopod oil from the Americas. The chenopod is a low shrub
found in arid environments of South America. The efficacy of
chenopod oil as a medicine was increased by adding a strong
laxative that expelled the worms and their eggs.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Man in the Ice,'' published in 1994 (Harmony Books,
$25), Dr. Konrad Spindler, an archeologist at the University of
Innsbruck in Austria who led the early investigation of the mummy,
noted the first evidence suggesting that the Iceman might have been
carrying some natural medicines.
</P>
<P>
   ``All folk medicine has its origins in prehistory,'' Spindler
wrote. ``Over hundreds and thousands of years remedies were passed
on from generation to generation. The modern pharmaceutical
industry has frequently analyzed the active constituents of
traditional medicines and makes use of them to this day, where
synthetic forms cannot be produced.
</P>
<P>
   Seen in this light, the Iceman with his modest but no doubt
effective traveling medicine kit, is not all that remote from
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John F. Leslie, a fungal geneticist at Kansas State
University who is editor of the journal Applied and Environmental
Microbiology, called the reported link between the fungus and the
Iceman's intestinal parasites ``an interesting and exciting
finding.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the toxins effective as medicine were produced by the
fungi to protect themselves and their food source in the tree.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael G. Rinaldi, a clinical mycologist at the University
of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, said he would like
to see more evidence supporting the inference that the Iceman was
consciously treating the parasites with the fungus.
</P>
<P>
   If that proves to be the case, he said, ``It just shows that
from earliest time, people when they were sick would try whatever
they could to make it go away, even if they never had a clue as to
why it made them feel better.''

   &UR; Feline Transplants &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can cats have organ transplants?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, in some cases. The School of Veterinary Medicine at the
University of California at Davis does about 30 kidney transplants
a year for cats, at a cost of $3,000 to $4,000. Dr. Clare Gregory,
a veterinarian who is a professor in the department of surgery and
radiological sciences, said there were no other transplant programs
for dogs or cats, though there was initial research on partial
liver transplants. Because there is no organ procurement program
for animals, he explained, veterinarians have to use live donors
that can survive either donation of one of two organs or partial
organ transplants.
</P>
<P>
   The school's Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital maintains a
colony of donor cats, and the owner of a cat that receives a kidney
has to agree to adopt the donor.
</P>
<P>
   No need has been found for tissue matching in cats, and
rejection of a transplanted kidney can easily be suppressed with
cyclosporin, Dr. Gregory said. Without the drug, rejection occurs
in about 21 days.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital also has a dialysis unit. Cats with acute kidney
failure, caused by things like poisoning, usually need three to
four weeks of dialysis, costing $3,000 to $6,000. In cats with
chronic kidney failure, a few weeks of dialysis before a transplant
makes success more likely.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The blueprint for making a person is not a set of plans showing
what a finished heart or kidney looks like and how all the
different organs are plumbed together. It is almost certainly a
program, not a description, a series of steps that directs a
handful of embryonic cells into progressively more specialised
tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Interacting with each other through a burst of chemical signals,
the cells proliferate and slowly organize themselves into the
program's end product, the miracle of a mewling infant.
</P>
<P>
   Human embryonic stem cells _ the cells at the beginning of this
biological unfolding _ have now been isolated for the first time
and scientists last week promised Congress that they would soon be
able to mimic parts of nature's program in the laboratory, making
heart, blood and nerve cells to replace or fortify diseased
tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Should the technique work, it could well change the face of
medicine by providing a universal spare parts kit for the human
body. No longer would patients have to wait in line for scarce
transplantable organs; their failing hearts would be injected with
heart muscle cells grown from human embryonic cells.
</P>
<P>
   The cells would be genetically manipulated so as to avoid
provoking the patient's immune defenses, and immortalized with a
gene that enables cells to divide indefinitely instead of growing
old after an allotted number of divisions.
</P>
<P>
   From the cornucopia of embryonic stem cells, biologists would
also spin off nerve cells for Parkinson's disease patients,
pancreatic islet cells for diabetics and endothelial cells to
reline tired blood vessels, Dr. Tom Okarma told a Senate committee
last week. Okarma is vice president for research of Geron, the
company that funded the stem cells' development.
</P>
<P>
   The principle of growing replacement tissue cells from embryonic
stem cells was also endorsed at the hearing by Dr. Harold Varmus,
director of the National Institutes of Health. But a sizeable gap
still yawns between theory and practice.
</P>
<P>
   The chemical messages the cells exchange as they travel down
developmental paths to their destined cell type are almost
completely unknown. Biologists will need to identify these signals
before they acquire complete mastery over the cell's lineages and
fate.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a large bank of knowledge to draw on, derived from
studies of how simpler organisms develop, like sea urchins,
roundworms, fruit flies, frogs and mice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The field has exploded over the last 10 years,'' said Dr.
Sally A. Moody, a biologist at George Washington University and
editor of ``Cell Lineage and Fate Determination'' (Academic Press).
Because of similarities in evolution's design, an overall picture
of embryonic development is emerging, Dr. Moody said, ``but the
perception that scientists know how to choose any cell fate is
wrong. We know a lot about particular cell fates but we don't have
all the pieces worked out by any means.''
</P>
<P>
   All cells in the human body have a full set of genes, but as
cells progress down different lineages, they presumably activate
the particular suite of genes that tells them how to operate as a
hair cell or kidney cell or whatever is appropriate to their
neighborhood. The first main step of development is when the
all-purpose embryonic cells differentiate into the three tissues of
the early embryo: the endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm.
</P>
<P>
   In backboned animals, the gut, liver and lungs develop from the
endoderm; the mesoderm gives rise to the skeleton, muscle, kidney,
heart and blood, and the ectoderm generates two not obviously
kindred tissues, the skin and the nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   This division of labor is thought to be accomplished by chemical
signals that cells secrete to influence their neighbors, along with
receptors they insert in their outer membranes to receive these
signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a language of signals and receptors,'' said Dr. Roger
Pedersen, a biologist at the University of California, San
Francisco, who studies development in mice and humans. ``We know
the semantics, but we don't understand them because we can't
eavesdrop on the embryo very well, where this intimate conversation
is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   A few words in this code have been deciphered. Embryonic stem
cells can be driven to develop into nerve cells by exposing them to
the chemical known as retinoic acid. Certain growth factors
influence the development of blood-forming cells.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``One could generalize to say we know that the language being
spoken within the emrbyo as it forms these cell types is the
language of growth factors, but we don't know how to decode the
particular sentences of messages that the individual cell types
hear,'' Pedersen said.
</P>
<P>
   A development that may provide many of the words in this vital
language comes from research undertaken by Human Genome Sciences of
Rockville, Md. Dr. William A. Haseltine, its chairman and chief
executive officer, said that the company has now isolated more than
75 percent of all human genes in full length form. From them the
company's scientists as of this week have identified 14,387 genes
whose products are predicted to be proteins that are either
exported from the cell as chemical signals or inserted into the
membrane as receptors, Haseltine said.
</P>
<P>
   The identification was accomplished by setting a computer to
search for the sequence of DNA letters that are the zip code, under
the cell's protein sorting system, for all proteins destined to be
exported or used as membrane receptors. These 14,000 proteins,
Haseltine said, comprise almost the entire gene-encoded signals
communication system between human cells.
</P>
<P>
   A ``big fundamental surprise,'' he said, is that some 12,000 of
these genes have no family relationship to any genes found in the
C. elegans roundworm, whose DNA sequence is now almost complete.
This implies that higher animals invented a much more sophisticated
intercellular communications system as they evolved away from the
worm.
</P>
<P>
   The 14,000 signals and receptors, Haseltine said, would be
expected to include those that are involved in embryonic
development and hence, once identified, would supply most of the
factors needed to make human embryonic stem cells differentiate
into any desired cell type.
</P>
<P>
   Haseltine said he was discussing a collaboration with Geron.
</P>
<P>
   Haseltine was well known in the academic world before he left
the Harvard Medical School for Human Genome Sciences. But the
company has not published its findings in scientific journals and
few if any scientists independent of the company have detailed
knowledge of its work. Academic scientists consulted about the
company's claims were unable to verify them.
</P>
<P>
   Human Genome Sciences has filed many patent applications on the
genes it has discovered and so far has been granted patents on 652
genes whose function it has identified. The company is building a
plant near its Rockville headquarters to manufacture three of the
proteins it has discovered. One, vascular endothelial growth factor
2 or VEGF2, stimulates growth of new blood and lymph vessels. The
others are keratinocyte growth factor 2, which stimulates growth of
the skin and mucosal tissue, and myeloproliferation inhibitory
factor 1, to be used for protecting the bone marrow cells in
patients receiving chemotherapy. All three compounds are in
clinical trials and have not yet been approved for market.
</P>
<P>
   Haseltine has coined the term ``regenerative medicine'' to
describe his hope for renewing body tissues with the help of the
natural signals that control their growth. Understanding the body's
repair processes at the genetic level ``should permit us to
maintain our bodies in normal function, perhaps perpetually,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the repair signals should be found among the 14,000
signal and receptor proteins Human Genome Sciences has isolated,
Haseltine believes. The set should also contain the factors that
guide human embryonic stem cells down their various lineages to
form all the tissues of the body.
</P>
<P>
   The company has developed a robotic screening system to monitor
how cells respond to external signals, and hopes that this will
pinpoint the signals involved in embryonic development.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Greenwood, Geropn's chief financial officer, confirmed
the company had been in discussions with Haseltine. ``It's
reasonable to assume that Human Genome Sciences has generated
interesting data, given their efforts in the field,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The world of genes and cells that beckons so brightly may well
prove harder to conquer than it seems. But there is at least a
rational basis for the hopes now being expressed, whatever the
timescale of their fulfilment.

   Much of the dread in the dreaded trip to the dentist is being
removed: New treatments are bringing patients freedom from
drilling, freedom from anesthesia and freedom from pain. Moreover,
they appear to be, in their initial stages, safer more accurate and
faster than traditional methods.
</P>
<P>
   Technological advances have, after decades of scientific and
engineering effort, produced laser beams that can cut efficiently
and without pain into the hardest surface of the body _ teeth _ to
remove decay and prepare cavities for filling.
</P>
<P>
   And computerized X-rays are greatly reducing the levels of
radiation to which patients are being exposed. At the same time,
the computers are producing a much larger, brighter, easier-to-read
image of a patient's cavities, displayed on a 17-inch computer
screen at the dentist's elbow.
</P>
<P>
   The lasers, used with a stream of water sprayed on the teeth,
have been successful in dental work done on 1,800 people in
clinical trials. All but one percent reported no pain or need for
anesthesia, compared with 70 percent of those treated with drills.
</P>
<P>
   The laser treatment was approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for use in adults in May 1997 and for children last
October.
</P>
<P>
   The development of technology that would apply laser light to
the repair of decaying teeth is the culmination of nearly four
decades of research and development. A variety of obstacles
presented themselves, chief among them the heat generated by the
laser that could damage the nerve of the tooth and destroy the
fiber optic material needed to deliver the laser beam to the tooth
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Momtaheni, an oral surgeon in New York and clinical
professor at the Columbia University School of Dentistry, said that
the new lasers were ``extremely important and opened a whole new
era'' to a field that for centuries has been associated with pain
and suffering to almost anyone whose teeth began to decay.
</P>
<P>
   Both Momtaheni and Dr. H. Jinder Khurana, a New York dentist and
program chairman of the annual New York Dental Meeting held last
week for some 24,000 colleagues, said the use of the lasers caused
no side effects in the clinical trials and early use in dentists'
offices, but cautioned that, as with all new technology, hidden
problems could emerge.
</P>
<P>
   The laser technology ``must be carefully watched for possible
adverse side effects that may arise in the future,'' Khurana said.
</P>
<P>
   A race to harness the new technology had been on since 1964,
when Dr. Leo Goldman, director of the dermatology department at the
University of Cincinnati, began experimenting with lasers _
powerful, highly focused beams of light. He tried placing various
combinations of chemical elements or compounds _ holmium,
neodymium, yttrium and lithium among them _ in crystalline
cylinders and shooting rays of ordinary light at them.
</P>
<P>
   The hope was to activate or excite the electrons in the
chemicals to create light with just the right wave length and
energy to cut tooth enamel without overheating. But the right
chemical combinations proved elusive.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until the 1980s that a team of researchers from
academic and private business research groups, led by Dr. Myron
Wohlbarsht at Duke University and Dr. Robert Freiberg representing
academic and private research groups, hit upon erbium, which in
combination with other elements, produced the correct wave length
to cut tooth enamel, and the team received a patent for the idea in
1987. But the overheating problem persisted when they tried to use
it in animal studies.
</P>
<P>
   In the following four years Freiberg, and his team came up with
the idea of adding water to absorb enough of the heat before the
laser was shot out of the cylinder. The team also reported applying
air or water spray to the teeth during its experiments and clinical
trials for added cooling and to make the cutting more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Colette Cozean, an original member of Freiberg's team, said
in an interview that the FDA then began a review of the laser data
and found it supported the claims made for it. Premier Laser
Systems of Irvine, Calif., was granted approval for the treatment
of adults and later for children.
</P>
<P>
   A second manufacturer, Biolase Technology of San Clemente,
Calif., which developed a slightly different technology, was given
the go-ahead in October for laser work on some but not all types of
adult cavities.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wayne T. Wozniak of the American Dental Association's
council on scientific affairs, agreed that the laser was an
important new tool for dentistry, but added cautionary notes to
those of Momtaheni and Khurana. He warned that it is possible for
lasers to damage a tooth and cause pain if they penetrate too
deeply and strike at the heart of the nerve.
</P>
<P>
   Wozniak also said that the laser would not replace the drill
completely. It was not, for example, given approval for removing
metal-based fillings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But both Dr. Cozean, now the chief executive of Premier, and
Jeffrey W. Jones, chief executive of Biolase, said that approval
has never been given for drilling out metal fillings either,
because no one knows the effects that escaping gases or particles
may have on the mouth. The correct way to remove a filling, they
said, is to cut around it and remove it with a dental pick.
</P>
<P>
   They added that a laser in the hands of one who is not properly
trained to use it, can, as with the user of a drill, cause damage.
But they in normal and proper use it does not and, if it does hit
the nerve, they said, it causes neither damage nor pain.
</P>
<P>
   The computer-enhanced X-ray technology was developed in 1994 in
a cellar in Queens at the home of David B. Schick, now president
and chief executive of Schick Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Since then it has been refined so that, as of a few months ago,
the new bigger, brighter, easier to read X-ray image of the inside
of a patient's mouth, can be called up on dentists' lap-tops, if
they have more than one treatment room and want to carry the X-ray
images from room to room, or on a large computer on a console.

TWO LESSER KNOWN SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES ACCOUNT FOR MOST NEW

<P>
   Among sexually transmitted diseases, syphilis, herpes,
chlamydia, gonorrhea and HIV are probably the best known. However,
a report released last week shows that two lesser known infections
_ human papillomavirus and trichomoniasis _ actually account for
two-thirds of new cases of the diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers convened by the American Social Health Association,
who prepared the report for the Kaiser Family Foundation, said that
better detection of some sexually transmitted diseases, or STD's,
was responsible for a jump in new cases in the United States _ from
the often cited figure of 12 million, which was released by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the mid-1980s to an
estimated 15.3 million new cases in 1996, the last year for which
statistics are available.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is good news and bad news in the report,'' said Dr.
Willard Cates, Jr., president of Family Health International in
Research Triangle Park, N.C., and chairman of the research panel
that prepared the report. ``Better detection offers a great
opportunity to treat the spread of STD, but it has also shown that
the epidemic is bigger than previously thought.''
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that an estimated 5.5 million Americans
contract human papillomavirus every year and 20 million people
already have this incurable viral infection. It is generally
characterized by soft, itchy warts in and around the genitals, and
can lead to cervical cancer in women. Cervical cancer is
responsible for 5,000 deaths a year in the United States, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 90 percent of cases of invasive carcinoma of the cervix
there is evidence of HPV,'' said Dr. Vanessa Cullins, an
obstetrician-gynecologist and medical director of AVSC
International, a nonprofit organization involved in reproductive
health. New tests that detect the DNA of the virus have improved
diagnosis of the disease, Dr. Cullins added.
</P>
<P>
   Though awareness of trichomoniasis has increased over the past
decade, it remains difficult to detect. As many as five million
Americans contract it every year, but many do not know they have
this parasitic infection. In men there are often no signs of the
infection, while symptoms in women include discharge with an
unpleasant odor, which is often confused with yeast infection.
Trichomoniasis can be cured with antibiotics; untreated, it can
lead to preterm labor in pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most women have never heard of trich, because they only know
about yeast,'' said Dr. Sharon Hillier, an associate professor of
obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University
of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. ``At our clinic, one-third of the
women treat themselves with an antifungal before they even walk in
the door,'' she said, referring to the over-the-counter medication
for yeast infection.

WITH HERBS, A `FULLER PALETTE' FOR SKIN CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By NANCY BETH JACKSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid the recent blitz of scientific studies on the effectiveness
of herbal treatments, Dr. Alan Dattner, a dermatologist, stepped
back to take a look at several herbal preparations that have
sometimes been used to treat common dermatological problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the November issue of Archives of Dermatology, he and his
co-author, Dr. Donald Brown, a New Jersey-based naturopathic
physician and editor of The Quarterly Review of Natural Medicine,
noted that many doctors offered both prescription medicines and
herbal preparations to their patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of a fuller palette of treatment,'' Dattner
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two doctors from different traditions do not claim to break
any new ground in this paper. ``We discuss some common herbal
preparations historically used for dermatological conditions and
recent studies that support their use,'' the doctors wrote in their
review.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional practice of topically treating dermatological
conditions with plant-derived medicines predates the cultures of
ancient Egypt and remains vital today in the United States and
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the herbal preparations, associated with various skin
conditions, can be found in health food stores. Experts caution
that patients using herbs should discuss them with their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   DERMATITIS _ This condition, which Dr. Dattner calls ``the
wastebasket'' of skin inflammation, covers a variety of nonspecific
complaints, which can be as common _ and as annoying _ as diaper
rash and eczema.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional treatment for skin rashes has included powerful
topical steroids, antibiotics and Vitamin A. Brown and Dattner
suggest the pot marigold as an herbal substitute. Calendula
officinalis, as the marigold is called, is the basis for topical
creams used when an antiseptic or antifungal effect is needed.
Herbalists have traditionally used it in treating burns, bruises,
cuts and diaper rash.
</P>
<P>
   Chamomile, a member of the daisy family that is mainly known as
a calming tea, has been used in a number of topical products to
ease dermatitis.
</P>
<P>
   Studies using a chamomile cream produced in Frankfurt, Germany,
found it 60 percent as effective as hydrocortisone in one trial and
``about as effective'' in another, Brown and Dattner say.
</P>
<P>
   Plantain, not the banana but a low-growing perennial as common
in lawns as the dandelion, has a folk history of reducing the
swelling and pain of insect stings and treating rattlesnake bites.
Although clinical studies are limited to reports of its usefulness
in easing poison ivy rashes and healing wounds, Dr. Dattner has
found that applying crushed plantain leaves to the site helps
reduce the itch and swelling of bug bites.
</P>
<P>
   PSORIASIS _ The cause of this chronic scaling-skin disease is
unknown. Conventional treatment includes exposure to sunlight,
topical steroids, lubricating creams and coal tar ointments. In
more severe cases, patients are treated with ultraviolet light,
Dattner said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the topical anti-inflammatory herbal agents used to
treat dermatitis may help, but few studies have looked at herbal
treatment for psoriasis.
</P>
<P>
   A capsaicin cream, derived from cayenne peppers, is perhaps the
best plant-related product, the two doctors say. They point to two
clinical trials in which application of the cream led to a
``significant'' reduction in scaling and redness, but with the
adverse effect of a burning sensation where applied.
</P>
<P>
   Aloe vera, a familiar beauty and health product used to soothe,
heal and moisturize the skin, was tested as a topic treatment in a
Pakistani study of 60 subjects with slight to moderate chronic
psoriasis. The aloe group reported significantly greater
improvement than the placebo group.
</P>
<P>
   SIMPLEX LABIALIS _ This recurrent viral infection, in which cold
sores typically appear around the mouth, has no known cure.
Standard treatment involves antiviral drugs that can speed the
course of the virus and reduce symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon balm, which herbalists also know as melissa, smells like
lemons and has been used as an herbal substitute.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors report a 1994 study in which a lemon balm extract
cream brought complete healing in 96 percent of the patients after
seven days with only three patients reporting a burning sensation
at the site of application.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors urge further study of herbal treatment to document
its effects in ``an acceptable scientific manner,'' and also remind
their fellow practitioners that many herbs have already been used
by patients who learned their applications from their parents and
grandparents. Understanding how doctor-prescribed and herbal
treatments can complement one another adds to effectiveness of
medical treatment, they said.

 By CLAUDIA DREIFUS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Martin Wells, 70, grandson of H.G. Wells, retired reader in
zoology at Cambridge University, one of the world's great experts
on cephalopods and author of the just released, ``Civilization and
the Limpet'' (Perseus, $22), can speak for hours about the wonders
of cuttlefish, squids and octopuses _ his specialty and great
passion.
</P>
<P>
   He held forth on a recent November afternoon in his sprawling
17th century house in Cambridge, England, while his wife, Joyce,
put together a supper of steamed vegetables and cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Q. If there were such a thing as a vivisectionist's
Anti-Defamation League, you'd be heading it. What's good about
vivisection?
</P>
<P>
   A. Knowledge! I am proud to say that I've been a practicing
vivisectionist all my life. I work on octopuses and squids and
things like that, when I'm not eating them.
</P>
<P>
   My point is, if you want to conserve animals, you've got to know
how they work and what they need to survive. There are a good many
things that can only be found out about animals, and people, by
doing experiments.
</P>
<P>
   If you look at squids and octopuses _ my specialty _ practically
every darn thing we know about how nerves work, has been worked out
from squid nerves.
</P>
<P>
   That's because squids have good, big, nerves you can put
electrodes into. Unless you're prepared to cut up a few squids to
get that material, there's no way we'd learn how nerves work.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you say you eat your experimental subjects?
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh, when my wife and I were first married, I had a job on the
staff of Naples Zoological Station in Italy, and we were very
impoverished. So of course, we ate our experimental animals. The
only thing we had to do for the laboratory was save their brains.
We ate calamari till we got pig-sick of it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why is squid, by and large, your specialty?
</P>
<P>
   A. I find them fascinating. The whole group _ squids, octopuses,
cuttlefish _ are interesting because they are animals, which, by
and large, live on their wits. They react to the same sorts of
things we react to. You can look at them and understand their
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing I like about squids is that they are predominantly
visual animals. They see things coming and assess them. They have
to learn a lot in their life because they grow from millimeters to
meters long, and if you think about that, you realize that who is
an enemy and who is potential prey alter throughout the lifetime.
And they've got to be adaptive in that way.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do squids have anything like a language?
</P>
<P>
   A. It depends on how you define ``language.'' If you define it
as anything that has grammar and syntax, then you are in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Some people would say that squids have a form of communication
and can indicate quite complicated things like, ``Hey, there's a
predator coming, chaps _ let's move over.'' Squids can signal to
other squids what sex they are and what condition they are in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it worth approaching me with a view to mating or not?'' Or,
``Get out, I'm bigger than you are and I'm after that squidess over
there.'' Whether they can say anything more complicated than that
is to be debated.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Your books on zoological subjects are breezy, easy to read.
How do your Cambridge colleagues feel about your being ... a
popularizer?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think it's rather approved of, though that wasn't always
true. When I first joined my department in the early 1950s, there
was the feeling that people who did broadcasts and wrote pop stuff
should keep quiet about it.
</P>
<P>
   And I used to write BBC pieces that went on in the half-times of
concerts. They'd buy anything _ so long as it lasted exactly six
minutes. So, I wrote pieces on snails and bats, and that raised a
few eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things I wonder about now, is _ why bother to write
pop books when there are all those marvelous nature programs on
television? You look at some of these and you think, ``How much
work has gone into getting those shots!''
</P>
<P>
   The stuff that David Attenborough does is certainly wonderful.
He was almost a contemporary here at Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   He took the same courses I did, and in fact, the big ``Life on
Earth'' series, which really put him on the map, I could recognize
large chunks of it. Some of it reminded me very much of the
lectures that one of our professors used to give.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. You've written that you never wanted to be anything else but
a zoologist. When did you know that for certain?
</P>
<P>
   A. As a child, I used to collect things out of the river and put
them into aquariums. I went to nearby rivers for specimens because
this was during World War II and you couldn't get near the coast _
it was mined. So I never met any marine animals at all, until I was
16 or so. After the war, my parents took me to France and there I
discovered a mask and snorkel and saw things that I had only heard
about in books. That's what got me into it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. David Attenborough once told me that as a boy he also
collected butterflies and lizards. Is the practice a sign of a
budding zoologist?
</P>
<P>
   A. It used to be. The sad thing now is that in my department
here in Cambridge there is only a handful of us who probably can
tell one animal from another. The rest are molecular biologists and
model-makers. There are sort of mutually incomprehensible languages
taught in my subject now.
</P>
<P>
   My elder son is a veterinarian who has' gone into molecular
biology to do research into muscular dystrophy. When he and his
wife are discussing their work, I practically can't understand
them.
</P>
<P>
   In the Biology Department in Cambridge, you'll meet more people
who know about the movement of calcium within cells than who know
how a mollusk moves. Now, I do think it's good to move a subject
forward.
</P>
<P>
   But the sad thing is that they miss so much. Whole animals,
whole plants, are such lovely things. I just can't feel the same
way about a molecule coursing its way through a cell.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you read much of your grandfather's science fiction?
</P>
<P>
   A. Of course. I think of him as one of the first popular writers
to cash in on his scientific education. He got scholarships to come
to London and learn biology under T.H. Huxley. But in his time
there weren't really any posts for professional scientists. So what
H.G. did was use his education in stories. ``The Time Machine'' was
a straight application of the idea of evolution into the future.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are your recollections of your grandfather?
</P>
<P>
   A. When I was a child, H.G. used to come down for the weekends
and play with us, the grandchildren. He died when I was about 16.
The problem was that the time when I might have got to know him was
during the war. And he rather bloody-mindedly insisted on living in
the middle of London. And, of course, you didn't take the
grandchildren up to London during the war because it was being
fairly consistently bombed. So apart from the occasional weekend, I
never really got to know him. Which is very sad.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was a biologist. I would have liked to gossip with
him. But by the time I had gotten into the biology fray, he had
faded out.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you tried your own hand at science fiction?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. I've done a couple of novels, which I haven't sold to a
publisher. I'm a fan of the kind of science fiction where you are
allowed about one variable that you can alter and then you follow
through the consequences of that.
</P>
<P>
   And my own pieces are like that. For instance, I've written a
genetic engineering story about triggering elements of a rerun of
vertebrate evolution.
</P>
<P>
   It starts out with a young man who works on amphibians and who's
brought in as a consultant because all these strange amphibians
have been turning up. This triggers a whole lot of events which end
up with the evolution of primates again.
</P>
<P>
   Another story I've written is about dolphins becoming a plague _
they become a ravenous beast in response to overfishing.
</P>
<P>
   The only adaptive response that dolphins could make to it was to
breed more readily.
</P>
<P>
   Q. One senses from this that you're not such a fan of everyone's
favorite marine mammals _ whales and dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   A. I find dolphins overrated. They are beautiful animals, but
I'm not sure they're as smart as they are made out to be.
</P>
<P>
   And on what grounds whales are supposed to be intelligent has
always rather beaten me. Anything that spends its life looking for
rather easy-to-find krill isn't much better than a cow in the
field, is it? If what you eat is grass, grass doesn't struggle to
escape very much. No, I can't believe that whales are very smart.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe killer whales, because hunting takes skill. The most
interesting animals are the ones living complicated lives because
they have to solve a lot of problems.
</P>
<P>
   I think I'm perhaps unusual in that I find many of the
invertebrates as interesting as birds and mammals. Nautilus snails,
think about them: They are ancient! It's a mystery of an animal and
it lives at great depths. It's one of these classic living fossil
animals. You can't tell about the soft parts, but if you look at
the shell, you can find pretty much the same shell in fossils from
the time of the dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So let me ask a Barbara Walters sort of question, if you
could be a Nautilus snail or a squid, which would you be?
</P>
<P>
   A. Squid, without a question. I think your life is more
interesting, but deeply stressful.

   ISRAEL-POLITICS (Jerusalem) _ Facing possible defeat over a bill
calling for early elections, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu engineered a motion of no-confidence in his own

BRASSAI IMAGES REVEAL ARTIST'S PURSUIT OF PERFECT TRUTH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (An idiaeresis, or double dot, needed over i in Brassai; accent
mark needed over second a in Halasz) 
 
(Attn: Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.) 
 
By PATRICIA C. JOHNSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Brassai did not make photography his medium until he
was 31 years old. But once claimed, it became the tool of his
passionate eye, oracular in its portrayal of a richly textured
world.
</P>
<P>
   Artists, opium smokers, thugs, children and aristocracy captured
in gelatin silver prints are part of it. So are the breathtaking
bridges of Paris, a humble thimble and the inopportune rear end of
a race horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brassai: The Eye of Paris'' runs through Feb. 28 at the Museum
of Fine Arts in Houston, then it will travel to the J. Paul Getty
Museum in Los Angeles and the National Gallery of Art in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brassai: The Eye of Paris'' gathers the images into a major
exhibition 15 years in the making. Curated by Anne W. Tucker, head
of the museum's department of photography, the landmark show
celebrates the centennial of the artist's birth in 1899 and offers
the first in-depth look at his work since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Born Gyula Halasz in Brasso, the Hungarian town from which he
drew his pseudonym, the artist made Paris his home from the age of
25. Brassa, Tucker writes, ``had an intimate relationship with
Paris. Day by day, evening after evening for 40 years, he
systematically explored her with the leisure of a lover.''
</P>
<P>
   He was part of the heady intellectual and artistic ferment of
Paris in the 1920s and 1930s. His friends were writers such as
Henry Miller and Paul Reverdy, painters and sculptors such as Pablo
Picasso, Henri Matisse and Alberto Giacometti. He explored all of
the city, from its bridges and monuments to its hidden corners, and
all of its citizens, be they aristocrats, artists, prostitutes or
hoodlums.
</P>
<P>
   He made his mark with the series ``Paris de nuit'' (Paris by
Night). This outstanding collection of images shows Paris as we
dream it and want to remember it _ misty air, soft gaslight,
romantic bridges arching over the Seine, thick walls and broad
avenues shrouded in silvery tones and whispered promises. Published
in book form in 1932, it won Brassa the appellation ``the eye of
Paris'' _ coined by Miller _ and international admiration. It also,
and forever, influenced photographers shooting cities and night
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   He dissimulated carefully planned compositions in a veil of
spontaneity. He focused on scenes that interested him and waited
till that which he hoped would happen happened. Many times his
subjects were accomplices, fully aware of the photographer's
presence but forgetting or ignoring it, thus affording him the
moment of perfect truth he sought.
</P>
<P>
   This patient willfulness is most evident in ``Secret Paris of
the '30s.'' The series, which followed ``Paris de nuit,'' is a
composite portrait of the underworld of libertines and criminals of
all descriptions. Chorus girls in dishabille backstage at the
Folies Bergre, a pair of hoods smoking in the street, prostitutes,
a lesbian couple in a coffeehouse are among the unforgettable
pictures that remained unpublished for four decades. They may be
candid, but it is obvious that the protagonists had to tolerate, if
not necessarily collaborate with, the photographer.
</P>
<P>
   In two of the pictures, one of Brassa's bodyguards _ a necessary
precaution when he ventured into the demimonde that did not
necessarily welcome him _ posed for the lens. He's the man in the
famous photograph ``Introductions at Suzy's'' (a brothel in the
Latin Quarter), which shows three naked prostitutes from the back.
He is also the customer in another bordello scene who dresses while
the woman sits at intimate toilette. The camera's vantage point
couldn't be any other than bedside. One wouldn't suspect
playacting, so casual and believable do the scenes appear, yet they
are composed with the care and fine illumination accorded other
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Brassa's probing eye also focused on artists and their work. A
commission from Harper's Bazaar after World War II led him to
photograph sculptures in Picasso's studio. Among them is a plaster
cast attentively documenting the artist's hand, the hand that
redefined the 20th-century vision. &UR;  &LR; Another sculpture, the
emblematic bronze skull ``Death's Head,'' was taken for a book in
1943 at Picasso's request.
</P>
<P>
   Portraiture, many believe, is the photographer's greatest
strength. Here is a character study of Miller dated 1932-34. He
leans against a door frame in a light-colored trench coat,
characteristic owl-like eyeglasses and the unmistakable ``mandarin
smile'' that Brassa described. Picasso, with whom the photographer
shared a decades-long friendship, is the subject of many pictures,
two of which are included here.
</P>
<P>
   Also from this period is a portrait of Marianne
Delaunay-Belleville, or Madame D.-B., as Brassa referred to her.
She was an aristocrat and accomplished pianist who befriended the
impoverished young Brassa, new to Paris, and became his mentor,
patron and entre into high society.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1948 portrait of Giacometti, Brassa gives us a photograph
in shades of silver and black velvet, a privileged look at a
sculptor famous for his shyness. He is seated on a sagging, worn
mattress layered with newspapers. His intense eyes are clear and
look straight back at us from beneath black curls. He wears a dark,
dog-eared jacket and pants, and holds a sculpture against his knee.
This sculpture _ a skeletal, startling white arm _ extends across
the picture plane from behind the artist's right shoulder and
across his chest to seemingly grasp the left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of children, like the delighted little boy in ``Balloon
Seller, Montsouris Park'' (1931-34), and of elegant women at social
events counter the dark underworld Brassa frequented during the
same period. There is the graffiti he admired _ especially the kind
gouged out of walls, which he described as the poor man's sculpture
and which include the only two color photographs in the exhibition.
His pictures for Harper's range from the sober image of two cloaked
old men deep in conversation in Madrid to the humorous
juxtaposition of a comparatively tiny statue of Napoleon and the
large woman who promenades past it on a New Orleans street.
</P>
<P>
   Brassa began as a journalist and studied drawing in Budapest's
and Berlin's art academies before moving to Paris. Of his
commitment to photography, he wrote, ``It is not enough for the
artist of today to express the meaning of our age; he must express
it in the modern medium. Our generation can only recognize itself
completely in images expressed in the new languages of our century.
Hence the power (and) prestige of the cinema and of photography.''
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't forsake the written word or other art media when
he picked up the camera. Increasingly after the war, he returned to
those expressive routes. Tucker has included a handful of Brassa's
sculptures and drawings _ animated, sensual works that, like the
palm-size ``Almond Woman,'' recall Cycladic figurines.
</P>
<P>
   Around 1962, Brassa stopped making photographs and dedicated
himself to writing. By the time of his death in 1984, he had
published 17 books of his photographs and accompanying texts. Among
them are two on Picasso and two more on Miller. ``If you want to
know about me, read Brassa's book,'' Picasso said of ``Picasso &AMP;
Co.,'' published in 1966. His 18th book, on French novelist Marcel
Proust, was finished shortly before his death and will be published
in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had perfect memory,'' Tucker said, ``and he was a great
raconteur.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his subjects _ including Marie, his cleaning lady, and
the taxi driver who delivered a monologue during a ride one
Christmas Eve _ would recognize themselves in his narratives, and
whether it was important that they do so, Brassa replied no.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meaning of art is not authenticity,'' he wrote, ``but the
expression of authenticity.''
</P>
<P>
   Always, the viewer walks away knowing more, understanding better
than before encountering his pictures.

NEW TEXAS CONSTITUTION FOR THE NEXT MILLENNIUM? 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ State Sen. Bill Ratliff and state Rep. Rob
Junell, two legislative heavyweights who have taken on one of the
most difficult tasks in the Free World, are correct.
</P>
<P>
   Texas needs a new state constitution. Texas is able to govern
itself under the present charter, adopted in 1876 at the end of
Reconstruction, only because the document has been amended more
than 370 times to try to keep pace with modernization.
</P>
<P>
   Today's urban Texas bears little resemblance to the rural,
frontier state that existed when the present constitution was
written as Texans were emerging from the darkest period in the
state's history.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Texas is preparing to enter not only a new century, but
also a new millennium. What better time, Ratliff and Junell ask, to
bring the structure of state government into the modern age?
</P>
<P>
   The mere fact that the two veteran, well-respected legislative
leaders _ one a Republican, the other a Democrat _ are sponsoring
the constitutional revision effort means that it will get a full
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But, having watched the last attempt at overhauling the
constitution go down in flaming defeat in 1974 and 1975, I am not
ready to place any bets on their success yet.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional convention of 1974 was not a pretty sight.
Its members, or delegates, were the 181 members of the Legislature,
who met for several months in the House chamber. It ended in
failure on its last night, coming up three votes short of the
two-thirds vote necessary to send a new constitution to Texas
voters for ratification.
</P>
<P>
   The key fight ultimately was over a business-backed attempt to
lock into the constitution the state's right-to-work law, which
prohibits union membership as a condition of employment.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor bitterly fought the proposal. And although labor
ran a poor second _ and still does _ to business in the hearts and
minds of Texas lawmakers, unions had enough clout to block a
two-thirds vote.
</P>
<P>
   There also were other obstacles. County officials and numerous
special interests, who are protected by many constitutional
provisions, fought any effort to remove those provisions.
</P>
<P>
   And the legislator-delegates were very susceptible to
special-interest lobbyists, particularly since the convention was
held in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders tried to revive the revision effort during
the 1975 regular session by offering a new constitution to the
voters in the form of several constitutional amendments, with
right-to-work and other particularly controversial provisions
deleted.
</P>
<P>
   But the voters rejected all the amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the blame went to then-Gov. Dolph Briscoe, who came out
against all the amendments only three weeks before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers also blamed the voters' reaction on a distrust of
any constitution written by legislators. The public's distrust of
government had been heightened by the Sharpstown stock fraud
scandal, which had recently rocked state government, and the
Watergate scandal, which had recently forced the resignation of
President Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff and Junell aren't proposing a new constitutional
convention but a new constitution in the form of one constitutional
amendment, which would have to be ratified by voters if it wins
legislative approval on a two-thirds vote during next year's
regular session.
</P>
<P>
   And, with Sharpstown and Watergate little more than items in the
history books now, they hope the public will have more trust in
lawmakers this time.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative sponsors also have taken steps to defuse some
potential fights. Right-to-work, for example, isn't in their
proposed constitution. And although they would give the governor
sweeping new appointment powers over many judges and executive
officeholders, the offices of lieutenant governor, comptroller and
attorney general would remain elective.
</P>
<P>
   But there isn't much reason to think that the special interests
who helped scuttle the last effort to rewrite the constitution will
be any less willing to give up their special constitutional
benefits or protections now _ or that lawmakers will be any less
willing to listen to them.
</P>
<P>
   And any of numerous provisions could become controversial enough
to sink the entire effort if the Legislature does put a new charter
on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   One is a proposal by Ratliff and Junell to establish a salary
commission, which would remove the voters' long-held power to veto
legislative pay raises.
</P>
<P>
   Another key factor could be Gov. George W. Bush. With his
overwhelming popularity, the governor could become an effective
salesman for a new constitution. But Bush may prefer to avoid that
fight, particularly if he is preparing to launch a presidential
bid.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be accurate to say that Ratliff and Junell are
dreaming an impossible dream. But they are getting ready to have
one whale of an experience.

MANUFACTURERS WRESTLE OVER ON-LINE SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you want to shop at www.macys.com instead of
trudging down to the mall this holiday season, don't bother looking
for Levi's jeans or Levi's Dockers brand _ you won't find them.
</P>
<P>
   Levi Strauss &AMP; Co., which started selling Levi's and Dockers on
its Web sites (www.levi.com and www.dockers.com) within a week of
Macy's in November, won't allow Macy's or any other retailer to
sell the products on line. The company wants its cyberstores to be
the only place to buy Levi merchandise through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As an increasing number of manufacturers start to sell directly
to customers through the Internet, a growing concern emerges. It's
known as ``channel conflict'' _ the head-to-head competition
created between manufacturers and the brick-and-mortar retailers
that sell the manufacturer's goods.
</P>
<P>
   Channel conflict is ``a huge problem,'' said Barry Parr, an
analyst with the market research company International Data Corp.
``It is not easy to change a distribution system.''
</P>
<P>
   Many manufacturers have chosen not to sell on line, either
because they lack the infrastructure to sell and ship merchandise
directly or they don't want to upset the solid relationship they
have established with their resellers. Others are selling on line,
but lessen possible conflicts by opting not to offer any promotions
or special deals.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, channel conflict was more of a fear than a real
problem. Many manufacturers and department stores had World Wide
Web sites for the sole purpose of building customer awareness and
brand image, not for direct transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Web sales have been dominated by on-line retailers, such as the
video store Reel.com and giant bookseller Amazon.com., companies
whose entire business is Web-based. Also relatively quick to go on
line were such retailers as the Gap and L.L. Bean, which compete
with their own stores and catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Now traditional stores and manufacturers have realized they will
lose ground to on-line retailers unless they sell directly through
the World Wide Web. New York-based Jupiter Communications estimates
shoppers will spend $2.3 billion through on-line outlets this
holiday season, up from $1.1 billion last year. They also have
become less worried that on-line sales will cannibalize store sales
and are more confident in the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be hard pressed in a year or two to find a manufacturer
that doesn't sell something on line,'' said Erina DuBois, digital
commerce analyst for Dataquest Inc. in San Jose, Calif. ``It's an
area you cannot not play in.''
</P>
<P>
   But right now, manufacturer-direct on-line sales are still not
that common. According to an Ernst &AMP; Young study produced with the
National Retail Federation early this year, only 9 percent of
manufacturers currently sell on the Web; an additional 12 percent
have plans to do so eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will continue to be flare-ups, but retailers who get
caught up in that are missing the point,'' Ernst &AMP; Young spokesman
Keith Hark said. ``The point isn't whether or not they are cutting
a little here or there into each other's businesses. You have to
accommodate the customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Web watchers say the way this delicate relationship between
manufacturer and distributor will be played out will depend on the
companies, their products and their on-line goals.
</P>
<P>
   What Levi has decided is that a reseller may not have the time
or money to sell Levi products on line the way Levi wants it done.
Levi established www.levi.com in 1995 and www.dockers.com the
following year, but just started selling on the sites last month.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McSpadden, director of e-commerce for the Dockers brand,
said the company spent the past year interviewing customers about
what they want from an on-line store. The site offers such features
as interactive changing rooms and a ``fit calculator'' for women.
</P>
<P>
   McSpadden said Levi's decision to bar other retailers from
selling its products on line has nothing to do with its
relationship with its resellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not an issue between Macy's and Levi Strauss on
this,'' he said. ``This is just a different business model for both
Levi and Macy's.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent Anderson, president of Macys.com, said there was no rift
between Macy's and Levi or Dockers. ``I can't explain and do not
know the entire explanation behind why they chose to go this
route,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said no similar problems have arisen with other
manufacturers. He admitted several vendors were reluctant about
Macy's on-line plans when first approached, but changed their minds
once the concept was explained.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taking a different approach is New York-based Estee Lauder Cos.
Inc., which last month launched a selling site for its Clinique
brand. Estee Lauder is also the parent company of cosmetic
companies Aveda, Prescriptives, MAC, Aramis, Bobbi Brown and
Origins.
</P>
<P>
   Estee Lauder maintains that department stores have brought the
company to where it is today and it intends to be sensitive to
those retailers. That means handling on-line sales differently for
each of its brands.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Clinique can be purchased at www.clinique.com, a
site established three years ago that just started selling direct
last month. Estee Lauder also sells Clinique and Estee Lauder
products through Macys.com after successful pilot tests.
</P>
<P>
   But when Bobbi Brown customers log onto the site at
www.bobbibrowncosmetics.com and make a purchase, the transaction is
handled by Neiman Marcus through a joint venture arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   And in February, Origins becomes available on-line. The brand
already has its own separate, established distribution network
because it is sold through catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an either-or proposition,'' said Angela Kapps,
Estee Lauder's vice president of special markets and new media.
``The reality is our products will be sold on line in a lot of
places. You will be able to buy where it's convenient to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapps likens channel conflict to what happened when designers
opened their own stores. ``Back in the '70s when Ralph Lauren
opened its first store down the street from Bloomingdale's, people
said, how could you do that?'' she said. ``But then it wound up
increasing sales in both places.''
</P>
<P>
   DuBois advocates a sort of ``happy medium'' approach toward
dealing with the manufacturer-reseller relationship. She said
exclusive selling sites are not ideal in forming those
relationships, but manufacturers may want to limit the number of
sites that sell their products to ensure quality control.
</P>
<P>
   Parr, of International Data Corp., said there are no easy
answers, but on-line selling will become virtually mandatory for
manufacturers and traditional stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not selling on the Web, you've got a big problem,''
Parr said. ``When these kind of shifts take place in the
marketplace, you may find you're damned if you do, damned if you
don't.''

   Most people who have not been there, and some who have, picture
Switzerland the way that Ernest Hemingway described it
three-quarters of a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Switzerland is a small, steep country, much more up and down
than sideways, and is all stuck over with large brown hotels built
on the cuckoo clock style of architecture,'' wrote Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   And the citizens of Switzerland are usually thought of as
practical people, more upright than broad-minded on issues of
morality, politics and lifestyle, a people not given to the ready
embrace of cuckoo ideas.
</P>
<P>
   How came it, then, that the staid people who dwell in that place
of snowcapped mountains, placid lakes and unimposing architecture
went to the polls last weekend and voted on the outlandish notion
of legalizing ``the consumption, cultivation or possession of
drugs, and their acquisition for personal use''?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Swiss sensibly rejected that cuckoo idea
overwhelmingly. That was predictable. Even the proponents of the
constitutional amendment to legalize drugs, those who collected the
100,000 signatures to put it on the ballot, knew it wouldn't pass.
</P>
<P>
   And many of them were relieved that it didn't because they
really were not wed firmly to the idea of taking prohibitions off
the sale and distribution of hard drugs such as cocaine and heroin.
</P>
<P>
   What they were really seeking was freedom to use such soft drugs
as marijuana, which is not a cuckoo idea by any means.
</P>
<P>
   Neither, really, is total legalization of drugs on a conceptual
level. It is worth talking about, particularly in the context of
pointing out how current drug policy is failing.
</P>
<P>
   But it will never happen. Certainly not in the United States.
Contrary to a lot of misinformation, it has not happened in the
Netherlands. In fact, the closest it has come to happening anywhere
in the world has been in Switzerland. And it was rejected there by
76 percent of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   If it wouldn't fly in Switzerland, it wouldn't stand a
snowball's chance in a Central Texas summer of becoming public
policy in the good old U.S. of A. After all, the practical,
conservative Swiss already have demonstrated that they are far more
progressive on the subject of drugs than most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   That became abundantly clear last year when Swiss voters
overwhelmingly endorsed state distribution of heroin to hardened
addicts. The Swiss sensibly concluded that it would be more
profitable to their society to provide the addicts with what they
need and allow them to be productive citizens than to leave them no
choice but to obtain their drugs from criminals and commit crimes
to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that there is a considerable body of American
public opinion that even rejects methadone distribution to addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Although full decriminalization of drugs in Switzerland, the
United States or any other country doesn't appear to be in the
cards, discussion of the notion needs to continue as a counterpoint
to the failing policies of pouring increasing millions into
minimally productive interdiction efforts, incarcerating thousands
on minor drug offenses, and building more jails and prisons to
contain the offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Out of that clash of extremes can evolve more understanding of
the need to emphasize and fund treatment and to de-emphasize
punishment for relatively minor drug offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the successful initiatives in Washington, Alaska,
Arizona, Oregon and Nevada derived some of their driving force from
the general discussion of drug decriminalization.
</P>
<P>
   The standard argument for decriminalization is that it would
take the profit out of drug trafficking and reduce the crime and
violence associated with it. That may or may not be true. The fact
is that drug trafficking is profitable because people in this
country and around the world crave drugs to fill a void in their
lives, some existential need that is not satisfied by their work,
their personal relationships or their systems of belief.
</P>
<P>
   Decriminalization may take some of the crime out of drug use,
but it would likely be no more effective in reducing addiction than
the repeal of prohibition on curbing alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's worth talking about because as real drug policy, it
is no more cuckoo than what now masquerades as the war on drugs.

SEVEN WEEKS AFTER FLOOD, SOME IN SOUTH TEXAS TOWN STILL HOMELESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY BINGHAM 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CUERO, Texas _ The old blue Dodge spews smoke from its muffler
as Miss Ora B. Wesley steers the car onto Hamilton Street. She
drives around heaps of trash piled in front of every house. Hers is
the last on the left.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Wesley, as everyone calls her, parks at the corner and
lifts a bucket of cleaning supplies and a pair of rubber gloves
from the back seat. She walks as far as the front porch before she
has to take off her bifocals and wipe her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Some days, she gets inside before the stench of river water
overwhelms her. Other days, she makes it through all the rooms
before the broken picture window, the buckled walls, the
mud-covered floors make her teary.
</P>
<P>
   It's been like this nearly every day since the October flood.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Wesley turns around and gets back in the car. On days like
this, she drives around the neighborhood and asks herself, If her
mother and daddy were still living, could they stand it? Could they
stand to see trash in the trees and houses washed off their
foundations?
</P>
<P>
   Her entire neighborhood flooded, even her church. Two of her
daughters lost their homes, too. On days like this, 75-year-old
Miss Wesley gets in the car and just drives. She wonders, Will this
place ever be home again?
</P>
<P>
   IT SWALLOWED EVERYTHING: The day the Guadalupe River overflowed,
Miss Wesley was not at home. It was Monday, Oct. 19. A weekend rain
had flooded some of the two-lane roads on the outskirts of town, so
school was closed.
</P>
<P>
   When Miss Wesley retired as assistant supervisor of housekeeping
at the Cuero Community Hospital, she agreed to baby-sit the
Shoemaker children. She cleaned the family's bed-and-breakfast inn,
so she already knew the two boys and the little girl.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Wesley was with the children at their house the morning the
river marched out of its banks. She had seen the rain in San
Antonio and in the Hill Country, but that was hours away. No one in
Cuero, an old farming town of 6,700 people, expected any serious
flooding, at least not for a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   But the river grew swift upstream, and by the time it reached
the prison northeast of Cuero, it was swallowing pastures, downing
trees and gaining speed.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Wesley's son-in-law saw the river coming. He was at his
house, a few blocks from where she lives, when he left the car
idling and ran inside. By the time he got back out with his arms
full of clothes, the river had surrounded his car.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, Miss Wesley left the Shoemaker house to
check on her own. She turned the old Dodge down onto a side street
and found it flooded. She tried another and found the river there,
too. When she reached her house, her granddaughter was on the
porch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Granny! The policeman said the water's coming fast. Granny, we
better hurry! The water's already in the back yard!''
</P>
<P>
   They were driving away when they met Miss Wesley's daughter, who
had come to make sure they were all right. That's when Miss Wesley
remembered that she forgot her high blood pressure medicine on the
dining room table.
</P>
<P>
   The river was circling the house when they returned. Miss
Wesley's daughter waded in for the medicine. The car wheels carved
a wake behind them as they left.
</P>
<P>
   Townspeople watched the river from a high spot on the main road.
They judged how fast it was moving by the things it carried: lawn
chairs and seat cushions first; doghouses and septic tanks later;
cars, sheds and finally a house from the corner of Hamilton and
Gonzales streets floated past them and was last seen in Carter's
pecan grove.
</P>
<P>
   Before the river crested, it kicked open the back door to Miss
Wesley's house. It forced its way through her window
air-conditioners, and it seeped behind her paneling and beneath her
carpeting.
</P>
<P>
   The river swallowed everything in her house except the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Cuero spent the next week in the Sands Motel &AMP; RV Park.
They ate meals in the parking lot of the old H.E.B. store, where
the Salvation Army set up. They got tetanus shots at the health
department, and they waited in line for permits to get back in
their houses.
</P>
<P>
   The weekly newspaper tallied the damage: 25 percent of the
town's houses flooded; hundreds of cattle drowned or missing; 85 of
the town's businesses closed.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Wesley moved into a room at the Shoemakers'
bed-and-breakfast inn. She wore clothes her sister sent from San
Antonio. She put the $12,096.69 the government gave her after the
flood into the bank.
</P>
<P>
   On the 10th day, Miss Wesley went home.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw, I said, `Lookie here, this is all gone. This is
something you can't patch up, and whatever you put here won't be
like it was.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Her dishes were dumped from the cabinets. Every drawer in her
house had been opened and emptied. Everything inside was covered
with a slick layer of shiny black mud.
</P>
<P>
   The living room furniture landed in the dining room; the
mattress landed against the wall. The couch stood up. The
refrigerator lay down. The telephone disappeared. Miss Wesley
wondered, ``How can this be?''
</P>
<P>
   She drove the few blocks from her house over to the little pink
house on Hamilton Street where she was born in 1923. The river had
swallowed it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The picture window used to be over there. Daddy kept his
sitting chair right here. Back there is where the boys used to
sleep. It used to be a screened-in porch, and Mother set the table
out there in the summer, and that's where we ate. It made it real,
real nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew everybody in the neighborhood. There was a family back
there, and they had five children just like us, and we played
together. There was a chokeberry tree the boys climbed on. I
remember we used to have swings in that tree over there. We just
loved this little house.''
</P>
<P>
   BIG DECISION: Seven weeks have passed since the flood, and Miss
Wesley is still homeless, like a lot of her neighbors. One of her
daughters is living in a friend's hunting cabin, and another
daughter still lives at the motel. Miss Wesley is still at the
bed-and-breakfast in Room 3. She can't decide what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Shoemaker and some other men cleaned the mud out of her
house with a shovel and rake. They took everything she owned and
piled it at the street. They opened the windows to get rid of the
smell.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Wesley knows the money won't repair and replace everything.
One minute she thinks about making the repairs she can afford _ she
doesn't have the heart to tear the house down _ and another minute
she wonders whether the money is enough to buy a trailer. Some days
she thinks about her daughter, who begs her to move to Houston. She
can't make up her mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought in that house, we loved in that house, we would all
be in that house and we would hug and make up, and you know, that's
the joy of a place.''
</P>
<P>
   On days like this, Miss Wesley gets in her car and just drives.

SINFULLY DELICIOUS BOOKS DISH UP CELEBRITIES' CATTY REMARKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing gets you in the holiday spirit quite like reading the
snipings of overpaid celebrities. OK, many things get you in the
spirit better than that, but there's something about
celebrity-sniping that's just plain dirty fun.
</P>
<P>
   Two recently published books celebrate this: ``Hollywood and
Whine,'' by Boze Hadleigh (Birch Lane Press, $19.95) and ``Stupid
Celebrities,'' by Ross and Kathryn Petras (Andrews McMeel
Publishing, $9.95). ``Whine'' is the better book: Not only is it
more comprehensive, it's also a bit more compassionate.
``Celebrities'' is fun, but more condescending, and sometimes
intentionally misinterprets quotes meant to be ironic or
self-deprecating to suit its own purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of both books have experience in the dishing field.
Hadleigh wrote ``The Lavender Screen,'' an expose of veiled
homosexual references in older movies. The Petrases wrote ``The 776
Stupidest Things Ever Said'' and other ``Stupid'' books.
</P>
<P>
   A sampling from ``Hollywood and Whine'' (subtitled ``The Snippy,
Snotty and Scandalous Things Stars Say About Each Other''):
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I've known some actors who were intelligent, but the better
the actor, the more stupid he is.'' _ Truman Capote
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I did not have 3,000 pairs of shoes _ I had 1,600.'' _
Imelda Marcos
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I don't mean to be a diva, but some days you wake up and
you're Barbra Streisand.'' _ Courtney Love, after showing up hours
late for a photo shoot
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I want a man who's kind and understanding. Is that too much
to ask of a millionaire?'' _ Zsa Zsa Gabor
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I'm your basic flasher. I've always loved exposing myself.''
_ Michael Douglas
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I heard Michael Jackson is moving to France. For the first
time, my sympathies are with the French people.'' _ Boy George
</P>
<P>
   _ ``It was like being stuck in a blender with an alligator.'' _
Director Peter Bogdanovich (''Mask''), on working with Cher
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I thought it was very humanitarian of Sean Penn and Madonna
to marry each other. That way, they make only two people miserable
instead of four.'' _ Cesar Romero
</P>
<P>
   Selections from ``Stupid Celebrities'' (subtitled ``Over 500 of
the Most Idiotic Things Ever Said by Famous People''):
</P>
<P>
   _ Reporter: ``Do you realize that you have five gold albums in
Austria?'' David Hasselhoff: ``Where's Austria?''
</P>
<P>
   _ `` ... I'm a mess and you're a mess, too. Everyone's a mess.
Which means, actually, that no one's a mess. Know what I mean?'' _
singer Fiona Apple
</P>
<P>
   _ ``It was God who made me so beautiful. If I weren't, then I'd
be a teacher.'' _ supermodel Linda Evangelista
</P>
<P>
   _ ``That man is so repugnant. All those satanic murderers are.''
_ Geraldo Rivera, on Charles Manson
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The word `genius' isn't applicable in football. A genius is
a guy like Norman Einstein.'' _ quarterback-turned-commentator Joe
Theisman, who later explained that this wasn't an error: Norman
Einstein was his high school valedictorian.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I already know tap dancing and ballet. Now I know lap
dancing, too!'' _ Elizabeth Berkley, on her role in ``Showgirls''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I want an Internet. Can I have one of those?'' _ Mel B., a k
a Scary Spice of the Spice Girls
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I'm old. I'm young. I'm intelligent. I'm stupid.'' _ Warren
Beatty
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Nuclear war would certainly set back cable.'' _ cable-TV
mogul Ted Turner
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I'm not a snob. Ask anybody. Well, anybody who matters.'' _
Simon LeBon, lead singer of Duran Duran

JACKSON POLLOCK SHOW RAISES MANY QUESTIONS, ANSWERS MOST IMPORTANT
ONES
</HEADLINE>
 
(Accompanies BC-POLLOCK-ELSEWHERE and BC-POLLOCK-OTHERS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ According to art-history legend, Jackson Pollock's
supple loops, spatters and gobs of paint lie at the heart of
American art's triumph over European painting.
</P>
<P>
   But attempts to verify that legend today, 42 years after the
artist's violent death, are burdened with high expectations _ as is
the case with the Museum of Modern Art's current Pollock
retrospective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackson Pollock'' is the first U.S. retrospective of the
artist's work in more than 30 years _ actually, the most complete
survey of Pollock's art ever assembled. It comes after his
contribution to American art has been elevated to the highest
heights by his advocates, then torn down to the lowest depths
ironical critics could manage. It's a time when conservators work
feverishly to prevent Pollock's trademark aluminum paint from
flaking. An era in which his paintings command millions of dollars
_ as did ``Number 8, 1950,'' when it fetched more than $11 million
at auction in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   And so, the questions hover. Will Pollock emerge from this show
a hero? Will the exhibition open viewers' eyes, once again, to his
greatness? Will it vindicate Pollock as the greatest American
artist of this century? Will it sustain his reputation as our most
controversial 20th century artist _ or will it prove him to be
merely interesting? And, finally, will enough people care about any
of those questions that ``Jackson Pollock'' will prove to be New
York's hot-ticket show this season?
</P>
<P>
   So far, published reviews suggest that, when he was good,
Pollock was scintillating and that, when he was bad, he was
borderline hopeless. Still, when I viewed the exhibition _ in
galleries that were far from crowded _ I was amazed and thrilled,
even with pictures any number of my peers found bad.
</P>
<P>
   I left MoMA thinking that Pollock could claim triumph for much
more than his glorious, notorious Action Paintings from his prime
years of 1947-50. I also decided that Pollock is not nearly as
quintessentially American as tradition would have _ he never
completely purged himself of Picasso, Siqueiros, the baroque and
other influences _ and that it doesn't matter whether he is or
isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Pollock's life was brief: He was born in Cody, Wyo., in 1912 and
died on the East Coast in 1956. It also was troubled: Intensely
charismatic, Pollock suffered from depression and alcoholism, and
effectively killed himself in a drunken automobile accident.
</P>
<P>
   In 1930, Pollock moved to New York to study painting with Thomas
Hart Benton at the Art Students League. In the early 1940s, he
gained the patronage of Peggy Guggenheim, who also represented
Pollock at her Art of This Century Gallery: It was for her that
Pollock painted his first large-scale painting, his breakthrough
``Mural'' of 1943.
</P>
<P>
   When Pollock moved with his new wife, artist Lee Krasner, to
Long Island, his approach to painting evolved _ within just two
years _ into his classic Action Paintings. Poured, flung and
spattered, executed on the floor rather than the wall or easel,
these paintings are so-called because Pollock considered them
arenas for, and documents of, his actions as an artist.
</P>
<P>
   Of the almost 160 works in the MoMA show, 46 are taken from
Pollock's classic period. This segment includes three monumental
works _ ``Number 32, 1950,'' ``One: Number 31, 1950,'' and ``Autumn
Rhythm: Number 30, 1950'' _ that erase any doubts as to why Pollock
was anointed the messiah of American art. These and others are
works of remarkable complexity and delicacy, executed on canvases
larger than the walls of most rooms. Between their dense, intricate
compositions and their grand dynamism, they seem wrought by the
forces of nature rather than man.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to encountering these miraculously resolved paintings,
however, viewers slog through a selection of early works that
include turgid attempts at both relative realism and total
abstraction. In them, we see Pollock wrestling, like Jacob with the
Angel, with a number of influences _ with the spatial compression
of cubism, mannerism and the baroque; with the heroic scale and
anguished struggle of the Mexican muralists, Michelangelo's ``Last
Judgment'' and Picasso's ``Guernica''; with the dark symbolism of
Albert Pinkham Ryder and the surrealism of Miro.
</P>
<P>
   But, in their earnest clumsiness, Pollock's early paintings
possess a quality, what some would call genius, that shines through
and sets them apart.
</P>
<P>
   That ineffable quality made me root for Pollock to pull through,
to go for it, as he experimented with spattering paint, mingling it
with relentless, urgent strokes of jarring color in ``The
She-Wolf'' (1943), Peggy Guggenheim's ``Mural'' and other works. As
his works became increasingly linear _ dense drawings in paint,
whether brushed on, flung on, squeezed straight from the tube or,
in the case of ``Croaking Movement (Sounds in the Grass Series)''
(1946), incised with the wrong end of Pollock's paint brush _ I
felt like cheering.
</P>
<P>
   Once he achieved his Action Paintings, though, many of the
classic works quickly seem aimless _ sporadic showers rather than
great, cleansing storms. Surely Pollock, too, felt his new way of
painting easily could degenerate into little more than a signature
style.
</P>
<P>
   In his last years, Pollock painted a number of black-and-white
canvases that combine dripped and brushed gestures and shapes, and
verge once more on representation of recognizable figures. At the
same time, he reprised most of his other approaches to painting,
and some of these _ including ``White Light'' (1954) and ``Untitled
(Scent)'' (circa 1953-55) _ are heartbreaking in their beauty.
</P>
<P>
   By exhibition's end, I was in an exhausted state of denial. I
didn't want to believe that Pollock had died according to the
fatalist motto of his era: ``Live fast, die young and leave a
good-looking corpse'' or, in Pollock's case ``corpus'' _ of work.
That would mean conceding that Pollock had overstayed his moment of
cultural relevance.
</P>
<P>
   To me, ``Jackson Pollock'' offered too many tantalizing
suggestions that, had he lived longer, Pollock would have done even
more for art _ and not just American art _ than legend claims.

   NEW YORK _ Retrospectives for art stars like Jackson Pollock
easily get the lion's share of attention. But New York has several
other provocative shows this season, including ``Rendezvous'' at
the Guggenheim Museum, ``Edgar Degas, Photographer'' at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Met's presentation of Flemish
paintings from its permanent collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rendezvous'' was a marvelous surprise, a rich brew of works by
artists great and small. Organized by the Guggenheim and the
Pompidou Center in Paris as a showcase for works from both
collections, ``Rendezvous'' levels the playing field shared by
modern artworks from America, France, England and other countries.
It mixes works by artists such as John Chamberlain and Cesar (both
of crushed-automobile fame), Robert Rauschenberg and Alberto Burri,
Joan Miro and Alexander Calder. In doing so, ``Rendezvous'' retires
the idea that American art achieved world supremacy in the years
after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, ``Rendezvous'' set me up with an almost global
context for viewing Pollock. It puts him in the company of artists
such as Andre Masson, Wifredo Lam, Roberto Matta, and others who
married expression of the subconscious with abstract compositions
that have no focal point or visual resting place, but fill the
canvas with lines and shapes in a constant state of flux.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rendezvous'' continues through Jan. 24. Information: Solomon
R. Guggenheim Museum, (212) 423-3500.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is ``From Van Eyck to Bruegel: Early Netherlandish
Painting in The Metropolitan Museum of Art.'' While their Italian
counterparts used painting to impose ideal order upon the world,
early Northern artists like Petrus Christus, Jan Van Eyck and
Pieter Bruegel lovingly scrutinized the natural world and the world
of fantasy _ from the most mundane aspects of daily life to the
most disturbing reaches of the imagination _ without making visual
distinctions among any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Bursting with an encyclopedic scope of information _ with every
detail painstakingly painted and brought, as it were, to the
foreground _ their pictures appear irrational, strange and artless.
Paintings of holy events and human activities are set in the real
world without any strict focal point, any
</P>
<P>
   visual center of attention. As such, instead of seeming
centuries old, these works strike me as modern.
</P>
<P>
   A wondrous exhibition, the Met's collection is studded with
masterpieces, as well as with lesser works possessing their own
curious charm. Taken together, they provide visitors with a truly
altered state of experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Van Eyck to Bruegel'' continues through Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   My only disappointment was Degas _ and that probably because I
expected so much from the show. For one thing, Degas' seemingly
random, snapshot approach to composing pictures makes him one of my
art gods. For another, I thought this show would reveal telling
relationships between Degas' photos and his other works, akin to
last winter's Picasso photographs show in Houston. But no such
luck. Despite a few such links, this was mostly a historical
exhibition that featured a few psychologically charged portraits,
but almost nothing of aesthetic interest. Too much life, not enough
fantasy or art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edgar Degas, Photographer'' continues through Jan. 3.
Information: Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 879-5500.

WILL HUMANS OVERWHELM THE EARTH? THE DEBATE GOES ON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Colo., Mass., Mich.)  (The Science Times) 
(lb) 
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Two hundred years ago the Rev. Thomas Robert
Malthus, an English economist and mathematician, anonymously
published an essay predicting that the world's burgeoning human
population would overwhelm the earth's capacity to feed it.
</P>
<P>
   Malthus' gloomy forecast, called ``An Essay on the Principle of
Population As it Affects the Future Improvement of Society,'' was
condemned by Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and many other theorists,
and it was still striking sparks last week at a meeting in
Philadelphia of the American Anthropological Society. Despite
continuing controversy, it was clear that Malthus' conjectures are
far from dead.
</P>
<P>
   Among the scores of special conferences organized for the 5,000
participating anthropologists, many touched directly or indirectly
on the dilemma suggested by Malthus: Although global food supplies
increase arithmetically, the population increases geometrically _ a
vastly faster rate.
</P>
<P>
   The consequence, Malthus believed, was that poverty, and the
misery it imposes, will inevitably increase unless the increase in
population is curbed.
</P>
<P>
   This contention has prompted endless debate. Malthus' critics
have argued that man's ingenuity will always keep pace with
population growth by finding improved ways to produce food. They
cite the success of the ``Green Revolution'' launched in the 1950s
and 1960s by Dr. Norman Borlaug and his associates in developing
high-yield strains of rice and wheat.
</P>
<P>
   But the scientific descendants of Malthus argue that feeding the
world's masses is only part of the problem. Just as dangerous, they
contend, is the omnivorous consumption of nonrenewable resources,
the irreversible destruction of habitats and species, the fouling
of the air and seas and consequent changes in climate, and many
other effects of a growing human horde.
</P>
<P>
   One of the symposiums held at last week's meeting was regarded
as so contentious that a similar conference was banned from the
1994 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science, on the grounds _ said its organizer, Dr. Warren Hern, a
Colorado physician and epidemiologist _ that ``you may not ask that
question.''
</P>
<P>
   The question, posed as the title of the symposium, was this:
``Is the Human Species a Cancer on the Planet?''
</P>
<P>
   Hern, the director of an abortion clinic in Boulder, Colo.,
noticed nearly a decade ago that aerial and satellite views of
urban centers taken over a period of years bore a striking
similarity to images of cancerous tissue _ particularly melanoma _
invading the healthy surrounding tissue.
</P>
<P>
   In his presentation last week, Hern argued that in many parts of
the world the increase in human numbers is rapid and uncontrolled,
that it invades and destroys habitats, and that by killing off many
species it reduces the differentiation of nature. All of these
features are characteristic of cancerous tumors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   This assessment was applauded by another member of the panel,
Dr. Lynn Margulis of the University of Massachusetts in Boston, who
is the co-author of another highly debated theory, the Gaia
Hypothesis.
</P>
<P>
   The hypothesis, the brainchild of an English theorist, Dr. James
Lovelock and Dr. Margulis, who is a microbiologist, is that the
earth deploys feedback mechanisms to maintain an environment
hospitable to life. In this it resembles a gigantic living
organism, proponents of the Gaia idea believe.
</P>
<P>
   Life on earth has survived many crises, including mass
extinctions caused by the impacts of asteroids and comets, Dr.
Margulis said, and life will continue despite the threats created
by humanity _ but with reduced diversity.
</P>
<P>
   She agreed with the notion that the human race is a kind of
self-destructive cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``For millions of years,'' she said, ``the earth got along
without human beings, and it will do so again. The only question is
the nature of the human demise that has already begun.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Margulis quoted a line from the German philosopher Friedrich
Nietzsche: ``The earth is a beautiful place, but it has a pox
called man.''
</P>
<P>
   A different but complementary perspective was offered by Dr.
Compton Tucker, a physical scientist at the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration's Goddard Space Center. Tucker is an
analyst of images of the earth made by Landsat and other orbiting
spacecraft. In particular, he keeps track of deforestation and
other anthropogenic changes in the global habitat.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many regions, we've seen astonishingly rapid change since
1975,'' he said. ``Vast tracts of both rain forest and dry tropical
forest have disappeared in the Amazon Basin as human communities
expand and clear the land for cattle ranching. This has led to a
monoculture dominated by cattle breeding, with losses of immense
numbers of the species deprived of forest habitat.''
</P>
<P>
   Several speakers cited U.N. statistics indicating that
population growth rates in underdeveloped countries averaged only
1.77 percent per year between 1990 and 1995. The expectation for
that period had been for a growth rate of 1.88 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1930, when the world population was about 2 billion,
the population has nearly tripled, and each doubling of the
population has occurred in a much shorter time than the previous
doubling period. The U.N. report projected that the world
population could reach 9.4 billion by 2050.
</P>
<P>
   Demographers say that the population increase has leveled off in
China, where the government limits family size, and that the rate
of population increase has declined in Bangladesh and other
populous countries.
</P>
<P>
   But recent U.N. statistics identified 28 countries _ 20 of them
in Africa _ where fertility rates increased during the past decade.
Among the countries was the United States, which has the
third-largest population after China and India, and where the
fertility rate increased from 1.9 percent to 2.1 percent, largely
because of Hispanic immigration.
</P>
<P>
   All the speakers at the symposium had expected vigorous
criticism from the audience of anthropologists, but were surprised
to encounter few strongly negative comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arguments over the accuracy of Malthus' views, future
population trends and the earth's carrying capacity are
never-ending and never resolved,'' one speaker said. ``Many people
prefer to just forget about the big questions involved, and get on
with their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Population pressure is partly a question of perception, said Dr.
Bernice Kaplan, an anthropologist at Wayne State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask my students how they feel about being increasingly
crowded by the growing population, and they reply, `We're not
crowded,''' Dr. Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That attitude results from being young and not having
experienced the changes old people have seen during their lives.
Whatever environment you're born into is the one that seems normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't seem to realize the problems created by population
pressure until you get old,'' she said, ``and then nobody listens
to you. We are a species that doesn't respond to threats until it's
too late.''

<P>
   Exercisers are often confused about the best way to strengthen
and tone the midriff. And for good reason: Experts cannot seem to
agree, either. Even the research is not definitive.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the biomechanics laboratory at Centinela Hospital
Medical Center in Inglewood, Calif., completed a study this year
comparing the effectiveness and safety of eight popular abdominal
movements. To measure the amount of electrical activity _ and thus
the force of muscular contraction _ researchers placed electrodes
on each subject's three largest abdominal muscle groups _ the
rectus abdominis, internal obliques and external obliques _ and on
one hip flexor muscle. Of all the exercises, the crunch, or quarter
sit-up, was shown to activate the greatest number of abdominal
muscle fibers and the least number of hip flexor muscle fibers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means that the crunch surpasses other exercises in terms
of efficiency and low-back safety,'' said Dr. Marilyn Pink, the
lab's director. She explained that when the hip flexors are
overexerted, they tug on the muscles supporting the lower spine,
which, in turn, can contribute to back pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to do anything fancy in an attempt to isolate
the abdominal muscles,'' Dr. Pink said. ``Simple crunches with your
feet unsupported work best.''
</P>
<P>
   Another study reported last year in the journal Medicine and
Science in Sports and Exercise, however, used similar procedures
yet reached the opposite conclusion. Researchers could pinpoint no
single exercise that optimally trained all of the abdominal muscles
with minimal stress to the lower back. The authors advocate doing a
variety of exercises to sufficiently challenge all of the
abdominals.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Len Kravitz, director of exercise science at the University
of Mississippi at Oxford, agreed. ``The whole theory of training
muscles, abdominals or otherwise, is to constantly stimulate them
with a different type of shock,'' he said. ``If a muscle works in
one way only, not all its fibers will be stimulated.''
</P>
<P>
   Kravitz recommends including crunches that involve twisting or
rotation of the trunk, because they isolate the internal and
external obliques, muscles that attach to the connective tissue of
the lower back. ``Strengthening these muscles helps bolster and
support the spine,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Pink argued that the crunch variations serve only to
place the lower back in greater jeopardy. ``We found that twisting
crunches increase intervertebral disk pressure and hip flexor
activity,'' she said, explaining that these exercises involve less
of the abdominal muscles and are potentially unsafe for the lower
back.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are experts like Dr. Richard M. Bachrach, an
osteopathic physician and medical director for the Center for
Sports and Osteopathic Medicine in Manhattan, who advise forgoing
crunch-type movements altogether because they only activate the
upper fibers of the rectus abdominis, the wide, flat sheet of
muscle that runs the vertical length of the torso, while the rest
of the muscle goes unused.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are plenty strong to begin with,'' Bachrach said.
Instead, he suggests doing reverse crunches, which involve keeping
the upper body still while lifting the legs and buttocks a small
way upward in order to target the often weak and underused lower
portion of the rectus abdominis.
</P>
<P>
   Bachrach also advocates working a fourth muscle, the transversus
abdominis, which lies deep beneath the other abdominals. Although
it is not involved in moving the spine, it contracts to stabilize
and support it, a function Bachrach and many others believe is
important for spinal health and good posture. Forceful breathing
while tightening the abdominals, or exercises that call upon the
abdominals to contract without any resultant spinal movement, train
the transversus as well as the other abs.
</P>
<P>
   One thing experts do agree on: No amount of abdominal training
will ``spot reduce'' the midsection in spite of testimony by
infomerchants hawking various devices. A seminal, 1984 study
performed at the University of Kansas evaluated the effects of 27
days' worth of regular abdominal exercises and concluded that they
do not selectively reduce abdominal fat. Kravitz sums it up
succinctly: ``Working the abs does not cause fat to magically fall
away from that area. Period.'' Reducing that area involves
restricting caloric intake in combination with regular aerobic
exercise to burn off overall fat.
</P>
<P>
   Experts also seem to agree that no matter which exercise is
performed, proper execution is crucial. ``Good technique is
essential for results and injury prevention,'' Bachrach said. He
advises avoiding jerky movements, overarching the low back off the
floor, and holding the breath.

ARE TODAY'S KIDS HARDER TO HANDLE?

<TEXT>
<P>
   Emily's long day was finally ending.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-year-old had needed to stay late at school because her
father's train was delayed and he couldn't get to her preschool
until an hour and a half after the usual pickup time.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted to wait for her father in the parking lot so she
could catch the first glimpse of his car rounding the corner. When
told that she would have to wait inside where it was safer, Emily
promptly sank her teeth into the teacher's forearm. Fortunately, no
permanent damage was done, but neither the child nor her teacher
could have been more surprised. Emily had always been a cooperative
and well-behaved kid from a ``nice home.''
</P>
<P>
   Such acts of aggression are occurring more frequently in
childcare settings. As a consultant to private and public daycare
and family-care providers for several decades, I have seen an
increase in this behavior in even the most advantaged and
competently run childcare facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Lola Nash, lecturer in education at Yale University's Child
Study Center, who has established and directed early-childhood
programs in and around Yale for 30 years, observes: ``There's been
a dramatic increase in this kind of aggressive upset in childcare
over the past decade. All the programs I work with are struggling
to develop policies to handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   A teacher in a private kindergarten in a Boston suburb says,
``Often, my classroom feels out of control. The speech is 'in your
face' and 'street talk,' even from kids who were raised in suburban
areas. Verbal aggression, teasing, and sarcasm are common, and most
of us can name children from good families who've decked or bitten
someone in the past year.''
</P>
<P>
   Expressing and mastering aggression is a normal and healthy part
of child development. Aggression is the drive to use our bodies, to
move about in space, to reach out and grab what we want. Aggression
gets us up on our feet and helps us learn to walk.
</P>
<P>
   Violence, on the other hand, is the intended use of physical
force to injure or abuse, and it is certainly not a normal, healthy
part of a child's development.
</P>
<P>
   We say no to babies, toddlers and preschoolers mostly to keep
them safe from the stairs, the street, the poisons under the
kitchen sink, the stranger and the unknown dog. But why should your
child listen to you? ``Because I'm the Dad (or Mom)'' carries
weight occasionally, but the real reason that no works is the child
believes this: Daddy and Mommy say no because they know what's best
for me; they love me and want to keep me safe.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Too many caregivers? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Herein lies a dilemma for many young families who need to divide
the care of their children between people who love them deeply _
parents and other relatives _ and people who may like their
children well enough _ daycare staff and educators _ but are not
invested in them unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
   The more caregivers a child has when he is learning how to
master his aggressive impulses and the greater the variability of
his experience with limit-setting adults, the harder he will find
it to develop the trust that prompts him to behave well for someone
whom he loves.
</P>
<P>
   Young children who are exposed to too much variety in caregiving
situations or to too many caregiver changes may begin to wonder,
``Why should I struggle to master my favorite aggressive impulses
for you? You may like me and know how to bathe and feed me, but you
don't really know me or love me, and I don't know or love you. So
is it really worth it for me to restrict my 'me first' impulses for
you?''
</P>
<P>
   From there, a preschooler can easily conclude: ``Well, then, I
guess it's every kid for himself around here.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Media influence &LR;
</P>
<P>
   We know that young children are susceptible to visual images of
aggression, repeating and mirroring the violence they encounter in
movies, electronic games or cartoons for hours _ or days _
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   As a clinician, I know there's a limit to the number of violent
images that children can absorb before feeling overwhelmed. Their
ability to neutralize the visual toxins emotionally is vastly more
limited than ours; can we be surprised when violence spills over in
their play for days afterward?
</P>
<P>
   Even more than movies, electronic and computer games excite our
young kids with irresistible graphics and attention-grabbing action
sequences. They keep attention levels so high that kids often have
difficulty returning to the more mundane pastels of life among
family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The voice of authority &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A small crisis in parental self-esteem may also play a part in a
young child's ability to manage everyday aggression. Erin, the
young mother of a 4-year-old daughter, works 30 hours a week
outside the home. ``I do love my work,'' she says. ``But I so want
to be with my daughter that it's hard for me not to spend the first
hour when I get home making up to her for not being there during
the day. When she challenges my authority, all I want to do is make
nice because I've missed her so much! I'm not good at setting
limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Erin's comments help explain why so many working parents place
their children in the driver's seat long before they can see over
the dashboard, then wonder why household routines last only a few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   This parental expectation that children be catered to also
influences their childcare and schooling. Karen, the suburban
Boston kindergarten teacher mentioned earlier, struggles with the
growing number of well-intentioned parents who urge teachers not to
quash their children's ``spirit.'' While a rigid classroom can
certainly stifle expressiveness, the educator's concern centers on
the difficulty some of these ``overappreciated'' children have in
sharing classroom supplies and equipment
</P>
<P>
   Are there any solutions? Yes. Here are several strategies to
consider:
</P>
<P>
   _ Limit the number of caregivers your young child must deal
with. A few family members and a couple of daycare or school
professionals handling physical and emotional needs is about it for
kids under age 5.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stay in close touch with your childcare providers about how
your child is doing, emotionally as well as physically. If you
don't get clear descriptions or stories that match your own
experience, the staff may be too busy with other kids. Ask the
director to keep an eye on things and to get back to you. When you
collaborate closely with the important people in your child's life,
both you and he are reassured.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep tabs on what your child is watching and playing. Then
observe her moods. It will be clear to you if your child is
suffering from a toxic accumulation of internal aggression. Don't
worry about being the only parent on earth who won't allow his or
her child to watch the newest multimedia dismemberment spectacle.
Check out the thoughtful, age-appropriate movie and television
guides for kids available at local public libraries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Review the routines that your family follows. What you haven't
any? That might explain why you feel so exhausted. The chaos that
tends to take over when you don't have at least some routines in
place keeps the stimulation and tension levels in you and your kids
fairly high because you can never leave the negotiating table and
get on with life. Kids often embrace routines with enthusiasm; they
offer a sense of order and control, which raises children's
aggression threshold.
</P>
<P>
   _ When you say no to a child, let him know you understand how
much he wants what you've ruled out. Accepting the emotional part
of your child's aggressive drives (``I don't want to go to bed
yet!'') lets him know that he doesn't always have to act out
physically to get his point across. Furthermore, it sets up a way
for you and your child to commiserate about the daily
disappointments of life within the context of the loving
relationship between the two of you.
</P>
<P>
   Because understanding intervenes, your child feels comforted and
the pressure to be aggressive eases.

   It isn't 20-percent-off-manufacturer's-suggested-retail-price
poetry, either. This is absolutely free poetry. And grade A
quality: tasty morsels of Robert Frost, Carl Sandburg, Langston
Hughes and other big name bards. ``Now I've got something to do
tonight,'' Armstrong chirps, ``and it' not Blockbuster Video.''
</P>
<P>
   That friendly fellow giving dozens of startled shoppers copies
of ``101 Great American Poems'' is Andy Carroll, the 29-year-old
unpaid executive director of the American Poetry and Literacy
Project, a shoestring nonprofit organization based in Washington,
D.C., with the lofty goal of (pardon the rhyme) awakening America's
poetic soul.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll _ a native Washingtonian who earns his living as a
freelance writer and editor _ encounters Shirley Armstrong on the
second day of a 6,529-mile, New York-to-San Francisco odyssey
dubbed The Great Appleseed Giveaway. The concept couldn't be
simpler: Andy Carroll hops into a rental truck loaded with 100,000
poetry books and heads west, showering literally free verse upon
whomever he meets.
</P>
<P>
   His target destinations aren't made-to-order venues such as
coffeehouses and high-school English classes. He plans to hit jury
rooms, turnpike rest areas, even Elvis Presley's Memphis mansion;
everywhere that everyday folks with time on their hands can be
found.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his supermarket stop, Carroll swings by the
Pentagon (where scores of rigid-posture passersby quickly gobble up
more than a thousand books) and the tourists' entrance to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poetry, it's the vegetable of the literary world,'' he
declares while driving across town on his poetry-promotion rounds.
More and more people have begun eating their literary
``vegetables.'' Sales of poetry books are up nationwide, as is the
number of public poetry readings.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop music has helped spawn a ``spoken word'' movement. ``It
really does feel like poetry's finest hour,'' says Toni Bevan,
director of marketing and promotion at The Academy of American
Poets. ``There are a lot of things contributing to that. You could
certainly say Andy is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll wouldn't say that, though. He gives the lion's share of
the credit to the late Joseph Brodsky, the Nobel Prize-winning
Russian-emigre poet. In 1991, in a speech that was printed later in
New Republic, Brodsky lamented the fact that print-based literacy
was gradually giving way to a dumbed-down, visually-oriented
``videocy.''
</P>
<P>
   As an antidote, he proposed making poetry ``as ubiquitous as the
nature that surrounds us ... as ubiquitous as gas stations, if not
as cars themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky's name didn't really ring a bell with Andy Carroll, who
had taken just one poetry course as a Columbia University
undergrad. Well, actually, it rang the wrong bell: Carroll thought
he was a retired Russian cosmonaut.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Brodsky's call to arms struck a responsive chord.
Carroll immediately wrote him a letter offering to help
saturation-bomb the United States with great poetry. Turns out it
was the only offer Brodsky received, and in 1993, Brodsky and
Carroll launched the American Poetry and Literacy Project.
</P>
<P>
   It has no employees. It sponsors no conferences, publishes no
newsletter. It just raises money from corporations, foundations and
private citizens, uses the cash to buy poetry books, and then gives
them all away in person or through the mail _ more than 200,000
books and counting.
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky died of a heart attack in 1996, and ex-poets laureate
Rita Dove and Robert Hass have since lent their names to the APLP
cause. However, as Carroll notes, ``Joseph was it. In some ways,
he's irreplaceable.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll personally takes care of business in the Washington
area, dropping off books at hospitals, nursing homes and other
sites. But he has also developed a nationwide network of poetry
compadres. Amtrak executives once stocked the cafe car on the
Washington-to-Boston run with 1,500 copies of ``100 Best Loved
Poems.'' One Halloween in Austin, Texas, the county tax assessor
and the local coroner held a ``Death and Taxes'' reading at a
library, dipping into spooky selections from Edgar Allan Poe's
``The Raven and Other Poems.''
</P>
<P>
   After Brodsky's death, Carroll was determined to take to the
road in his memory. In some respects, Carroll was the worst man for
the job. He flunked his driver's test three times before passing
and had never driven more than 400 miles from home.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he possesses the requisite freewheeling spirit for such an
undertaking. He got Ryder to donate a truck. Doubletree hotels
provided rooms on the road. Washington State Apple Growers _
intrigued by the Johnny Appleseed-like notion of reaping and sowing
literacy through poetry plantings _ picked up the tab for the
books.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are plans to compile a book of travel-related
poetry, perfect for slipping into seat pockets on trains and
planes. He's also looking for a corporate sponsor to underwrite the
cost of giving away 1 million books. Sound quixotic? Or crazy?
</P>
<P>
   Either way, don't expect Andy Carroll to sit on the sidelines
watching the demise of Western civilization and the rise of Fox
Network. After all, this is a guy who walked into a swank Las Vegas
casino and was blown away by an innocuous sign in the gambling pit.
``It read: 'You must be present to win,''' says Carroll. ``That's
one of the most poetic things I've ever seen in my life.''

   WASHINGTON _ With the weather outside more delightful than
frightful, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton opened the holiday
season in the nation's capital Monday by revealing a Winter
Wonderland inside the freshly and festively decorated White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to try something different this year,'' said Mrs.
Clinton, showing reporters a White House gleaming with chilly
shades of white, silver and gold instead of the season's usual red
and green.
</P>
<P>
   With temperatures in the 70s and sidewalk Santas sweltering
beside their iron kettles, a family of snow folk welcomed White
House visitors to the East Colonnade. Mantels over fireplaces in
historic rooms were filled with penguins, polar bears, igloos, an
ice palace, an ice garden and Christmas packages wrapped in icy
silver and white.
</P>
<P>
   The mantelpiece decorations were all edible -- the sugary
creations of Colette Peters, a confectionery artist from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Beside being starkly beautiful, the decorations ``are wonderful
to smell,'' the first lady noted.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to announcing ``A Winter Wonderland'' as the holiday
theme -- a tradition begun by Jackie Kennedy in 1961 -- Mrs.
Clinton presented this year's White House Christmas card. A
watercolor painting of the State Dining Room, the card shows a
table set for a holiday dinner and a cheery fire in a hearth below
a portrait of Abraham Lincoln. The painting is by Ray Ellis, an
artist from Martha's Vineyard, the Massachusetts island where the
Clintons have spent several summer vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Winter Wonderland theme, this year's gingerbread
house is a castle with oversized versions of presidential pets
Socks the Cat and Buddy the Dog ice-skating at both ends. Resting
on a table in the state dining room, the completely edible castle
comprises 90 pounds of gingerbread, 40 pounds of chocolate and 20
pounds of sugar icing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a challenge -- especially the round tower,'' said
Roland Mesnier, the pastry chef whose culinary creations have
become another White House tradition.
</P>
<P>
   A chocolate Santa and laden sleigh, pulled by sugary reindeer,
are preparing to leave the castle while Mrs. Claus decorates a
Christmas tree inside its walls.
</P>
<P>
   The official White House Christmas tree -- so tall that the
snowman on top is pushed forward by the 20-foot ceiling -- is the
centerpiece of the Blue Room. Its ornaments were made by artists
from all 50 states, and a handmade green velvet tree skirt has a
panel from every state and territory.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Christmas trees abound in the White House. In the
East Foyer stands a tree decorated with ornaments made by hundreds
of Peace Corps volunteers stationed in remote spots around the
globe. The library features two trees decorated with pine cones
from every region of the country. The Grand Foyer is a glistening
forest of frosted birch trees.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional White House creche is the focal point of the
East Room. Made in Naples two centuries ago, it features 47 carved
figures and has been displayed every Christmas for the past three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The White House will feature its usual array of holiday parties,
said Mrs. Clinton, but the president and first lady will not be
able to attend some because of their trip that begins Friday to the
Mideast.

TRIAL-HIRE (Los Angeles) _ Rod Pease of Agoura Hills was standing
outside the jewelry store when the robbery suspect came running
out, gun still smoking. The jewelry store owner lay dead inside.
When the time came, Pease did his duty gladly. ``That's him,'' he
said on the witness stand, pointing at the scruffy guy in the black
leather jacket. But the jury didn't buy his eyewitness
identification. They let the thug go, and that bothers Pease.

A YEAR OF CHANGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ask Barry Munitz about his leadership style, and
he'll slyly insist, ``I'm a pussycat.''
</P>
<P>
   Few who know the president and CEO of the J. Paul Getty Trust
would likely share that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   In a career that has spanned academia, big business and six
years as chancellor of the California State University system,
Munitz has acquired a reputation as a smart, tough-minded
negotiator whose behind-the-scenes diplomacy is matched by his
steely resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Munitz, 57, has described himself as ``a political
animal in the most profound and intense sense, not just a partisan
political sense.'' That helps explain why California Gov.-elect
Gray Davis recently tapped Munitz to head his transition team in
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever sort of animal he may be, Munitz appears well on his
way toward transforming the Getty Center _ the 800-ton leviathan of
the art world _ into a different sort of beast: Less insular and
self-sufficient than in years past, more corporate-minded and
competitive, and as consumed with teaching the public about art as
it once was obsessed with acquiring priceless objets.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago, the Getty Center unveiled its new $1 billion
Brentwood headquarters amid a flurry of international press
coverage, a flood of traffic along Sepulveda Boulevard _ and a
paucity of public toilets. (The Getty plans to add more facilities
next year.)
</P>
<P>
   By January 1999, officials estimate, some 1.9 million visitors
will have flocked to the Getty's travertine marble campus to
inspect its Old Master paintings, world-class photography
collections and IMAX-caliber views of the San Gabriel Mountains,
the L.A. basin and the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   That's roughly one-third more than the 1.2 million originally
projected. The average Getty visitor stays 4{ hours, a virtually
unheard-of length for a museum.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, as the crowds have tapered off and phone
parking-reservation waiting times have dwindled to an average of
five minutes, Munitz's administration has begun to take shape,
succeeding that of his more understated, avuncular predecessor,
Harold Williams.
</P>
<P>
   And, as often happens under a new regime, there have been a few
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Since Munitz took over last January, three of the five directors
of the Getty's arts-related institutes have resigned. One Getty
affiliate, the Information Institute, will formally cease to exist
by June.
</P>
<P>
   These swift changes have raised concerns both inside and outside
the Getty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like (baseball manager) Kevin Malone with the
Dodgers,'' observed Bill Lasarow, publisher of Art Scene, a monthly
digest of the visual arts in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still too early to tell whether all the trades and the
cutbacks and the add-ons are going to add up to a better operation
or is going to take away from what Mr. Williams built up. You sort
of have a situation where the Getty won the World Series last year.
You almost wonder why they'd be toying around with this.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Munitz said he regarded some
high-level staff turnover as ``inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   He was hired by the Getty's board, he said, not to sit on a $4.7
billion endowment but to analyze how the Getty's various programs _
previously spread throughout several buildings _ could be better
integrated now that they have a common address.
</P>
<P>
   Munitz concedes that agenda has created some stress and
uncertainty, as well as opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some, it's very exciting and fulfilling. To some, it's
scary. To some, it's distressing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it make me happy to pick up the paper ... and see the
headline (about a staff member's departure)? Of course not. ... My
assignment is to look forward. We have to recognize now we're open,
we're very public. I mean, we have a bunch of people who haven't
worked in big, public programs before. And my assignment is to put
a leadership team together for the board that's collaborative,
that's public-oriented, that focuses on advocacy and policy and
education. And I'm just going to have to do it as patiently, but as
firmly, as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Getty's 1,200 employees sharing space with 36,000
visitors every week, Munitz said his priority is to make the Getty
operate more publicly than before and to forge partnerships with
corporations and other museums, both in and outside Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the Getty is cooperating with the Huntington
Library, on an upcoming show about how different portraitists
depicted the famous 18th-century British actress Sarah Siddons.
</P>
<P>
   The Getty also agreed to offer an exhibition on Sigmund Freud,
organized by one of its own curators, to the nearby Skirball
Cultural Center, with the Getty picking up the $300,000 tab.
</P>
<P>
   Some local arts officials say the Getty has brought not only
cash to L.A., in the form of cultural tourism, but cachet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many groups that have been coming through town that
probably would not be coming had it not been for the Getty,'' said
Henry Hopkins, former director of the UCLA Armand Hammer Museum of
Art and Cultural Center.
</P>
<P>
   Art for art's sake no longer defines the Getty's central
mission, if it ever did. Munitz has sought to give education an
institution-wide focus by recruiting Ted Mitchell, former dean of
the Graduate School of Education at UCLA, to serve in the
just-minted post of vice president for education and special
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   New acquisitions, besides fleshing out the collections'
art-historical continuum, also will be evaluated by what they can
teach about a particular genre or period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have to be more selective,'' said Deborah Gribbon,
deputy director of the Getty Museum. ``In terms of paintings, in
particular, we are trying to go for the best examples of the best
artists in the best condition. And when you've done that, a priori,
you have an object that can be a platform for many different kinds
of programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Munitz and his board also have considered the idea of
instituting a membership program for a small group of upper-level
donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in very good shape financially,'' Munitz said. ``But for
me, that just continues to make the point that you can't run a
place of this complexity on one source of revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   You begin to grasp the Getty's changing personality when you
ride its trestled tram car with a load of energetic high school
students.
</P>
<P>
   From 9 to 11 a.m. every weekday but Monday, schoolchildren and
their teachers are the only visitors admitted to the Getty, giving
them a chance to study objects closely, work at making art with
Getty instructors, and delve into themed, interdisciplinary study
programs designed by their teachers with support from Getty staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really good program, because I was here, like, three
times with my family, and I was bored after an hour. Now it's a lot
more interesting,'' said Jocelyn Landgraf, a sophomore at
Louisville High School in Woodland Hills, during a recent trip with
her class.
</P>
<P>
   By year's end, Getty staff estimates, 25,000 students will have
visited the center and taken part in its arts education programs,
including a contingent of 700 from Cleveland High School in Reseda.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Brigham, who runs the Getty's education department, at
first wasn't sure how her colleagues would react to the daily
presence of hundreds of adolescents, far more than the Getty Villa
in Malibu could accommodate.
</P>
<P>
   But she says the reaction has been positive. Some staff members
say the crowds have energized and humanized Richard Meier's
abstract architectural collage of angles and arcs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having thousands of people up here all the time makes me feel
more connected to the city than I would've thought. I really was
afraid about moving up here and being isolated,'' said Michael S.
Roth, associate director of the Research Institute, the Getty's art
think tank, and head of its Scholars and Seminars Program.
</P>
<P>
   Once referred to by a Getty official as a ``secular monastery,''
the Research Institute offers several examples of how the Getty is
attempting to make the public feel like guests rather than
intruders.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, it liberalized its policy on admitting readers to its
research library stacks. Now, anyone with a simple college ID can
gain access to a substantial part of the library's collection of
700,000 volumes of books, serials and auction catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Also, for the first time, the institute is using an open
nomination and application process for its senior visiting research
scholars, who previously were selected by committee.
</P>
<P>
   Roth sees these changes as part of an ongoing effort to
``demystify'' Getty scholarship and make it as transparent as the
institute's glass shell.
</P>
<P>
   Of equal significance, Roth said, the new ``Friday Nights at the
Getty'' performance series has attracted a more diverse crowd than
typically came to Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many visitors hail from the same college-educated, upwardly
mobile demographic as before.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my friends came here for a visit, and when he got off
the tram he said, `My God, I wasn't wearing black! I didn't think
they'd let me on!' '' Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Getty is taking steps to attract new adult
constituencies. When the Research Institute hosted a lecture this
year by a group of African-American photographers, Roth said, it
rented buses to bring people without transportation to the Getty.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials concede that the Getty stills needs to be made
more user-friendly, with less concern for quiet good taste and more
signage telling people where to find the restrooms or Van Gogh's
``Irises.''
</P>
<P>
   A sheltered canopy and benches have been provided for walk-in
visitors waiting in line. A taxi dispatcher works the main parking
structure. Future plans call for adding a taco bar and a children's
menu to the Getty's culinary offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Getty has turned down numerous requests to use
its site for weddings, bar mitzvahs, film productions, corporate
planning sessions and fund-raisers, which are closely restricted by
the facility's conditional-use permit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we've said yes only to those things that are
directly tied to Getty activities,'' Munitz said.
</P>
<P>
   As the Getty enters the new millennium, its mission will
continue to be defined by a tension between the scholarly and the
public, elitism and accessibility.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, those themes probably will figure in this
week's four-day Governor's Conference on the Arts at L.A.'s Hotel
Inter-Continental. Titled ``Beyond the Millennium: Redefining the
Arts for the 21st Century'' and co-sponsored by the Getty Trust,
the conference will wrap up with a Thursday afternoon bus trip to
the Getty, where Munitz will deliver welcoming remarks.
</P>
<P>
   With delegations from academia, government, Silicon Valley and
the worlds of art, entertainment and philanthropy, the conference
symbolizes a crossroads of power and culture where the Getty now
sits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're very pleased to see the appointment of Dr.
Munitz overseeing the transition (at the Getty),'' said Barbara
Pieper, director of the California Arts Council, another conference
co-sponsor. ``I think that's a signal of a confluence of education,
creativity and industry issues that are coming together in what I
would call the New California.''
</P>
<P>
   Munitz may be no pussycat. But neither is he a bull in a china
shop. It remains to be seen how the New Getty _ let alone the ``New
California'' _ will respond.

STATE PROGRAMS TO GET GETTY FOCUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For years, the entire world has been their oyster.
</P>
<P>
   Now it looks as if the Getty's educational strategists may be
casting their nets in less-far-flung waters.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen D. Rountree, executive vice president of the J. Paul
Getty Trust, said that, in the future, the Getty plans to
concentrate its educational development and outreach programs in
the Southern California area.
</P>
<P>
   While the Getty Trust, Museum and arts-related institutes will
continue to maintain a national and international focus, Rountree
said the Getty would be playing a more active role in shaping local
and state educational policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're definitely going to see an engagement of the
Getty with issues of school reform, and the importance of education
in the arts and humanities, and a greater concentration on Los
Angeles and the Southern California region, trying to use our
resources closer to home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the fall campaign, Gov.-elect Gray Davis identified
education as his top priority. Davis' first cabinet-level
appointment, whom he named last Monday, is former state Sen. Gary
K. Hart as education secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Munitz, president and CEO of the Getty Trust, is leading
Davis' transition team. Hart previously worked with Munitz as
co-director of the California State University Institute for
Education Reform while Munitz was chancellor of the Cal State
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we're going to see us focus a lot more on our back
yard and trying to develop initiatives in Southern California,
because we think every opportunity and every problem exists here,''
Rountree said. &QL;

TRIAL BY HIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Rod Pease of Agoura Hills was standing outside
the jewelry store when the robbery suspect came running out, gun
still smoking. The jewelry store owner lay dead inside.
</P>
<P>
   When the time came, Pease did his duty gladly. ``That's him,''
he said on the witness stand, pointing at the scruffy guy in the
black leather jacket.
</P>
<P>
   But the jury didn't buy his eyewitness identification. They let
the leather-jacketed thug go, and that bothers Pease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was more convincing than that,'' said the retired
banker. ``I've never had any trouble with juries believing me
before. I'll have to work on my script some more.''
</P>
<P>
   Pease, you see, is a professional witness _ if you can be a
professional without getting paid. He and nearly 500 other Southern
California residents volunteer to act as witnesses, jurors and even
judges for depositions, client meetings and mock trials that help
UCLA School of Law students earn their degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they volunteer to sit in a courtroom _ hardly makes sense
at a time when Los Angeles Superior Court judges have to threaten
real-life citizens with a $1,500 fine to get them to show up for
jury duty.
</P>
<P>
   But showing up in court for real is one thing; play-acting is
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our witnesses and jurors say they really have fun,'' said
witness program director Bunny Friedman. ``The day after a trial, I
get calls: `Thank you fot letting me come.'''
</P>
<P>
   The volunteer witnesses and jurors have had a workout this past
week as third-year law students take their final semester exams. No
multiple choice here. No essay questions to bluff your way through.
</P>
<P>
   In teams, the students must present a half-day civil trial
before a jury that not only decides which attorney presented the
more factual case, but who needs to show more confidence, who
speaks too softly and who needs to work more on tailoring final
arguments to the age and status of the jurors being addressed.
</P>
<P>
   The students are grateful for the chance to practice on real
people _ without real risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps us a lot,'' said third-year law student Anthony Lopez
of Van Nuys, who took the role of counsel for a 60-year-old
bookstore clerk who sued her boss, claiming age discrimination was
behind her firing. ``The (final exam) itself is a culmination of an
entire semester of theory and practice. It's here where we get to
see how well we've learned.''
</P>
<P>
   Mia Perez of South Pasadena, who represented the bookstore owner
(played by Pease, who acts several different roles in various
trials), said she loves seeing the law come alive in the only
courtroom she's been allowed to practice in so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to read it in a book, but you don't see how it
all comes together until trial,'' Perez said. ``The witnesses help
us see how it all works.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first trial of the series, Perez was the more convincing
attorney, with a panel of 11 volunteer jurors voting 8-3 against
the age-discrimination claim.
</P>
<P>
   Pease, a retired banker who had left by the time the jury
brought back its verdict, was undoubtedly pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to win,'' he said with a grin. ``In the other trial, I
walked out with the `defendant,' the `killer.' He said, `You're a
professional actor, right?' I had a swelled head for weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Dudley of Santa Monica, who played the role of the fired
bookstore clerk in that day's trial, actually worked as an actress
before beginning a career in public administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fun,'' Dudley said after giving a stellar performance
_ pausing quizzically to think, looking sincere, her voice full of
unshed tears _ as the plaintiff and key witness in the mock trial.
``I think it's a wonderful opportunity for the young people, and
it's fun to be somebody else for a few hours.''
</P>
<P>
   In every case, witnesses receive mock depositions that outline
most of the facts. But some facts are left out; witnesses are free
to use their imagination _ and their acting skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``In real life, they're going to have to deal with real
witnesses,'' said professor Albert Moore, who teaches the trial
advocacy class and who acted as judge for the Pease-Dudley trial.
``Sometimes they get answers or reactions they don't expect, and
they've got to learn to deal with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses _ and the jurors who judge the cases and hand out
post-mortem critiques _ are a valuable part of the students'
education, the professor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many lawyers have practiced in this town for 10 years and have
never, ever done a trial,'' Moore said. ``With the mock trial
program, these students know they're not as good as they're going
to get, but they know they can do it. It gives them a sense of
confidence that allows them to say, `If this case doesn't settle,
we'll take it to trial.' That's a good position to be in.''

LIVING WITH PARKINSON'S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENIFER HANRAHAN 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Barbara Mallut stopped dead in her tracks as she
made her way across the mall parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on?'' she asked herself. Her mind was commanding
her legs to walk, but her feet stayed planted.
</P>
<P>
   Cars honked. Her heart raced. The terror welled inside her as
she realized she could not budge.
</P>
<P>
   Her body had gone completely rigid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh God, I can't move!'' she shouted to herself as the tears
cascaded down her cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   Mallut, 56, of Van Nuys is one of more than a million Americans
diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, a degenerative neurological
disorder that destroys the brain cells that control movement. It
can lead to tremors, uncontrollable body movements and paralyzing
muscle rigidity.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, actor Michael J. Fox, 37, disclosed he, too, suffers
from the disorder and had been hiding the symptoms for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's candidness has heartened younger people battling
Parkinson's. Although he's not the first celebrity to talk publicly
about the disease _ Muhammad Ali, the Rev. Billy Graham and U.S.
Attorney General Janet Reno all have Parkinson's _ Fox is the best
hope for getting people to understand that anyone can be touched by
it, including young adults, Parkinson's advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   Best-known for his role as Alex P. Keaton on ``Family Ties,''
Fox has a youthful, energetic persona _ one not typically
associated with a disease thought of as an affliction of the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, about 15 percent to 20 percent of those diagnosed are
younger than 50, according to the National Parkinson Foundation.
About 10 percent of all cases occur in people younger than 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel so invisible,'' said Mallut, who first noticed the
symptoms at age 32 and was diagnosed with the disease at 39.
``Everyone thinks it's an older person's disease, but it's not. We
have families we are raising or have raised and none of us want to
be dependent on the government for support.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's publicists say support for the star of ABC's hit sitcom
``Spin City'' has been overwhelming as hundreds of well-wishers
call his office and write letters of support.
</P>
<P>
   National Parkinson Foundation representatives have approached
Fox to serve as their spokesman, seeing his disclosure as an
opportunity to improve public understanding and raise more research
dollars to find better treatments and, eventually, a cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Hallelujah!' '' said Rod Preston, 48, of Moorpark,
who was diagnosed 17 years ago. ``I wouldn't wish this disease on
anyone. But I've been waiting for someone young and famous to have
it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is no known cause or cure for Parkinson's disease, a
condition that cripples the brain's ability to direct muscle
activity.
</P>
<P>
   While there are many drugs and surgeries that can alleviate the
symptoms, the disease cannot be reversed. Parkinson's is
progressive and ultimately renders some people unable to walk, talk
or care for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Depression is common. Over time, people can develop what's known
as a Parkinson's ``mask'' _ when the muscles of the face get so
rigid they don't register facial expression.
</P>
<P>
   And in some, it can lead to dementia.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, however, the symptoms of Parkinson's disease
are hardly noticeable. They creep up insidiously _ first, perhaps,
with a recurrent twitch, a sluggish arm or an ever-so-slight
shaking.
</P>
<P>
   Fox noticed his left pinkie twitching while on location filming
the romantic comedy ``Doc Hollywood'' in 1991. Within six months,
the tremor had spread to his left hand, and his shoulder had become
achy and stiff, he told People magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors had circulated on a Parkinson's Internet mailing list for
years that Fox had the disorder, Mallut said.
</P>
<P>
   Watching ``Spin City'' after hearing the news, she noticed the
tell-tale signs of a person disguising Parkinson's, such as Fox's
habit of keeping his hands in his pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Like Fox, many people choose to cope with the disease privately,
hiding the symptoms from employers and from the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel diminished by it,'' said Joanne Nelson, 53, of
Chatsworth.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson noticed her disease much the same way as Fox _ a tremor
in her pinkie in her early 30s. Then looking in the mirror one day
while brushing her hair, she noticed her hair shaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized my head must be shaking, too,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Because there is no test for Parkinson's disease, it took
several years for Nelson to get a correct diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most neurologists are often very nervous about rendering that
diagnosis in a 30-year-old,'' said Dr. Cheryl Waters, chief of the
Movement Disorders division at the University of Southern
California and director of USC's National Parkinson Foundation
Clinic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first drug to treat Parkinson's, levodopa, was on the market
as far back as the 1960s. But the side effects of the drug were,
for some people, as bad as the disease. Levodopa relieved rigidity,
but some patients also experienced nausea, heart problems,
dangerous drops in blood pressure and dyskinesia, or
uncontrollable, wild movements.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, the original medication was combined with a second
drug, carbidopa, and called Sinemet; the combination drug remains a
staple treatment. Patients take it as often as once an hour to
restore the brain's production of dopamine, the chemical messenger
that helps nerve cells communicate with each other _ and therefore
the muscles.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, the drug loses its effectiveness over time and
can act unpredictably. It's a constant balancing act to take the
correct amount. A little too much, and side effects return.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to Preston after he took his hourly dose of
medicine at a Christmas party for Parkinson's patients in the North
Ranch Community Center in Westlake Village last week.
</P>
<P>
   His body jerked. He crossed and recrossed his legs and held one
hand down with the other. After about an hour, the movement
subsided _ but then it was time to take the medicine again.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard for Preston to believe anything could terrify him
more than the combat he saw in Vietnam _ until he woke in the
middle of the night unable to move, gasping for breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least in Vietnam, I could keep my weapon clean. I could
stay alert,'' he said. ``With this, you feel you have no control.
My only sense of control is my thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's torment. It's like rigor mortis without the benefit of
death.''
</P>
<P>
   For people with pronounced symptoms, several types of surgeries
can help. Fox, for example, underwent a thalamotomy, which can
alleviate tremors by destroying the overactive area of the brain
that causes them.
</P>
<P>
   A pallidotomy is a similar operation that can treat balance
problems and rigidity. Doctors and patients say a promising third
surgical option uses deep brain stimulation to dramatically reduce
severe tremors.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson tried an experimental fetal tissue transplant to replace
the cells in the brain that produce dopamine. She feels it has
helped somewhat, but it wasn't a resounding success.
</P>
<P>
   Preston is holding off as long as he can before resorting to
risky brain surgery. The longer he can wait, the more doctors will
know about the disease and the greater the chances of success, he
believes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the emotional and physical difficulties of coping with
the disease, advances in medicine and surgical treatments have
given Parkinson's patients reason to feel more optimistic than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Last week at the Christmas party, some Parkinson's patients got
up to dance. As they joked and chatted, you had to look closely to
notice the twitches and tremors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would not have been possible 10 years ago,'' said
Kimberly Seidman, West Coast director of the National Parkinson
Foundation. ``You would have seen jerking and flailing limbs. The
embarrassment was so great they simply stayed home.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mallut, it's the small things the disease has taken from her
that have been the most difficult to cope with. She can no longer
hold her hand steady to apply lipstick the way she used to. She
can't cut a steak and chew it without feeling as if she's choking.
</P>
<P>
   She can't roll over in bed to get comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   She had to skip the Christmas party because her balance was off
and she felt her body reacting strangely to the medicine that day.
</P>
<P>
   During the hours and days the symptoms stretch on, she can do
little else besides watch TV. Even reading can be impossible
because the disease affects the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   But when the symptoms subside, Mallut is ready to make the most
of it. She goes for a walk around Lake Balboa. Outside in the
sunshine, she feels hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a deal with myself that I didn't want to be pitiable,''
she said. ``There are days when there aren't good reasons to live.
So I make them. I watch the kids skating and talk to the old men
fishing. And I feel better.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The greater Los Angeles area has several support groups for
people with Parkinson's disease and their families. Some groups are
tailored for young onset patients. Most welcome all ages. For more
information about the disease, support groups and centers
specializing in Parkinson's treatment, call the West Coast office
of the National Parkinson Foundation office in Encino at (800)
400-8448.

`JOAN OF ARC' SOIREE A FAMILY AFFAIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; A chance to meet Jodie Foster, Isabella
Rossellini and Winona Ryder? What a way to kick off the holiday
soiree season.
</P>
<P>
   The trio were the honorary hostesses for the Directors Guild of
America screening party for the newly restored 1948 film ``Joan of
Arc.'' Guests _ and press _ lined up around a fragrant 20-foot
Christmas tree awaiting their arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Rossellini was the first to arrive, wearing about a dozen ropes
of pearls around her throat and a stunning black velvet-trimmed
pantsuit by MaxMara, the Italian design company that sponsored the
party. I don't know if she'd planned it or not, but the actress had
her hair cut super short with bangs, and many remarked how much the
style made her look like her mother, Ingrid Bergman, who played
Joan of Arc.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Rossellini if she'd ever seen her mom in the film when
she was growing up, and she told me she had a vague recollection of
it when she was about 4 or 5. She said the burning-at-the-stake
scene was what she remembered _ and was frightened by _ the most.
</P>
<P>
   She also explained that her mother had a lifelong love of Joan
of Arc and had more than 120 books on her. Adding, ``I think that
she felt the same thing about acting that Joan of Arc felt about
her mission, that it was a calling, just like Joan of Arc's mission
was a calling from God. It was the same strong impulse that ruled
her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster was next in the arrivals line, also wearing pants. ``It's
by Armani,'' she said of her gray pin-striped suit, accented with
the currently trendy Gucci loafers with a silver buckle, and big
diamond studs in her ears. Her choice of designers has nothing to
do with status, however. ``Actually, I hate to shop, so, when I do,
I look for clothes that will last 20 years. And Italians are all
about classics,'' she confided.
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar-winning actress said she's also a fan of film
preservation, which is what the party was all about. ``I don't get
involved in that many things, but I'm interested in saving obscure
little movie gems to introduce them to the world. Actually not
introduce them, as much as have them available for people to
stumble upon ... like I did in college,'' she said. Asked which of
her films she considered a little movie gem, she said she worried
that ``Little Man Tate'' eventually could disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, the UCLA Film and Television Archive, the Film
Foundation and Martin Scorsese won't let that happen.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when Foster was at the podium, she said ``Joan of Arc,''
was finally going to be seen the way the film was meant to be seen,
adding that Bergman was a role model for her when she was about 9
years old.
</P>
<P>
   Ryder, wearing a black sheath in that new below-the-knee length,
spoke next, but Foster didn't leave her many lines. ``I'm proud to
be here, and want to echo everything Jodie said. She's a hard act
to follow,'' Ryder commented, adding that the film presentation
honors the memory of those who made the film.
</P>
<P>
   After the film, we gathered around the tree in the guild's lobby
and dined on salmon, chicken and roast beef with a bounty of
fattening desserts, including creme brule, maple mousse and
chocolate napoleans _ all provided by the chi-chi restaurant
Patina.
</P>
<P>
   At my table was British Consul General Paul Dimond, who
commented how wonderful it was to see the film again after so many
years. He didn't seem to mind that the English were the bad guys in
the film.
</P>
<P>
   Also in attendance was MaxMara chairman Luigi Maramotti, who was
in town to celebrate the opening of his new store in Beverly Hills.
Actors there to support the film preservation cause included Kyle
MacLachlan, James Woods and Elliot Gould. &QL;

SPACE STATION IS A RISKY VENTURE FOR NASA AND PARTNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The international space station that is being
assembled 285 miles above Earth faces enough hazards to fill a
stack of paperback science fiction thrillers.
</P>
<P>
   Fires, explosions, solar flares, power failures and collisions
with space debris could threaten the station _ history's grandest
construction project and humanity's first stepping stone to Mars
and worlds beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The risks may seem remote this week, as the world's largest
orbiting public works project gets under way. But the risks are
real, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Goldin, the administrator of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, expects to face ``countless problems and
countless issues'' during station construction.
</P>
<P>
   The station, which may eventually cost as much as $100 billion,
is a collaboration of 16 nations, including the United States,
Russia, Canada, Japan and European countries. It will be used for
conducting orbital scientific experiments and learning how humans
would endure a three-year mission to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any large construction project on Earth where
there hasn't been injuries or deaths,'' said Dr. Julie Swain, a
surgeon and member of the NASA Advisory Council that advises Goldin
on space issues.
</P>
<P>
   In space, ``you're doing a bigger construction project in a
horrible environment,'' said Swain, who works at the University of
Kentucky. ``I think it's common sense that something bad will
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheer size of the space station offers more opportunity for
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   When completed in the next few years, the station will measure
356 feet by 290 feet, big enough to glow like a bright star in the
night sky. It will have as much volume as two Boeing 747s.
</P>
<P>
   On board, a rotating crew of seven astronauts will live for
months at a time. They will work, eat, and sleep amid forests of
pumps, cables, and wires, electrically powered by highway-wide
solar panels. They will study their physiological, psychological
and orthopedic reactions to space flight, generating information
useful for long-term missions to Mars and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   With repeated retrofitting, it may last decades longer than its
official 10-year life span.
</P>
<P>
   NASA advisers appear to be preparing the public emotionally for
the possibility of problems during construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough program, it is ugly, it is difficult,'' Goldin
admitted in testimony to the House Science Committee on June 24.
</P>
<P>
   The crew of the shuttle Endeavour is on a mission this week to
assemble the first two components of the station _ the Russian
Zarya (``Sunrise'') power module, which was launched Nov. 20, and
the American Unity module. Unity, which was carried into orbit on
Endeavour, is a 25,000-pound, 18-foot section that will link to
other station components.
</P>
<P>
   In deft maneuvers, the Russian and U.S. shuttle crew connected
the two components Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dangers astronauts will face when the station is
staffed:
</P>
<P>
   _ Fires. In February 1997, the crew of the aging Russian Mir
space station, including American Jerry Linenger, fought ``an
impressive, life-threatening fire. ... It was very surprising how
fast the smoke spread throughout the complex,'' Linenger wrote in
his report to NASA.
</P>
<P>
   _ Collisions between space station components during assembly. A
spaceship rammed into Mir last year, crumpling its solar panels and
causing a slow air leak.
</P>
<P>
   _ Exposure to solar radiation. Around the turn of the century,
the sun is expected to enter a period of intensified solar
activity. As a result, crew members will be bombarded with a
higher-than-usual amount of radiation, which could have adverse
medical effects, such as cancer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Space debris. Millions of pieces from prior space flights
litter Earth's orbit. Traveling at many miles per second, they
could punch holes in the space station, asphyxiating astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Loss of heat and electrical power. As long as the space
station points within a 15-degree plane relative to its orbit, it
will capture enough sunlight to electrify its solar panels. If it
sways out of that plane, heat and power supplies could plunge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dangerous space walks or ``extravehicular activities'' (EVAs),
lasting a total of more than 1,000 hours, during which astronauts
will assemble station components. That's more than in the entire
previous history of NASA.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent NASA Advisory Council meeting, some members
expressed concern that ``the number of estimated hours of EVA ...
was getting longer,'' recalled former council member Elisabeth
Pate-Cornell, who chairs the department of industrial engineering
and engineering management at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   ``EVAs have some risks associated with them ... (although) I
don't think these risks are very high,'' said Pate-Cornell, a
specialist in risk analysis.
</P>
<P>
   James Oberg is one of the most distinguished experts to express
concern about the risks to the station. A former NASA engineer and
space writer, he left the agency this year.
</P>
<P>
   In June, in a little-noticed article for the magazine Spectrum,
published by the Institute of Electronic and Electrical Engineers,
Oberg wrote: ``In boasting about how much the Mir experience taught
them, NASA officials unwittingly highlight the shallowness of
pre-Mir preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   And if NASA officials think Mir taught them about space station
hazards, he said, ``this could be the road to more disasters.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The American and Russian space programs have endured deaths and
disasters before, including the grisly explosion of the Challenger
space shuttle over Florida in January 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Disasters struck the first space stations. In 1971, the Soviets
launched Salyut 1; its three-man crew asphyxiated on re-entry when
their space capsule lost air pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the United States launched a roomy, cylindrical
space station called Skylab. NASA intermittently housed astronauts
aboard Skylab. While unoccupied, solar activity increased, causing
Earth's upper atmosphere to rise and to exert `drag'' on Skylab.
The result: In 1979, it prematurely returned to Earth and burned up
in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year-old Mir has acquired a reputation as the scariest
spaceship in history because of fires, power failures,
malfunctioning computers, and a collision with another vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   During assembly of the new station, a schedule mistake might be
disastrous. As with Skylab, atmospheric drag will slowly but
constantly nudge the station back to Earth. Astronauts must visit
the station at least once each year to raise it back to its
appropriate orbit. Otherwise, it would plunge into the atmosphere,
generating history's most expensive fireworks show.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials remain optimistic that they've done everything
they could to keep space station builders and inhabitants safe.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Swain said, any historic venture entails risk.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: We illustrious writers with the
initials `JM'
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Old Jay Milner of Fort Worth, who grinds out a
new book every 35 years or so, has finally come out with his
long-awaited second opus, ``Confessions of a Mad Dog,'' such was
the group of writers and musicians who ran in packs in Austin
during the 1950s-70s.
</P>
<P>
   Jay and I are old friends, going back some 25 years. He even
writes about me in the book, though never quoting me fully and
accurately, which I appreciate, and instead making me seem
something I never was _ interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jay, who is now in his mid-70s, has lived out 10
lifetimes or so, such are the roles he played ...
</P>
<P>
   _ High school state football champion, Lubbock, 1939.
</P>
<P>
   _ War hero. (He taught WACs how to swim.)
</P>
<P>
   _ College gridiron star at Southern Mississippi, later drafted
in the 100th round, thereabouts, by the Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Desoto new car salesman working for the first of a succession
of fathers-in-law. (Never sold the first car).
</P>
<P>
   _ Managing editor of the fabled Delta Democrat in Greenville,
Miss., fighting some of the earliest civil rights battles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Helped edit the editorial pages of the beloved New York
Herald-Tribune in the days leading to its demise.
</P>
<P>
   _ Authored a long-forgotten novel, ``Incident at Ashton,'' which
in its time was compared with ``To Kill a Mockingbird.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Taught journalism at SMU and TCU back in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   _ Edited a country music magazine that was the focus of Willie
Nelson's first Fourth of July picnic, a fund-raiser to try and keep
the magazine alive.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hid out in Lufkin (peaceful place for people who ``can't
afford Betty Ford's sanitarium,'' says Jay) for more than 20 years
while completing his second book.
</P>
<P>
   _ Published his book, ``Confessions of a Mad Dog'' ($29.95,
University of North Texas Press), a fascinating collection of
stories despite a major flaw.
</P>
<P>
   It leaves out what I consider the best Jay Milner story of all.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that I'll relate it here and now, what you won't read
in Jay's book.
</P>
<P>
   This was in the 1970s. The story comes from the wife of author
Dan (''Semi-Tough'') Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, a writer for Sports Illustrated magazine, and his wife
were in Saudi Arabia for part of a series of articles on the best
golf courses in the world. Their plane had been met by a limo,
which immediately proceeded to a private jet that also just landed.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from the private jet was a beautiful young woman,
dressed as a princess might be, and with eyes so dark that a man
might wander into them and never find his way out. She entered the
limo and said not a word to her companions.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, as the wife told it, immediately went into his act _
his one-man show for impressing pretty women, that all but involved
his juggling while riding a unicycle and recounting his resume of
success as a novelist and all-around famous personage.
</P>
<P>
   The lovely woman seemed to take no notice at all _ not until he
happened to mention he was from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're from Texas?'' she asked, excitedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why, yes ma'am,'' Jenkins replied, his hopes soaring.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you're a writer?'' she exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``True enough,'' said Jenkins, smiling his best Texas writer
smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know Jay Milner?!'' she gasped.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins sunk back into the seat of the limo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never heard of him,'' he mumbled.
</P>
<P>
   How Jay ever counted an Arabian princess among his fans is
something he never fully explained to me. Here's hoping the answer
lies in a possible sequel, ``Son of Mad Dog.''

 &HT;    GATES: TRUSTBUSTERS SEEK TO DESTROY MICROSOFT
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    740 words
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Bill Gates charged the government Monday with
seeking to ruin Microsoft Corp. in court by coming to the aid of
its business rivals.
</P>
<P>
   In a satellite press conference beamed from Microsoft's Redmond,
Wash., campus, the company's chairman and co-founder said David
Boies, the lead counsel for the Justice Department, ``made it clear
in the negotiations leading up to the case that he's really out to
destroy Microsoft. He is out to take all the work we have done and
make us look very bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The claim comes the same day as news was released that one of 20
states that had joined the Justice Department in suing Microsoft
had dropped out. The suit claims abuse of the company's monopoly
power in software for personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Boies said in an interview that ``Microsoft has only itself to
blame for making the colossal error of failing to call Gates'' as
one of its 12 allotted witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bill Gates were to be put on the witness stand, the 20-hour
deposition we took in August could not have been entered into
evidence,'' Boies noted. ``And if (Gates) didn't want to testify,
they should have at least warned him that all this stuff would be
made public.''
</P>
<P>
   To Microsoft chagrin, Boies has been playing excerpts of the
Gates deposition videotape at the trial, now entering its eighth
week.
</P>
<P>
   The government has sought to portray Gates as an evasive,
forgetful and surly figure whose testimony has often proved at odds
with once-secret Microsoft documents in which he comes across as a
fierce hands-on competitor. Microsoft's lawyers brand the segments
as ``snippets,'' aimed at destroying the world's richest man.
</P>
<P>
   With the trial due to resume Tuesday, Microsoft struck back
outside the courtroom by staging a virtual Gates press conference.
</P>
<P>
   The company's high command was further buoyed when news came
that South Carolina was dropping out of the suit, leaving 19 states
joined with the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recent events have proven that the Internet is a segment of
our economy where innovation is thriving,'' said Charles Condon,
the state's attorney general. ``Further government intervention or
regulation is unnecessary and, in my judgment, unwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would appear as a witness to counter the poor
impression he created on the tapes, Gates said if the government
called him ``that would be fine.'' But Microsoft's witnesses, he
went on, were chosen from the executives most familiar with the
issues raised by the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I answered truthfully every single question that was put to
me,'' Gates told reporters, noting that he receives about 10,000
e-mail messages a year and often can't recall their details. But he
conceded he might have smiled during the deposition -- had he known
the government would play the videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Gates said, consumers have not complained about the
company's products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our competitors are complaining,'' he said and added: ``Who is
the government representing? A handful of competitors or consumers.
We are trying hard to compete. Success today is no guarantee of
success tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina's Condon struck a similar theme in disputing that
the suit would benefit consumers, as the government contends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers have not taken a leading role in this action,'' he
said. ``That's because there are no monopolies on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Gates and Condon cited America Online Inc.'s recently
proposed $4.2 billion takeover of Netscape Communications Corp. as
proving there was plenty of competition in cyberspace. Sun
Microsystems Inc., a bitter Microsoft critic, is also a party to
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   As Gates put it: ``When you look at the AOL-Netscape deal, it's
hard to believe that the government can still press their case with
a straight face. Three of the biggest competitors are banding
together, and yet the government is still trying to slow us down.''
</P>
<P>
   In further pressing their attack, Microsoft's lawyers filed a
motion with U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who
is trying the case without a jury, for permission to examine
confidential documents from the participants and their investment
bankers on how the three-way deal was put together.
</P>
<P>
   ``This discovery (process) may also give all of us a better
understanding about what was occurring with respect to this
alliance while witnesses from these companies were on the stand in
this litigation,'' said William Neukom, the company's general
counsel.

 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    740 words
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Bill Gates charged the government Monday with
seeking to ruin Microsoft Corp. in court by coming to the aid of
its business rivals.
</P>
<P>
   In a satellite press conference beamed from Microsoft's Redmond,
Wash., campus, the company's chairman and co-founder said David
Boies, the lead counsel for the Justice Department, ``made it clear
in the negotiations leading up to the case that he's really out to
destroy Microsoft. He is out to take all the work we have done and
make us look very bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The claim comes the same day as news was released that one of 20
states that had joined the Justice Department in suing Microsoft
had dropped out. The suit claims abuse of the company's monopoly
power in software for personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Boies said in an interview that ``Microsoft has only itself to
blame for making the colossal error of failing to call Gates'' as
one of its 12 allotted witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bill Gates were to be put on the witness stand, the 20-hour
deposition we took in August could not have been entered into
evidence,'' Boies noted. ``And if (Gates) didn't want to testify,
they should have at least warned him that all this stuff would be
made public.''
</P>
<P>
   To Microsoft chagrin, Boies has been playing excerpts of the
Gates deposition videotape at the trial, now entering its eighth
week.
</P>
<P>
   The government has sought to portray Gates as an evasive,
forgetful and surly figure whose testimony has often proved at odds
with once-secret Microsoft documents in which he comes across as a
fierce hands-on competitor. Microsoft's lawyers brand the segments
as ``snippets,'' aimed at destroying the world's richest man.
</P>
<P>
   With the trial due to resume Tuesday, Microsoft struck back
outside the courtroom by staging a virtual Gates press conference.
</P>
<P>
   The company's high command was further buoyed when news came
that South Carolina was dropping out of the suit, leaving 19 states
joined with the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recent events have proven that the Internet is a segment of
our economy where innovation is thriving,'' said Charles Condon,
the state's attorney general. ``Further government intervention or
regulation is unnecessary and, in my judgment, unwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would appear as a witness to counter the poor
impression he created on the tapes, Gates said if the government
called him ``that would be fine.'' But Microsoft's witnesses, he
went on, were chosen from the executives most familiar with the
issues raised by the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I answered truthfully every single question that was put to
me,'' Gates told reporters, noting that he receives about 10,000
e-mail messages a year and often can't recall their details. But he
conceded he might have smiled during the deposition -- had he known
the government would play the videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Gates said, consumers have not complained about the
company's products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our competitors are complaining,'' he said and added: ``Who is
the government representing? A handful of competitors or consumers.
We are trying hard to compete. Success today is no guarantee of
success tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina's Condon struck a similar theme in disputing that
the suit would benefit consumers, as the government contends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers have not taken a leading role in this action,'' he
said. ``That's because there are no monopolies on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Gates and Condon cited America Online Inc.'s recently
proposed $4.2 billion takeover of Netscape Communications Corp. as
proving there was plenty of competition in cyberspace. Sun
Microsystems Inc., a bitter Microsoft critic, is also a party to

 &HT;    NURSE'S INTERNET POSTING BECOMES WHITE HOUSE PROTEST
 &HT;    PHOTOS to accompany this story are being placed in the National
folder on the Cox server.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just over two months ago, Michelle Hellgeth, a
nurse from Marietta, Ga., was in her home, tapping out Internet
messages urging the impeachment of President Clinton. That was too
passive, she concluded.
</P>
<P>
   So she sent out a call to on-line conservatives. ``I said,
'Let's have a march,''' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   And although she admitted she had no idea how to pull it off, on
Monday she was standing on a platform between giant loud speakers
to welcome a modest lunch-hour protest across from the White House
in Lafayette Park. For more than two hours, a dozen Clinton critics
assailed the president in front of a crowd bearing signs such as
``Impeach the rat.''
</P>
<P>
   A vote to impeach Clinton is ``by no means'' certain, Howard
Phillips, chairman of the Conservative Caucus, told the gathering.
``Bill Clinton will use all of the power of his presidency'' to
stop it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As she watched the results of her first-time political
organizing, Hellgeth said she would have liked to have had a bigger
turnout than the roughly 70 people who showed up. But Hellgeth, the
mother of three grown children, allowed that she wasn't
disappointed. ``We're glad we had some to come and hear the
message,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, her political activism had extended to telephoning
the White House to offer comments. But using her bedroom computer
to search conservative Web sites on the Internet, Hellgeth made
enough contacts to set up the Washington rally.
</P>
<P>
   Her partner was another self-proclaimed political neophyte,
Debbie Cragg of Virginia Beach, Va. ``Michelle and I got together
over the Internet,'' she said. ``I'm just a normal person. I just
got mad. I'm not part of the 'vast right wing conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The two women hooked up with veteran Clinton foes, including
Garland Favorito, a computer consultant from Peachtree Corners,
Ga., who linked them with speakers and ordered up the loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   The two women then worked the Internet sites to send out the
word.
</P>
<P>
   That message got through to Susan Sarver, of Parkersburg, W.Va.,
who brought her four children, ages 4 to 11, who joined a march
around the park with signs, including one saying, ``Dear President,
My parents punish me for lying.''

 &HT;    Magoo's `Carol' is treat from holiday past
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a whole lot of folks of a certain age, their first exposure
to Charles Dickens' ``A Christmas Carol'' was heaped with
razzleberry dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1962, before the Grinch stole Christmas (on TV anyway)
or Charlie Brown brought back that poor, bedraggled little tree,
NBC aired ``Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol,'' an animated one-hour
special of Charles Dickens' oft-adapted tale of Victorian
redemption. The Grinch and the Peanuts gang became holiday
perennials, but poor Quincy Magoo was banished to some back room,
unseen on TV for decades and nearly impossible to find on video.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, though, it popped up on the Disney Channel, and
tonight it's on PAX Net, a new family-values network that's
available from all metro Atlanta cable operators (if you don't have
cable, it's Channel 14). Do yourself and your family a favor and
check it out.
</P>
<P>
   The animation is almost alarmingly primitive, but that's quickly
forgotten as you're swept up in the music of Jule Styne (who also
wrote the songs to ``Gypsy'') and the lyrics of Bob Merrill (who
went on to write the lyrics to ``Funny Girl''). It was Merrill who
wrote the lines for Tiny Tim to sing about his favorite razzleberry
dressing, and Styne's music is dazzling. This is a full-fledged
Broadway-quality score grafted on to an otherwise unsophisticated
little cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   The extremely myopic Magoo (who may take some explaining to the
little ones) hasn't worn well as a comic figure, but the late Jim
Backus can get surprisingly poignant when he sings in that
fakey-creaky voice. And bet you didn't know the late Jack Cassidy
was the voice of Bob Cratchit.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Christmas Carol'' can be both joyous and scary (as anyone
who's seen the current Alliance Theatre(Ga.) production can
attest), and this one is both. Toward the end, when that Ghost of
Christmas Yet to Come waggles the bony finger sticking out of its
shroud and Scrooge quavers before his own tombstone, a whole new
generation can have the Dickens scared out of 'em. It's about time.
</P>
<P>
   TV REVIEW
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   7 tonight E.S.T. on PAX Net .
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: ``A Christmas far more glorious than grand.''

 &HT;    Time declares movie hero a metaphor
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who was the real Moses and did he really perform all those
miraculous deeds? The soon-to-be-released animated film ``The
Prince of Egypt'' inspired Time ($2.95) to re-examine the facts and
fallacies about the Old Testament hero. Writer David van Biema
concludes that archaeological and historical evidence are sketchy,
but it really doesn't matter. ``It is our nature to search for
heroes, and Moses, rebel and saint, is as relevant today as he ever
was. He is a metaphor for our times, proof that a single flawed
human being can be chosen to change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cruise control: For a time, Nicole Kidman was better known as
Mrs. Tom Cruise than as a serious actress. That is changing,
Newsweek ($2.95) reports in a cover story about Kidman's daring and
critically acclaimed role in ``The Blue Room'' on Broadway. When
they're not acting and dodging paparazzi, the Cruises climb
mountains in Nepal, scuba dive and jump out of airplanes. And what
about the marriage? ``When you're loved for your flaws, that's when
you really feel safe.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Unsolved mystery: Nearly two years after the death of JonBenet
Ramsey, People ($2.99) reports on the investigation and provides a
glimpse of the Ramseys' new life in Atlanta. Things apparently are
as normal as possible under the circumstances, says family friend
Linda McLean. Son Burke Ramsey, 11, plays sports and attends the
Lovett School, Patsy remains the consummate homemaker, and John is
starting a new software business. Meanwhile, as a Boulder, Colo.,
grand jury considers the evidence, some experts doubt that District
Attorney Alex Hunter would take the case to trial even if there is
an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Star-studded party: You don't have to spend thousands of
dollars to study the stars. As David DeVoss writes in the December
Smithsonian ($4), the comet Hale-Bopp was discovered by Alan Hale,
an astronomer, and Tom Bopp, a parts-supply manager. Bopp, an
amateur stargazer, proved you don't need an expensive telescope to
go down in history. On the night he discovered the comet, Bopp had
driven into the Arizona desert to look at the night sky with
friends. Since then, other star parties have sprung up around the
country, but Arizona has become the center of ``astronomical
tourism'' because of the dark nights and high elevation.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quick reads: According to U.S. News &AMP; World Report ($2.95),
office romances are alive and well, despite the best efforts of
corporations to stifle love in the workplace. And one of the most
hazardous events at work is the office Christmas party. Experts
recommend setting a tone of moderation and omitting the mistletoe.
. . . Newt Gingrich probably didn't foresee stepping down as
speaker of the House when he gave some travel pointers to Men's
Health ($2.95), but they are still viable. In ``How Not to Be
Left,'' Gingrich advises travelers to pack conservatively, check
the performance record of your airline and make your own call to
the airline's 800 number if you're bumped from a flight. . . .
Business to Business ($3.50) is the first magazine to feature
Georgia's Gov.-elect Roy Barnes on its cover. In the article,
Barnes discusses some of the issues he plans to address (health
care, tax cuts) and includes some humorous advice from Zell Miller.
One example: ``You can't govern effectively if you tap dance.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Publishing note: Art &AMP; Antiques ($4.95) is moving its
editorial staff from New York to Atlanta by the first of the year,
according to Monte Plott, vice president and editorial director.
The new editor in chief is Barbara Tapp, formerly editor of Atlanta
Homes and Lifestyles. ``We're broadening the scope of the magazine
to cover lifestyle aspects of arts and antiques as well as the
objects themselves,'' Plott says. The April issue will reflect the
changes. The magazine's offices will be at 2100 Powers Ferry Road.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Outside the White House, life is neither festive
nor traditional as the House of Representatives lurches erratically
toward impeachment and the unseasonal hot weather produces furry
buds on the tulip magnolias outside First Lady Hillary Clinton's
office window.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the White House, 'tis nonetheless the season to be jolly
in a lavishly decorated winter wonderland enveloping the
president's house in fir boughs and wreaths, frosted magnolia
leaves and birch trees, gilded pine cones, glittering gold and
silver ornaments, and delicate, edible confections depicting
elaborate Christmas scenes.
</P>
<P>
   This year the great mansion gleams with 344 wreaths, 18
decorated Christmas trees, 2,700 lights on the central Blue Room
tree, 843 fancy bows and countless handcrafted ornaments. Plus a
chandelier dripping with gilded holly, golden swags, silver
icicles, golden garlands and silvery bows. And similarly draped
grapevine angels tootling their horns before each of the East
Room's four mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   This is a wow. It is the most elegantly dressed-up Christmas
White House in my memory, although the decorations there are always
spectacular. You cannot try to duplicate them at home.
</P>
<P>
   This year's display is pure fantasy in every sense. The
atmosphere is magical and serene.
</P>
<P>
   On the public floors of the White House, outside reality dare
not intrude. The holiday social cocoon is impenetrable.
</P>
<P>
   What life is like in the off-limits upstairs family quarters or
in the his-and-hers offices is strictly private. We cannot know
about that. The Clintons are practiced at compartmentalizing. They
never let their opponents see them cry.
</P>
<P>
   Composed and smiling, the first lady showed reporters the
cheerful seasonal transformation Monday, revealing nothing more
serious than a minor struggle to keep their dog Buddy away from the
tempting gingerbread castle in the State Dining Room. Blandly, she
said she hoped the White House parties and special events would be
``as beautiful and welcoming and hospitable as they always have
been.''
</P>
<P>
   That evening the Clintons were hosting their annual Christmas
party for Congress, a bipartisan affair that included some
Republicans panting to impeach the president. The parties for other
groups and even the press will also go on as usual.
</P>
<P>
   She had barely finished her tour when her husband's press
secretary, Joe Lockhart, began in a nearby undecorated room to
explain to other reporters how President Clinton's lawyers intended
to defend him before the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   This could well be the most dangerous period of the Clinton
presidency, with only a few days left of final impeachment
arguments before a committee vote the end of the week. It is not
inconceivable _ although not likely _ that this could be their last
Christmas as occupants of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is the symbolic burden of the president and his wife to
carry on in public as though all is well, no matter how trying the
moment, how ominous the future. Only in this way does the republic,
and the White House, endure. We cannot be strong if our presidents
are weak.
</P>
<P>
   That the Clintons are so skilled at keeping what the British
call a stiff upper lip is one of the reasons the public still gives
them both high marks for performance and does not want to see him
kicked out of office.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a year makes. At last year's Christmas
celebration, Clinton was as strong and popular politically as he
had ever been. The Paula Jones suit was chaotic and stalled,
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr had been unable to produce an
indictment in the Whitewater probe that reached into the White
House, and Clinton had pulled off a widely hailed balanced budget
deal in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He could not run again, which made him a lame duck vulnerable to
defiance from various political rivals. But he seemed comfortably
positioned to maximize the remaining three years of his second term
in productive ways.
</P>
<P>
   We learned of Monica Lewinsky the following month. And that was
that for the year 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton is not the only president forced to soldier on
through the Christmas holidays with a smiling face and heavy heart.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, President and Mrs. George Bush celebrated with outward
normalcy, although between their joyful holiday rounds the
president was weighing whether to go to war. One month later, on
Jan. 16, he opted to attack Iraq's Saddam Hussein for invading
Kuwait, mounting a risky military confrontation that had won Senate
approval by only five votes.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as now, the mood in Washington beyond the White House was
one of tension, partisan suspicion and a mounting sense that the
president was a flawed link in the majestic sweep of history.
</P>
<P>
   History, however, takes care of itself. In the meantime, a
temporary holiday spirit of peace and good will is a good thing.

   COMP-SALARY _ ATLANTA _ The ComputerJobs Store, the
award-winning employment Web site that offers regional-specific
jobs and career resources to technology professionals, announced
its first online salary survey, a timely analysis of wages and
compensation-related information. The report points directly to
gender-biased wage trends within the IT industry that are similar

   LOWES _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Home Depot and Lowe's Inc., the two
giants of the home improvement industry, are bullish on Austin. The
two companies are scrambling for real estate and customers to gain
market share in one of the hottest home improvement markets in the
country. This scramble is exemplified by a pending lawsuit filed by
Lowe's, which wanted to get into a prime retail center in South
Austin. Now it looks like Home Depot will be going into the center.
(Breyer, Austin American-Statesman).
</P>
<P>
   REEL _ WEST PALM BEACH _ The folks who produced the Reel to Reel
game show for PAX TV have stiffed contestants by not coming up with

for each show. Even the show's host, the ageless Peter Marshall,
got stiffed. (Sedore, Palm Beach Post)

</P>
<P>
   CYBERSCENE _ ATLANTA _ You won't be surprised to learn that the

the finest and most powerful of servers. Santa Claus, after all,
does not mess around. (Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOBUDDY_ ATLANTA _ In my old-fogey opinion, at least, that
daily commute in your car is unlikely to be replaced _ on a
day-to-day basis at least _ with a cyber-office at home. (Husted,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   NETWATCH _ ATLANTA _ Online auctions prove one of the basic
truths of human nature: one person's trash is another person's
treasure. The Web auction game is relatively new, and might be a
little too much for Web surfers just getting comfortable with
online shopping. Still, if you read the directions carefully and
ignore the $250 Furby's, (unless the money is going to charity) you
can find your own personal pot of gold _ or gold plate_ at an
online auction. (Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED

   TECH-REPORT _ ATLANTA _ Swatch, the company that made the

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early Monday afternoon, temperatures soared to 71 degrees at the
International Jetport in Portland, Maine, marking the first time
readings have reached 70 degrees in December since records at
Portland began in 1940. Farther south, the mercury climbed to 75
and 76 degrees at New York City and Boston, respectively, with each
reading breaking the all-time record high for December.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, high temperatures along the northeast seaboard will
be 25 to 35 degrees lower than Monday's record warmth in the wake
of a relatively bland cold front for December which will manage to
lower readings only to seasonal levels.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, broken areas of rain will develop over the northern
middle Atlantic and southern New England seaboards as an area of
low pressure ripples northeast along the stalling cold front. A
stripe of light snow is possible on the northern fringe of the rain
over the hills of southern and central Vermont and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The bastion of unseasonable warmth over the East in the past
several days will be confined to the southeast seaboard as balmy
winds from the southwest build ahead of the slow southern flank of
the cold front moving across the eastern states. Showers and a few
thunderstorms will escort the cold front across Alabama and
Tennessee into Georgia and the Carolina mountains. Meanwhile,
southern and central Florida will be sunny and warm.
</P>
<P>
   Just west of the front, clouds and a few broken areas of chilly
rain will affect parts of the region from the central Gulf states
to the Tennessee and lower Ohio valleys.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Desert Snow
</P>
<P>
   An inch of snow fell at McCarran International Airport in Las
Vegas early Sunday. Snowfall of an inch or more is rare in the
desert city, occurring, on average, about once every four years and
usually in January. Indeed, Sunday's snowfall marked only the
second December snowfall of an inch or more in Las Vegas since
records began in 1937. To add to the surreal setting on Sunday, a
peal of thunder was reported around the time snow began to fall. A
pocket of cold air at 18,000 feet, with temperatures as low as
minus 27 degrees Fahrenheit, sparked the thundery desert snow.

 &HT;    CLINTON TURNS TO OLD LAW SCHOOL FRIEND TO QUARTERBACK HIS
IMPEACHMENT DEFENSE
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Greg Craig is known around the White House as
``QB'' _ the ``quarterback'' of President Clinton's final campaign
to avoid impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   And when the White House begins its two-day defense of the
president Tuesday, Craig will lead the Clinton team onto the
treacherous field of the GOP-dominated House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has spent the last quarter century becoming one of
Washington's blue-chip lawyers, Craig is the least known of those
attorneys who have represented Clinton on his six-year slide to the
edge of presidential history.
</P>
<P>
   While he may lack the marquee power of Bill Bennett or David
Kendall or the institutional gravatus of Charles Ruff, Craig is
uniquely qualified to defend Clinton. His experience is a potent
mix of the legal and the political. Confrontational by nature, he
has as much appreciation for a finely-honed public relations
campaign as for a ground-breaking legal argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot of expertise and a lot of wisdom,'' said Mike
McCurry, the former Clinton White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Craig has been a chum of Clinton's since they were
classmates at Yale Law School. And when the president most needed a
friend _ the day after the lurid details of his affair with a
former White House intern became public _ Clinton turned to Craig.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in great pain,'' Craig recently told The Washington
Post as he recalled the two hours he spent with Clinton on the
balcony overlooking the South Lawn of the White House. It was the
evening of Sept. 10, the day after independent counsel Kenneth
Starr's report to Congress had been published on the World Wide
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, Craig agreed to leave his influential
position at the State Department to quarterback the White House
strategy to keep Clinton in office. He did so without much
enthusiasm, he confided to friends _ as well as to the president
himself.
</P>
<P>
   But like so many others who have known Clinton throughout his
life, Craig ultimately answered his friend's call for help.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, a boyishly handsome 53 years old with tousled grey hair,
is no stranger to politically-charged legal proceedings. He safely
guided Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., through the hazards of the
rape trial of his nephew, William Kennedy Smith, in Palm Beach in
1991. He also worked on the defense team of John Hinkley Jr., who
was acquitted by reason of insanity in the attempted assassination
of President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Craig was born at the Navy hospital in Norfolk, Va., where his
father, William Craig, was an officer during World War II. He grew
up in Palo Alto, Calif., near Stanford University where his father
was dean of men.
</P>
<P>
   Like Clinton, Craig was drawn to the civil rights movement. In
the mid-1960s, he registered black voters in Mississippi and later
tutored kids in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   It was Craig, not Clinton, who actually first gained national
attention for his activities at Harvard and Yale in opposition to
the Vietnam War. He was one of three antiwar activists at Yale who
were befriended by Hillary Rodham, the future first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his opposition to the Vietnam War, Craig ultimately
submitted himself to the military draft, but avoided service due to
a damaged shoulder _ the result of a prep school lacrosse injury.
</P>
<P>
   After law school, Craig joined the prestigious Washington law
firm of Williams &AMP; Connolly and was, at one point, the protege of
the late Edward Bennett Williams, a Washington legend.
</P>
<P>
   Craig has left the firm three times: first, to follow his wife
back to Yale for her graduate degree in art; second, to become a
foreign policy adviser to Kennedy; and finally, to become the
director of policy planning in the Clinton State Department, the
position he left to quarterback Clinton's impeachment defense.
</P>
<P>
   Craig and his wife, graphic designer Derry Craig, have five
children.

`A CAFE ON THE NILE': NONSTOP ACTION IN WARTIME ABYSSINIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at the end of the review) 
(rl) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Extreme Africa'' would be an alternative title for Bartle
Bull's new adventure novel, which takes place in 1935 in Egypt and
Ethiopia (more commonly known then as Abyssinia).
</P>
<P>
   In Cairo, where the Cataract Cafe attracts a fair share of the
exotic human menagerie of Europe, America, Africa and the East
Indies, a Goan dwarf named Olivio Alavedo schemes to create an
agricultural empire in newly irrigated lands along the Nile in
northern Egypt. In Abyssinia, meanwhile, a hunter named Anton
Rider, English by birth but raised by Gypsies (and a dead ringer
for Indiana Jones) takes three rich Americans on safari just when
Italy's brutal invasion of the country begins.
</P>
<P>
   Many other characters (there are camels, horses, mules and
chimpanzees as well as human beings) appear in Bull's ``Cafe on the
Nile,'' and a great deal of action takes place in a novel that,
even when it is a bit overdone, pulses with entertainment value. A
German rogue from Tanganyika, one Ernst von Decken, strives under
cover of the Italian invasion to steal a hoard of silver coins
minted by the fascist dictator Mussolini. Leading an Italian air
squadron in the war is Lorenzo Grimaldi, who happens to be the
lover of Anton's estranged wife, Gwenn, who also goes to Abyssinia,
as a volunteer nurse.
</P>
<P>
   When one of Anton's safari clients, a svelte and rich Kentuckian
named Harriet Mills, takes film footage of the Italians using
poison gas on the Ethiopians, Grimaldi sets out to catch her before
word of this violation of international law reaches the outside
world. The advantage switches back and forth more times than in a
close tennis match as Grimaldi's grim pursuit takes place. The
story unfolds with little regard for moral niceties and lots of
hacked-up corpses.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Bull's new novel could easily disintegrate by
virtue of its own high voltage, but it doesn't. Bull is an
English-born New York lawyer who once was publisher of The Village
Voice. He is described on the dust jacket as a student of Africa
for more than 30 years. He is also a skilled storyteller with a
knack for characters of rugged individualism and for suspenseful
situations. He has thrown everything into his new novel, from a
medical consideration of dwarfism to a luridly detailed description
of a camel abattoir in Cairo. He knows about guns and airplanes and
tracking game in the African bush, and he sprinkles his text with
expletives in Arabic, Italian, German, Swahili and Amharic.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes this is too much, especially toward the end when Anton
and Lorenzo, who have several reasons to hate each other, engage in
a protracted duel that just about exhausts all of the logical
possibilities for close calls, abrupt reversals of fortune and
types of ambush. Abyssinia is five times the size of Italy, yet the
main characters of Bull's novel stumble over one another often
enough to defy the laws of probability. Bull's characters also
never let pass a possible erotic encounter, to the point that
creative sexual escapades take on a cartoonish ``Thousand and One
Nights'' quality.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``A Cafe on the Nile'' is the sort of yarn that can keep
you up late at night. It acquires its narrative bristle early on
with the introduction of Olivio and his cafe, which brings people
together in the way that Rick's place did in ``Casablanca.'' Olivio
himself is a fine creation, a figure whose ambition, which is as
big as his body is small, needs to be advanced by wit, charm and
cunning. Within the first few chapters, all of Bull's main
characters have made their way to the cafe and met one another _
all but the mad German, von Decken, whom we meet at a gambling
casino not far from the pyramids.
</P>
<P>
   Anton is our hero, the most handsome and the least unscrupulous
of an unscrupulous and spoiled bunch. But we learn quickly that
Anton, nice as he is, has learned a few lessons in taking care of
himself in a rough world. And given all the dangers (the grimly
determined Grimaldi, cheats at the gambling table, thieves lying in
wait in the shadows of the pyramids, and the occasional crocodile)
it's a good thing, too.
</P>
<P>
   Anton lives in British Kenya. He comes to Cairo to meet his
safari clients, including the sexy and adventurous young Harriet,
one of a pair of twins. As long as he is in Cairo, he attempts to
win back Gwenn, who finally couldn't put up with his long absences
and his white-hunter lifestyle. Gwenn, who has two young boys to
take care of and is studying medicine, has become the mistress of
Grimaldi, who is fascist Italy's military attache in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, however, everybody but Olivio (who has his own murder and
mayhem to deal with at home) is off by steamship to Abyssinia, each
for a different purpose _ to engage in fascist-imperialist
conquest, to hunt animals, to seize an illicit fortune, to do good
works. Midway through the book these characters, all of them having
gone their separate ways, are rejoined, and a struggle to the death
spins suspensefully and cruelly to its conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   He is not a soldier but a hunter, Anton reminds himself at one
point, facing a tight spot and giving a hint as to the way his war
with his Italian foe is carried out. While Grimaldi wages his
struggle via technology and firepower, Anton relies on stealth and
wit. And, indeed, not the least of Bull's virtues as a writer of
adventure-strewn historical novels is his ability to come up with
unexpected, though always plausible (or at least logical) solutions
to what seemed like insurmountable problems. You finish this book
almost out of breath with the nonstop quality of the action, but
appreciative of Bull's spirited, sensuous, hot-blooded evocation of
a rich and eventful historical world.

ULTIMATE HIGH-BEAM JOB SITE: 240 MILES UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(lb) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their hard hats are helmets, their safety goggles are
gold-coated visors and their boots are made of bulletproof fibers
instead of leather, but they are nonetheless construction workers
doing high-beam work.
</P>
<P>
   Far above Earth, test pilots, engineers and scientists have
begun practicing the building trades as they tackle the mammoth job
of assembling a space station at a truly remote site.
</P>
<P>
   The space shuttle Endeavour, launched on Friday with a crew of
six, began one of the most challenging construction jobs in history
on Sunday when it joined the first two pieces of the station
together while orbiting 240 miles above Earth.
</P>
<P>
   To complete the mating of the Russian-built Zarya module and the
American-made Unity connecting node, the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration assigned a team of astronauts to conduct three
space walks about the modules, joining electrical cables, removing
covers, bolting on handles, attaching safety lines and taking on
scores of other tasks.
</P>
<P>
   This begins a series of space walks over the next five years by
American and Russian astronauts that will test their endurance and
skills as they slowly bolt, screw, wire and snap together the 100
major components of what will become the largest object ever placed
in space.
</P>
<P>
   Astronauts are training to make at least 162 planned space walks
during this period to assemble the station, and additional ventures
outside the outpost undoubtedly will be needed for unscheduled
maintenance or repairs. Experts say the expected 1,700 hours of
EVAs, for extravehicular activity, as NASA terms space walks, will
more than double the time people have spent outside spaceships
since human flights began 37 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the EVA wall,'' said Greg Harbaugh, manager of the
EVA Project Office at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. ``It is
a daunting task, but we are prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Harbaugh said that many of NASA's 130 astronauts had general
training for space walks and that 20 to 25 were now practicing for
specific walks. The few hours a crew spends space walking on a
specific mission often require hundreds of hours of training on the
ground to make sure the job is done correctly and safely, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Bleisath, the NASA official in charge of space walks for
the current mission, said three astronauts had received a total of
540 hours of EVA training to hook up the Russian and American
modules in three space walks of six to seven hours each.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Jerry Ross of the Air Force and Dr. James Newman, a
physicist, received the bulk of the training as the primary space
walkers, but Maj. Frederick Sturckow of the Marine Corps also
practiced as a backup.
</P>
<P>
   This training included 240 hours in NASA's Neutral Buoyancy
Laboratory, a huge, 40-foot-deep pool in Houston where fully-suited
astronauts train under water with full-size replicas of
space-station components. Such submerged rehearsals are the closest
representations of working in the weightlessness of space available
on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Both the international space station and earlier American
designs have been criticized for requiring too many space walks to
build and maintain. Critics said so many space walks not only
increased risks to crews, but would also divert so much time that
scientific work aboard the station would be compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Harbaugh acknowledged that the planned number of space walks
remained high, but said NASA had been firm about preventing more
from being added to the schedule. ``We have told contractors,
program people, everyone involved _ `No more growth in EVAs' _ and
we are serious about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   People are concerned about space walks because they are
physically difficult and inherently dangerous. Working in the
vacuum of space, an astronaut could be killed instantly if struck
by a piece of space debris or if he or she tears a pressurized suit
on a sharp metal part. There is also the danger of an astronaut's
floating away because of a broken tether line and dying if his air
is depleted before a ship can get to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, building the space station is a big
construction project, and people get killed in construction
accidents all the time,'' said John Pike, director of space policy
for the Federation of American Scientists in Washington. ``I'd
frankly be surprised if we didn't lose an astronaut while building
the station.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials acknowledge the dangers, but say they can be
mitigated. ``No EVA is a walk in the park,'' Harbaugh said. ``It is
always a challenge. It is always somewhat hazardous duty, although
we can control the hazards.''
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately designed space walks, proper training and
attention to detail reduce risks, he said. For instance, starting
with the current mission, space-walking astronauts will routinely
wear a new backpack unit called Safer, for Simplified Aid for EVA
Rescue. This pack, propelled by jets of gas, acts as a space life
jacket or parachute by allowing a crew member who becomes
untethered to fly back to the station.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has also designed a new spacesuit for the station, one that
can be stored in orbit and used up to 25 times before having to be
returned to Earth for refurbishment. The current space-shuttle suit
must be inspected and serviced between flights by specialists on
the ground, but the enhanced station suit is designed to be cleaned
and serviced by regular astronauts serving on the outpost.
</P>
<P>
   The new suit will also include other improvements, including
easily replaceable internal parts, a new radio that allows up to
five people to talk at once, gloves that allow more dexterity, new
helmet-mounted floodlights and spotlights and fingertip heaters for
more comfort when work is being done outside direct sunlight.

</P>
<P>
   To help prepare for the new era in space walking, NASA in 1991
started including practice space walks on shuttle missions to test
new equipment and procedures.
</P>
<P>
   On more than a dozen such walks, astronauts tested wrenches,
clamps, power tools, foot restraints, tool carts and other devices
that would apply to space-station construction and maintenance.
This included a remote-controlled, beach-ball-size free-floating
television camera propelled by gas jets that could survey
hard-to-reach areas of the station and possibly reduce the need for
some space walks.
</P>
<P>
   On the current flight, the Endeavour is carrying 135 tools
ranging from special torqueless power drills and liquid-filled
hammers that reduce recoil and vibration when striking something,
to standard wrenches and crowbars. At the end of the mission, the
space walkers will leave a large tool bag filled with some of these
items attached to the side of the Unity module for future workers
to use.
</P>
<P>
   The number of space walks associated with the space station
should steadily increase beginning next year and peak in the years
2000 and 2001, when many major components arrive to be attached,
officials said. The station is to begin permanent staffing in
January or February 2000, after the arrival next summer of the
much-delayed Russian service module, which contains living quarters
and laboratory space, and attachment of a large American solar
power array.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Russia currently have incompatible systems
for refurbishing spacesuits between walks. As a result, all
American space walks around the station will be shuttle-based until
the arrival in July 2000 of the Joint Airlock Module, which will be
equipped for both kinds of spacesuits. Before then, the only space
walks directly from the station would be from the service module
using Russian Orlan-M spacesuits.
</P>
<P>
   The joint airlock will be large enough for crews to stay
overnight at a lower atmospheric pressure than the rest of the
station so that astronauts can purge their bodies of nitrogen. This
will prevent decompression sickness, or ``the bends,'' when they go
to the even lower-pressure pure oxygen atmosphere of a spacesuit
and return to the station.
</P>
<P>
   Harbaugh said station-based crews would be able to make routine
maintenance space walks, but heavy construction would remain the
duty of specially trained shuttle crews during work-packed 10- to
12-day visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a symbiotic relationship,'' he said. ``We will rely on
shuttle crews for the heavy lifting and station crews for cleanup
and maintenance sort of things. Remember, station crews are really
there for science.''

WHEN INTENSIVE CARE UNITS MEDDLE WITH THE MIND 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(lb) 
 By SANDEEP JAUHAR, M.D.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One night recently, when I was on call in the cardiac
care unit at New York Presbyterian Hospital, I visited a patient
who had been in the unit for nine days, recovering from a procedure
to remove a clot in one of her coronary arteries.
</P>
<P>
   She was doing well, breathing on her own, with a normal blood
pressure and regular heartbeat. I thought she was asleep.
</P>
<P>
   But after a moment she opened her eyes. ``Welcome, doctor,'' she
said. ``Will you have a drink?'' She pointed in the dark toward her
fully stocked bar and asked me to help myself. ``You know where
everything is,'' she said. ``And fix me one as well.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked her where she was. ``My apartment,'' she replied. She
knew nothing about being sick or in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   I walked up to her IV pole and squeezed the bag of saline that
hung next to her bed. She thanked me and went off to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Although this woman, a wealthy 69-year-old who lives on the
Upper East Side, was deeply confused, she was actually acting quite
normally. She was experiencing a disturbance called ICU psychosis,
observed with increasing frequency as intensive care units
proliferate in American hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s there were only about a hundred ``special care''
units in the United States. Now most hospitals with more than 100
beds have some form of intensive care unit. About a third of the
patients who spend more than five days there will experience some
form of psychotic reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they have never had any psychiatric problems before,
these patients may experience anxiety, become paranoid, or hear
voices and see things that are not there. Sometimes, like my
patient, they become severely disoriented in time and place. They
may get out of bed and grapple with nurses. Occasionally they
become very agitated, even violent.
</P>
<P>
   That same night I responded to a 4 a.m. page and found myself in
the room of a businessman from New Jersey, transferred to the unit
after a heart attack. He was sitting at the side of his bed, his
sheets soaked with bright-red blood. He had pulled out his catheter
and was threatening his nurses with jail for keeping him captive.
</P>
<P>
   Only hours earlier this man had spoken to me quite normally of
his grandchildren, his country club, and so on. Now he was a raving
lunatic.
</P>
<P>
   I ordered him sedated, and though I was confident that he would
soon be his normal self again, I stopped outside his room to ponder
what the attending physician had told me that morning. Get this
patient out of the unit as soon as possible, he had warned.
``People like him don't do well here.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly what causes this reaction, but it is
generally accepted that something about the environment of the
intensive care unit makes some patients, already experiencing high
levels of stress, debility and pain, lose their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is sensory deprivation _ being caged in a windowless
room, away from family and familiar things. Or perhaps the sensory
overload _ being tethered to noisy machines that are on all day and
night.
</P>
<P>
   It could even be something as banal as pain, which studies show
is often inadequately controlled in the ICU.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is sleep deprivation and disruption of the normal
day-night rhythm. Or perhaps it is simply the loss of control that
patients must feel as their bodies are probed and medicated,
largely without their consent, by strangers who usually don't have
time for explanations or empathy.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, the phenomenon is so widespread that experts
have explicitly defined it as an ``acute brain syndrome involving
impaired intellectual functioning which occurs in patients who are
being treated within a critical care unit.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an example of the more general phenomenon of delirium.
Delirium, or acute brain failure, often has organic causes.
Dehydration, infection, low blood oxygen, inadequate cardiac output
and drugs can all bring it on. And though environmental stressors
are often implicated in the delirium of the ICU, studies show that
more often organic factors are to blame.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many experts object to the term ``ICU psychosis''
because it covers a number of conditions with a catch-all rubric
that often deters further investigation. This can be fatal. For
example, delirious patients with blood infections may be prescribed
anti-psychotics instead of the antibiotics they desperately need.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, at least 20 percent and perhaps as many as 76 percent
of acutely ill patients with delirium die within a few months,
possibly because of the severity of the illnesses that caused the
delirium in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   When patients leave the ICU, the problem almost always vanishes.
Even in the ICU, the psychosis often resolves spontaneously, with
the coming of morning or sleep. Sometimes it lingers through the
day. Severe agitation usually occurs only at night, however, which
is why doctors and nurses often call it sundowning, also a kind of
delirium common in nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   When it does not go away by itself, though, doctors must
identify the underlying cause. Dehydrated patients will require
fluids, for example; those with heart failure, digitalis.
</P>
<P>
   If it is environmental in origin, family members, familiar
objects and calm words can help. But usually patients will require
sedation with powerful anti-psychotics.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, progress has been made to reduce the stressors
of the ICU. Many units now have visiting hours. Shifts are adjusted
to minimize changes in the nursing staff caring for a patient.
Lighting is adjusted to synchronize with day-night cycles.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes it is the small changes that make all the
difference. I remember one patient who had suffered neurologic
damage that had left him unresponsive. His son asked us to move him
to the room next door because it had larger windows. The next
morning I walked in to find the patient sitting in a chair,
admiring the Queensboro Bridge. He gave me a thumbs-up and his
message was clear: All he wanted was a room with a view.

   It sounds like a catalog from the nightmare side of the
collective male memory: The woman yawns, frowns, sneers, cleans her
nails, picks at her teeth, stares at the ceiling and makes an
excruciatingly minute examination of her hair's split ends.
``Sorry, what were you saying?''
</P>
<P>
   These are weapons in the battle of the sexes, or, to use their
scientific name, female nonverbal courtship-rejection behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   According to a new study, they work _ except with some real
jerks or when the lighting's too dim.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Monica Moore, a professor of psychology at Webster
University in St. Louis, has been hanging around natural
observation posts for courtship behavior _ singles bars _ for 20
years, one of a growing number of researchers applying ethnological
techniques to the study of what she described recently in a
telephone interview as ``how people decide where to end the
night.''
</P>
<P>
   A substantial body of research has been compiled on courtship
techniques _ flirting _ and on the role played by gestures like the
quick glance and the casual touch of the arm.
</P>
<P>
   It became clear in the course of these studies that there was a
nonverbal vocabulary for the opposite message as well, and Dr.
Moore, in research published last month in the journal Semiotica,
set out to categorize such rejection behaviors and gauge their role
in courtship encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the singles bar. Dr. Moore and research assistants
posing as boring, ignorable couples took tables in a local pub,
where they randomly selected, in visits spaced over more than two
years, 210 single females for observation.
</P>
<P>
   What they found was a relatively consistent array of 17
behaviors that Dr. Moore broke down into facial and head patterns,
gestures and posture patterns.
</P>
<P>
   They also found that the silent brushoffs were generally
effective, at least if used enough. ``Across the sample, these
behaviors did serve to cause a man to lose interest'' and break off
the courtship attempt, Dr. Moore said, although, she added,
``sometimes it took several behaviors.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Dr. Moore noted: ``There are those guys whose
feelings get hurt easily and who give up too soon. What I tell men
is that if somebody looks like she's blowing you off, give it one
more try _ in a polite, respectful way _ and then, if it doesn't
work, give it up.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, she added, ``It's a tough world out there for
singles.''

   When Lightning Strikes on the Ski Slopes
</P>
<P>
   Most lightning injuries occur in summer and the majority are
suffered by golfers, fishermen, hikers and others enjoying
warm-weather sports. But according to a report issued by the
Lightning Data Center in Denver, winter-sports enthusiasts also are
at risk, though the risk is small.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which appears in the current British Journal of
Sports Medicine, cites two instances in which lightning struck on
the ski slopes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a man, 38, was on a high-altitude ski rescue mission in
Breckenridge, Colo. The weather was ``cold with sleet and
lightning,'' the report said, and the man, who recalled seeing a
flash, was launched 5 feet from his snowmobile, where after
regaining consciousness moments later he was able to radio for
help.
</P>
<P>
   In the other case, a 38-year-old man died after being struck by
lightning on a ski run in Vail, Colo. Witnesses said that they
heard thunder about 30 seconds before the man left the chair-lift
and that snow pellets were falling.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Cherington Sr., author of the report, explained that
two factors stood out in both cases: the appearance of convective
clouds, which carry an electrical charge, and the presence of
precipitation in the form of large ice particles or snow pellets
known as graupel.
</P>
<P>
   The electrical charges created by the collision of super-cooled
cloud droplets, graupel and ice crystals in turbulent wind currents
ultimately result in lightning. ``Lightning injuries are
particularly tragic because they are often incurred by healthy
young individuals,'' Cherington said.
</P>
<P>
   He advised paying attention to weather changes and having a
safety plan if conditions worsen.
</P>
<P>
   Experts generally recommend avoiding high areas, open fields,
isolated trees, light poles, metal fences and water _ ocean, lakes
and pools _ during a thunderstorm.
</P>
<P>
   Large enclosed structures tend to be safe, and cars, trucks,
buses and vans with windows rolled up also provide adequate shelter
from lightning.

   Improving Fitness in Smaller Doses
</P>
<P>
   Shoehorning exercise into the schedule by doing small amounts
several times a day improves fitness as much as a single daily
workout of the same total time, according to research in the last
few years. Now a new report says that the multiple-dose plan also
helps lower blood fats _ which are associated with heart disease _
as much as a one-shot session.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, published in a recent issue of Medicine &AMP; Science
in Sports &AMP; Exercise, 18 men ate a high-fat meal, and then
exercised the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Testing showed that their triglyceride profiles benefited
equally from 90 minutes of running at a moderate pace regardless of
whether the exertion came in one session or three.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing post-meal blood fat is believed to slow the progress of
atherosclerosis, the narrowing of the arteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``After you eat a meal with a lot of fat, fatty particles remain
in your bloodstream for several hours, and their secondary effects
damage artery walls,'' said one of the study's authors, Dr.
Adrianne Hardman, a professor with the human exercise metabolism
research group of Loughborough University in Leicestershire,
England.
</P>
<P>
   Previous research showed that one session of endurance exercise
reduced the level of fatty particles in the bloodstream. Though the
British study relied on an uncommonly high total amount of
exercise, Dr. Hardman said that much shorter workouts would
probably also produce benefits for the heart. ``Three 10-minute
sessions a day is a typical breakdown used by exercise
researchers,'' Dr. Hardman said.

   Keeping Track, to Make Hospitals Safer

   In news that may be a bit frightening for anyone checking into a

Organizations has compiled statistics on major medical mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   The health commission, an agency that certifies hospital
quality, defines the mishaps, known as sentinel events, as
unexpected occurrences that involve death or major permanent
disabilities.

mishaps, said that the purpose of compiling the numbers was not to
scare people.

   ``By analyzing them,'' he said, ``we're hoping to make
recommendations on how to design our health-care procedures more
safely.''

PETER FONDA: AN EASY RIDER TACKLES SHAKESPEARE

 Includes a color slide of Peter Fonda in a scene from ``The
Tempest.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's the day before Thanksgiving and Peter Fonda is most
thankful.
 &HT;    The last year or so was one of his best. His book ``Don't Tell
Dad'' very publicly cleared the air on his relationship with his
father, the late actor Henry Fonda, while his Oscar-nominated turn
in ``Ulee's Gold'' (1997) rescued him from a long run of B movies
and big-budget turkeys.
 &HT;    Speaking by telephone from his Montana ranch, Fonda revels in
his renaissance, oozing charm in his trademark acid-trippy, folksy
way that mingles deep thoughts with a 1960s vocabulary that
includes plenty of ``cools'' and ``neats.''
 &HT;    He's particularly eager to talk about ``The Tempest,'' an
ambitious retelling of Shakespeare's final play that airs Dec. 13
on NBC. Fonda stars as Gideon Prosper, a wizard who lives happily
in the Mississippi swamps with his daughter, Miranda (Katherine
Heigl) and a freed slave named Ariel (Harold Perrineau),
indifferent to the Civil War and the machinations of Prosper's
deadly brother, Anthony (John Glover), both of which threaten their
idyllic existence.
 &HT;    ``I hadn't expected to do TV this year, and I ended up doing
both `The Tempest' and `The Passion of Ayn Rand' with Helen
Mirren,'' says Fonda, who will turn 60 in February. ``Who wants to
give up the chance to work with Helen Mirren? Or give up the chance
to play Prospero?
 &HT;    ``I mean, selfishly, how many times am I going to be asked to
play a sorcerer?'' the actor says, laughing. ```The Tempest' was
very autobiographical, so I also got to look at my own
autobiographical sense and was able to apply it to the work: Had I,
for example, protected my daughter Bridget in such a way that she
was blinded by reality?
 &HT;    ``I hadn't, of course, but I was able to understand the
process.''
 &HT;    Fonda came to ``The Tempest'' familiar with the material. He'd
seen several stage productions, as well as John Cassavetes'
``far-out'' 1982 film version and even ``Forbidden Planet,'' the
1956 sci-fi classic with Walter Pidgeon that loosely adapted the
play.
 &HT;    What makes ``The Tempest'' so ripe for diverse interpretations,
Fonda suggests, is that it offers us a chance to see ourselves in a
disguise, to look in a mirror without even realizing it.
 &HT;    ``That allows us to see the action and get caught up in the
emotions,'' he says. ``I'm personally fascinated by `The Tempest'
because it was Shakespeare's last play. It's called a comedy, but
it's actually a fantasy with some comedic stuff.
 &HT;    ``It's got a lot of melodrama and action, but it's really about
discovering your presence,'' the actor says. ``Shakespeare used the
stubbornness of Prospero to show how this man avoids the real
world, how he's invented all this stuff to scare away people, how
he keeps his daughter blind to society in a desire to protect her
from what he perceives as the world's injustice.
 &HT;    ``And again, I got to be this sorcerer who creates storms and
uses magic,'' he says, laughing. ``I got to live in this neat
treehouse in the bayou. When you see this treehouse, you'll want
one, too.''
 &HT;    Fair enough, but adaptations of classic drama are dangerous
creatures. Hollywood legends from James Cagney and Marlon Brando to
Mel Gibson and Leonardo DiCaprio have caught some slings and arrows
for daring to trifle with the Bard.
 &HT;    ``I'm sure some people will have their daggers out,'' Fonda
concedes, ``but I think the people out there who decide to watch
our version of `The Tempest' are looking for a different kind of
entertainment.
 &HT;    ``We've got an interesting story that's based on Shakespeare,''
he says. ``If nothing else, that lends us credibility. And I'm very
comfortable with my work. I played almost every scene at the level
I wanted to play them, and I loved doing it.''
 &HT;    The path to ``The Tempest'' was paved by ``Ulee's Gold,'' the
warm, simple story about a quiet beekeeper faced with a family
crisis that won widespread critical acclaim and earned Fonda a 1997
Oscar nomination for Best Actor.
 &HT;    ``It changed things tremendously,'' the actor says. ``I was
thrilled with the reception I got from `Ulee's.'
 &HT;    ``Actually, I was thrilled while making it,'' he adds. ``Listen,
it's a wonderful thing to want a project, to get it, to be excited
while making it and then, every time you see it, to feel, `God
damn, that's f--king great!' I don't mean my performance, but the
whole film.
 &HT;    ``The whole thing was a beautiful, wonderful experience,'' he
concludes. ``It was a cool year. `Ulee's' kicked off a lot of stuff
for me.''
 &HT;    The other tentpole of his year was ``Don't Tell Dad,'' in which
Fonda candidly addressed his childhood, the pros and cons of having
a famous father and sister _ actress Jane Fonda _ and the
emotion-charged days before the elder Fonda's death.
 &HT;    ``Jane was absolutely blown away by it, and my wife loved it
too,'' the actor says. ``Of course, the best, most important
reviews were those of my family.''
 &HT;    Many readers saw their own family lives reflected in the famous
acting clan, Fonda adds.
 &HT;    ``I get a lot of letters,'' he says, ``and people have been
wonderful in their responses. They tell me what it meant to them,
how it was nice to see that such very different people could share
the same types of experiences.''
 &HT;    Then there's the cable movie ``The Passion of Ayn Rand,'' set to
air in 1999 on Showtime. Helen Mirren stars as the famous
novelist/philosopher, whose affair with a young protege (Eric
Stoltz) wreaks havoc on her husband, Frank O'Connor (Fonda), and on
the protege's girlfriend (Julie Delpy).
 &HT;    It's definitely a supporting part, Fonda says, but he relished
the chance to work with Mirren.
 &HT;    ``It's not called `The Passion of Frank O'Connor' for a
reason,'' he says, laughing. ``But I found my place in the story,
and working with Helen was as good an experience as I'd hoped.''
 &HT;    Next up is ``The Limey,'' a feature directed by Steven
Soderbergh in which Fonda plays a music-industry figure who
accidentally kills his girlfriend.
 &HT;    ``My role was written for me!'' Fonda says, practically
shouting. ``Five years ago I was having dinner with Bridget and
some of her friends. One of her dear friends is married to a writer
and he said, `I'm going to write a role for you in this movie.'
 &HT;    ``I said, `That's cool. I hope it happens.' And here it is. And
it happens to be with Steven Soderbergh, which is really neat.''
 &HT;    As the conversation ends, Fonda waxes enthusiastic about
Thanksgiving, which he'll share with his wife Becky and their
children. Bridget won't be there, he adds, because she's still
unpacking boxes at her new home in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    The actor doesn't know for sure what he'll do next, but he
doesn't seem concerned.
 &HT;    ``Life is grand,'' he says, slipping back into his 1960s patois.
``In terms of the reality of the world, peace is still a good idea
and we're sure not near it.
 &HT;    ``Then, on the other side of my head, I can hear Bobby Dylan's
words: `Life is sad, life is a bust. You do what you do, you do
what you must. You do what you must do and you do it well.'
 &HT;    ``That's a pretty good statement.''

entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of Bridget Fonda with Bill Paxton and Billy
Bob Thornton in a scene from ``A Simple Plan.'' 
 By JEANNE WOLF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Being naked on screen is nothing new for Bridget Fonda.
 &HT;    ``I'm naturally uninhibited about that,'' she admits, laughing.
 &HT;    But ``A Simple Plan,'' opening Dec. 18, offers her first
pregnant nude scene.
 &HT;    ``It was strange,'' she says. ``I had a robe on, and when it
falls open you can see all of me _ but what you are really seeing
is about 40 pounds of silicone.''
 &HT;    In Sam Raimi's thriller, based on Scott Smith's 1993 novel,
Fonda is very much with child, but it took a lot of work to
transform her sleek body to fit the role.
 &HT;    ``They created this enormous fake stomach for me,'' she recalls.
``It was so real that when I stood in front of a mirror I could
really imagine how I'll look when I'm pregnant.
 &HT;    ``Then they gave me a suit full of lead weights,'' she adds with
a rueful smile. ``I didn't have morning sickness, but that pregnant
suit was a real pain in the back.''
 &HT;    In ``A Simple Plan,'' Fonda plays the wife of a small-town man
(Bill Paxton) who, with his brother (Billy Bob Thornton), finds a
downed airplane containing $4 million in cash. Should they turn it
in, or should they keep the money and fulfill their fantasies?
 &HT;    Fonda's character at first wants to call the police, but soon
reconsiders.
 &HT;    ``I think it could change anybody,'' the actress says. ``It's
not so much the money as the possibilities you see of realizing
your dreams. It's like all the hopes and plans you had as a kid,
when you'd put a few dollars in a shoe box and shove it under the
bed, can now come true.
 &HT;    ``We can all make moral judgments,'' she says, ``but that kind
of money presents an enormous temptation. I don't think you can
really know what you'd do until you're actually confronted with
it.''
 &HT;    Unless, of course, you have the financial rewards of Hollywood
stardom, a point which Fonda grants.
 &HT;    ``I've been fortunate, but what's been important to me is that I
have a career which is also my hobby and my passion,'' she says
with sudden intensity. ``I lucked out because I get to do something
that I love doing. A lot of people don't have that luxury.''
 &HT;    Fonda's success seems almost predestined. After all, she's the
daughter of Academy Award-nominated actor/director Peter Fonda, the
niece of Academy Award-winning actress Jane Fonda and the
granddaughter of legendary _ and, yes, Academy Award-winning _
actor Henry Fonda.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, she says, she didn't get the acting bug until she
appeared in a high-school production of ``Harvey.''
 &HT;    ``Go figure,'' she says. ``I played Nurse Harvey, and I was
awful, really terrible. But one day I threw out a line in a
rehearsal and the people who were building the sets actually
chuckled. I felt a connection _ it felt so good that they were
laughing at my line. That was the beginning of my addiction to
acting.''
 &HT;    That's acting. Stardom is another thing entirely.
 &HT;    ``Growing up, I remember being struck by the fact that everybody
seemed to know my father,'' she recalls. ``I was shy, and it was a
bit of an embarrassment to me. I kind of hid from it, even though I
could see that my father loved it. It made the world seem really
small for me.''
 &HT;    So committed is Fonda to her penchant for privacy that, when she
recently broke up with her longtime companion, actor Eric Stoltz,
the two managed to keep the split out of the tabloids for weeks.
 &HT;    ``We hadn't been together for a while,'' she says. ``But it just
got to the point where you knew you were going to be asked and you
might as well admit it. Ironically, we sort of felt we had to go
public because we had been so open about being together.
 &HT;    ``Now I'm learning how to keep my life my own,'' Fonda adds. ``I
guess the conflict came because my father was always so open with
the press. I felt like that was part of the deal of being a star.
Now I think my love life is nobody's business.''
 &HT;    So as far as her current situation ...
 &HT;    Fonda laughs.
 &HT;    ``Why do we care about romance among celebrities? I guess it's
like wanting to know who a friend is dating,'' the actress says.
``Anyway, I'm not with someone at the moment.''
 &HT;    It's something she's been thinking about, the 34-year-old
actress admits, in part because of ``A Simple Plan.''
 &HT;    ``It sort of cemented the fact that I wouldn't mind having my
own kids,'' she says. ``I want to be married, and I want to have a
family. But I'm not at the point where I'm desperate about it.''
 &HT;    In the meantime, she's keeping very busy on screen. She played
an abused wife in ``The Break-Up'' (1997) and a drugged-out surfer
chick in Quentin Tarantino's ``Jackie Brown'' (1997), and will next
be seen as a Marilyn Monroe impersonator opposite Harvey Keitel in
``Finding Graceland.''
 &HT;    ``Impersonating Marilyn was a lot of fun,'' Fonda says, smiling.
``I've always loved her and felt a lot of sympathy for her _
sympathy not in terms of feeling sorry, but empathy for what she
projected.
 &HT;    ``Some people thought she was a bimbo, I guess, but she had this
tremendous life force _ the studio people used to call it flesh
impact. There was something about her that was just alive. And
there was a sense that she was just burning up all her fuel, as if
she wasn't destined to live a long life.''
 &HT;    The role was another exercise in body sculpting, she admits,
almost as extensive as that in ``A Simple Plan.''
 &HT;    ``I was a special effect,'' she says with a laugh. ``I was
sculpted, molded and reformed. I wore a hot-pink dress, the one
that was Marilyn's trademark, and the upper half was definitely a
work of breast enhancement.
 &HT;    ``Unfortunately, my hips and butt couldn't be padded enough,
because I have to dance,'' she said. ``So below the waist I'm not
as curvy as I would have liked to have been.''
 &HT;    Fonda herself has no indelible onscreen image a la Monroe,
despite a career that has produced several memorable films,
including a sexy cameo in ``The Godfather III'' (1990) and roles as
a victim of the roommate from hell in ``Single White Female''
(1992) and a seductive killing machine in ``Point of No Return''
(1993).
 &HT;    ``I don't know what people are looking for when they go to see
one of my films,'' she says, brushing back her long hair. ``Is it
that they like to see me with a gun or see me terrorized by my
roommate? I don't know.
 &HT;    ``The only thing I hope I deliver is an emotional reality,
whether I'm in a comedy or a drama,'' she says. ``That's what I
expect from myself, and maybe that's what audiences are paying to
see.''
 &HT;    In a number of her films, she concedes, audiences have seen
quite a bit.
 &HT;    ``I don't take the nudity thing personally,'' Fonda says. ``I
guess there are very few ingenues that people wouldn't want to see
without their clothes. I've never felt particularly vulnerable as a
sexpot. As I said, I'm pretty uninhibited.''
 &HT;    She pauses.
 &HT;    ``But I've started to realize that it can affect people's
perception of me,'' she adds after a moment. ``Some people find it
distasteful. It can get really bad for an actress if the audience
thinks you're selling your body for entertainment. I'm careful
about my love scenes. I can feel when it's not right. And if it's
not right, I just don't do it.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's 4 a.m. in Las Vegas, and Jeri Ryan is seeing double.
 &HT;    The most talked-about star of ``Star Trek: Voyager'' is sitting
in a red booth, distinctly non-Borgian in jeans and a T-shirt.
She's eating a hamburger and fries, for heaven's sake. With catsup.
 &HT;    And then a guy comes up to her, gesturing toward a place where
no man has gone before. The ladies' room, that is.
 &HT;    ``I'm sorry to bother you,'' he says, ``but my wife is in the
john getting dressed as you.''
 &HT;    Ryan lowers her burger and thinks that one over.
 &HT;    ``Getting dressed like me,'' she repeats slowly. ``OK. And thank
you for being such big fans.'''
 &HT;    And sure enough, soon a second Jeri Ryan emerges, this time
costumed as ``Voyager's'' Seven of Nine.
 &HT;    This doesn't happen to Jenna Elfman or Calista Flockhart.
 &HT;    ``My life is so very strange,'' Ryan says.
 &HT;    Also very changeable. Only a few years ago, she was an
out-of-work actress with a husband and young son. Now she is a
``Trek'' phenomenon with a 4-year-old and a recent split from Jack
Ryan, the Chicago-based investment banker who had been her partner
in a commuter marriage since ``Voyager'' called.
 &HT;    Being America's favorite Borg has wide-ranging implications.
Even taking young Alex to preschool can be complicated.
 &HT;    ``It doesn't really occur to me how many kids watch the show,''
Ryan says. ``I go to school and the kids scream, `Oh, you're the
Borg mom! Where is your starship?' I have to sit all the kids down
and say, ``OK, now we know it's all pretend.'''
 &HT;    At 30, Ryan doesn't look like a mom. Seven of Nine's navy-blue,
Spandex uniform leaves little to the imagination, but the actress
says she's never been a fitness freak.
 &HT;    ``I've only recently started working out with any regularity,''
she admits. ``It's because I just turned 30 and I know things will
start moving and shifting.''
 &HT;    She'd rather exercise than diet, anyway. Ryan reveals that
cheesecake is a personal favorite. And barbecued ribs.
 &HT;    ``Anything from McDonalds and most things from Taco Bell are on
my list of snacks,'' she adds, sighing. ``Oh, I love bad food. I
have a soft spot in my heart for junk.''
 &HT;    Ryan never relocated completely to Los Angeles because of her
husband's job requirements. Now that will probably change.
 &HT;    ``I didn't really realize how exhausting it was until I started
getting a little break from the traveling,'' she says. ``Now I
realize, `My God, I must have been on autopilot for seven years.'
It wipes you out. Your exhaustion sort of sneaks up on you.''
 &HT;    Sort of like ``Star Trek,'' which Ryan never watched growing up.
 &HT;    ``I watched `The Brady Bunch' as a girl, which was in direct
competition with `Star Trek,''' she says. ``I used to call `Star
Trek' a boy's show.''
 &HT;    Two years ago, when her NBC series ``Dark Skies'' hit the skids,
she heard that ``Voyager'' was looking for a young actress to play
a non-human Borg who takes on human characteristics. Ryan went on
an audition as a lark.
 &HT;    To her amazement, she got the part. She and her husband were
equally taken aback.
 &HT;    ``His reaction was `Oh boy,''' she recalls. ``We weren't really
sure what we were getting into. My husband had the same fears I had
about the role _ we were both apprehensive.''
 &HT;    In two words, their concern was ``Star Trek,'' a franchise with
a life of its own.
 &HT;    ```Star Trek' has been around for 30 years,'' the actress says,
``so you don't have to worry that the show will be canceled on you.
But when you sign that contract you better know exactly what you're
doing, because you know you'll be there for the duration of the
contract.
 &HT;    ``You are almost making a commitment for life,'' Ryan says. ``I
do have to say it's been great fun. The way this character has been
written has really exceeded my hopes and my best expectations.''
 &HT;    As soon as Seven of Nine was introduced, rumors began flying of
personality conflicts between Ryan and series star Kate Mulgrew,
who plays Capt. Janeway.
 &HT;    ``We get along just fine,'' Ryan says firmly. ``We're friendly
with each other. I don't know where rumors started that we didn't
get along.''
 &HT;    Actually, Ryan says, her biggest problems on set have involved
her intricate Borg makeup, which includes a latex-foam face piece.
 &HT;    ``It's glued on for every episode,'' she says. ``It's not bad,
but it's annoying to have something glued to your face all day.
Later it's removed with alcohol, and then they have to remove the
residual glue with an oil. Then you wash your face.''
 &HT;    She also wears a Borg skeleton glove on her fingers.
 &HT;    ``The hand, for the most part, is OK,'' she says, ``unless
you're trying to eat, which is a real pain in the neck when your
fingertips are covered in latex.''
 &HT;    But it's worth it, Ryan says, for the chance to play this
character.
 &HT;    ``It's a terrific role,'' she says. ``I love the constant
discoveries this character makes. I love the challenge of playing a
character who has emotions but doesn't know how to express them
because she hasn't experienced them before. She's someone to whom
everything is new _ yet she is so wise and so smart and so
strong.''
 &HT;    There are rumors that Seven of Nine will get a romance this
season, but Ryan downplays them.
 &HT;    ``That's premature for her, because she's only been human
essentially for a year,'' the actress says. ``She's still almost a
child emotionally. Last season, we toyed with a little crush that
someone had on Seven. He couldn't handle it. Also, she doesn't
really have any concept of sexuality.''
 &HT;    All in all, it's a long way from home for a self-described army
brat who, by age 11, had lived in Germany, Kansas, Maryland,
Hawaii, Georgia and Texas.
 &HT;    During her years as a Northwestern University drama major, she
met Jack and got married in 1991. After a series of local
commercials in Chicago, Ryan headed for Hollywood _ part-time. She
showed up on ``Who's the Boss?,'' ``Murder, She Wrote'' and
``Diagnosis Murder.'' She wasn't exactly rivaling Meryl Streep _
one of her television movies was ``Coed Call Girls.''
 &HT;    Then there was that guest stint on ``Melrose Place.''
 &HT;    ``I was the lesbian singer/actress who had an arranged marriage
to my gay leading man,'' she recalls, smiling.
 &HT;    ``Dark Skies'' was her turning point. Though the
``X-Files''-influenced series failed, Ryan was noticed.
 &HT;    The next stop was ``Star Trek,'' and a new level of stardom.
 &HT;    ``I've been very lucky so far,'' she says. ``Everyone I've
encountered fan-wise has been very respectful, very curious, very
conscious of my time with my family, and they try not to be
intrusive. It's been very nice.''
 &HT;    ``Trek'' fans have sent marriage proposals, though, along with
portraits and even a hand-sewn bunny.
 &HT;    ``There was a Seven of Nine teddy bear sent to me which was a
riot,'' she says, chuckling. ``There was a little wig on the top
and high heels. It was very cute.''
 &HT;    Ryan is also getting used to being recognized on the street.
 &HT;    ``If I'm particularly tired, I'll do the standard baseball cap
and sunglasses,'' she says. ``In L.A., everyone is so hyper-attuned
to anyone in a baseball cap that they recognize you, whether they
know who you are or not, because you're wearing a baseball cap.
They figure you must be somebody trying to go incognito.
 &HT;    ``I swear, I'll be looking my worst and someone will come up and
scream, `It's Jeri Ryan!'''
 &HT;    Actually, having a double could come in handy ...

KERI RUSSELL'S SENSE OF FELICITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
NIRDI RELIS in New York at 212-499-3333, or by fax at

 Includes a color slide of Keri Russell in a scene from
``Felicity.'' 
 By ANDREW RYAN  
 c.1998 Canadian TV Guide  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The way Keri Russell tells it, she had only one qualm when she
was offered the title role on ``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the WB Network show looked great on paper, but Russell _
although only 22 _ had already been on two other short-lived
series, ``Daddy's Girls'' and ``Malibu Shores.'' If ``Felicity''
suffered a similar fate, her career might go down with the ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seriously, I was really worried about that,'' says Russell,
fresh-scrubbed and gorgeous even after a long day of interviews.
``If the show went bad I would really look bad, because I'm the
main character. If it bombed, people would say, `That Keri Russell
series was really bad.' Who needs that kind of pressure?''
</P>
<P>
   No need to fret. Since its September debut, ``Felicity'' has
lived up to much of its early hype and become a
solid-if-not-sensational hit. The critics have been kind, and
nearly all have credited Russell's presence for the show's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   For those who haven't seen it, ``Felicity'' casts Russell as a
precocious college freshman set loose in New York. Between classes,
she spends her time rapping with her dorm supervisor/emotional
mentor Noel (Scott Foley) and shyly trying to make a connection
with Ben (Scott Speedman), the former high-school classmate who's
the object of her unrequited affections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a joy to play someone like Felicity,'' Russell says.
``I don't think she's naive, per se. But all of a sudden she's in
the middle of New York and there's so much going on in her life.
But she's in control _ she's not in over her head.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the starlets on ``Beverly Hills 90210'' and other
youth-oriented shows, Felicity is not your typically glamorous
television teen _ which is just what Russell loves about her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the fact she doesn't wear makeup, has baggy clothes and
has her hair stuffed into a ponytail,'' she says. ``Most young
girls out there look like her, not like the girls on `Baywatch.' I
think it's a positive thing to see someone like her who's smart and
funny, and can still be a basket case sometimes. She's human. They
can finally see someone who's like them.''
</P>
<P>
   And like herself. Since ``Felicity'' started production, Russell
has been encouraged to make suggestions regarding scripts and
dialogue, and has even been allowed input into the show's musical
score.
</P>
<P>
   ``No kidding,'' she says. ``I gave a little tape of my favorite
songs to the producers. And how cool that they were open to that!
They were totally interested in my ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   In person, the actress seems remarkably low-key about
practically everything, even her career. She credits her
down-to-earth demeanour to her background: Born in Fountain Valley,
Calif., she was one of three kids and spent much of her formative
years studying dance, without ever entertaining the notion of
becoming a child star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never one of those kids with a stage mother _ `OK,
honey, you go in there and knock them out!''' she says. ``I just
wanted to keep dancing and studying dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell's dance experience won her an audition for the Disney
Channel's revival of ``The Mickey Mouse Club'' in 1991. She got the
job, and in short order was living at Walt Disney World in Orlando,
where the series was taped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty exciting for a 16-year-old,'' she says. ``Plus, we got
to go on rides for free.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, she received her first film role, in the comedy
``Honey, I Blew Up the Kid'' (1992). One thing led to another, and
in 1994 she was cast as Dudley Moore's daughter on the
flash-in-the-pan NBC sitcom ``Daddy's Girls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was definitely the rookie,'' she recalls, ``but I learned a
lot working with people like Dudley Moore, in terms of comedic
timing. He says anything and it's funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, she won a more adult role on the glitzy
prime-time soap ``Malibu Shores,'' which came from Aaron Spelling's
production company.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something really unique about an Aaron Spelling
show,'' Russell says diplomatically. ``He totally knows his
audience, and he has this system he uses over and over. `Felicity'
is a different approach. There's less fantasy _ a lot less
fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly that's the world to which Russell herself belongs. Some
of her favorite scenes on ``Felicity,'' for example, involve not
the glamorous Ben but the more pedestrian Noel, who is always there
to offer Felicity advice or a shoulder to cry on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't he the greatest guy?'' she sighs. ``A lot of my friends
are just like Noel. I think I'm personally drawn to people like
him. I mean, who wouldn't be?''
</P>
<P>
   The main attraction, she says, is that Noel ``knows exactly who
he is. He has this great line _ it just broke my heart _ in one
episode. They're all going to some party, and Noel says to
Felicity, `Wow, you look really nice.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So she tells him he looks handsome,'' she continues, ``and
Noel says, `Oh, you had to say that. But you know what? I feel
handsome.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Only Noel could say that and get away with it. It was so
sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell found similar realism in a scene from the pilot in which
Felicity's manipulative parents try to coerce her to attend prep
school by offering a BMW as bait.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's reality,'' she says. ``I have friends whose parents are
just like that. They want to mold their kids, but they can't. I
guess I'm lucky, because my parents were never like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Away from ``Felicity,'' Russell has a major role in the film
``Mad About Mambo,'' due out next spring. Drawing on her dance
background, she plays a young Irish dancer who teaches an awkward
soccer star (William Ash) how to dance, in order to help him with
his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ireland was so gorgeous,'' she says. ``I only wish I could
have been a bit less focused on work, because it's so beautiful. I
was stuck in a studio in the middle of Dublin most of the time.
Some days I just wanted to take off and sightsee and roam those
green hills.''
</P>
<P>
   In the immediate future, though, Russell plans to be fully
immersed in ``Felicity,'' which has so far translated into 15-hour
work days.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's easy to believe her when she calls the series a
labor of love. In fact, she's not even worried about the
inevitability of her being viewed as a role model by millions of
young women.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a huge responsibility,'' she says earnestly, ``but
what's great about this show is that Felicity actually is a good
role model. She's true to herself and considers other people first.
I don't have to change her one bit.''

<P>
   New research is challenging the medical textbook view of
osteoporosis as largely a women's disease linked to the singularly
female experience of menopause. It now seems that osteoporosis is
more prevalent in men than was previously thought, and that
although men do not go through menopause, the main cause of the
degenerative bone disorder is the same in men and women: an
age-related drop in estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent studies show that men's levels of this sex
hormone decline with age and that the decline leads to a loss of
bone mass, the signature symptom of osteoporosis. Some of these
studies were presented last week at a meeting of the American
Society for Bone and Mineral Research and the International Bone
and Mineral Society in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is surprising,'' said Dr. B. Lawrence Riggs, a professor
of medical research at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., who has
found that estrogen naturally falls in men after about age 65.
``Three years ago, none of us would have thought that estrogen loss
was a factor in male osteoporosis.'' Although men and women have
estrogen, it is more abundant in women and plays a central role in
female reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   The National Osteoporosis Foundation in Washington estimates
that of the 10 million Americans who have osteoporosis, more than
1.5 million are men, and that half of women and one in eight men
over 50 will have an osteoporosis-related fracture. But because
osteoporosis is underdiagnosed in men, the numbers for men are
probably higher, the organization's literature says.
</P>
<P>
   Medical textbooks describe osteoporosis differently for men and
for women. In women it is linked mainly to the sharp drop in
estrogen after menopause, because estrogen is known to slow the
natural process of bone loss that occurs with age. In men, however,
osteoporosis is said to result from abnormally low levels of
testosterone, a sex hormone more plentiful in males. The cause of
low testosterone is usually a rare condition called hypogonadism,
in which the testicles are underactive.
</P>
<P>
   Two studies presented at last week's meeting indicate that
estrogen plays a more central role than testosterone in
osteoporosis in men. Researchers following residents of Framingham,
Mass., over five decades studied 382 elderly white men for eight
years, tracking bone density, estrogen levels and signs of
hypogonadism. Men with the highest bone density also had the
highest estrogen levels; the connection with hypogonadism was
negligible.
</P>
<P>
   In another study, doctors in Germany measured bone density as
well as estrogen and testosterone levels of 300 men with
osteoporosis for five years. Forty percent of the men had low
estrogen; 20 percent had low testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't see a pronounced effect of testosterone on the
males' bone-mineral density,'' said Dr. Peter Kaps, an orthopedic
surgeon and the lead author.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pamela Taxel, assistant professor of medicine at the
University of Connecticut Health Center in Farmington, said:
``These are suggestive findings, but larger studies are needed to
understand the mechanism of estrogen and testosterone on bone
health in men.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Taxel is studying the use of estrogen supplements to treat
men with osteoporosis. She said research was needed to develop a
form of estrogen that helps men without causing side effects like
prostate disease or impotence.

CHINA APPEARS READY TO PUT LEADER OF NEW PARTY ON TRIAL
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ One leader of a suppressed new political party will be
tried on Dec. 17 on a charge of colluding with foreign enemies of
China ``to incite the subversion of state power,'' according to
court documents given to his wife on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to try the leader, Wang Youcai, a founder of the
China Democracy Party, with unusual speed suggests how serious the
Communist authorities are in their campaign to destroy the
fledgling party and silence dissidents who had begun to speak out
over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   The charges that Wang faces, in a trial that will almost
certainly be secret and quick, could bring a sentence of five years
or more. Wang, 32, has been imprisoned in his home city, Hangzhou
in eastern China, for a month, but was not formally arrested until
Nov. 30. On that day two prominent dissidents, both promoters of
the new party, were detained.
</P>
<P>
   One, Qin Yongmin, 45, of the central city of Wuhan, and the
other, Xu Wenli, 55, of Beijing, are being held on suspicion of
subversive activities. Detailed charges have not been filed.
</P>
<P>
   Wang was a student leader in the pro-democracy demonstrations in
Tiananmen Square in 1989. After the army had crushed the movement,
Wang was arrested and served two years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Qin and Xu became known as democracy advocates in the late
1970s. Qin was imprisoned for eight years. In 1993 he was put in a
labor camp for two years. Xu spent 12 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton visited in the spring, Wang announced the
formation of the Democracy Party. He and other dissidents hoped
that China's new friendship with the United States and its decision
to sign a global covenant on political and civil rights would give
them room to promote political alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton returned home Wang was detained, warned and
released, only to be re-arrested as authorities began what now
appears to be a major crackdown on dissent. Monday, Wang's wife, Hu
Jiangxia, was handed the bill of prosecution, according to the
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Wang is charged with helping draft a party manifesto that
states, in part, ``Only by establishing an opposition party can we
be rid of this despotism.'' That is cited as grounds for the
subversion charge, the information center said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to detailing Wang's organizing activities, the
prosecutors charge that he colluded with enemies of the state
abroad, making his crime far more serious under Chinese law.
</P>
<P>
   He used e-mail to send 18 copies of the party's founding
documents abroad, met with a member of a subversive foreign
organization and received money from foreign sources to buy a
computer, the indictment reportedly says.

SOARING PRICES SPUR A REVOLT IN SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ariz., Wis., Ga.)  (The Science Times) 
 (af)  
 By CAROL KAESUK YOON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Esoteric and highly technical, scientific journals have never
been viewed as a hot publication market. In recent years, however,
scientific journals have become big business, with large commercial
publishers entering a scene once dominated by nonprofit scientific
societies whose only goal was to disseminate scientific
information.
</P>
<P>
   It is a change that many academics say has sent prices
skyrocketing _ with some journals now costing libraries more than
$15,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists, whose universities are often unable to afford
the very journals to which they are giving their research findings,
are now teaming with irate librarians to fight back. They are
creating their own journals to compete with expensive commercial
publications, and offering them at one-half to one-twentieth the
price.
</P>
<P>
   Fomenting this revolution is Sparc, the Scholarly Publishing and
Academic Resources Coalition, a group of more than 100 major
research libraries helping these rebel journals get established by
committing to buy them.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new journals are coming out of scientific societies,
but the poster child of the movement is Evolutionary Ecology
Research, created by a professor who was so fed up with commercial
publishers' raising the price of a journal that was his brainchild
that he abandoned it, starting a new journal with his own money and
the editorial assistance of his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original deal was that the journal would be available as
inexpensively as possible,'' said Dr. Michael Rosenzweig, a
professor at the University of Arizona whose entire board of
editors defected along with him. ``This has got to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the battle is being fought over subscription prices,
what is really at stake, researchers say, is the scientific process
itself, which depends so heavily on the ready exchange of
scientific information.
</P>
<P>
   ``These prices have been a complete disaster,'' said Ken
Frazier, director of the general library system at the University
of Wisconsin and chairman of Sparc's steering committee. With many
journal prices increasing 20 percent to 30 percent a year, Frazier
said his libraries were forced to drop half their physics journals
in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you repeatedly increase prices and not understand that
you're damaging scholarly communications?'' he asked. ``What must
they be thinking?''
</P>
<P>
   Commercial publishers insist, however, that their publications
are high quality and remain a good value. ``The goal of any
business is to make money,'' said Dr. Peter Sheperd, managing
director of Elsevier Science in Switzerland, a division of Reed
Elsevier, one of the biggest commercial publishers of scientific
journals. ``I don't see that as incompatible with serving the needs
of scientific communication.''
</P>
<P>
   The real problem, many say, is that commercial publishers have
discovered they can raise prices with impunity, since universities
must buy the most important journals, no matter what the cost. And
scientists will continue to publish their best work, even in
journals neither they nor their libraries can afford, because
prestigious publications are crucial to getting grants, promotion
and tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commercial publishers began to realize the gold mine that they
had and that everything was working to their advantage,'' said Mary
Case, director of the Office of Scholarly Communications at the
Association of Research Libraries in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, researchers say, academia is a paradise for publishers.
First the public pays for most scientific research through, for
example, the National Science Foundation. Then universities pay the
salaries of scientists who do virtually all the writing, reviewing
and editing. Universities sometimes even provide free office space
to journals.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, authors typically sign over their copyright to
publishers, who can sometimes bring in many millions of dollars a
year in subscriptions for a single high-priced journal _
subscriptions paid by university libraries supported by tax dollars
and tuition.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the profits being made by commercial publishers,
Dr. Mark McCabe, an economist at the Georgia Institute of
Technology who is one of the few researchers studying this unusual
market, said, ``It is clearly dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Librarians say that what happened with Rosenzweig's journal was
typical. Twelve years ago, Rosenzweig, a professor at the
University of Arizona, came up with the idea for the journal
Evolutionary Ecology and began publishing it with Chapman &AMP; Hall.
Then Chapman &AMP; Hall was bought by International Thomson Corp. and
the journal was then sold to Wolters Kluwer, an international
publishing company based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   At each turn, Rosenzweig said, despite his objections, the price
went up and the number of scientists to whom it was available went
down.
</P>
<P>
   When Rosenzweig quit, to found Evolutionary Ecology Research,
his entire board of editors, came with him. With their backing,
Rosenzweig, who has called the new movement a ``slave revolt,''
said authors had been supportive of his new journal, submitting
high-quality manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenzweig, who spent Thanksgiving weekend working on the first
issue of his new journal with his wife, Carole, said the new
journal would cost libraries about one-third of the cost of the
Kluwer journal, which is about to go up to $777 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Katz, a lawyer for Kluwer Academic Publishers, declined to
discuss the journals, saying he did not want to jeopardize
discussions being held between himself and Rosenzweig's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Sparc's other efforts include three new journals from the
American Chemical Society and an electronic journal _ a cheaper,
quicker form of publication which some say may be Sparc's best hope
_ from the Royal Society of Chemistry called PhysChemComm.
</P>
<P>
   Selling to libraries for $353, PhysChemComm is intended to
compete with Elsevier's Chemical Physics Letters, which costs more
than $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining their higher prices, commercial publishers say
they have additional costs that scientific societies do not have,
including supporting an international network of offices. They also
note that societies receive additional income from members' dues.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers are also quick to point out that there can be other
reasons for increased prices than merely increasing profits, like
increases in the quality or quantity of articles.
</P>
<P>
   But McCabe said that quite often there was no such explanation.
From 1992 to 1996, McCabe said, there was no increase in the
quality or quantity of articles in the journal Brain Research, a
publication infamous among librarians for its high cost _ more than
$15,000 year _ yet the price of the journal nearly doubled.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you explain the price increase, except as taking
advantage of the situation?'' McCabe asked.
</P>
<P>
   And while publishers have suggested that currency exchange rates
might explain the rising dollar prices for foreign-produced
journals like Brain Research, McCabe said that fluctuating exchange
rates simply did not explain such spiraling prices.
</P>
<P>
   McCabe said that publishing mergers, however, did result in
journal price increases, as did decreasing circulation. That is,
when libraries drop high-priced journals, publishers often raise
the prices of their other journals even higher in an effort to
recover the same revenue from fewer subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, there is no sign of prices flagging, and similar
pricing practices have already begun showing up in the social
sciences and humanities.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Frazier said Sparc would press on, urging
libraries and scientists to support the new journals. ``If we can
demonstrate that we can help the good guys,'' he said, ``then there
is hope.''

GOVERNORS CALL FOR SALES TAX ON INTERNET COMMERCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAIME CASTILLO  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONOIO _ The popularity of the Internet, the one-stop
window into the world of culture, business and information, is
starting to hamstring state governments as more and more shoppers
go on-line to make purchases free of sales taxes, a panel of
governors said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every month, there's more commerce developed on the
Internet,'' said Illinois Gov. Jim Edgar, a Republican. ``I'm very
fearful for the states because sales taxes are our lifeline.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers in many states now avoid paying sales taxes through
mail-order catalogs. But state and local governments say they are
being bled of even more revenue by the point-and-click ease of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   This holiday season alone, Internet purchases from mail-order
businesses like L.L. Bean in Freeport, Me., and Land's End in
Dodgeville, Wis., are expected to exceed $3 billion nationwide,
Edgar said.
</P>
<P>
   Some states have resorted to taxing on-line subscriptions and
transfers of data, but many state leaders say that doesn't make up
the difference for lost sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation that would have forced mail-order and Internet
businesses to collect sales taxes and return them to the states
failed in Congress this year. Opponents called the measure a hidden
tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   The technology industry has argued that imposing sales taxes
would stymie Internet commerce. But proponents of taxing Internet
sales say that the tax-free status gives on-line sellers an unfair
advantage over retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar made his comments during a panel discussion with Georgia
Gov. Zell Miller, a Democrat, and Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson and
Idaho Gov.-elect Dirk Kempthorne, both Republicans. They were
attending the annual meeting of the Council of State Governments.
</P>
<P>
   During the often free-wheeling, wide-ranging discussion on
Monday, they also decried unfunded federal mandates and other
measures they say restrict states' rights.
</P>
<P>
   When states are allowed to tackle problems on their own, they
said, innovative ideas such as welfare reform and welfare-to-work
programs are created.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the biggest problem we face is trying to get
Washington to give us more authority,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leadership is going to our state houses more than it is to
Washington D.C.,'' he said. ``States have an unprecedented
opportunity to step into the breach and wrestle with the problems
that really affect people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kempthorne, who is retiring from the Senate to become governor,
said: ``The states will be those who come up with the solutions.
It's where the action is,'' he said. ``That's why I decided to take
this promotion.''

HOW CAN A COMPANY INSTILL LOYALTY IN WORKERS

By KEN LLOYD  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Q. The employees in our company do not have much
loyalty. There is no strong sense of commitment, and they are quick
to turn their back on us and leave, even though we have tried our
best to help them and make them feel they belong. What can we do to
increase loyalty? C.L. &QL; 
A. When the bonds of loyalty are loose, there is no quick fix to
mend them. Loyalty emerges as a result of a broad range of actions
that a company takes over time. In order to figure out why loyalty
in your organization may be low, you need to take an honest and
objective look at your organization and at the employees who are
turning their backs on it. The problem may be a matter of your
company's culture, or it may be as basic as your company's hiring
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, companies that have higher levels of loyalty tend to
have a number of factors in common, and it may be helpful to match
your company with them. For example, such companies typically
strive to understand the objectives of the employees and link
individual objectives with organizational objectives. They place
strong emphasis on employee training and development, career
guidance and growth, fairness in pay and benefits, recognition,
equitable treatment, open communication lines, teamwork, input
opportunities, social consciousness and a balance between work life
and personal life.
</P>
<P>
   In a broader sense, while the idea of building employee loyalty
to the company is important, this is an age in which it is equally
important to focus on building company loyalty to the employee. &QL; 
Q. The company where I work has performance appraisal procedures in
place, yet no one, including the CEO and human resources staff,
enforces them. The only feedback my manager will give me is, ``I
don't like doing this,'' and, ``Please sign.'' How do I force this
manager and company to give me a performance appraisal that is
objective, fair and responsible? S.G. &QL; 
A. It sounds like management in your company merits a rating of
``needs major improvement'' when it comes to the way they handle
performance appraisals. You cannot really ``force'' management to
follow its appraisal procedures, and any appraisal under such
circumstances would not be particularly useful.
</P>
<P>
   The source of the problem is your CEO. The fact that this
topside leader places no emphasis on performance appraisal sends a
signal to all employees in leadership positions that the appraisals
are a second-tier item at best.
</P>
<P>
   This means that if you want to have real performance appraisals,
you need to try to get the word to the CEO. In fact, there are a
few words that the CEO should hear on this matter, including the
compelling motivational, administrative, goal-setting and proactive
reasons for conducting up-to-date appraisals.
</P>
<P>
   If you cannot access the CEO, and the company has no viable
outlet for you to have your inputs heard, then it may be time for
you to appraise more than the company's performance appraisal
system. &QL; 
Q. I do not have many personal calls at work, but it seems that
every time I'm on one, my manager walks in. Should I tell him that
this has been a bunch of coincidences, or should I just let it go?
T.L. &QL; 
A. Many employees have found that the best way to get a manager to
drop by is to be doing something other than work. It is almost a
law of the workplace that the less an employee would like to see
his or her manager, the more likely the manager is to show up.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you are making personal calls all the time or
practically never, the fact is that you have been making them, and
your manager has a misperception of your telephonic tendencies. In
order to figure out what to do, you may want to look at the degree
to which personal calls are expressly prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, since the issue is gnawing away at you, the next
step is to mention the personal calls to your manager, but they
should not be the subject of a meeting. Rather, when you meet with
him in the near future, preferably during a discussion that is
focusing on a successful outcome on one of your projects, you can
lightly and briefly mention the coincidence to him. Depending on
his reaction, you will quickly see if you need to go into more
detail or if this issue is actually a nonissue.

UNEARTHING HISTORY  
 PRAIRIE CHICKEN REVIVAL  
 OVARIAN TISSUE PRESERVED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mo., Minn., Iowa, Ill.)  (The Science Times) 
 (af)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking new clues to changes in vegetation and climate that
occurred thousands of years ago, scientists have gone underground.
Eighty feet underground, in fact, in a cave in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, from the University of Minnesota and the
University of Iowa, analyzed stalagmites from Crevice Cave, in the
southeastern part of the state, for evidence of what things were
like topside 75,000 to 25,000 years ago. They reported their
results in the current issue of Science.
</P>
<P>
   A stalagmite tells a tale through time, growing on the floor of
a cave through the constant drip of mineral-laden liquid from
above.
</P>
<P>
   That liquid, of course, began as rain, and filtered through
decaying plant matter in the soil like water through coffee
grounds. Analysis of carbon isotopes in sections of the stalagmite
can reveal what kinds of plant matter the water dripped through.
And the sections can be dated by measuring the amount of a
radioactive thorium isotope they contain.
</P>
<P>
   All that analysis showed that the region around Crevice Cave was
mostly forest from 75,000 to 71,000 years ago, shifting to savannah
and then prairie for about 15,000 years before returning to forest.
</P>
<P>
   A similar analysis of oxygen isotopes in the stalagmites showed
average annual atmospheric temperatures varied by about 7 degrees
Fahrenheit, peaking around 57,000 years ago and reaching a low
point about 46,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Prairie Chicken Revival
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows the story of the buffalo, how they once roamed
the Great Plains by the millions, only to be virtually wiped out by
hunters in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The greater prairie chicken may not have gotten the same press,
but it suffered the same fate, particularly in Illinois where it
was driven to near-extinction by westbound settlers looking for
food. In recent years, the prairie chicken population has thinned
even more as their habitat has disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   But like the buffalo, the greater prairie chicken is making
something of a comeback. A team of scientists from the University
of Illinois and state agencies has imported prairie chickens from
other states to diversify the gene pool, which had become
dangerously homogeneous due to inbreeding among the few remaining
birds.
</P>
<P>
   The importation is only the most recent facet of the
researchers' long-term study of prairie chickens, which they
discussed in a recent issue of Science.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that even though efforts were made to
eliminate predators and restore and preserve habitat, addressing
the issue of lack of genetic diversity was crucial to stemming the
population decline.
</P>
<P>
   Ovarian Tissue Preserved
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to preserving genetic material from many
endangered species for breeding purposes, sperm is the preferred
material. It is easy to collect, freezes well, and when thawed, is
practically as good as new.
</P>
<P>
   Not so the female component of the reproduction equation.
Mammalian eggs are very difficult to collect, and in many cases do
not survive freezing and thawing.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Purdue University have experimented with another
approach to preserving female genetic material: freezing ovarian
tissue itself. In the latest experiment, the researchers removed
ovarian tissue from African elephants and froze it.
</P>
<P>
   When thawed a year later, it was transplanted into mice that had
had their own ovaries removed and their immune systems repressed.
The mice developed mature egg-producing follicles within three
months. In one case, an actual elephant egg was produced (which, in
theory at least, could be fertilized in a test tube and implanted
in another elephant's womb).
</P>
<P>
   While far from perfected, the technique of piggybacking ovarian
tissue on another species could provide a way to generate female
reproductive cells for endangered species in breeding programs.

 &HT;    Here's an idea. Buy a gift this year that isn't digital, that
doesn't require a Pentium processor, that won't have your recipient
flinging his eggnog against the fireplace when it crashes.
 &HT;    Buy a book. Or two or 10. There are plenty of good reads from
which to choose _ no operating manuals required.
 &HT;    The following surveys gift books on subjects ranging from
history and art to sports, music and fashion.: 
 
By FRITZ LANHAM 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   The approaching end of the 20th century has spurred publishers
to offer picture-filled commentaries on the past 100 years. Two
notable contributions are ``The American Century'' by Harold Evans
(Knopf, $50) and ``The Century'' by Peter Jennings and Todd
Brewster (Doubleday, $60).
</P>
<P>
   Evans' book is truly a standout. Most coffee-table books tend to
be bland in their treatment of people and events. Evans, a
British-born naturalized American and one-time editor of the Times
of London, isn't afraid to be provocative as he surveys the
political history of his adopted country. Whether dredging up
almost forgotten episodes such as the Wyoming range war of 1892 or
describing American meddling in Latin American affairs, he's
delightfully tart and challenging.
</P>
<P>
   The book also carefully meshes text and pictures into
self-contained segments, making it easy to take in small doses.
</P>
<P>
   The collaboration of veteran ABC news anchor Jennings and
Brewster, a former Life magazine writer and editor, has resulted in
a less sharp-edged book but one that covers a lot of ground, from
Frederick Jackson Turner's 1893 announcement of the closing of the
West to the death of Princess Diana. The emphasis is on the United
States, with international matters covered to the extent that they
affected this country.
</P>
<P>
   Both ``The Century'' and ``The American Century'' are on the New
York Times best-seller list _ remarkable given their hefty prices.
My guess is a lot of copies will end up under Christmas trees.
</P>
<P>
   More scholarly but still readable and attractive to a general
audience is ``The Oxford History of the Twentieth Century'' edited
by Michael Howard and William Roger Louis (Oxford University Press,
$39.95). The editors have assembled an all-star list of
contributors _ Jonathan Spence writes on China; William H. McNeill
on demography and urbanization; Steven Weinberg, the University of
Texas Nobel laureate, on physics; and so forth. Chapters deal with
themes (The Growth of a World Economy, The Visual Arts), as well as
events and individual countries. There are some illustrations, but
this is a book for reading rather than browsing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Heritage History of the United States'' (Viking,
$50) is both lavishly illustrated and crisply written. It would
make a fine gift for anyone wanting a handy overview of American
history. The author is Douglas Brinkley, the indefatigable young
historian at the University of New Orleans. This is the third
illustrated volume Viking has published in conjunction with
American Heritage in the past couple of years. ``The American
Heritage New History of the Civil War'' and ``The American Heritage
New History of World War II'' also continue to be available and are
well worth owning.
</P>
<P>
   For that baby boomer on the list _ the one who lived through the
'60s, but for some reason doesn't remember it that well _ there's
``The Sixties: Cultural Revolution in Britain, France, Italy and
the United States,'' 1958-1974 by Arthur Marwick (Oxford University
Press, $39.95).
</P>
<P>
   As the subtitle indicates, this book is distinguished by its
breadth (with the glaring omission, as Marwick admits, of Germany)
and by its emphasis on social and cultural rather than political
changes. Popular music, political protest, sexual experimentation
and dozens of other topics all get their due. At 900 pages this
looks like a forbidding tome, but Marwick writes clear, lively
prose. His is the most comprehensive history of the '60s that I
know.
</P>
<P>
   For Anglophiles, Antonia Fraser, the popular British historian,
has edited an expanded and updated version of ``The Lives of the
Kings and Queens of England'' (University of California Press,
$39.95). The coffee-table book, with 100 color and 75
black-and-white illustrations, consists of brief, readable
summaries by notable historians of the lives of Britain's monarchs.
Here's the perfect book to consult if you can't distinguish George
IV from George V or remember which Mary got her head cut off.
</P>
<P>
   Nominated for a National Book Award, Yaffa Eliach's ``There Once
Was a World'' (Little, Brown, $40) is a pioneering study. Subtitled
``A 900-Year Chronicle of the Shtetl of Eishyshok,'' it explores
the day-to-day lives, over nine centuries, of the Jews who lived in
the small market town south of Vilnius in what is now Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
   Eliach, a distinguished Holocaust scholar, was born in Eishyshok
and fled in 1941 as Nazi troops began systemically killing the
town's 3,500 Jews. Her mother and younger brother were among those
brutally murdered.
</P>
<P>
   She discovered that ``no serious, comprehensive, in-depth
account of ''shtetl`` life had ever been done,'' despite the
central role these towns played in the history of Eastern European
Jewry. Her investigations, which included archive research and
interviews with Holocaust survivors and descendants of Eishyshok's
residents, result in a richly textured portrait of a world gone
forever. A moving and important book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerusalem: Stone and Spirit'' by Dan Bahat and Shalom Sabar
(Rizzoli, $60) narrates the city's 3,000-year history mainly
through works of art. The book's 220 illustrations _ 157 in color _
are gorgeous. The text, on the other hand, is in an irritatingly
small and hard-to-read typeface. Still, this would make an
attractive addition to the coffee table. &QL;

GREAT GIFT BOOKS: ART AND PHOTOGRAPHY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Accent mark needed over i in Dali) 
 
By PATRICIA JOHNSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bounty of art books this season began as a trickle of little
publications. Literally little _ Abrams' ``The Essential'' series.
The mini-books measure 6 by 6 inches, and the first four titles are
``Jackson Pollock,'' ``Salvador Dali,'' ``Edward Hopper'' and
``Vincent van Gogh'' ($12.95 each).
</P>
<P>
   Each is written by a different author but follows a format _ 112
pages, 50 illustrations. The tone tends toward the snappy and
informative, and the books seem intended for the reader who
recognizes the name but maybe not the art, or the importance of the
art to which it is attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's so great about Jackson Pollock?'' Justin Spring asks on
the first page of his mini-monograph. His book, he states boldly _
and accurately _ ``is a quick primer in: The Man, The Myth, The
Movement, The Art ... and it's a lot cheaper and quicker than grad
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Monographs, especially those dealing with photographers, are
plentiful this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jacques Henri Lartigue, Photographer'' (Bulfinch, $95) is a
joyful celebration of the French photographer (1894-1986) of the
``belle epoque.'' He was a child prodigy who grew up to lead a
charmed life.
</P>
<P>
   The only text is a nicely wrought introductory essay by Vicki
Goldberg, photography critic for the New York Times. ``Jacques
Henri Lartigue thought that perhaps it was God who gave him his
first camera. Or at least someone who might have been mistaken for
him,'' Goldberg writes.
</P>
<P>
   Lartigue's interests were beautiful women and movement of all
kinds, especially speed. He was there with his viewfinder to
capture fledgling automobiles and airplanes, early races, soaring
kites, a playful young woman skipping down stairs. The book's ample
duotone photographs, several of them gatefolds, do justice to his
vision.
</P>
<P>
   Caught between two world wars, Lartigue managed to retreat from
the harshness of his time, effectively ignoring an ugly world to
rejoice instead in a beautiful life.
</P>
<P>
   American W. Eugene Smith, a world away from Lartigue
geographically and emotionally, turned his lens on people who did
things, simple or dramatic, that changed the world around them.
People such as Maude Cullen, a nurse midwife in the backwoods of
South Carolina, and Albert Schweitzer in Africa. Or people who were
changed by the world, such as the residents of Minamata, Japan,
victimized by an industrial pollution so distinctive and awful that
it gave birth to what's known as ``the Minamata disease.''
</P>
<P>
   ``W. Eugene Smith: Photographs, 1934-1975'' (Abrams, $75),
edited by Gilles Mora and John T. Hill, examines the remarkable
career of one of this country's heroes of photojournalism. He
worked on his own terms and indulged in what essayist Hill calls
``darkroom hyperbole,'' manipulating extreme effects of light and
dark for maximum effect. As Smith himself said, ``There must be the
realization that photography is the best liar among us abetted by
the belief that photography shows it as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The lie was only in dramatic effect; the subjects were all too
real. Smith worked for Newsweek and was a war correspondent in the
Pacific, but he is best known for the dramatic photo-essays he
created for Life magazine between 1938 and 1972, pieces for which
he also wrote the text.
</P>
<P>
   This new book is thorough in its images and its analysis of
Smith's life and work. As a bonus, it reproduces four of his
best-known Life stories, including the controversial 1954 piece ``A
Man of Mercy,'' about Schweitzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Margaret Bourke-White, Photographer'' by Sean Callahan
(Bulfinch, $65) tells the story of a courageous woman with a
remarkable eye. The American photographer established her
reputation early on with clean, graceful images of industry that
transformed the banal _ a plow blade, a spoon or a turbine _ into
sculptural aesthetic objects. She also made a name for herself with
her skyscraper pictures taken from daredevil angles _ looking down
on a DC-4 flying over Manhattan, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Bourke-White was fearless when traveling to the theaters of
World War II on assignment as one of Life magazine's four staff
photographers. She was also compassionate, as her portraits of
India in the late 1950s can attest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spiritually Moving: A Collection of American Folk Art
Sculpture'' is simply lovely (if somewhat precious). Designed by
Tom Geismar and Harvey Kahn, it's an oversized production,
slip-cased and luscious (Abrams, $125). Its content is the private
and until now unknown collection amassed by someone never named in
the book itself. The collector, David Teiger, a management
consultant based in New Jersey, has come to light only in
post-publication stories.
</P>
<P>
   This disingenuous play for mystery aside, the superb color
photographs by Dave Hoffman are knockouts. They illustrate 78
traditional folk-art objects _ weather vanes and decoys, for
example _ with rich attention to overall form, texture, coloration
and frequent small details that surprise and delight.
</P>
<P>
   The images are arranged in thematic groupings such as ``Horses
Running/Jumping,'' ``Bannerets'' and ``Angels.'' Textual material
consists of a brief introduction by Don Walters, former curator of
the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Center.
</P>
<P>
   A 16-page catalog of the works with captions and provenance is
inserted at the back of the book and thoughtfully duplicated in a
pullout. In the absence of access to the objects themselves, this
volume is a worthy substitute.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Baptiste Bacquart's ``The Tribal Arts of Africa'' (Thames
and Hudson, $50) is another seductive picture book, but one with a
strong didactic intent.
</P>
<P>
   ``African art is not just about an aesthetic, it is also about
meaning and function ... always related to magical or social
rites,'' writes Bacquart, art historian and former head of the
tribal art department of Sotheby's auction house in London. ``This
book has been created with the aim of helping professional and
amateur collectors alike to find visual and textual references. It
is based on photographs supported by a text whose purpose is to set
each object in a social, artistic and sometimes religious
context.''
</P>
<P>
   He breaks his subject into five primary geographic areas
subdivided into cultural or tribal groups such as the Asante and
the Fang. The selected objects are carefully reproduced to enhance
salient qualities, such as the scar pattern on the carved Luba
figure typical of the tribe. A handy reference indeed.
</P>
<P>
   No art-book season is complete without at least one book on
Pablo Picasso. ``Picasso and the War Years, 1937-1945'' (Thames and
Hudson, $50) was published as a catalog for the exhibition of the
same title organized by the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. Its
focus is on an intense period during which Picasso created what
many believe to be his most personal work. If not that, it surely
was a pivotal demi-decade during which he produced two of the
world's most compelling portraits of war: ``Guernica,'' in 1937,
and the ``Charnel House,'' in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   These two powerful paintings in grisaille are like brackets to
the horrors of World War II and to a period when, more than ever
for Picasso, making art constituted ``a declaration of free will
and a song of human perseverance,'' as museum director and catalog
essayist Stephen Nash puts it.
</P>
<P>
   This is an art in which death, destruction, fear and desolation
are expressed by crying women, flayed skulls and massive
distortions of form, but the artist himself appears distant and is
not so clearly understood. The narrative probes deeper and
ultimately produces a fuller profile of Picasso as a political
artist. &QL;

GREAT BOOK GIFTS: POP MUSIC, CLASSICAL MUSIC AND MORE ... 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICK MITCHELL, 
CHARLES WARD 
and FRITZ LANDHAM 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Rolling Stones: A Life on the Road'' (Penguin Studio, $50)
documents the Stones' adventures as a touring band, from its early
years as England's ruling blues-club band to its current status as
the world's top-grossing stadium-rock act.
</P>
<P>
   The oversize volume has page after page of dramatic photos from
the band's 35-year archive, with a text featuring commentary by
current and former members of the band and road crew. The
interviews were done by keyboardist and BBC radio host Jools
Holland and Dora Loewenstein, the daughter of Stones' business
manager, Prince Rupert Loewenstein.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing here that hasn't been revealed before, though
the collective reflections on founding member Brian Jones (who died
in 1969) and the band's late road manager Ian Stewart are humorous
and touching. But ``A Life On the Road'' stands as a visual
testament to the Stones' refusal to relinquish its title as the
world's greatest live rock 'n' roll band.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruce Springsteen: Songs'' (Avon, $50) contains the complete
collection of Springsteen's recorded lyrics, from ``Blinded By the
Light'' to ``The Ghost of Tom Joad.'' The lyrics _ usually typed
but sometimes printed in Springsteen's handwriting _ are
accompanied by the artist's reflections on the relationship of his
music to his life and to the lives of his audience.
</P>
<P>
   The text is surrounded by old and new photos from Springsteen's
personal collection. Sandra Choron, Springsteen's longtime art
director, designed the book, and New Jersey free-lance writer
Robert Santelli edited the text.
</P>
<P>
   ``Songs'' is the work of a true artist who represents the best
of America's traditional values _ honesty, integrity, loyalty,
honor _ without forgetting the part about ``liberty and justice for
all.'' The book is a striking visual complement to Springsteen's
new boxed set of previously unreleased material, ``Tracks.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
CLASSICAL MUSIC &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Story of Opera'' (Abrams, $49.50) is a serious
coffee-table book. Instead of the customary parade of lavish
photographs with wisps of narrative, Richard Somerset-Ward's
history of Western opera offers a traditional text illustrated by
photographs reproduced with the excellence of Abrams, a publisher
known for its art books.
</P>
<P>
   Somerset-Ward doesn't pretend to offer new scholarship or
radical insights. His goal, achieved with grace and good speed, is
summarizing the 400 years of opera from its seeds in
late-16th-century Italy until today.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the Camerata and Claudio Monteverdi, the author
moves briskly through the people, places, opera houses, composers
and works that form the essential backbone of opera.
</P>
<P>
   The sprint from the Camerata to Mozart is necessarily brief, to
accommodate the 19th century and its bounty of familiar works.
Still, a reader not familiar with early opera will get a good sense
of the essential developments, quirks and social importance of
opera _ key composers, the castrati, and the royal marriages and
wealth that supported opera in its infancy.
</P>
<P>
   The chapter ``Opera in Nineteenth-Century Paris'' offers a
similar chance to become acquainted with the composers beyond
Georges Bizet who made the French capital such a cauldron of
musical excitement and scandal.
</P>
<P>
   What Somerset-Ward doesn't do is to cast off the essentially
conservative nature of opera. In his foreword he hints at a
revolution in the rise of the importance of drama as part of opera
in the last half of this century. He doesn't prove his case, and
his attitudes toward this century's music reflect traditional
tastes: He devotes as much space to Franz Schreker and Ernst Krenek
as he does to Alban Berg, though the latter's two operas,
``Wozzeck'' and ``Lulu,'' are two of this century's masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
RELIGION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Attractive and informative, ``The Illustrated Guide to World
Religions'' edited by Michael D. Coogan (Oxford University Press,
$49.95) surveys the seven major living religions _ Judaism,
Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Chinese traditions,
Japanese traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Each chapter is written by a different expert who discusses the
history, tenets and practices of his faith. Numerous color
illustrations give this oversize volume an inviting look. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SCIENCE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year dinosaurs were all the rage. This year, it's birds.
The evolution, social behavior, and eating and nesting habits of
birds are the subject of David Attenborough's ``The Life of Birds''
(Princeton University Press, $29.95), based on a 10-part PBS series
to air in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The 180 color photographs complement Attenborough's lucid text.
Among the fun facts you'll learn from ``The Life of Birds,''
according to the publisher: ``One of the most spectacular and
vitriolic feuds in natural history raged for over a century about
whether or not vultures detect a corpse on the ground far below
where they circle in the air by sight or by smell. It was finally
resolved in 1964, when ornithologists, through rigorous experiments
with turkey vultures, excluded any possibility other than smell.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the most visually striking reference books this season is
``The Simon &AMP; Schuster Encyclopedia of Animals'' edited by Dr.
Philip Whitfield (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $50). This massive 616-page
book, a guide to the vertebrates, features brief descriptions by
scientists and fine full-color paintings of the animals.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SPORTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Love of the Game: My Story'' by Michael Jordanedited
by Mark Vancil (Crown, $50) is mostly pictures, but has some text
by the basketball superstar. Focusing mostly on his pro career,
Jordan describes his evolution as a player season by season. The
book's design _ with all manner of typefaces splashed over and
around photographs _ will either seem boldly fresh or irritating.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and his publishers must be doing something right. This
book is sitting at No. 4 on the New York Times best-seller list.
</P>
<P>
   Next is a book that describes a sports world as different as can
be imagined from that of Jordan and his millionaire fellows. Ty
Cashion's ``Pigskin Pulpit: A Social History of Texas High School
Football Coaches'' (Texas State Historical Association, $29.95) is
a sympathetic but not hagiographic examination of coaches from the
1890s through the 1960s, with the emphasis on those who entered the
profession around World War II or shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``While this work does not dodge the tough questions critics of
the game have posed, it is largely the coaches' own story, often in
their own words, describing the way they fit into this once
sacrosanct institution,'' writes Cashion, who teaches history at
Texas A&AMP;M-Commerce.

GREAT HOLIDAY BOOKS: LIFESTYLE, TRAVEL, FASHION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing, it has been said, is as big as the Texas sky.
Nevertheless, Wyman Meinzer, named Texas State Photographer in
1997, manages to pack a lot of it into his book ``Texas Sky''+
(University of Texas Press, $29.95). In more than 100 stunning
color pages, Meinzer records vistas across the state, on Mother
Nature's best and worst days. From lightning strikes to tornados,
sunrise to moon up, rainbows to rocks, we get a fresh look at why
we all brag and complain.
</P>
<P>
   Or travel farther afield. Three special books this holiday
season focus on Italy, two specifically on Rome. In ``Italy: In the
Shadow of Time'' (Rizzoli, $50), photographer Linda Butler captures
the nation in an old light in her black-and-white pictures,
projecting the reader into a cave near Naples or an opera box at La
Scala in Milan.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Private Rome'' (Rizzoli, $45), photographer Francesco
Venturi and writer Elizabeth Helman Minchilli go behind the faades
of the city's grand palaces, aged villas and charming terraced
apartments. With an introduction by designer Valentino, who has
long made Rome his headquarters, the book ranges from the
spectacular to the pastoral, from sculptor Mario Ceroli's bucolic
setting for his living areas and studio to Federico Forquet's
classic apartment a stone's throw from the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Rome 360'' (Random House, $75), Attilio Boccazzi-Varotto
turns his rotating camera on 58 views of the city's ruins,
churches, palazzos, aerial cityscapes and fountains, many of them
shown on fold-out pages. This is a slightly different version of a
book first published in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   If something truly different is what someone on your gift list
craves for holiday perusal, try ``Railroad Voices'' (Stanford
University Press, $35). A tough take on the reality of modern-day
railroad work, this book was put together, surprisingly enough, by
two women.
</P>
<P>
   Lina Bertucci, a former brakeman and sometime photographer, read
Linda Niemann's book, ``Boomer: Railroad Memoirs,'' and called her,
as it happened, shortly before Niemann was to begin a round of
chemotherapy. With time on her hands, Niemann, who hired on with
Southern Pacific in 1979 and continues to work as a conductor for
Union Pacific, agreed to write the text to accompany Bertucci's
black-and-white photos.
</P>
<P>
   She did not write captions but rather narrative slices of life
on the rails, in the yards and in the locker rooms, pieces of a pie
women had formerly been forbidden to sample. Read it and laugh,
wince, cry and applaud.
</P>
<P>
   Another heady offering is Guy Davenport's ``Objects on a Table:
Harmonious Disarray in Art and Literature'' (Counterpoint, $27.50).
This translator, poet, critic, essayist and writer of short fiction
turns a discerning eye on cultural patterns in four meditations on
the still life.
</P>
<P>
   A blend of art history and literary criticism, Davenport's work
goes beyond pieces of fruit, a bust of Sherlock Holmes, an Egyptian
tomb or a Vincent van Gogh painting to find deeper, more ancient or
more modern meanings. Once you've read this, you may never again
look at an apple and a pear as fruit that happened to collide on
the space you call your kitchen table.
</P>
<P>
   So lighten up. Take a look at ``Hirschfeld on Line'' (Applause
Books, $49.95). The first collection of Al Hirschfeld cartoons in
nearly 10 years and the only one now in print, this big book
contains 400 black-and-white and color line drawings spanning the
artist's more than 70 years of illustrative commentary.
</P>
<P>
   Included is a biographical sketch of the artist, his personal
commentary and essays by his wife, his daughter, playwright Arthur
Miller, novelist Kurt Vonnegut, fashion doyenne Grace Mirabella and
actress Whoopi Goldberg. From the Broadway stages to the century's
great figures he covered for the New York Times, Hirschfeld's takes
were instantly recognizable and usually on target.

<P>
   Reach out to your roots or those of others this holiday season
with ``Las Christmas'' (Knopf, $22), in which favorite Latino
authors share their holiday memories. Editors Esmeralda Santiago
(author of ``When I was Puerto Rican'') and Joie Davidow do not
settle for poignant stories only _ although Junot Diaz's first
Christmas in America would qualify _ but search for the unusual,
with tales of Hanukkah and recipes for traditional sweet tamales
and Puerto Rican ``asopao'' (stew) and ``coquito'' (coconut
eggnog).
</P>
<P>
   For those who know the season as ``Las Navidades'' the book is
also available in Spanish in paperback from Vintage Espanol.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has dipped a toe into the history of architecture,
design and technology knows that structures built for world's fairs
often presaged major developments in those fields. Erik Mattie, a
Dutch architectural historian and town planner, looks at the
subject in ``World's Fairs'' (Princeton Architectural Press, $65),
examining some 30 fairs from the Great Exhibition of the Works of
Industry of All Nations in London in 1851 to the upcoming Hanover,
Germany, fair in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   There is Joseph Paxton's great Crystal Palace, the Eiffel Tower,
Seattle's Space Needle and Buckminster Fuller's Montreal dome _ the
better known feats _ but don't miss the many buildings that once
surrounded the Eiffel Tower on the Champ de Mars or the beautiful
structures of the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition in
San Francisco, first set back by delays in the Panama Canal and
then by the 1906 earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Those who like armchair travel will appreciate Dr. John
Grimshaw's ``The Gardener's Atlas'' (Firefly Books, $29.95), in
which he traces the origins, discovery and cultivation of the
world's most popular garden plants.
</P>
<P>
   Leguminosae, for example, is the pea family and happens to
include the Texas State Flower, the Bluebonnet, but also the yellow
Indian laburnum, planted in the Asian tropics for its flowers and
shady canopy.
</P>
<P>
   How did tulips get to Holland, orchids to England and roses to
New York? You will find that perseverance, barter and international
friendships played a great part in the travels of flowering plants,
as did immigrants who left home with seeds and samples of their
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Donzel's ``Book of Flowers'' (Flammarion, $50)
reproduces charming photographs, paintings and illustrations that
attest to the seductiveness of flowers, the rage for bouquets and
the many languages in which you can say it with flowers. Also
included is a connoisseur's guide to the best flower shops and
markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stopping to smell the flowers'' will be more than a slick
self-help phrase for those lucky enough to receive Cathy Newman and
photographer Robb Kendrick's ``Perfume: The Art and Science of
Scent'' (National Geographic Society, $35). Not since Patrick
Suskind's murder story ``Perfume'' have noses been treated to such
delights.
</P>
<P>
   Newman follows the creation of a personal scent, explores the
puzzle of exactly whose noses formulate the hundreds of new
fragrances every year and what everything from the weather to the
price of labor in India to the customers at Sephora in Paris have
to do with how we smell.
</P>
<P>
   Dapper Quincy Jones writes the foreword to ``Men of Color''
(Artisan, $35), in which author Lloyd Boston takes African-American
style onto a runway of words and photographs. The impact black
style has had on the world of fashion has come from from such
diverse personalities as Wynton Marsalis, Jesse Jackson and LL Cool
J. This book is not a superficial chronicle but a serious discovery
of a style as deeply rooted in America as Calvin Klein jeans.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Country Wild'' (Houghton Mifflin, $35), author David
Larkin's Country Wisdom series turns its attention to the forest
and uncultivated open spaces of America. From recipes for Birch
Beer and cooked glasswort to determining what direction a rabbit is
heading from his tracks, Larkin's knowledge can turn a tenderfoot
into a savvy explorer who knows everything from the breeding season
of the moose to how far away he should stay from the business end
of a skunk.
</P>
<P>
   Winter reading is a fine way to explore the idea of life
elsewhere without making a mortgage investment. Elizabeth McMillian
allows the reader that pleasure in ``Living on the Water''
(Rizzoli, $50). She goes behind private doors and enjoys the vistas
from windows, balconies and patios of homes in Bali, Mexico,
Tahiti, even Cross Lake at Shreveport, La. This is one of those
yummy, glossy books that will make any landlubber want to set sail
for a weekend or get a summer home on the water.
</P>
<P>
   Treasures are on view in the Stewart, Tabori &AMP; Chang book ``The
World's Great Treasures'' ($60). Edited by Gianni Guadalupi, the
book contains 580 color photographs of the work of the world's most
outstanding goldsmiths and others who create objects of desire.
</P>
<P>
   Drool over the reliquary made to contain the skull of St.
Elizabeth of Thuringia, the daughter of King Andrea II of Hungary,
and unravel its complicated history _ or imagine wearing the
collars of jewels inscribed with the names of Mogul emperors. &QL;

HITACHI TO HELP NISSAN DEVELOP `SMART CARS'
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Hitachi Ltd., Japan's largest electronics maker, and
Nissan Motor Co. announced Monday that they planned to collaborate
on developing advanced technology for cars.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in a week that large corporations here
have united to finance research projects, a tacit acknowledgment
that Japanese companies no longer have the financial muscle or
unquestioned access to capital they once enjoyed. The cost of
developing new technology is immense, one reason for the
consolidation taking place in the global auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hitachi said it would most likely make an equity investment in
Unisia Jecs Corp., a struggling auto parts manufacturer whose main
backer is Nissan, Japan's second-largest and most visibly troubled
automaker.
</P>
<P>
   A capital injection from Hitachi would give Unisia Jecs
much-needed financial support for research and development of
intelligent transport systems, or ``smart cars,'' at a time when
Nissan is unable to finance such activities for itself, let alone
for its affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be a big boon to Nissan, which has lagged behind
its global competitors in developing technology that could one day
create a car that could drive its owner home after an evening out
on the town without human assistance. Hitachi would gain access to
automotive know-how that could help position it as a leader in the
young market for intelligent transport.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Toshiba Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd., two of Hitachi's
competitors, joined forces to finance development of technology to
build the next generation of computer memory chips.
</P>
<P>
   Should such alliances become a trend, they could lead to merger
activity and the possibility of increased efficiency in Japan's
bloated manufacturing industries. In auto parts, for example,
companies are reporting some of the highest costs ever while
production has declined to 27 percent below peak levels, according
to a new report by Christopher Redl of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   But Redl said any plan by Hitachi to inject money into Unisia
Jecs, which has some of the highest costs in the business and
declining earnings, might be an attempt to hold back the market
forces pushing for efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Hitachi, Nissan and Unisia Jecs are all part of the battered
Fuyo group, or keiretsu, bound together by cross-shareholdings,
interlocking directorates and crucial business relationships that
give them a relationship regarded as familial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of seeing consolidation, we may be seeing another
attempt to breathe life into a weak subsidiary that should probably
be forced to sink or swim,'' Redl said.
</P>
<P>
   A Hitachi spokesman, Kenichiro Mizoguchi, denied that the
company was moving to bail out a corporate cousin, noting that
Hitachi, which is rich in cash, had pointedly refused to provide
funds to Fuji Bank, the beleaguered financial institution at the
heart of the Fuyo group.
</P>
<P>
   He said that it was more Hitachi's relationship with Nissan,
which buys about 40 percent of Hitachi's auto-related products, and
the three companies' collaboration in developing power-train
systems that persuaded it to consider an equity investment.
</P>
<P>
   Mizoguchi said the company would conduct a feasibility study
before determining its investment in Unisia Jecs. But he added that
Hitachi would almost surely take a stake in the parts supplier
either through an equity infusion or by buying shares from Nissan,
which owns 29.6 percent of Unisia Jecs. Hitachi's stake is likely
to make it the second-largest shareholder in Unisia Jecs, which
trades separately.
</P>
<P>
   Although a report Monday morning in the financial daily Nihon
Keizai Shimbun said Hitachi would pay 3 billion to 4 billion yen _
$25 million to $34 million _ for 23.6 percent of Unisia Jecs, a
spokesman for Nissan said that company intended to remain the parts
supplier's largest shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   That is likely to disappoint investors. Nissan has been
promising to take steps to mend its tattered balance sheet in
advance of regulations requiring it to fully include the financial
results of its various affiliates in its consolidated earnings.
Right now, Nissan's consolidated reporting reflects only a portion
of Unisia Jecs' results equal to its stake.

GREAT HOLIDAY BOOKS: ADVENTURE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By FRITZ LANHAM 
and LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the winter of 1915, British explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton
and his crew found themselves and their ship, the Endurance,
trapped in ice off the coast of Antarctica. By the end of October
the grinding pack had reduced the Endurance to kindling.
</P>
<P>
   The members of expedition drifted on ice floes for months before
finally making it to Elephant Island. Shackleton then took five
crewmen and sailed 850 miles in a 22-foot boat to secure help from
South Georgia. On Aug. 30, 1916, he was able to rescue the men on
Elephant Island.
</P>
<P>
   Shackleton's voyage is truly one of the great adventure stories
of the 20th century (the explorer wrote about it himself in his
classic narrative ``South,'' published in 1919 and recently
reissued in two new paperback editions). Among the expedition
members was a photographer, Frank Hurley, who took astonishing
shots documenting the men's ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley's photographs have been married to text by author
Caroline Alexander in ``The Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary
Antarctic Expedition'' (Knopf, $29.95). Alexander does a fine job
in retelling the story, but the photographs are what make this
elegantly produced book.
</P>
<P>
   The Elissa, a ship with a happier fate, is the subject of the
engaging new book ``Sailing Ship Elissa'' by Rice University
history instructor Patricia Bellis Bixel (Texas A&AMP;M University
Press, $22.95).
</P>
<P>
   Launched in 1877, the Elissa served almost 100 years as a
merchant vessel _ under different owners and states of
modification.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1960s the scrap heap loomed. Then two maritime
historians, Peter Throckmorton and Karl Kortum, arranged to buy the
ship with the goal of returning it to its original glory.
</P>
<P>
   Bixel describes the process by which the ship found a home in
Galveston and was lovingly restored and returned to operation as a
sailing vessel. It's a heartening story, well-illustrated with
photos chosen by Galveston photographer Jim Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   For more on ships that didn't make it, there's Mensun Bound's
``Lost Ships: The Discovery and Exploration of the Ocean's Sunken
Treasures'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster Editions, $35). Bound, a professor of
marine archaeology at Oxford University, is no armchair explorer.
Readers will thrill to the story of how his wife's reading about
the auction of a pair of binoculars in a Sunday newspaper led to
his diving on the German pocket battleship ``Admiral Graf Spee'' in
its grave off Montevideo.
</P>
<P>
   For those who favor the mountains to the sea, Villard has
published ``Into Thin Air: The Illustrated Edition'' by Jon
Krakauer ($40).
</P>
<P>
   Published to critical and commercial acclaim in 1997, the book
tells the story of how 12 climbers died on Mount Everest during a
violent storm in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The oversize edition has more than 250 photographs and a new
postscript by the author, who is donating all the royalties from
this edition to the Everest '96 Memorial Fund.

GREAT BOOK GIFTS: POP MUSIC, CLASSICAL MUSIC AND MORE ... 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Sub to correct byline to ``Lanham'' sted of ``Landham'' 
 
By RICK MITCHELL, 
CHARLES WARD 
and FRITZ LANHAM 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Rolling Stones: A Life on the Road'' (Penguin Studio, $50)
documents the Stones' adventures as a touring band, from its early
years as England's ruling blues-club band to its current status as
the world's top-grossing stadium-rock act.
</P>
<P>
   The oversize volume has page after page of dramatic photos from
the band's 35-year archive, with a text featuring commentary by
current and former members of the band and road crew. The
interviews were done by keyboardist and BBC radio host Jools
Holland and Dora Loewenstein, the daughter of Stones' business
manager, Prince Rupert Loewenstein.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing here that hasn't been revealed before, though
the collective reflections on founding member Brian Jones (who died
in 1969) and the band's late road manager Ian Stewart are humorous
and touching. But ``A Life On the Road'' stands as a visual
testament to the Stones' refusal to relinquish its title as the
world's greatest live rock 'n' roll band.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruce Springsteen: Songs'' (Avon, $50) contains the complete
collection of Springsteen's recorded lyrics, from ``Blinded By the
Light'' to ``The Ghost of Tom Joad.'' The lyrics _ usually typed
but sometimes printed in Springsteen's handwriting _ are
accompanied by the artist's reflections on the relationship of his
music to his life and to the lives of his audience.
</P>
<P>
   The text is surrounded by old and new photos from Springsteen's
personal collection. Sandra Choron, Springsteen's longtime art
director, designed the book, and New Jersey free-lance writer
Robert Santelli edited the text.
</P>
<P>
   ``Songs'' is the work of a true artist who represents the best
of America's traditional values _ honesty, integrity, loyalty,
honor _ without forgetting the part about ``liberty and justice for
all.'' The book is a striking visual complement to Springsteen's
new boxed set of previously unreleased material, ``Tracks.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
CLASSICAL MUSIC &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Story of Opera'' (Abrams, $49.50) is a serious
coffee-table book. Instead of the customary parade of lavish
photographs with wisps of narrative, Richard Somerset-Ward's
history of Western opera offers a traditional text illustrated by
photographs reproduced with the excellence of Abrams, a publisher
known for its art books.
</P>
<P>
   Somerset-Ward doesn't pretend to offer new scholarship or
radical insights. His goal, achieved with grace and good speed, is
summarizing the 400 years of opera from its seeds in
late-16th-century Italy until today.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the Camerata and Claudio Monteverdi, the author
moves briskly through the people, places, opera houses, composers
and works that form the essential backbone of opera.
</P>
<P>
   The sprint from the Camerata to Mozart is necessarily brief, to
accommodate the 19th century and its bounty of familiar works.
Still, a reader not familiar with early opera will get a good sense
of the essential developments, quirks and social importance of
opera _ key composers, the castrati, and the royal marriages and
wealth that supported opera in its infancy.
</P>
<P>
   The chapter ``Opera in Nineteenth-Century Paris'' offers a
similar chance to become acquainted with the composers beyond
Georges Bizet who made the French capital such a cauldron of
musical excitement and scandal.
</P>
<P>
   What Somerset-Ward doesn't do is to cast off the essentially
conservative nature of opera. In his foreword he hints at a
revolution in the rise of the importance of drama as part of opera
in the last half of this century. He doesn't prove his case, and
his attitudes toward this century's music reflect traditional
tastes: He devotes as much space to Franz Schreker and Ernst Krenek
as he does to Alban Berg, though the latter's two operas,
``Wozzeck'' and ``Lulu,'' are two of this century's masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
RELIGION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Attractive and informative, ``The Illustrated Guide to World
Religions'' edited by Michael D. Coogan (Oxford University Press,
$49.95) surveys the seven major living religions _ Judaism,
Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Chinese traditions,
Japanese traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Each chapter is written by a different expert who discusses the
history, tenets and practices of his faith. Numerous color
illustrations give this oversize volume an inviting look. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SCIENCE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year dinosaurs were all the rage. This year, it's birds.
The evolution, social behavior, and eating and nesting habits of
birds are the subject of David Attenborough's ``The Life of Birds''
(Princeton University Press, $29.95), based on a 10-part PBS series
to air in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The 180 color photographs complement Attenborough's lucid text.
Among the fun facts you'll learn from ``The Life of Birds,''
according to the publisher: ``One of the most spectacular and
vitriolic feuds in natural history raged for over a century about
whether or not vultures detect a corpse on the ground far below
where they circle in the air by sight or by smell. It was finally
resolved in 1964, when ornithologists, through rigorous experiments
with turkey vultures, excluded any possibility other than smell.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the most visually striking reference books this season is
``The Simon &AMP; Schuster Encyclopedia of Animals'' edited by Dr.
Philip Whitfield (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $50). This massive 616-page
book, a guide to the vertebrates, features brief descriptions by
scientists and fine full-color paintings of the animals.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SPORTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Love of the Game: My Story'' by Michael Jordanedited
by Mark Vancil (Crown, $50) is mostly pictures, but has some text
by the basketball superstar. Focusing mostly on his pro career,
Jordan describes his evolution as a player season by season. The
book's design _ with all manner of typefaces splashed over and
around photographs _ will either seem boldly fresh or irritating.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and his publishers must be doing something right. This
book is sitting at No. 4 on the New York Times best-seller list.
</P>
<P>
   Next is a book that describes a sports world as different as can
be imagined from that of Jordan and his millionaire fellows. Ty
Cashion's ``Pigskin Pulpit: A Social History of Texas High School
Football Coaches'' (Texas State Historical Association, $29.95) is
a sympathetic but not hagiographic examination of coaches from the
1890s through the 1960s, with the emphasis on those who entered the
profession around World War II or shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``While this work does not dodge the tough questions critics of
the game have posed, it is largely the coaches' own story, often in
their own words, describing the way they fit into this once
sacrosanct institution,'' writes Cashion, who teaches history at
Texas A&AMP;M-Commerce.

STATE IMPOSES FINANCIAL CONTROLS ON WARHOL FOUNDATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a long investigation of the Andy Warhol
Foundation for the Visual Arts in response to allegations of waste
and mismanagement, Attorney General Dennis Vacco announced Monday
that the foundation would have to comply with strict new financial
controls.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation will form an audit committee, hire a new chief
financial officer and introduce tighter accounting and bookkeeping
procedures. The foundation must also open its books to the attorney
general's office for review four times a year rather than annually.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Sansverie, chief of the attorney general's charities
bureau, said he had found no legal wrongdoing by the foundation,
which was created after the artist's death in 1987 to promote the
visual arts. He declined to specify what led his office to impose
the financial monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Archibald Gillies, the foundation's president and chief
executive, said he was relieved that the investigation was behind
him. ``It's finished and the changes we've agreed to are things
we've had in place,'' Gillies said. ``There have been discussions
with the attorney general's office for four years now. These
changes are a way for the public to better understand what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues looked into by the attorney general's office
were the salaries of the foundation's employees, which Sansverie
said were not out of line with salaries at comparable foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Gillies said his salary was $215,000 and his contract, which was
supposed to expire on Feb. 28, 2000, had been extended to June 30,
2001. Vacco's office also looked into the foundation's art program,
which included fees paid to Vincent Freemont, who has had the
exclusive right to sell art for the foundation for a commission of
10 percent. Freemont's fees had already been reduced last year.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's new chief financial officer, K.C. Maurer, who
has worked for NASA, started her job in November, Gillies said. Ms.
Maurer will report to both Gillies and the foundation's board
through the new audit committee, which will consist of three
members of the board.
</P>
<P>
   Practically since its inception, the foundation has been the
subject of criticism by people in the art world who complained to
the attorney general's office. When Warhol died he left the
foundation real estate, cash and an outstanding collection of art
worth somewhere between $100 million and $800 million. At his death
his estate included some 700 paintings, 9,000 drawings, 19,000
prints and 66,000 photographs, all of which went to the foundation,
which was the sole beneficiary of his will.
</P>
<P>
   While the foundation was rich in art, for years it spent
millions of dollars on administrative costs while giving far
smaller amounts to charity. Such costs are typically 11 cents for
every dollar donated. It also sold art to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's explanation for its expenses was that it needed
money for the labor-intensive job of cataloging the collection,
safely storing it and selling it. (Gillies said the foundation had
about $40 million in cash assets and about $81 million worth of
art, conservatively estimated. In its last fiscal year it made
grants of about $9.5 million. Administrative expenses that year
were $5.3 million, of which $3.2 million was spent on the
artworks.)
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's assets were greatly eroded over the years by
legal fees incurred in a highly publicized suit filed in 1992
against the artist's estate by Edward Hayes, a former assistant
district attorney who was the estate's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleged that the estate's holdings were worth more than
$600 million in art, not $100 million as the estate contended. In
calculating his fee, which was to be 2 percent of the value of the
estate, Hayes said he was owed $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 a Manhattan judge ruled that Hayes and Francis Harvey, a
lawyer working with him, were to be paid $7.2 million for their
work. That ruling was overturned 10 months later when the appellate
division of the state Supreme Court decided that Hayes was entitled
to only $3.5 million for his work as a lawyer. Hayes subsequently
complained about the behavior of the appellate judge, Francis
Murphy, who resigned without answering Hayes' complaint.

INTERIOR DEPARTMENT SAYS NEW PLAN FOR YOSEMITE IS DUE NEXT MAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said Monday the
government will come up with a comprehensive plan next spring to
protect Yosemite National Park from the environmental damage that
millions of tourists and their cars inflict each year.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which will be released in May, will combines separate
projects already under way that are dealing with transportation,
housing and commercial development and land use at the northern
California park, one of the most popular in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense that we roll things into a broad package that
can be reviewed in total,'' Babbitt said at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
   He said that unless the number the cars entering the park's
valley is greatly reduced, the ``beauty and ecology of the Yosemite
will be destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   About 4.2 million people visit the park each year, and that
number is expected to grow to at least 6 million in the next 10
years. During the busy summer months, as many as 7,000 cars a day
cram into the 7-square-mile valley of the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times the valley reminds you very much of being in Times
Square in midsummer,'' said Babbitt, who was joined by
environmental leaders in discussing the new Yosemite plan.
</P>
<P>
   Massive flooding in the park in 1997 prompted officials to take
a closer look at congestion and other problems as part of the
restoration effort.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Meadows, president of the Wilderness Society, said
California's projected population growth threatens to overwhelm the
park. The state is expected to have 47.5 million people by 2020, up
from more than 32 million now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yosemite could be trampled in the next century,'' Meadows
said.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said the key to protecting Yosemite was not to cut down
on the number of visitors but to ``separate'' the tourists from
their cars.
</P>
<P>
   To address that problem, park officials and the five adjacent
counties voted in August to establish a bus system that could
transport more than 800,000 visitors a year by the end of the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the bus service will begin in limited form next
summer and will bring in visitors on Highways 140, 41 and 120. The
bus service would run hourly from the park's main entrance at El
Portal on 140 and four to six times a day from other locations,
including Fish Camp on Highway 41 and Tuolumne Meadows on 120.
</P>
<P>
   Use of the buses will be voluntary, but officials hope to entice
visitors to ride them by offering reduced park entrance fees for
people using the service. People arriving in their cars will pay
$20, while bus riders will have to pay only $3 per person or $6 per
family.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the buses will be able to bypass the long lines of
cars waiting to get in the park, and riders will be assured of
admission on those occasional days when the valley can't
accommodate more cars.
</P>
<P>
   If the test program is successful, park officials say around 200
buses would be added to the fleet over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   However Babbitt said at the news conference that the park's
transportation problems could not be solved without dealing with
other concerns such as lodging, the number of overnight park
visitors, overcrowding at popular sites and commercial development.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt also acknowledged that pressure from a lawsuit by the
environmental group Sierra Club, which had called for a planning
approach similar to the one announced Monday, helped push the
Interior Department to consider the cumulative impact of housing,
commercial development and transportation problems on Yosemite.
``It surely was a factor (in our decision),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Brower, former executive director of the Sierra Club, said
he was pleased with Babbitt's announcement. He added that the
department must ``look at the whole picture'' when examining ways
to protect the park and ``bring the public into'' the
decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
   Interior officials ``need to make sure that this beautiful park
can be seen by everybody who wants to,'' Brower said.

 &HT;    What will be remembered most is the end result, not who casts
what vote
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The prevailing political explanation for the latest
mood swing toward impeachment, as the House Judiciary Committee
nears a vote, is that wavering Republicans have been swayed by the
argument that a vote to impeach will be remembered by those who
favor it, while a vote against will be forgotten by those who
oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   By this logic, moderate Republicans can ``inoculate'' themselves
from the hardliners in their own party, without risking much
backlash from less focused opponents of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   This has the right layering of Potomac cynicism to sound
sensible, but like so many political calculations made in
Washington this year, there is almost no recent evidence to back it
up. For example, voters opposed to impeachment were not less
focused in the last election, contrary to so many predictions, than
those who want Bill Clinton out of office.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a vote that could lead to the removal of the
president, and in the least case will send these deliberations to
the Senate, extending the process for perhaps several more months,
is far more likely to be remembered than a vote to end it.
</P>
<P>
   As fuzzy as the politically cynical explanation for the
hardening attitude on impeachment may be, it makes more sense than
the reasoning proffered by those who approach this difficult moment
in a more high-minded fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Rep. Christopher Shays told the Boston Globe a
number of Republicans who weren't going to vote for impeachment
were infuriated by Clinton's answers to the 81 questions submitted
by Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde and may now vote for impeachment
``almost as a form of punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Last-straw exasperation with bland White House legalisms (''Q.
Do you admit or deny that you are the chief law enforcement officer
of the United States? A. The president is frequently referred to as
the chief law enforcement officer, although nothing in the
Constitution specifically designates the president as such. ...'')
seems at best a thin rationale for such a momentous decision, at
this late hour.
</P>
<P>
   That it came about the same time Hyde was determining there was
nothing worth pursuing in the Justice Department memo on Democratic
fund-raising, and a jury was deciding in favor of the target of
another independent counsel, former Agriculture Secretary Mike
Espy, makes this reasoning even more suspect.
</P>
<P>
   A more likely explanation for the changing mood among House
Republicans is a gathering recognition that they have no other way
out of this box. Simply voting against impeachment would be
problematic, and it has become more obvious how difficult it would
be to engineer a censure deal.
</P>
<P>
   Shays' choice of words is revealing, nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost as a form of punishment'' suggests those turning toward
impeachment still do not believe it will result in the Senate
voting for Clinton's removal. Rich Galen, the director of GOPAC,
has fleshed out this idea. A House vote for impeachment would, in
itself, be Clinton's punishment, he argues, while the Senate could
do whatever it does in a matter of hours.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds dangerously close to Espy special prosecutor Donald
Smaltz's comment last week that the indictment of a public official
may be ``as great a deterrent as a conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   And, like voting for impeachment and passing the problem on to
the Senate, it's not nearly as difficult.
</P>

Journal-Constitution, Atlanta, Ga.

CUTBACKS IN AMERICAN ART ARCHIVES CAUSE UPROAR IN ART WORLD
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Mich., N.Y., Calif., Ill.)   (mk) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Richard Wattenmaker, director of the Smithsonian
Institution's Archives of American Art, started making phone calls
from his Washington office on Sept. 23, he could hardly have
imagined the uproar he would soon create.
</P>
<P>
   He was about to close the Boston and Detroit offices of the
archives, whose more than 13 million documents record the history
of visual art in the United States, and to shrink operations in New
York. Six employees, including two regional directors, would lose
their jobs. From now on, material would be collected from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The news ricocheted around the American art world, and so did
the complaints. But they were not enough to stop Wattenmaker's
plans, which went into effect on Nov. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Though the archives constitute a tiny agency, all but unnoticed
by the public, its cache is crucial. Some 3,000 scholars, curators
and writers use it each year. ``It has enormous implications for
how art history is written,'' said Francis O'Connor, an art
historian best known for editing the catalog raisonne of Jackson
Pollock's work.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder, then, that Wattenmaker and much of the American
art establishment are engaged in a battle over the archives'
future. Critics have begun to protest not only the cutbacks but
also the archives' past retrenchments, its sometimes fitful
collecting, its often tardy processing of material and
Wattenmaker's pronouncement of the reorganization as a fait
accompli. And he has lashed back in a way rarely heard in the art
world or in the government.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Stebbins and Jonathan Fairbanks, curators at the Museum
of Fine Arts in Boston and members of the archives' Boston advisory
committee, wrote a letter to Wattenmaker on Oct. 8 that said in
part, ``If your plans to `reorganize' proceed, you will succeed in
destroying the very foundation upon which the archives was
established.'' They sent copies to I. Michael Heyman, secretary of
the Smithsonian, and J. Dennis O'Connor, its provost.
</P>
<P>
   From Detroit, Mado Lie, president of the archives' local support
group, called Wattenmaker's news ``a bombshell'' and in an Oct. 5
letter to him went on to say, ``Everybody understands bottom line
concerns, but your furtive blitz was unconscionable.''
</P>
<P>
   A few people are even grumbling that the archives might be
better off as a private institution, as it was before seeking
federal aid in 1969-70.
</P>
<P>
   Wattenmaker, who flew to Detroit in mid-November to listen to
the dissenters, and O'Connor, who made a similar trip to Boston in
late October, insist that there will be no change in plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reorganizing, we're not cutting back,'' O'Connor said in
a recent interview. And he dismissed contentions that the archives
might be better off in private hands: ``I don't know how anyone
with two neurons would say that we are not concerned with the
archives at the Smithsonian.''
</P>
<P>
   Wattenmaker, who has held his post since 1990, responded with a
broadside that sniped not only at his critics but at Vice President
Al Gore's six-year-old effort to ``reinvent'' government, and even
at the archives' trustees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful to have people tell you how to run your
business,'' Wattenmaker fumed. ``Ted Stebbins hasn't been to an
advisory committee meeting in years. In my time he has never done
any serious fund raising. Since 1970 we have raised no serious
money in Boston. When the Museum of Fine Arts put up that ugly
shopping mall wing, did I call them up and say, `Why are you
putting all this trash in the museum?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they ought to understand how up-the-creek the finances
here were,'' Wattenmaker added. ``How about they run their
business, and the Smithsonian runs its business?''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to his critics' statement that the Boston office cost
a mere $150,000 a year, Wattenmaker said: ``I don't have the
$150,000. With the mandate by your vice president and all of his
playmates, we have to reduce.''
</P>
<P>
   All told, the Smithsonian allocates $1.5 million of its annual
budget of more than $550 million to the archives. The archives add
to that by raising another $500,000 a year privately. But even
there, it has had trouble meeting needs. ``Part of the trustees'
duty is to give money, and they were falling short of
expectations,'' Wattenmaker said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, when a management consultant suggested that the
annual donation expected from trustees be doubled to $10,000,
Wattenmaker said, ``the trustees declined to raise it.'' And two
years ago, the Brown Foundation gave the archives a $500,000
challenge grant to guarantee the publication of its quarterly
journal, but so far the archives have managed to match only
$160,000.
</P>
<P>
   Trivial as those budget numbers sound, they are no measure of
the archives' value. They collect, process, microfilm and store
letters, notebooks, photographs, diaries, sketchbooks, business
records and other items from hundreds of artists, museums, dealers,
collectors, scholars and critics, as well as audio and video
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The personal papers of such artists as Pollock, Thomas Cole,
Stuart Davis, Louise Nevelson and Ben Shahn are among the archives'
treasures. So are those of art critics like Clement Greenberg and
art patrons like Isabella Stewart Gardner. The records of the
legendary 1913 Armory Show, which introduced modern art in the
United States, are in the archives.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Hill, an art historian at Boston University, said the
archives' primary research material had ``allowed art historians to
rethink art history. You don't have to follow the road of the
antiquarians.''
</P>
<P>
   She is writing a book about Jacob Lawrence, who she said was
shunted aside by the experts in the 1930s and 40s. ``You can do
better art history'' because of the archives, she said. Its catalog
lists 47 files that mention Lawrence, including his personal
papers, and interviews with him in 1968 and 1982.
</P>
<P>
   When the archives were founded by three Detroit art lovers in
1954 in the kitchen of Lawrence Fleischman, a dealer who died in
1997, there was no institution for the study of American art, the
archives literature says. Today, they are the largest single source
of historical material about visual art in the country.

   In years past, the archives had offices in several cities,
including San Francisco and Chicago, that collected documents and
housed microfilmed copies of the original material, which is stored
in Washington. But the regional system proved too expensive,
Wattenmaker said.
</P>
<P>
   The archives, which employed 46 people in 1990, began 1998 with
36 people spread around its Washington headquarters, a dusty office
on the third-floor balcony of the National Museum of American Art,
and offices in Detroit, New York, Boston and San Marino, Calif.
Most of the holdings are stored in Smithsonian quarters north of
the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Under Wattenmaker's new plan, the number is 30. Detroit is
closed, its microfilm records transferred to Washington. Boston is
closed, though microfilms are still available at the Boston Public
Library, where they were moved in 1993. The Manhattan office, in
the Equitable Center, remains open as a research center but not a
collecting point, and a new employee will be hired to raise money
and develop membership.
</P>
<P>
   The shrinkage means that scholars not situated on either coast
must depend on intra-library loans, which take four to six weeks
and may take longer now, archives staff members have told users.
</P>
<P>
   But art experts say the bigger worry is collecting. A large part
of the job of the former regional directors, Robert Brown in Boston
and Stephen Polcari in New York, was ``rainmaking'': initiating
relationships with artists, dealers, scholars, curators and
collectors and persuading them to donate their papers.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Polcari each cite many examples of their successes,
but Wattenmaker said they often simply picked up things that would
have been donated anyway. Brown's backers in Boston testify to his
effectiveness. Polcari's in New York are less enthusiastic; they
credit him with being a better scholar than schmoozer.
</P>
<P>
   Polcari disagreed: ``My track record stands for itself. I am a
nationally recognized scholar, and that's useful in collecting. But
my personality works well with people.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, nearly everybody contacted, except Wattenmaker and
O'Connor, said it made no sense to close down collecting from New
York and Boston. They said that knowledgeable people constantly on
the scene must do the collecting, or the process atrophies.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that in dealing with his bosses in Washington over
the past few years, ``I got no feeling that they wanted collecting
to continue. They want some big names, of course, but not the whole
thing. But you never know what a third-rank artist might have that
mirrors a whole era.''
</P>
<P>
   And if collecting has to be concentrated in one office, why
Washington? Historically at least, most American art was produced
in and around New York and New England. ``The collecting office
should be in New York,'' said Gail Levin, an art professor at the
Graduate School of the City University of New York and the author
of a dozen art books.
</P>
<P>
   Wattenmaker argues that much of the archives' collecting will
simply be more focused, with money raised from foundations for
specific goals, like a current Hispanic art project based in
Florida. ``There will not be any cutback in collecting,'' he said.
He also dismissed complaints that the archives had fallen behind in
processing the material collected. Yet he acknowledged that only
about one-third of the documents had been microfilmed.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seems to agree that the archives are underfinanced,
which is hampering all of its work. Many people blame the trustees,
though they will not do so on the record.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ``we are underendowed,'' Wattenmaker said, citing
the total as less than $500,000, a remnant of gifts made in the
1960s when the archives were still private. The endowment should be
at least $5 million, he said. His solution is to hire a fund-raiser
based in New York to seek endowment money and operating funds.
</P>
<P>
   But a few people are starting to say the archives should be
given more federal money or returned to private status. The art
world has gotten bigger and richer since the archives sought
federal shelter. Raising the money needed _a total in the low
millions would probably do it _ may not be that difficult at a time
when many museums are attracting tens of millions of dollars.

RATE OF SUICIDE AMONG THE ELDERLY EXPECTED TO RISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 20 long years John Sauls watched Parkinson's disease batter
his wife's body, watched the drugs lose their power to help,
watched the power of speech flee from Anna Sauls' lips.
</P>
<P>
   His seven years of retirement held no leisure. Instead, his days
passed in a small house outside Iberia, Mo., where he tended hour
by hour to a woman whose jaw went slack, whose eyes ceased to
blink, whose life in a wheelchair was tortured by neurological
disease.
</P>
<P>
   When he fell from a barn and broke some ribs in April 1990, the
69-year-old man surrendered to his burdens. He fired a .22-caliber
rifle into his wife's head and then put the barrel of a .410
shotgun in his mouth and pulled the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt that he had come to the end of his rope,'' said their
son, Russ Sauls. ``He didn't see much choice.''
</P>
<P>
   These kinds of deaths among the elderly _ double-suicide and
murder-suicide cases, such as the Saulses and perhaps U.S. District
Judge Earl O'Connor and his wife, Jean O'Connor, found dead last
week in their Mission, Kan., home _ remain as rare as they are sad.
</P>
<P>
   And even though suicide _ often thought of in terms of
teen-agers employing permanent solutions to temporary problems _ is
really an elderly person's domain, fewer than 1 in 5,000 Americans
aged 65 and older kill themselves each year.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of elderly suicides has tumbled downward through this
century largely, researchers say, because elderly people now have
more money and better health care.
</P>
<P>
   Still, elderly Americans, especially white men, kill themselves
more than anyone. Of the handful of people who have used Oregon's
assisted-suicide law to hasten their deaths in the last year, the
median age was 71.
</P>
<P>
   And the raw numbers of elderly suicide balloon with the aging of
the American population.
</P>
<P>
   With baby boomers _ the most suicidal generation of this century
_ moving into their 60s in little more than a decade, experts
expect both the number and the rate of older people killing
themselves to rise.
</P>
<P>
   In general, they commit suicide when hopes of recovering their
health, their comfort or their independence vanish. Because older
people are healthier and wealthier today than their parents and
grandparents were generations ago, the suicide rate among those 65
and older is less than half what it was 60 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big news for elderly suicide is that it went down steadily
for decades,'' said Eugene McDowell, a psychologist and suicide
researcher.
</P>
<P>
   He credits programs like Social Security and Medicare for the
trend that has held steady _ with small exceptions in the 1940s and
1980s _ since the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give older people more money and good health care, and
they kill themselves less often,'' said McDowell, a co-author of
Suicide Across the Life Span.
</P>
<P>
   Hospice workers say the pain and panic that can set off suicides
among the elderly can be avoided with a little know-how about
dealing with a terminal illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can actually be a quality to those last months and days,
some quality spiritual, emotional, psychological kind of growth,''
said Thelma Sword, Liberty (Mo.) Hospital home health and hospice
director. In 20 years as a hospice nurse, Sword helped hundreds of
patients deal with death.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they come to us, there's so many things we can tell them to
make it all easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Little things, Sword said, such as learning how to use pillows
to make someone more comfortable in bed. Teaching a caretaker to
turn a patient over by pulling on the sheet rather than tugging on
sore limbs. Or telling the patient that if swallowing pills is a
problem, nearly all pain medications now are available in liquids.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide pacts and murder-suicides _ every one its own riddle _
are actually more common in early adulthood and middle age.
Typically, research shows, a man kills his wife or girlfriend and
then himself in a psychotic episode set off by sexual jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   Murder-suicides among senior citizens _ far less common _
usually spring from different circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stereotype is that these suicide pacts happen among the
young like Romeo and Juliet,'' said psychologist McDowell. ``But
the reality is that it is old people who do this. And the risk of
suicide increases for them as their health fails and when they
experience money problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Agencies that track how people die tend to count suicides in one
category and murders in another while tending to overlook where the
two come together.
</P>
<P>
   Any understanding of what motivates a man to shoot his wife and
then himself is left to the imperfect science of psychological
autopsy. John Sauls left a note saying he thought God would forgive
him and asking the same consideration from those he left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Still, experts see trends. Murder-suicides among the elderly
nearly always involve a man shooting his ailing wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cases resemble `mercy killings' or simple suicide pacts
among the elderly in which both individuals ... are certified as
suicides,'' a team of psychiatrists wrote in the Journal of the
American Medical Association in 1992. ``These offenders also
resemble the profile of the `elderly white male suicide,' who is
usually widowed or separated, depressed and in poor health and
despair.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have come to believe that murder-suicides tend to be
the result of the suicidal tendencies of husbands, McDowell said.
Men are about five times more likely than women to kill themselves.
That's even more pronounced in old age. For men over 85, for
instance, the suicide rate is almost 60 per 100,000, as opposed to
less than 4.5 per 100,000 women over 85.
</P>
<P>
   Women's suicidal tendencies peak in their 50s as they reach
menopause and their children leave home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's usually a desperate act by the husband,'' said the Rev.
John Paris, a medical ethicist and theologian at Boston College.
``Women do far better at living alone. They've always run the
household. So they have coped with the shopping and the cleaning
and the cooking and the finances....
</P>
<P>
   ``When men see their wives in pain and realize that it's up to
them to take care of a long-term situation, they panic. It's almost
always with a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Russ Sauls says he suspects that his father could
have avoided a violent end for himself and his wife if he had
turned to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always somebody somewhere to give you help,'' he said.
``You can go through the churches or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   While he believes John Sauls took a desperate measure out of
fear and frustration, Russ Sauls said it was also a compassionate
one. Husband and wife were buried together under a single
headstone. It reads:
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of love came the end of the storm.''

YELTSIN, HIS AUTHORITY SLIPPING, RESHUFFLES INNER CIRCLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin came to his Kremlin office
Monday just long enough to dismiss four top aides and proclaim that
he is retaking control of his government's skidding tax-collection
and crime-fighting agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Then he returned to a Moscow hospital, continuing a recovery
from pneumonia that has stretched to 15 days and seemingly rendered
him an asterisk in the Kremlin power structure _ at least until
now.
</P>
<P>
   Oleg Sysuyev, a senior aide who often channels Yeltsin's view of
things to reporters and television viewers, told the Itar-Tass news
agency later that his boss had other moves in mind, but offered no
specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's official spokesman, Dmitri Yakushkin, said the
president gave his staff a blunt explanation for the reshuffling.
``Things are not going too well,'' he quoted Yeltsin as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-ranking aide dismissed was Valentin Yumashev, head
of presidential administration, whose job is roughly equivalent to
chief of staff in the U.S. White House. He was replaced by Nikolai
Bordyuzha, a onetime chief of the federal border guards who most
recently was secretary of Yeltsin's top advisory body, the security
council.
</P>
<P>
   Bordyuzha will keep his security council job, an apparent
attempt to insure that the defense and security officials on the
security council work in lock step with the rest of the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, 67, also said that the heads of the federal Justice
Ministry and tax-collection agency will now report directly to him
instead of to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov. Yakushkin said the
shift was coordinated with Primakov and does not signal any
unhappiness on Yeltsin's part with his latest second-in-command.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin changes underlings more often than many people change
their motor oil, having announced three prime ministers and
dismissed countless lesser aides since last spring. Outsiders were
reluctant to attach any special importance to the latest
dismissals, which were limited to Yeltsin's shrunken inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   The moves nevertheless addressed a rising perception that
influence over events here _ social, political and economic _ is
slowly slipping from the grasp of the pro-democracy forces that
Yeltsin long represented. In response, Yeltsin appears to be trying
to stanch the bleeding away of his political authority.
</P>
<P>
   The economy continues to work against Yeltsin. Tax revenues have
been slipping since August, forcing the government to print more
rubles. Officials said Monday that the central bank pumped 10.5
billion new rubles, or more than $525 million, into the economy
last month, triple the rate in October. The ruble traded at 6.3 to
the dollar four months ago but dipped below the 20-per-dollar mark
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Once content just to mock him, the president's many critics in
the Communist Party and among nationalist movements have begun
testing their own strength lately, to some effect.
</P>
<P>
   Members of both factions have refused to condemn attacks by one
Communist in the Parliament on Russian Jews, many of them rich
businessmen who have supported the current government. Some
legislators have openly endorsed the attacks, drawing a rebuke from
Yeltsin but little else.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Communists stunned many Muscovites by proposing to
restore to downtown Moscow a statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky, the first
head of the despised Cheka secret police, which later became the
KGB. The Cheka and its successors oversaw the arrest or execution
of millions of innocent Russians during Stalin's purges in the
1930s.
</P>
<P>
   The secret police also created a forced-labor program that sent
Russians to build huge dams and canals, mine gold and perform other
state tasks, often under horrific conditions and with high
mortality rates. Finally, the agencies created and ran the
now-famous gulags in which political opponents and dissidents were
imprisoned and forced to work.
</P>
<P>
   The Dzerzhinsky statue, which stood in Lubyanka Square outside
KGB headquarters near Red Square, was toppled from its pedestal by
celebrants after Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov ordered it removed in
1991. A Communist legislator proposed restoring the statue as an
anti-crime symbol, saying it memorialized a man with ``cold hands''
and a ``warm heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution eventually passed, and while the statue's future
remains uncertain, the vote is widely viewed as evidence of the
Yeltsin government's fading authority.
</P>
<P>
   The country's powerful criminal bands are increasingly brazen,
too. The recent assassination of a leading advocate of democracy,
Galina Starovoitova, a member of Parliament, has underscored the
criminals' efforts to muscle their way into politics.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin reportedly held a consultation with his daughter and
adviser Tatyana Dyachenko, 38, and with Yumashev before spending
three hours at the Kremlin Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Yakushkin quoted Yeltsin as saying that his aides' conduct of
the battle against corruption and political extremism ``undermines
trust in presidential authority in general, and that is
inadmissible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the present conditions,'' Yeltsin was quoted as saying,
``power should be concentrated in one hand.''

CAPITALIST CUBA?: ECONOMIC TIMES IN CUBA ARE A-CHANGIN'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's an innovative twist, this idea that Cuba's leaders are
pushing. Government agency as entrepreneur, the catalyst that
brings capital and labor together. A corporation with all the
citizens as stockholders, promoting scores of joint ventures with
private business investors from at least 34 different countries as
its partners.
</P>
<P>
   Shall we call it an exercise in socialist capitalism? Whatever
label we put on the process, it appears to be working.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba last month, I saw a shipyard, a citrus plantation and
attractive hotels that came about through this novel mechanism. I
talked at length with Ibrahim Ferradaz Garcia, the Cabinet minister
charged with closing such deals on behalf of the government. His
official title: minister of foreign investment and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was a child of necessity. The basic concept, and the
human energies that have gone into promoting it, grew out of the
stark realization six years ago that something new must be tried.
Cuba's economy was in a tailspin. But this amazing economic hybrid
had its roots in Cuba's history and its peculiar blend of
resources, as well as its suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, and its 11 million
people represent a third of all those who inhabit the 25 separate
countries, many tiny, that dot the sea. The island, about the size
of Pennsylvania, lies astride the seaward approach to the
continental land mass like a giant salamander sunning itself in the
warm Caribbean breeze. It's little wonder that the spacious natural
harbor snuggled into the curving northwestern shoreline at what is
now Havana attracted European explorers.
</P>
<P>
   Old Spanish forts with lookout turrets on either side of the
harbor's narrow mouth, today historic tourist attractions, once
made the city a defensible refuge from pirates and buccaneers. That
was great for Spanish settlers, but not necessarily for Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   From the systematized annihilation of the native Arawaks by the
followers of Christopher Columbus almost 500 years ago, Cuba's
inhabitants have been at the mercy of foreigners. Only briefly has
the land been free from some form of external domination. It was
the last of Spain's dominions to be relinquished after 50 years of
intermittent popular rebellions and, finally, the U.S. intervention
in 1898.
</P>
<P>
   After the Spanish-American War, Cuba fretted restlessly under
U.S. proprietorship for the first three decades of this century.
The hated Platt Amendment proclaimed America's right to intervene
militarily at will in Cuba's internal affairs. That fact rankled
Cubans, and still does. A playground and watering hole for wealthy
North Americans in the 1940s and '50s, Havana's glamorous hotel row
with its gambling casinos fell hostage to mob figures like Lucky
Lucianno and Meyer Lansky.
</P>
<P>
   After the overthrow of Cuban strongman Fulgencio Batista in
1959, Fidel Castro's confiscation of big properties, the abortive
Bay of Pigs invasion attempt and the abrupt termination of
relations with the United States in early 1961, Cuba became a
heavily dependent economic client of the Soviet Union. Russia
bought Cuban sugar and supplied Soviet oil and machinery at
concessionary prices. When the Soviet bloc began its swift
disintegration in 1989, ``we lost 80 to 85 percent of our market
overnight,'' Ferradaz tells me.
</P>
<P>
   Abandoned by Russia and spurned by the United States, the Cuban
economy declined by a punishing 35 percent during the next four
years. Life, always austere for the typical Cuban, became even
grimmer.
</P>
<P>
   Without established markets for its goods or sources of foreign
investment, without gasoline for its vehicles or Russian
replacements for aging machinery, Cuba was in an economic free
fall. Andres Oppenheimer, prize-winning writer for The Miami
Herald, was sure he saw the end. In January 1992, he foretold it in
his ambitious book, ``Castro's Final Hour.'' The prophecy, however,
was premature.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Cuba began to arrest the desperate downturn. The
economy that year eked out a meager 1 percent growth. With the
vigorous promotion of foreign investments, by 1996 it was growing
at a rate of 7.8 percent. ``Then came the Helms-Burton Act, El Nino
and the financial collapse of markets in Asia,'' says Ferradaz.
Each of these was a blow of hurricane proportions, according to the
trade minister.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's recovery strategy has been to promote tourism, negotiate
joint ventures with foreign investors and find new foreign markets
for Cuba's goods. The three-pronged approach appears to be paying
off.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is starving. Cuba is surviving, though hardly yet
thriving. Life is hard for the average Cuban _ very hard by U.S.
standards. But progress is visible.
</P>
<P>
   The Helms-Burton law, which Congress passed in 1996, not only
tightened the embargo against U.S. trade with Cuba but sought to
intimidate foreign investors through threat of lawsuit. It also
forbade any foreign ship from docking at a U.S. port for 180 days
after it has visited Cuba. This has no doubt retarded Cuba's growth
in trade, but it hasn't stopped it.
</P>
<P>
   For the past several years, Cuba has cultivated the world like
an aggressive chamber of commerce, scouring for business prospects.
Castro himself has resembled a traveling salesman, constantly
promoting good will. He maintained a grueling schedule through the
spring and summer. To Europe, Africa, Latin America, patching up
old enmities and making new friends.
</P>
<P>
   Ferradaz and his ministry have been busy closing deals. Now he
tells me that he believes his country has turned the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has adapted a creative version of state-sponsored
capitalism. To carry out joint ventures with foreign investors, it
created a business corporation named Cubanacan. What makes this
unique, Ferradaz explains, is that Cubanacan has ``11 million
stockholders _ the Cuban people.'' In 1992, he says, ``we had only
50 joint ventures with foreign companies. Today there are 340.''
</P>
<P>
   One-third of these have been consummated in the past two years.
Under a typical agreement, Cuba supplies the land and Cubans the
labor, a foreign private corporation the capital.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   There are several models of cooperative participation. Cuba's
negotiators are flexible. But often Cubanacan retains 51 percent of
the stock, with 49 percent held by the investing company. ``No deal
has taken longer than 60 days,'' boasts Ferradaz, ``from
presentation to this department until final approval by both
partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Firms from Canada, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Holland,
Britain, Russia, Israel, Australia, Brazil, Mexico, Jamaica and
other Latin American countries have embarked with Cuba on such
joint business ventures.
</P>
<P>
   A Dutch shipping company has joined with the Cubans to build a
large commercial ship repair and maintenance facility. Israeli
interests have financed a number of flourishing citrus groves,
selling the harvest in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Rodriguez, a foreign ministry specialist, shows me a
thriving orchard south of Havana. Farther east, he says, the joint
venture, employing Cubans, operates ``the world's largest citrus
plantation.'' Growing oranges, grapefruit and limes, it also is
developing bottling and canning facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Title to the land, I am told, remains with Cubans _ as does a
participating interest in the produce. Commercial citrus groves
help to diversify Cuba's agricultural production, once largely
confined to sugar and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has recently begun two new energy ventures _ one to work
natural gas deposits in eastern Cuba, another for a factory to turn
out bottled LNG (liquefied natural gas). The ministry considers
this development vital to industrial expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime reliance on Russian petroleum had left Cuba's motor
traffic practically immobilized. Now one sees buses again on the
highways. In Havana, taxis are abundant. Private automobiles drive
the city's wide esplanades again. Most of them are decades old.
Vintage 1950s Fords and Chevrolets stand out among smaller but
newer Russian autos. There still aren't nearly enough cars to
convene a traffic jam _ perhaps a mixed blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Most Cubans never expect to afford a new car. Bicycles are
everywhere. There is even a joint venture with Chinese interests
that manufactures bikes locally. They sell for about $2, I'm told.
</P>
<P>
   A colorful common sight along the sea wall and in the narrow
streets of Old Havana is the bicycle taxi. An energetic cyclist
pedals a neat carriage in which two customers sit side by side.
These are functional, cheaper than motor taxis and in demand by
tourists who liken the experience to a Cuban version of the
rickshaw, or a human-powered substitute for the romantic old
one-horse shay.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism grows by leaps, the number of foreign visitors virtually
doubling each year for the past three. Havana is becoming a
convention mecca for international societies of various kinds.
Tourist dollars are fast filling the gap left by abandoned Soviet
subsidies. Aggressive efforts are under way to create facilities,
compatible with Havana's romantic image, to accommodate the wave of
tourists that Cubans expect.
</P>
<P>
   Along the Malecon, a picturesque six-lane highway that runs
beside the sea wall, and in the narrow streets and ancient squares
of La Habana Vieja (the Old Havana), preservation and restoration
projects are everywhere evident. Workmen on scaffold landings work
to rehabilitate historic old native stone and concrete buildings
from the abrasive ravages of sand, sea salt and years of neglect. A
team of architects, working under the direction of city historian
Eusebio Leal Spengler, converts the restored buildings into hotels,
shops and restaurants. Some become office buildings catering to
foreign companies engaged in joint ventures with Cubanacan.
</P>
<P>
   Enter another novel corporation, Habaguanex S.A. Answering to
the city historian, it manages the restored properties. This public
entity is empowered to reinvest profits from its hotels, office
building rents, and restaurant and shop concessions into additional
restoration efforts on other abandoned historic buildings.
</P>
<P>
   In these and other ways, Cuba struggles to attract tourists and
to stay ahead of their advancing numbers. The country officially
welcomes Americans, although its leaders seem to feel a degree of
private ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   ``In no country of the world will the American people be safer
than in Cuba!'' insists Ferradaz. He suppresses a barely detectable
sense of hurt and anger about the U.S. economic embargo and our
tight lid on travel to his island. But Cubans as a people, he
confides, are ``incorrigibly friendly'' to Americans.
</P>
<P>
   After five days of visiting freely with merchants, tourists and
taxi drivers, mixing with informal Cuban crowds in farmers' markets
and youthful patients at a free clinic, talking with waiters and
taxi drivers and workmen at construction sites, I had to agree with
Ferradaz. I came into random contact with a hundred or so private
citizens. Most had little notion of my identity _ I was only an
American. They were uniformly friendly.
</P>
<P>
   They like us personally. But they fear and distrust our
government. They blame it, not Castro, for their economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   As I ponder the number and variety of nations with whose
citizens Cuba has formed joint business ventures, I'm tempted to an
additional conclusion. Castro and other influential Cubans are not
only content but quite happy doing business with a scattered lot of
investors from throughout the world. They prefer a multitude of
medium-sized foreign ventures. They don't want a few giant
corporate megapartners from any single superpower. Yes, they'd love
to have some American investors _ so long as their size and number
don't begin to dominate Cuba's economy.
</P>
<P>
   It's my view, although it was never put to me in just these
words, that Cuba never intends to be dependent again on any one
foreign country _ neither ours nor anyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   Still, contrary to pure socialist theory, Cubans aren't averse
to marketplace economics. Taking a cue from the early success of
the foreign joint ventures, and with the government's blessing,
Cubans are experimenting with a limited form of home-grown
capitalism at the retail level: free-enterprise farmers' markets.
But that's a story in itself.

 &HT;    Archambeau is questionable after surgery to repair thumb
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Falcons defensive end Lester Archambeau had
surgery Sunday night to insert pins in his broken left thumb and
won't know until later in the week whether he can play Sunday at
New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-year veteran was injured in the first half of a 28-21
victory against the Colts. After taking a painkiller and having the
thumb placed in a cast, Archambeau played in the second half,
finishing with a season-low one tackle.
</P>
<P>
   A decision on his status will be made after he tries to
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a possibility he could have some problems,'' coach
Dan Reeves said. ``We probably won't know until Thursday or
Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   Archambeau, who is having the best season of his career, leads
the Falcons (11-2) with a career-high nine sacks and six forced
fumbles. He is fourth on the team with 70 tackles and is tied for
the team lead with two fumble recoveries. He also calls most
adjustments in the defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It affects your grip,'' he said of the broken thumb, ``but
you're still able to hit people. I'll still have some grip. When I
practice some, I'll see how it looks.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Colts driving for a potential tying touchdown Sunday,
Archambeau forced running back Marshall Faulk to fumble on the
second play of the fourth quarter. Defensive end Chuck Smith
recovered at the Atlanta 29-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   If the 6-foot-5, 275-pound Archambeau can't play, he will be
replaced by John Burrough (6-5, 275), who also is bothered by an
injury. Burrough tore a muscle in his right foot during the
preseason and has trouble putting pressure on it. Burrough has 25
tackles and a half-sack this season.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when Archambeau had 66 tackles, 8.5 sacks and five
forced fumbles, he was named to USA Today's ``All-Joe Team,'' which
honors the ``unrecognized, overlooked, and hard-working stiffs'' of
the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Chris Chandler, who missed the Nov. 29 game at St.
Louis with a sprained ankle, limped off the field after the last
play of the game on Sunday, but he's healthy. And reserve
cornerback Randy Fuller, who missed the Colts game with a strained
and bruised shoulder, probably will play against the Saints.

 &HT;    Agents told they'll love new system
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No pain, no gain. Real estate agents complaining about
problems with Metro Listing Service's week-old, Internet-based data
retrieval system were told Monday they will learn to love it.
</P>
<P>
   For several days, users said the system was slow, that it bumped
people off too easily and that it did not give enough information
on existing listings.
</P>
<P>
   Don Lacey _ president of MLS, a service of the DeKalb (Ga.)
Board of Realtors _ defended the innovation and said operator error
was to blame for some of the difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the first multiple listing service in the country to
do this, and we have trained 8,000 people to use it,'' Lacey said,
explaining 4,000 more people still need to take a course to
understand the system.
</P>
<P>
   New features include comprehensive data on real estate listings,
contracts and sales in 19 counties; a five-year history of deed
transfers; data on school systems; and tax digests.
</P>
<P>
   While he acknowledged the new system was overwhelmed with users
when it went online last Tuesday, Lacey said 121,000 people had
used the new system successfully by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lacey said software was rewritten over the weekend, and the
system is moving rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Home buyers and sellers were not significantly affected.
</P>
<P>
   John Anderson of Bob Wood Realty said, ``It is not hurting the
sale of my listings ... but my ability to access the information I
need to function takes longer then I like.''

PARIS WITH TEEN-AGERS  
 THE FINAL FOUR  
 JERSEY SHORE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOSEPH SIANO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics)I will taking about 30 teen-agers to Paris during
their Easter school break, and I have heard that Easter Sunday and
Monday are holidays in France. Can you list a few sites that will
be open those days? And do you know any dance clubs that do not
serve alcohol? _ Daria Price, New Hope, Pa.(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You will find Notre-Dame Cathedral open, so you can apply in
person for sainthood for chaperoning 30 teen-agers. Seriously,
though, the churches of Paris might be a good choice for
sightseeing on Easter Sunday and Monday (April 4 and 5), since many
museums and shops will be closed, although that tradition has been
fading in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Paris tourist office, (33-1) 49.52.53.54, says
the Louvre should be open those days.
</P>
<P>
   You also expressed interest in the city's flea market, the
Marche aux Puces. Good news: It is scheduled to be open Saturday,
Sunday and Monday from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., as usual, although
there may be fewer merchants than normal. The flea market is in
St.-Ouen on the city's north side. Get off at the Porte de
Clignancourt or Garibaldi Metro stop. For a layout of merchants,
try www.les-puces.com.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, your teen-agers can join their Parisian counterparts at
dance parties organized by the Rock 'n' Roll Dance Center,
telephone (33-1) 43.80.90.23. Every Friday at 10 p.m. in the
Gymnase Club Italie, the center holds group lessons in swing
dancing (called rock in French). The students are broken into
beginner, intermediate and advanced groups.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's a regular dance until 2 a.m. Admission is $10 (at
about 5.7 francs to $1), including one soft drink (no alcohol
served). The center also has Sunday-afternoon dances twice a month,
but call to see if Easter is one of them. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics) For my boyfriend's 40th birthday, I want to send
him and a friend to the National Collegiate Athletic Association
men's basketball championships, the famed Final Four. Are there
companies offering trips to the Final Four with game tickets? _
Patricia Brigantic, New York, N.Y.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Your boyfriend is a lucky guy. But you have to shop carefully
or you might not be a lucky consumer. Trips to major sports events
like the Super Bowl and Final Four that are advertised as including
tickets to the event are always risky, because demand is so high
and ticket sources for tour operators are never completely
reliable.
</P>
<P>
   Look for an operator who has a long track record, which
indicates reliability in getting tickets. And ask for a written
guarantee, if possible. Buying these trips through a travel agent
adds a layer of protection.
</P>
<P>
   But you are more fortunate than usual because the 1999 Final
Four, scheduled for March 27 and 29, will be held at Tropicana
Field in St. Petersburg, Fla. This is normally a baseball stadium,
which means that many thousands more seats will be available than
in a typical basketball arena, which seats about 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The disadvantage is that many seats along two of the basketball
court's four sides are much farther away from the action, and the
price of these packages rises sharply the closer the seats are.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Erban, owner of Creative Charters, (888) 612-0323, which
can arrange customized trips to the Final Four, says that game
tickets are expensive because they pass through several middlemen.
This year, seats will typically cost $300 to $2,000 each, Erban
said, and the cheapest three-day packages should be around $800 a
person.
</P>
<P>
   Here are other tour operators that are selling trips to the 1999
Final Four. In both cases, air fare is extra and you should book
through a travel agent.
</P>
<P>
   Professional Sports Travel, (800) 846-8687. It has three- and
four-night packages with tickets to the semifinals and the final,
daily breakfast, an Alamo rental car and lodging at the Ramada Inn
Gulfview.
</P>
<P>
   Cost per person: $1,207 for three nights, $1,360 for four
nights, double occupancy. Deduct $120 to $160 per room if your
boyfriend and his buddy share the rental car. Tickets are in the
upper deck, behind one of the baskets; upgrades available at extra
cost.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Empire, (800) 255-5258. Its four-night packages start at
$1,695 a person, double occupancy, and include tickets to the
semifinals and final, a rental car and accommodations at the
Holiday Inn Sunspree. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)We have spent summers at the Duck area of the Outer
Banks of North Carolina. But with traffic worsening each year, we
want a getaway closer to home. Do any towns along the southern
Jersey Shore offer similar facilities, namely more rental homes
than hotels, fishing, golf and no casinos? _ Allan G. Fletcher,
Stamford, Conn.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. There are some quiet towns along the southern Jersey Shore,
but only in the relative sense. Don't expect beachfront homes that
are not within shouting distance of one another.
</P>
<P>
   The Jersey Shore is fairly well built up. And traffic along the
main highway to the shore, the Garden State Parkway, is pretty bad
on summer weekends.
</P>
<P>
   But you will be much closer to home, and if you can leave on a
Saturday morning and return early Sunday afternoon, traffic should
not be too terrible. Gambling, restricted to Atlantic City, isn't a
real intrusion in these towns.
</P>
<P>
   The ones you might want to consider are Avalon, Ocean City,
Stone Harbor, Strathmere, Sea Isle City and Cape May Point. A quick
survey of real-estate agencies indicated that you can expect to pay
$600 a week and up for a home rental in summer, with $1,200 to
$1,700 more likely.
</P>
<P>
   Each town has its quirks. Homeowners in Avalon and Stone Harbor
are said to prefer long-term rentals, sometimes a month or more in
the summer. Ocean City is dry _ you can't even take wine to a
restaurant _ and it has some small amusement piers so it gets busy
in summer.
</P>
<P>
   Cape May Point is a quiet enclave beyond the bustling Victorian
community of Cape May. For a list of real-estate agencies in each
town that specialize in summer home rentals, call the Cape May
County Office of Tourism at (609) 465-7181. As for fishing, you'll
find charter boats along the road from the end of the Garden State
Parkway to the center of Cape May.
</P>
<P>
   Recommended golf courses include Avalon Golf Club, 1510 Route 9
North, Cape May Court House; (800) 643-4766, and Cape May National
Golf Club, Route 9 and Florence Avenue, Cape May, (609) 884-1563. &QL;

LOOKING FOR `TITANIC'? YOU'RE IN THE WRONG VIDEO STORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Asian shelf of Facets Multimedia, an
unprepossessing, cellar-dwelling video store here, has 14 different
films by Akira Kurosawa. The Eastern Europe shelf has ``Loves of a
Blonde,'' an early comedy by the Czechoslovak-born director Milos
Forman, though his most recent work in this country, ``The People
vs. Larry Flynt,'' is not in evidence, even on the American shelf.
(Turns out it's in stock, just not displayed.) There's a section
marked simply ``noir,'' another devoted to animation, a third to
gay and lesbian films.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try not to organize things by `drama,' `action' and
`romance,''' said Milos Stehlik, the proprietor, dryly synopsizing
the difference between Facets and, say, Blockbuster. Specializing
in foreign, independent and hard-to-find classic films, Facets is
the country's largest video-rental business to eschew the product
of contemporary Hollywood. It has 17,000 titles available for rent,
and 35,000 for sale, and not one of them is called ``Total Recall''
or ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole store defined by the fact that these are videos
you can't get anywhere else,'' said Roger Ebert, the film critic of
The Chicago Sun Times who is featured with Gene Siskel on the
television show ``At the Movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Other video distributors specialize in art films, ``but Milos
has the biggest collection,'' Ebert said. ``In foreign films he's
got real depth. Not just French or Japanese, but films from Senegal
or Indonesia or Malaysia. Experimental films, silent films.
Underground films, as they used to be called. If you can't find it
at Facets, chances are you can't find it. He's really making a
difference, on a national, even a worldwide, level.''
</P>
<P>
   To support its video business, Facets publishes a remarkable
array of catalogs, some sold in book form: One lists gay and
lesbian films on video, another, African-American videos. But many
of its other publications are available free, like the Movie Lovers
Video Guide, with its bright red cover and its inviting and
informative array of lists (``100 Best Love Stories,'' ``50 Films
About Art and Artists,'' ``25 Great War Films,'' ``100 Super Kids
Movies'').
</P>
<P>
   A good part of the business is by mail. Martin Scorsese and John
Sayles are regular mail-order customers, Stehlik said. ``And we get
a lot of people who, for some reason, are stuck in small towns.''
</P>
<P>
   The shopworn quarters are a haunt for film scholars, university
professors, ardent hobbyists and insomniacs who linger in front of
a black-and-white television set. The place is a treasure trove,
and at a time when video is increasingly the only cost-effective
way for many films to be preserved and shown, Facets is an archive,
full of forgotten, undermarketed and underappreciated work that has
been outshouted by commercial movie making.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what we carry is out of print,'' Stehlik said. ``More
and more, we're a last resort.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there's a rescue aspect to Stehlik's business. For
example, consider ``Le Feu Follet'' (``The Fire Within''), a 1962
film by Louis Malle about an alcoholic contemplating suicide. ``A
wonderful film,'' Stehlik said, ``with a really haunting,
convincing portrayal of alcoholism by Maurice Ronet.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's relatively obscure, to be sure, even to film
enthusiasts familiar with Malle's better-known films, including
``Murmur of the Heart'' and ``Atlantic City.'' And members of
Malle's family have pulled it from distribution, along with some
others, to await the publication of a biography that they hope will
stimulate interest in his work.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing this, Stehlik bought the extant video copies of the film
from the family's American distributor, New Yorker Films. All 203
of them. ``That's it, in the country, right now,'' Stehlik said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Talbot, president of New Yorker, called Stehlik ``the Rolls
Royce of video.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's wonderful and important; he's a savior of film,'' Talbot
said. ``It's astonishing what that fellow has put together and made
available for people who love film.''
</P>
<P>
   The video business is now the driving force behind Facets, but
it didn't start out that way. Upstairs from the video store is a
125-seat theater where Facets shows 16-millimeter films, often to
tiny audiences, and a 35-seat video screening room used for film
classes taught by local graduate students. An empty front room was
once a live performance space; Stehlik's partner, Nicole Dreiske,
ran a theater company there until 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little temple of cinema over there,'' Ebert said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Stehlik, who is 49, has a story that itself seems worthy of an
independent film. A trim blond man with an amused but
undemonstrative manner (he could be a character in a deadpan drama
made by, say, Louis Malle), he was born in Slany, just outside of
Prague. When he was born, his father was in Germany. Before he
could return, the Communists closed the borders, and it was 12
years before his mother could secure passports for herself and her
son.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961 they went to Australia, where his father had emigrated.
But by the time they arrived, he had already moved on to Chicago,
where he was working as an electrical designer. It was another year
before the family was reunited.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '60s Stehlik began frequenting the Clark Theater
here, which offered a daily double feature. ``Foreign films,''
Stehlik said. ``Continuous shows, till 3 in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   He saw films like ``Jules and Jim,'' ``Black Orpheus'' and
``Greed'' for the first time, and ``Shop on Main Street,'' by the
Czechoslovak filmmaker Jan Kadar, who would become a mentor and
friend.
</P>
<P>
   When, with a partner, he opened a used-book store, he held
screenings there. When the bookstore went out of business, he
started a foreign film series in a tiny theater in the Lincoln Park
section of Chicago. The screen was a bedsheet.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he joined one of the theater's directors, Ms.
Dreiske, in opening Facets, whose mission was to present both live
theater and films of the sort that couldn't be seen anywhere else
in Chicago. (They married and later divorced, but their business
partnership has survived.)
</P>
<P>
   The company's home was an unused Lutheran church where the
audience sat in pews. The films were projected from the choir loft,
and the screen was put up where the altar had been. Forced to move
when the Lutherans sold the church, they found their current
quarters, a West Side printing plant, in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   It was the dawn of the video business, but with considerable
trepidation _ and with the encouragement of Ebert, who assured him
them that video was the future of film viewing _ Facets bought 140
videocassettes from a distributor. ``We taped the boxes to the
lobby wall with Velcro, and whenever someone wanted to rent a tape,
the film projectionist would run downstairs and get it,'' Stehlik
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Facets now buys videotapes from 1,100 different manufacturers,
rents 68,000 a year and sells 150,000 more. The company has
recently entered the licensing business, buying the rights to
produce and distribute the videos of some 200 films, mostly
contemporary foreign titles.
</P>
<P>
   That's some assurance that the works won't disappear or become
inaccessible. ``I like to think,'' Stehlik said, ``that having the
works of Bergman or Ozu on your video shelf is becoming the
equivalent of having works by Joyce or Dickens on your bookshelf.''

MURPHY ELECTED TEAMSTERS VP IN EAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A labor official whose digging unearthed a Teamsters
campaign finance scandal last year that rocked the 1.4
million-member union has been elected vice president of the eastern
region.
</P>
<P>
   John Murphy, 50, a business agent at Teamsters Local 122 in
South Boston, received 61,851 votes in an election that catapulted
Detroit lawyer James P. Hoffa into the union presidency. In all,
420,000 union members, approximately 31 percent of the membership,
returned postage-paid mail ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy's election resulted in the ouster of George Cashman as
vice president of the eastern region. Cashman, who ran as an
independent, received 7,491 votes. Cashman remains president of
Teamsters Local 25 in Charlestown, and also heads Teamsters Joint
Council 10.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman was in a meeting Monday and could not be reached to
comment. Murphy, who monitored the vote count in Washingto over the
weekend, also was unavailable, a campaign spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   University of Massachusetts at Amherst labor historian Thomas
Juravich said Monday it was still too early to say how the change
in leadership would affect the union locally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hoffa has not actually articulated his goals,'' said Juravich.
``So, we still do not know what to expect. He has said that he
would like to return the Teamsters to the days of local control.
What does that mean for union members here? It's still too early to
tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Said James Green, a labor professor at UMass-Amherst: ``John
Murphy appealed to the sentiment of having the union be a new kind
of organization _ aggressive and democratic. He has been involved
in a lot of progressive activities around Boston, and I think
members remembered that. The union that past presidents presided
over is a very different union.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Cashman indicated an interest in running for the
presidency on a unity slate that would bring the Teamsters' various
factions together. Choosing not to support either of the candidates
for president, Cashman ran as an independent. Ironically, his local
voted overwhelmingly for Thomas W. Leedham, a reform candidate who
heads the union's 400,000-member warehouse division.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, a longtime supporter of Hoffa, son of former Teamsters
president James Riddle Hoffa, used amateur detective work to ferret
out information that plunged the union into turmoil. For days, the
feisty union official pored through campaign donation documents in
a stuffy room in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When he opened a file at the bottom of the pile, he knew he had
reached something big: The document contained information about a
committee that had donated more than $200,000 to the re-election
campaign of former Teamsters president Ron Carey in the final weeks
before the election.
</P>
<P>
   After a little more digging, Murphy discovered that $95,000 in
illegal donations had been made by the wife of Michael Ansara,
owner of the Somerville, Mass. company whose telephone bank had
helped Carey aides get out the vote. The trouble was, Murphy said,
it was illegal for an employer or his relatives to contribute to a
candidate's campaign. Moreover, Ansara's wife, Barbara Arnold, was
listed as a college student.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just decided to break the pattern,'' Murphy said in a 1997
interview with The Boston Globe. ``I don't know why I did it. I
just went to the bottom of the pile and pulled (the file) out.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, evidence emerged that nearly $1 million in union funds had
been diverted to the Carey campaign. The scandal dealt a blow to
the union's reform movement, and Carey was expelled from the union
in July.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy was a leader of an aggressive campaign against a major
brewery that wanted to distribute beer with nonunion drivers. ``He
had a highly visible campaign, and it was successful,'' noted
UMass' Green.
</P>
<P>
   A former student activist who worked closely with a campaign to
free the Black Panthers, Murphy had lost an earlier bid for union
regional vice president on the Hoffa ticket to Cashman, a moderate
who had supported Carey in the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the people who put Ron Carey in office, this may seem like
a setback,'' Green said of the election results and Hoffa's
victory. ``But I think the union is at a crossroads. It still
remains to be seen what will happen. The real question is whether
local fiefdoms will regain power and not be accountable to any
national agenda or whether we will see the continuation of a large
national union.''

ON AMTRAK, FULL SPEED AHEAD  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amtrak is pleased with itself this fall. It considered
Thanksgiving week, usually its heaviest travel period of the year,
a success, apparently with a record rider total _ the figures were
still being added last week. And on the Monday after the holiday
weekend, it dedicated two more of its fancy new trains in the
Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Just before that, it reported that its passenger total increased
by a million in the year that ended in September, a rise of 4.5
percent, the biggest jump in a decade. Revenues also topped $1
billion for the first time since Congress created Amtrak 27 years
ago. What's going on?
</P>
<P>
   Quite a bit, according to officials at the railroad, which is
struggling to meet its mandate of self-sufficiency by 2002. It is
not there yet: for the coming year, Congress put $609 million into
the budget to help Amtrak meet its deficits; this does not count a
special item of $40 million to convert New York's General Post
Office into an Amtrak concourse to supplement Penn Station.
</P>
<P>
   One cause of the increase in ridership is the same thing that is
sending hotel occupancies and flights up the charts: in a better
economy, people travel more. John Wolf, a spokesman for Amtrak,
said that the railroad had not yet studied the demographics.
</P>
<P>
   So the line does not know if the graying of America, which is
producing more people who cannot fly for health reasons or will not
fly for psychological reasons, has had a major effect, or if the
baby-boomers' taste for travel with their children is a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf says that the increase in riders is across the board and
has no geographic center, with the heavily traveled corridors, the
long-distance services like the Empire Builder from Chicago to
Seattle, even the sparser trains in the middle of the country, all
showing rises.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some of those riders are less than thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   The Ralph W. Richardsons of Lewes, Del., represent two new but
disillusioned riders. They took a train trip to California in
September and back in October rather than fly. The problems,
Richardson said, ranged from difficulty in making reservations to
misinformation on bathroom locations to monotonous desserts. ``We
doubt we will use Amtrak again for long trips,'' Richardson wrote
to Amtrak, with a copy to The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that passengers making shorter trips find things
easier; interviews in Penn Station in New York early this month
found people reasonably satisfied with the service.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Lawrence of Brooklyn, who recently discovered club class
travel, was heading for Providence to see her daughter. She was
sitting in the first-class lounge, drinking coffee, and in a
cheerful mood. She said an earlier club car trip on the Empire
Service to Rochester convinced her the money was worth it. ``I like
the leg room, and I will get breakfast and lunch as part of the
ticket,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another passenger, Barbara Lieberman, who had lined up for the
Adirondack to go to Rhinecliff, N.Y., laughed when asked about the
service. On her last trip, she said, she ordered her tickets by
mail and the line sent someone else's ticket. This time, she said,
they got it right the first time. ``But they were pleasant about
it,'' she said. ``They are always pleasant.''
</P>
<P>
   Two women from Boston, old friends who came to New York on a
Saturday and were returning on Wednesday, said they were delighted
to have the travel time together. ``We chatted the whole five
hours,'' said one of them, Helene Hoffrichter.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hoffrichter and her friend, who did not want to give her
name, said that with trips to and from airports, the air shuttle
was not much faster, and it was certainly ``very expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   While Amtrak fares for the rest of the country are priced by
yield-management, meaning they fluctuate with demand, the fares in
the Northeast corridor are predictable. In unreserved coach,
Boston-New York costs $45 one way, except between 11 a.m. and 11
p.m. Fridays and Sundays, when the fare is $54. Between Washington
and New York, the unreserved coach fare is $62 except for the
Friday-Sunday periods, when it is $77. A one-way Metroliner club
car ticket is $107.
</P>
<P>
   During the week, Delta and US Airways charge walk-up passengers
$202 one way between La Guardia and Logan, in Boston, or Ronald
Reagan Airport, in Washington; on weekends the fare is $90 until
early Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   One change Amtrak has made is to restore daily or five-day
schedules for those trains it has kept, instead of limiting service
to, say, three days a week. The City of New Orleans linking Chicago
and the Crescent City, which in 1995 indeed had the disappearing
railroad blues, is now back in daily service.
</P>
<P>
   The California Zephyr, likewise squeezed, is making its way
daily in each direction between Chicago and Emeryville, Calif.,
near San Franciso. The Mohawk between New York and Niagara Falls,
N.Y., was restored to daily service westbound and Monday to
Saturday eastbound, after three years of running only four days a
week
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Daily service is not universal: the 60-hour trip on the Sunset
Limited between Disneyland and Disney World _ Los Angeles and
Orlando _ operates three days a week in each direction. And many
cities have only bus links to trains. But Amtrak has found that if
people use a train, daily service brings a marked increase in
riders.
</P>
<P>
   Analysis of its markets and consistency are two of Amtrak's
basic projects, Wolf said. A third is the development of faster
service in the major corridors. In the Pacific Northwest, the new
Talgo trains are going into service on the Cascades routes between
Vancouver, British Columbia, and Eugene, Ore., via Seattle and
Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   The Mount Baker, the Mount Hood and the Mount Rainier have been
bought for this project, replacing leased equipment. They make the
Portland-Seattle run in three and a half hours instead of the usual
four and a half.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast project, which requires changing the power between
New Haven and Boston to electricity from diesel, is due for
completion next summer. When new trains go into service, the
231-mile trip between New York and Boston should be reduced to
three hours from five, Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
   If the three hours works out, it would put the Boston-New York
run on a par with the New York-Washington run of 226 miles, covered
in three hours on the extra-fare Metroliner.
</P>
<P>
   R. Clifford Black IV, the line's director of public affairs,
said extra-fare trains would be added east of New York City when
the new service began. It has not been decided, he said, if
passengers will be able to remain aboard for the whole route _
Union Station, Washington, to South Station, Boston.
</P>
<P>
   A constant sticking point on the New Haven-Boston route has been
the grade crossings. Warren B. Flatau, of the Federal Railroad
Administration, says there are 13 on the route, 12 of them in
Connecticut. These require the trains to slow up, and there have
been political struggles concerning railroad speed and local
safety.
</P>
<P>
   The government, with the help of the Connecticut Department of
Transportation and Amtrak, last summer installed a test gate in
West Mystic, Conn. This closes off four lanes of traffic. In
addition, there are treadles on the spot where the road crosses the
tracks, which send signals to the engineer if there is something on
the right of way, in which case the train slows to 20 miles an
hour. The gate cost $1 million, with the government paying most of
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a steady reduction in car-train fatalities in the
country. In 1997, there were 461 deaths at grade crossings
nationwide; in '96 the figure was 488, and in '95, 579.
</P>
<P>
   In other areas of the Northeast, the popular Clocker trains
between Philadelphia and New York, and the Keystone service in
Pennsylvania, were not meeting demand, which had risen more than 10
percent; trains have now been added.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak is also trying to stay in better touch with its potential
riders, with training and new telephone systems. Wolf said it put
callers to its information and reservation number, (800) 872-7245,
on hold for an average of 41 seconds in the last fiscal year,
compared with 55 seconds in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A new phone center is in place in Riverside, Calif., joining one
in Chicago. Another is on the way in Philadelphia. The people who
answer phones are being trained to deal more effectively with
callers.
</P>
<P>
   The line's Web site, www.amtrak.com, was overhauled, Wolf said,
because it was ``difficult to navigate.'' October was the first
full month of the new operation. The Web site is handling a lot of
sales: in the year ended September 1997, 4,000 tickets were sold
online; in the year just ended, 16,000 were sold.
</P>
<P>
   The food service has also been looked at, Wolf said. New menus
were put on the Northeast corridor in November, and plastic cards
have been placed in seat pockets to advertise what can be bought at
the cafe car counter; four wrap sandwiches and a pastrami on
marbleized rye bread are among the offerings. What else? ``We're
refurbishing our equipment and stations,'' he added. ``We want to
revitalize our brand, change the way people think about us.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Richardsons' letter, sent Oct. 25, had not been
answered by Dec. 7.

LIBERALS PREVAIL OVER VIOLENCE, DIRTY TRICKS IN ST. PETERSBURG
VOTING
</HEADLINE>
   (rl) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ After a sordid campaign overshadowed by the killing
last month of a leading liberal politician, the citizens of St.
Petersburg, Russia's second largest city, voted in record numbers
on Sunday, and the preliminary results released Monday indicated
that they had improved the fortunes of the city's embattled
democratic alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The assassination on Nov. 20 of Galina Starovoitova, a national
democratic politician with a strong following in her native St.
Petersburg, drew special attention to these city council elections.
They had already been widely seen as a crude attempt by murky
criminal and commercial forces to stake out more turf in city
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently spurred by outrage over the killing, more than 40
percent of the city's voters cast ballots in a first round of
voting, compared with 14 percent in the last local election. The
turnout and the results sent a signal that St. Petersburg, once
capital of the Russian empire, is not ready to relinquish its claim
as a bastion of progressive politics.
</P>
<P>
   The elections were to fill the 50 city council seats, and only
candidates with 50 percent or more of the vote won a seat outright
in this round. In districts with no winner, the top two
vote-getters will compete in a runoff on Dec. 20.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest winner on Sunday was Yabloko, a liberal party led by
a presidential aspirant, Grigory Yavlinsky, whose candidates in 24
districts scored well enough to move to the final round. Of the six
outright winners, all incumbents, one was a Yabloko candidate, and
two belonged to smaller democratic parties.
</P>
<P>
   Yavlinsky, in an interview in Moscow Monday, said the results
were proof that Russian voters had not given up on liberal
democratic ideals, even at a time of economic distress and
political uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, people are ready to vote for democracy still,''
Yavlinsky said. ``Second, people are ready to come to vote. But my
third main point is that we can win speaking about human rights,
open society, private property, competition, freedom _ we can win.
This is a very good conclusion during this crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Petersburg, with a population of 5 million, is not
representative of all Russia. But for all its graceful 18th- and
19th-century architecture and its proud past, it is in fact a
working-class city, with local industry deeply imbedded in the old
Soviet military-industrial complex.
</P>
<P>
   The elections here were closely watched as a test of competing
political forces after the devastating financial crisis in August
and the political convulsions that followed.
</P>
<P>
   The elections included some of the dirtiest campaign tactics yet
seen in Russia, directed mainly against democratic and liberal
candidates. Some of those candidates found themselves confronted
with opponents bearing the same names, fielded with the obvious
intention of confounding the voters. In one case, the ``twin''
admitted publicly that he had been paid $900 to run.
</P>
<P>
   Yabloko, which has long considered St. Petersburg its
stronghold, was even opposed by a party that called itself
Yabloko-St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   These tricks _ some of them traced to a campaign consultant with
links to the local governor _ were seen as tied to the violence
that has infected public life in the city, bringing attacks not
only on Mrs. Starovoitova but also on several other public figures
in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians of all persuasions hailed the results as proof that
voters were wiser than the tricksters. Yuri Boldyrev, a former ally
of Yavlinsky whose own party placed 18 candidates on the
second-round ballots, said a majority had voted for ``political
forces that, as a minimum, had declared the necessity of putting
power under the control and returning responsibility to the
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary figures from the city electoral
commission, about 50 democrats from various parties _ including
five independents _ will advance to the second round, and the
democratic parties have agreed to join forces. This means that
voters in most districts will have a real choice in the runoff.
</P>
<P>
   According to the preliminary report, only 15 Communists
qualified for the runoff, confirming the Communist Party's
traditionally low standing in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The electoral commission said that results from early voting at
one polling place, the equivalent of absentee balloting, had been
annulled after some voters were found to have voted twice.

CONSENSUS IN SHORT SUPPLY ON EVE OF SOCIAL SECURITY CONFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as his legal team heads to Capitol Hill to
present his defense against impeachment, President Clinton will
open a two-day conference on Tuesday morning with an appeal for
bipartisanship in shoring up Social Security, a goal that would be
a stretch in the most tranquil of political climates.
</P>
<P>
   That this of all weeks is the one bringing together Republicans
and Democrats to deal with so highly charged an issue is just one
of the complications facing the effort to strengthen Social
Security, which will otherwise run short of money as the baby boom
generation retires in coming decades.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are fighting with Democrats over whether they would be
repudiating their most deeply held values if they supported a
revamped system under which individuals would save and invest for
their own retirement. Clinton, who is hinting that he might support
individual-account plans, has to keep an eye both on his own
political survival and on how the outcome of the Social Security
debate could affect Vice President Al Gore's presidential
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the deeply ingrained and well-justified fear among
Republicans, nearly all of whom favor individual accounts, that
Democrats will find a way to bludgeon them with the issue, as they
have so often in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The administration was advised over the past year by House
Speaker Newt Gingrich not to make a specific proposal, saying that
to do so would draw so much partisan fire that the effort to find a
compromise would founder. But with Gingrich stepping down,
Republican leaders are ratcheting up the pressure on Clinton to put
forward his own detailed plan, saying it is up to him to lead on an
issue that will almost certainly require politically painful
benefit cuts and tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to have to show some courage,'' Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the
Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has managed to reach compromises with the
Republican-controlled Congress on big ideological issues like
balancing the budget. In this case, though, his own party could be
a problem. Some prominent Democrats are bucking their party's
orthodoxy to argue that individual accounts would allow even
low-income workers the opportunity to build wealth in the financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no more Democratic idea than building a generation of
wealthy Americans who participate in our economy rather than
feeling isolated from it,'' said Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, one
of the Democrats supporting private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech last week, though, Kerrey warned that those who
advocated changing the current system would draw considerable fire
from the left. Two days later, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, one of many
liberal leaders who have banded together to oppose individual
accounts, suggested that he would mobilize against fellow Democrats
as quickly as he would take on Republicans over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats ``argue that we must dare to privatize Social
Security, that it takes courage to choose moneyed interests over
the common good,'' Jackson said. ``There are adjectives for that
choice, but courage is not one of them.''

<P>
   For Clinton, Social Security is probably a last chance to leave
a lasting legacy on domestic policy. Yet Democrats think they can
recapture the House in 2000, and some liberals would like to keep
Social Security alive as an issue to use against the Republicans.
Many of the groups that helped Clinton and the Democrats in this
year's congressional elections, including organized labor and
liberal black groups, are dead set against private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Should Clinton endorse private accounts _ and Republicans say he
must if he hopes to get legislation through Congress _ then he
might hand Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic
leader, an ideal opportunity to rally support from the left to
challenge Gore for the presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have their own reasons for wanting to get a deal
done. They would like to neutralize the issue before the 2000
election, and to move on to their tax-cutting agenda, which Clinton
has thwarted for the last year by declaring a need to preserve
projected federal budget surpluses until Social Security's problems
are addressed.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans have yet to agree among themselves on the best
way to finance individual accounts. Some of them argue that painful
steps can be avoided through use of the budget surplus, but others
say tax increases and benefit cuts will be necessary to keep the
system solvent in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides understand the limits of bipartisanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see this happen,'' Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas,
chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, told a news conference
Monday, repeating his desire to work closely with Clinton as both
of their careers in elected office draw to a close. ``This is my
last two years in Congress; it is his last two years as president.
I would like both of us to be able to leave Washington having saved
Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   A reporter quickly asked Archer if that meant Clinton should not
be impeached until Social Security is saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' Archer said, ``is another issue.''

FLORIDA MAN TRYING TO SELL MOON ROCK LANDS IN TROUBLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By TONY FREEMANTLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A tiny piece of the lunar surface presented in friendship by the
United States to the people of Honduras 25 years ago has landed a
South Florida man in what could be a heap of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Rosen of Aventura, north of Miami Beach, doesn't yet know
for sure _ it all depends on how he came to acquire the moon pebble
and how it came back into this country _ but for now the specimen
he unwittingly tried to sell to U.S. Customs agents for $5 million
in October is in government custody.
</P>
<P>
   Customs agents announced the seizure of the moon rock Monday at
a press conference in Miami, claiming it was the first case of its
kind in U.S. history. The chip of rock, which weighs 1.1 grams, was
picked up from the Taurus Littrow Valley of the moon in December
1972 during the Apollo 17 mission, the last U.S. flight to the
moon.
</P>
<P>
   Raphael G. Lopez, the Custom Services' special agent in charge
of the South Florida office, said the specimen was seized Nov. 18
at an Aventura bank after several meetings with Rosen during which
the transaction was discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said the seizure was the outcome of an operation called
``Operation Lunar Eclipse'' that was launched in September and
which was intended to snag people dealing in bogus moon rocks.
Agents from NASA's Office of the Inspector General and from the
U.S. Postal Inspection Service established a fake business in
Houston called John's Estate Sales and began placing ads in a
national newspaper saying they were looking to buy moon rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of September a man identified as Alan Rosen
called John's Estate Sales and left a message saying: ``I think I
have something you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus began two months of meetings and phone calls between the
agents and Rosen, whom Lopez would only define as being in his
early 60s and as a person who was ``involved in art deals.''
</P>
<P>
   When it became clear what the moon rock in question was worth
and that it had, at some point, come into the United States from
Honduras, the Customs Service was called in to determine if customs
laws had been violated.
</P>
<P>
   The piece of moon rock has been tested at the Johnson Space
Center in Houston and has been declared authentic by NASA
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   No more than half an inch long, the pebble was mounted on a
piece of black maple and presented to Honduras by President Nixon.
On the plaque was a description of where the specimen was gathered
and a warm greeting to the people of Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   The plaque was found in Rosen's car, but the inscription had
been changed to identify the specimen as merely a worthless sample
from a Honduran mine.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said that Rosen was never taken into custody, but that
smuggling charges could be filed against him if it is determined
that he brought the specimen into the country. Other than that,
there is nothing illegal about possessing a piece of moon rock.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen, who could not be reached for comment, apparently has told
investigators that he purchased the sample from a Honduran military
officer. Lopez said Rosen has provided conflicting accounts of who
brought the rock into the U.S. and the investigation continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still looking at what other parties are involved,''
said the Customs agent. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry is changing his Washington chief of staff
and looking for new legislative and communications directors in a
reorganization being conducted with the help of his wife, Teresa
Heinz.
</P>
<P>
   The moves come as Kerry continues to consider making a
presidential bid. Monday, on NBC's ``Today'' show, Kerry said he
might set up an exploratory committee in the coming weeks as he
makes up his mind about whether to run.
</P>
<P>
   Helen R. Kanovsky, who was hired as Kerry's chief of staff about
a year ago, confirmed she is leaving the post but said she may stay
on with Kerry in some other position.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Kerry's staff, Kanovsky was general counsel for
the AFL-CIO Housing Investment Trust, headed by former Boston
Redevelopment Authority director Stephen Coyle.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Lewis, Heinz's chief of staff for the Pittsburgh-based
Heinz Family Foundation, called Kanovsky and suggested she move on,
according to people close to Kerry's office. It wasn't the first
time Heinz's office was involved in personnel matters in Kerry's
office. Last year, Kerry hired Richard Breyers, a former press
secretary and legislative director to the late Republican Senator
John Heinz, to work as his legislative counsel. Breyers has since
left Kerry's employ.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Kerry dismissed suggestions that his office was
in upheaval. He said he has been slowly and steadily working to
improve his operations over many months. He said he wants to bring
in a communications director, create a policy director position,
and name a new legislative director.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry declined to discuss his plans for Kanovsky, saying they
should be private.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a terrific, capable person who's done an outstanding job
for me in ways I want to continue to utilize,'' Kerry said. ``The
discussion between us is personal and I don't feel I need to share
it publicly.''

RENO WON'T APPOINT CLINTON FUND-RAISING PROBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno Monday decided not to
seek an independent counsel to investigate President Clinton's 1996
fund-raising practices, finding that the president did not intend
to violate campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Reno made her decision despite a finding last week by Federal
Election Commission auditors that both the Clinton and Dole
campaigns engaged in massive violations of campaign finance laws by
illegally coordinating ads with their political parties. She also
overruled recommendations from FBI Director Louis Freeh and a
former top Justice Department official, Charles LaBella.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find by clear and convincing evidence a lack of knowing and
willful criminal intent required for criminal prosecution,'' Reno
said in a written decision.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was the question of whether Clinton engaged in a scheme
to get around the federal limit on campaign spending by
coordinating ads with the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Reno reasoned that Clinton and Vice President Al Gore were
advised by their lawyers that the DNC ads were legal, and thus they
did not knowingly violate the law. She said she was making no
judgment about whether the Clinton campaign should have been able
to go beyond the federal spending limits, as the FEC audit
indicated. Nonetheless, she noted that FEC commissioners said at a
hearing last week the law was ``fuzzy'' and ``hardly clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocacy groups such as Common Cause promptly condemned the
decision, saying it will ensure that future presidential campaigns
employ the same loophole to get around spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision effectively makes the spending limits
meaningless,'' Common Cause executive vice president Don Simon
said. ``That sets a terrible standard for the next presidential
campaign in which you can take public money, take a pledge to abide
by public spending limits, but not take it seriously because there
is an easy scam to get around them.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Dan Burton of Indiana, a Republican who oversaw a
fund-raising investigation by the House Government Reform and
Oversight Committee, said Reno's decision marked ``another sad day
for the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it deplorable that she seems to have placed the
president above the law,'' Burton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   While the White House was relieved at Reno's decision, the
official reaction was brief and low-key because it came just as
Clinton faces House impeachment hearings focusing on his
relationship with former intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we have been saying throughout this process, the president
and the Clinton-Gore campaign observed the spirit and the letter of
the law, and we are pleased by this decision,'' said White House
spokesman Jim Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1996 campaign, Clinton agreed to spending limits in
the primary and general elections in exchange for millions of
dollars of public matching funds. But several investigations,
including those conducted by the FEC auditors and the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee, found that Clinton worked with the
DNC to air advertisements boosting his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Those ads, many of them nearly identical to Clinton campaign
commercials, were paid for with unregulated and unlimited
contributions known as ``soft money.'' The DNC spent about $46
million on the ads, according to some reports. The Democratic
committee defended the commercials as generic party-building ads
because they did not call for the election or defeat of specific
candidates, although many of them blasted action by Dole and hailed
decisions by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The DNC funding of the ads helped the Clinton campaign get
around campaign laws that limit individual contributions to $1,000
per election cycle. The same person who gave $1,000 to the Clinton
campaign could give an unlimited amount to the DNC, which used the
money to produce the campaign-style ads.
</P>
<P>
   While many Republicans have long called for the appointment of
an independent counsel in the case, the GOP was in an awkward
position because FEC auditors found that the Dole campaign broke
the law in the same manner as the Clinton campaign. Indeed, the FEC
auditors said the Dole campaign should repay the Treasury $17.7
million for its violations, compared to $7.5 million for the
Clinton campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Reno stressed that her decision Monday did not end the
department's separate probe into a variety of allegations that
campaign finance laws were broken. ``Today's determination only
ends our probe into whether issue ads paid for by the Democratic
National Committee violated federal criminal statutes,'' she said.
``It does not end our vigorous investigation into allegations of
illegal activity surrounding the 1996 elections.''

HONDURAS BRACES FOR DISEASE THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras _ Six weeks ago, it was the violent winds
and torrential rains of Hurricane Mitch that sent millions in this
country running for shelter. Then came the grisly task of digging
out bodies and counting displaced families.
</P>
<P>
   Now, this small, impoverished Central American country is
battling an array of deadly diseases and infections that could kill
as many people, officials say, as the storm itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Honduran government issued a national state of alert Friday
because of epidemics following the hurricane. As many as 20,000
cases of cholera have been confirmed, the government says. More
than 30,000 people are suffering from malaria and another 208,000
residents have serious cases of diarrhea, which can be fatal for
infants and small children.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is when the real pain begins,'' said Douglas Ryan,
Honduras director for Catholic Relief Services, a private voluntary
organization. ``From the level of destruction we've seen to water
systems and other infrastructure, these kinds of numbers don't
surprise me at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's estimates are dramatically higher than those
previously given. Two weeks ago, for example, the Pan American
Health Organizaton, the leading medical assistance group currently
working in Central America, confirmed about 560 total cases of
cholera in Honduras, Nicaragua, Belize, El Salvador and Guatemala -
all of the countries hardest hit by Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Honduran health ministry also said in its alert that 62
people had been diagnosed with Leptospirosis, a disease spread by
rats that can cause liver and kidney failure. Four people so far
have died from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Although some international health and aid workers Monday raised
questions about the accuracy of the government's figures, no one
doubts that this country, roughly the size of Ohio, has now become
an incubator for life-threatening diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public health conditions here were vulnerable even before the
hurricane,'' said Leopoldo Narvaez, a doctor who practices out of
his home in a Tegucigalpa neighborhood. ``We've been dealing with
AIDS and high rates of cancer. But now we're talking about national
epidemics to have to fight and with few resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the worst cases of cholera, an intestinal disease that
can kill through severe dehydration, and malaria have been found
along the country's numerous rivers, in rural villages and along
the northern coastal communities, health workers said.
</P>
<P>
   But some cases have been reported even in the capital city of
Tegucigalpa, typically in people who live or work near the
Choluteca River, which since the storm has become a putrid
collection of human waste, animal remains and rotten food.
</P>
<P>
   Near the city's central market, one of the most popular shopping
areas for everything from vegetables to fresh chickens, some
residents have begun scavenging through the river to collect items
that can be washed and resold on the street. Government officials
closed the market for health reasons immediately after the storm
hit, but the hundreds of vendors have simply relocated their booths
across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Health workers also said that 1,080 cases of dengue fever, a
mosquito-borne illness that can cause chills, joint pains and
hemorrhaging, have also been confirmed in Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   Unless health workers are able to control the spread of
diseases, the death toll from illnesses could double the 9,000
Central Americans who have been killed by Mitch, the most
destructive hurricane to hit this area this century.
</P>
<P>
   In Honduras, the country hit hardest by the storm, the official
death toll stands at 5,657. On Friday, however, the country's
Justice Ministry said it had suspended the governor of the state of
Santa Barbara for overstating the number of dead in that region.
Rather than the 1,159 dead initially reported, the government said,
the actual number was 282.
</P>
<P>
   The spread of so many diseases has stretched the country's
medical institutions beyond capacity. Even before the thread of
diseases appeared, hospitals and clinics were busy treating many of
the 12,000 people who were injured by the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Many water systems, most of which were only recently built, were
severely damaged by heavy rains or by rivers that in some instances
swelled up to 45 feet above their normal level.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 60,000 homes have been completely destroyed,'' said
Scott Solberg, deputy director in Honduras for the relief
organization CARE. ``So much of the basic water infrastructure is
still clogged with debris. The magnitude of destruction is
astounding.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in other central American countries are also trying to
fight the spread of diseases. In Nicaragua, more than 400 cases of
suspected cholera and six of leptospirosis have been reported.
Guatemalan officials have confirmed 26 cholera cases, and two more
have been found in Belize.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who are not ill are being urged to take preventive
measures. Aid organizations have distributed thousands of water
purification tablets. Children are being vaccinated for hepatitis
and tetanus. Resuce shelters are being checked regularly for
infestations of rodents and mosquitos. And government agencies are
warning families to beware of contaminated meats and produce.
</P>
<P>
   Amid such grim precautions, many Hondurans are trying to resume
their daily life. Along streets once covered with leather-colored
water and outside many of the hillside homes that ring the city,
Christmas lights and ornaments hang in anticipation of a more
peaceful, joyful time.

   ``It's important that people feel a sense of restoring their
livelihoods,'' said Ryan, of Catholic Relief Services. ``This has
been like waking up from a nightmare.''

SUPREME COURT ENTERS TAX FIGHT BETWEEN JUDGES AND COUNTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Md.)  (mk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday entered a long-running
tax dispute between two federal district judges and an Alabama
county that has tried for 10 years to impose its occupational
license tax on the salaries of federal judges in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   The federal appeals court in Atlanta has ruled twice in the last
three years that Jefferson County, Ala., which includes Birmingham,
cannot constitutionally apply the tax to the income of federal
judges. The appeals court held that the tax, which applies to
hundreds of thousands of private- and public-sector workers in the
Alabama county, in effect amounts to a direct state tax on the
federal government, in violation of a legal doctrine that makes the
government immune from state and local taxation. On Monday the
Supreme Court agreed to hear the county's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Federal judges, along with other federal employees, pay state
and local as well as federal income tax, under a 1939 law in which
Congress expressly consented to state and local income taxes as
long as there was no discrimination against the federal workers.
But the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Atlanta, viewed the
Jefferson County tax not as an ordinary income tax but rather, in
this case, as an impermissible fee for the privilege of serving as
a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   The tax amounts to about $700 a year for the judges, who earn
$136,700. The two judges who have refused to pay are William Acker
Jr. and U.W. Clemon. The other federal judges who work in the Hugo
L. Black Federal Courthouse in Birmingham are not parties to the
case, having simply paid the tax or paid it under protest.
</P>
<P>
   In its Supreme Court appeal, Jefferson County vs. Acker, No.
98-10, the county is arguing that the tax is simply an income tax
under a different name and that, as such, it raises no
constitutional problem. Alabama counties are barred by state law
from imposing income taxes, and so several have come up with
occupational taxes that have the same effect. The Jefferson County
tax is levied at the rate of 0.5 percent of an individual's gross
earnings within the county. Only people who operate businesses
under a state license are exempt.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has taken the county's side in this
dispute. When the county's appeal was before the Supreme Court last
year, before the justices ordered the appeals court to consider a
separate, jurisdictional issue, the government told the court that
the appeals court had made a mistake ``in looking to the label,
rather than the substance, of the challenged tax.''
</P>
<P>
   In granting the appeal Monday, the justices were evidently not
satisfied with the appeals court's handling of the jurisdictional
issue, and ordered the two sides to address it again. That question
is whether a federal law, the Tax Injunction Act, which generally
prohibits the federal courts from interfering with a state's effort
to assess or collect taxes, should keep this case out of federal
court.
</P>
<P>
   The county originally sued the two judges in the local small
claims court, but the judges successfully requested a transfer to
federal court. If there turns out to be no federal court
jurisdiction, the lawsuit will proceed in the Alabama state courts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   These were among the other developments at the court Monday:
</P>
<P>
   _ Military death sentence: Without comment, the court refused to
hear an appeal by an Army private, now on the military's death row,
from his conviction of murdering two taxi drivers in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The case of the soldier, Pvt. Dwight Loving, first reached the
Supreme Court in 1996, when he challenged the constitutionality of
the death penalty provisions of the Uniform Code of Military
Justice. The justices upheld the military death penalty by a vote
of 9-0.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest case, Loving vs. Hart, No. 98-251, Loving
challenged particular aspects of his sentencing, including whether
members of the court-martial had received proper instructions. The
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, which previously upheld
the sentence, rejected the latest challenge earlier this year.
There has not been an execution in the military since 1961.
</P>
<P>
   _ Federal authority: Also acting without comment, the court
sidestepped a debate over federal vs. state authority, refusing to
hear a Maryland county's appeal from a ruling that it was required
under federal labor law to pay overtime to emergency medical
technicians.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Arundel County, backed by briefs from 20 states, the
National League of Cities and other state and local government
organizations, had framed the case as a vehicle to persuade the
court to re-examine a disputed 1985 ruling that upheld the
constitutionality of the Fair Labor Standards Act as applied to
state and local employers. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
in Richmond, Va., ruled against the county on the ground that the
1985 decision was binding. The case Monday was Anne Arundel County
vs. West, No. 98-266.

HERALD PUBLISHER APOLOGIZES FOR COLUMN ABOUT PUERTO RICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISA VALDES-RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After an estimated 500 people gathered in front of the
Boston Herald Monday to protest a Don Feder column calling Puerto
Ricans ``unassimilable immigrants,'' the Herald's publisher,
Patrick J. Purcell, published a ``personal apology'' to the Latino
community for the language in Feder's piece.
</P>
<P>
   It has been almost 30 years since Boston's Hispanic community
staged a public protest as large as Monday's rally at Herald
Square, according to community leaders.
</P>
<P>
   According to police and protest organizers, 500 people gathered
outside the newspaper's headquarters to protest the column,
published Monday, Nov. 30. The column described Puerto Ricans as
immigrants _ even though they have been citizens of the United
States since 1917 _ and equated Spanish speakers to criminals,
welfare recipients, and aliens.
</P>
<P>
   Purcell's apology says: ``Should we have been more sensitive to
the feelings of the Latino community? Yes. But all of our
columnists are given wide latitude to express their opinions in
their own way. We will stand by their right to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we will be judged by the Latino community and by all
of our readers not on one column but on the totality of our
contributions to this city and our coverage of its people.''
</P>
<P>
   While some of the boycott's organizers, such as Harvard Medical
School professor Francisco Trilla, said Monday that an apology
would be sufficient, other organizers, like Maria Alamo, say that
an apology from Feder himself is due.
</P>
<P>
   Feder has been in Israel and unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Alamo said she plans to push ahead with the boycott, in spite of
Purcell's apology. ``It's the only way I think we can avoid this
happening again in the future,'' Alamo said.
</P>
<P>
   Alamo and others were surprised by the apology, because, they
said, Purcell was opposed to an apology during their meeting,
apparently changing his mind only after they had left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Purcell told us that if he printed a retraction every time one
of his columnists offended someone, he'd be printing one every
week,'' said Trilla. ``I said I hoped he didn't have a protest like
this outside the paper every week. I said this was not just any
article. Something very upsetting happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   A press release from the National Congress for Puerto Rican
rights said Feder had ``upset many in the Latino community through
his callous ignorance of the historic reality of Puerto Rico.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Feder's column was, on the surface, about the issue of
Puerto Rican statehood, statehood was not the issue of the protest.
Attendees included Puerto Rican nationalists, statehood supporters,
and those supporting the current status as a territory, as well as
many non-Puerto Rican Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, they all said, was prejudice against Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feder used the Puerto Rican issue as an excuse to spew his
racist attitudes about Hispanics,'' said Alberto Vasallo III,
co-owner of El Mundo newspaper and host of a radio talk show.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Sanchez, the mayor's liaison to the Latino community, was
at the protest, and said it represented a new era. ``They are
showing not only that they will not be slurred, but that the media
needs to go beyond that and start addressing our issues
positively.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer John Loiza said Monday was the first time since 1969 he
had seen so many Hispanics united in public protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful,'' Loiza said. ``This is not a good time to be
baiting Latinos, as we're growing in numbers and power.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Velez and Mayari Sanchez, both students at Northeastern
University, marched in the picket line, chanting with hundreds of
others in English and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of us, young and old, are more aware now that if
we don't do something about this kind of racism, we are never going
to advance,'' said Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Rodriguez, president of the Massachusetts chapter of the
National Congress for Puerto Rican Rights, said he was pleased by
the turnout for the protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time,'' Rodriguez said. ``Puerto Ricans have a long
history of protest and activism, but for the past 10 or 20 years
we've been dormant. Not anymore.''

SOME IN HOUSE COUNT ON IMPEACHMENT FAILING IN SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The prospect the House will pass at least one
article of impeachment is growing partly because some swing-vote
Republicans are comfortable there is little chance the Senate would
vote to convict President Clinton, thus providing the GOP with a
historic way to punish the president without ousting him. A top
Republican leadership aide said Monday that the current ``psyche''
of the GOP is to punish Clinton with a move ``stronger than
censure.'' While it takes a majority vote in the House to impeach a
president, a two-thirds vote in the Senate is required for
conviction and ouster. Republicans control the Senate, 55-45, far
short of the necessary 67 votes needed for conviction.
</P>
<P>
   One senior GOP aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Republicans like this situation because it ensures that Clinton has
``an un-expungeable record as only the second president to be
impeached.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are trying to use the complex rules of impeachment
to their advantage, taking the Clinton case as far as possible
while trying to avoid the voter backlash that could arise if the
Senate convicted and ousted the president. The strategy depends on
House members voting for impeachment regardless of how they think
the Senate should act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are only the grand jury,'' said Representative Marge
Roukema of Connecticut, one of a number of Republicans who intend
to vote for impeachment without regard to possible Senate action.
``The Senate has to make that decision, and I don't think what the
Senate does should have any influence on how we do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Roukema said she takes ``strong exception'' to other
Republicans, such as Representative Christopher Shays of
Connecticut, who have said they won't vote for impeachment unless
they feel certain the Senate should convict Clinton. The outcome of
the House vote could depend on whether undecided Republicans take
the Roukema or Shays viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   All of this alarms Democrats, who charge that Republicans are
turning the impeachment vote into a form of punishment with no
intention of trying to oust Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard that argument,'' said Senator John F. Kerry. ``I
think it is a cop-out on constitutional responsibility. I don't
think the process should be trifled with that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Joseph Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat who has called
for a censure resolution, urged House members not to vote for
impeachment unless they really want to oust the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``One ought to do it as if there is a reasonable chance that the
impeachment will lead to removal from office,'' Lieberman said.
While Lieberman agreed there is a presumption the Senate won't have
enough votes to convict Clinton, he said the Senate is
unpredictable. ``No member I know of has declared how they would
vote on impeachment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Baron, who was the lead counsel in 1989 in the Senate's
last two impeachment trials of federal judges, said it would be an
``abuse'' for a House member to vote for impeachment while assuming
Clinton would be acquitted by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``No responsible prosecutor would bring an indictment knowing
full well he doesn't have the proof,'' Baron said.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a Senate trial is complicated by the arcane
rules of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate trial must start at 1 p.m. the day after the House
sends over the articles of impeachment. But Senate officials said
the process is more flexible, with the House first asking the
Senate whether it is ready to receive the articles. The Senate then
has time to ensure that all senators are assembled and ready to
begin the trial. Once the Senate is ready, it notifies the House it
is ready to receive the articles of impeachment. The House would
send the articles to the Senate, and the trial would begin the next
day.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, if the House does vote for articles of impeachment
later this month, Republicans expect a trial to begin shortly after
the new Senate convenes on Jan. 6. As a result, the House of the
105th Congress would be sending articles of impeachment to the
Senate of the 106th Congress. While there have been questions
whether such a timetable would be unconstitutional, House Judiciary
Committee Chairman Henry J. Hyde said Monday he was sure the
Supreme Court would allow it.
</P>
<P>
   The trial would be overseen by Supreme Court Chief Justice
William Rehnquist, with the senators sitting as jurors. There is no
prosecutor in the case because criminal charges are not being
brought. Instead, the House Judiciary Committee would appoint
``managers'' who would bring the case to the Senate. The managers
can be a House counsel, as well as one or more House members.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Constitution, the penalty for a Senate
conviction of a single article of impeachment ``shall not extend
further than to removal from office.'' While some analysts said
that leaves open the possibility of a lesser penalty than removal
from office, Baron said it is widely interpreted as the president
must be removed.

 By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you want to know what sets fashionable women's
hearts aflutter, just look at their feet. More even than clothes,
shoes are the not-so-obscure objects of desire that cause many
women to throw logic to the wind and succumb happily to temptation.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point: On a recent afternoon at Bergdorf Goodman, a
chicly dressed woman trying on a pair of Manolo Blahnik stilettos
wondered out loud if she would be able to walk in them. A woman
sitting opposite trying on even steeper heels said, ``If you love
them, you'll learn to walk in them.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes. Shoes have become an obsession with women who
care about fashion and can afford to indulge themselves. The
besotted will happily admit to owning so many pairs that they
forget what's in their closet. Some will even buy an outfit to go
with shoes they just couldn't resist.
</P>
<P>
   When alligator pumps can cost as much as a designer jacket, this
is not a cheap compulsion. But people involved in fashion have
always believed that shoes can make or break an outfit and that
wearing expensive shoes and handbags can make up for wearing
inexpensive clothes (as long as the style is right, of course).
</P>
<P>
   So at a time when sales staffs in fashion boutiques are standing
around chatting, shoe sales staffs are juggling shoppers and shoe
boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you compare the price of gold jewelry or a coat to the
price of shoes, you can afford to indulge yourself,'' said Rise
Gerber, fashion director for accessories at Bergdorf Goodman. ``I
think everybody is a closet Imelda Marcos.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not everybody, but certainly enough women in a city
like New York to attract more and more shoe designers and
manufacturers to open stores. Some blocks on Madison Avenue are
lined with shoe stores. Recent months have seen new boutiques from
Jimmy Choo, a London designer made famous by Diana, the princess of
Wales; Sergio Rossi, an Italian company with a 30-year history, and
Warren Edwards, soloing without Susan Bennis.
</P>
<P>
   They are poised to compete for women's feet with the stiletto
king, Manolo Blahnik, whose dominant position in high-fashion
footwear made possible a move in August from a tiny space on West
55th Street into a five-story town house at 31 West 54th St.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is becoming a shoe town,'' said Judy Gilliard, a
senior vice president of Barneys New York. ``Business in Europe is
not good. So someone like Sergio Rossi, who wants to be big, is
trying to build his business here.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``Warren Edwards is trying to get his business back.
He did well when he was on 55th Street and when he moved to Park
Avenue, the neighborhoods where his customers were. But when he
moved to West 57th Street, his customer wasn't there. Now he's back
on Park Avenue, where his customer is.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, of the Susan Bennis-Warren Edwards team that ruled the
sexy footwear market in the 1970s and '80s, is on his own at 473
Park Ave. (58th Street). His embroidered loafers and glamorous
pumps are priced from $325 to $595, with exotic skins going for as
much as $1,800.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bennis-Edwards star faded in the mid-'90s, Manolo
Blahnik stepped in with his own interpretation of ultrafeminine,
sexy shoes, which eschewed passing trends. Blahnik designed the
interior of his new shop himself, with beige carpeting, walls and
upholstered sofas, complemented by wooden African stools. There,
shoppers can see scores of his shoes and boots in every height of
heel and a wide range of colors and materials, including calf and
suede, silk, pony skin and alligator.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Manolo comes here, he hates seeing all these shoes on the
shelves, instead of just one or two displayed like art objects,''
said George Malkemus, who, with Anthony Yurgaitis, has held the
license to sell Blahnik shoes in the United States since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The only other Blahnik store is in London, where the designer's
headquarters are (though his wares, like all high-quality shoes,
are made in Italy). The shoes are also sold in Barneys New York,
Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus, some Saks Fifth Avenue stores
outside New York and upscale boutiques. Prices range from $295 for
ballet flats to $1,700 for alligator, with most shoes around $500.
Blahnik has never designed platforms or wide square toes because he
believes shoes should flatter women's feet and legs. So whether his
heels are flat, medium or high, and whether shoes are unadorned or
decorated with pearls and crystals, the toes are always tapered,
the straps delicate.
</P>
<P>
   Manolo Blahnik is the best-selling shoe brand at the Neiman
Marcus store in Los Angeles, said Sandra Wilson, the store's
fashion director for accessories. ``We don't sell Jimmy Choo,
though personally I like it,'' she said. ``It's trendy. But Manolo
Blahnik's quality is the best. The shoes are refined. Christian
Louboutin is another strong shoe line, with a different, distinct
look that's more ladylike, with quirky details and unusual heel
shapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Louboutin, who is based in Paris, is planning to open a boutique
on Madison Avenue next fall, heating up the competition even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Manolo Blahnik is the master,'' said Ms. Gerber of
Bergdorf's. ``He's in a class by himself. His shoes are whimsical
and beautiful and opened the door to new people. We do very well
with Blahnik and with Jimmy Choo, who's developed a nice following.
People now come in and ask for Jimmy Choo.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-level Jimmy Choo store in the Olympic Tower, 645 Fifth
Ave., with an entrance on East 51st Street, is furnished with
comfortable chairs upholstered in aubergine to contrast with beige
carpeting and walls. (A smaller store opened last week on North
Cannon Drive in Beverly Hills, Calif.)
</P>
<P>
   Choo's design philosophy adheres closely to Blahnik's (sometimes
too closely, critics say), with narrow toes, slender high heels and
decorative trimmings. Prices range from about $225 for a sandal to
$865 for a mink-trimmed boot, with most day shoes about $400.
</P>
<P>
   However, Choo himself is concentrating on custom shoemaking in
his London salon, allowing much of the ready-to-wear to be designed
by Sandra Choi, his niece, and Tamara Yeardye, his business
partner, who was an accessories editor at British Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   The Sergio Rossi store, which opened in mid-September at 835
Madison Ave. (69th Street), replacing a franchised operation at the
same address, is part of a United States expansion that includes
Bal Harbour, Fla., and Beverly Hills and is heading to Chicago and
Houston. There are also 35 stores in Europe and Asia. The decor of
all the stores is similar, with off-white floors, walls and leather
sofas.
</P>
<P>
   While Rossi was always known for glamorous, pretty shoes in the
Blahnik-Choo tradition, he has broadened his scope along with his
retail empire. There are now trendy styles like square-toe pumps
with thick heels, platforms, wedgies, ripple soles and sport shoes,
as well as classic pointy-toe pumps with curved heels. Prices range
from $200 to $795, with the best-selling shoe a pony-skin pump with
a Sabrina heel at $345.

 &HT;    RENO TURNS DOWN INDEPENDENT PROBE OF CLINTON CAMPAIGN FINANCES
 &HT;    770 words
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno decided Monday that
President Clinton will not become the target of an independent
counsel for exceeding campaign spending limits in 1996 because the
president had been guided by advice from his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Already embroiled in a historic fight against impeachment,
Clinton received news that neither he nor Vice President Al Gore
would be probed for coordinating a $44 million TV ad campaign paid
for by the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In her filing to a federal appeals court, Reno found that
Clinton and Gore were intimately involved in raising the money and
planning the so-called ``issue'' ads. However, neither ``acted with
the criminal intent ... because they were repeatedly assured that
legal counsel had approved the overall concept'' and because
lawyers were consulted along the way, Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general had ordered a preliminary probe after a
Federal Election Commission audit suggested Clinton and Gore may
have violated federal spending limits by allying their campaign so
closely with party spending.
</P>
<P>
   Her decision was the second in as many weeks in which she
declined to seek an independent counsel on campaign financing. Last
month, she cleared Gore in his telephone fund-raising from the
White House. She has delayed until early next year a third
decision, which is whether to seek an outside probe of former White
House aide Harold Ickes concerning allegations that he lied to a
Senate committee that investigated campaign finances.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of stiff pressure from Republicans and from FBI
Director Louis Freeh, Reno has yet to name an outside investigator
for any of the various campaign finance scandals that emerged from
the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   The White House responded that ``We are gratified'' by the
latest decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we have said all along, the president and the Clinton-Gore
campaign complied with the spirit and the letter of the law,'' said
spokeswoman Amy Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., lambasted the reasoning for
clearing Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Janet Reno's argument that we should turn a blind eye to
potential wrongdoing by the president, because his lawyers told him
to do it, is outrageous,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is specific and credible evidence, including the
president's own words on tape, that indicate he engaged in an
effort to violate campaign laws by engaging in a scheme to exceed
spending limits,'' Barr said. He added that some of the money
raised for the ads came from questionable sources, including China.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said ``the rule of law continues to
suffer'' and restated his intention to take the matter of an
independent counsel out of the attorney general's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who has been Reno's chief critic on
Capitol Hill, said, ``I find it deplorable that she seems to have
placed the president above the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign-reform advocates expressed disappointment but not
surprise at the latest turndown for an outside probe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a very unfortunate decision that takes a big
step toward dismantling the federal election laws,'' said Don
Simon, counsel for the group Common Cause, which favors cutting
back the role of big money in politics.
</P>
<P>
   The decision ``makes the spending limits largely meaningless and
approves the means for evading those limits,'' Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   This means in the 2000 election, ``a candidate can take the
public money and not abide by the spending limit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under campaign laws enacted in 1974 to remove much of the
private interest money from presidential campaigns, candidates who
accept federal funds agree to spending limits. However, the FEC
audit found that both the Clinton campaign and his Republican
challenger Bob Dole evaded those limits by overseeing millions of
dollars' worth of political ``issue'' ads that were financed by the
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC auditors said Clinton should repay $7 million and Dole
should repay $17 million. However, members of the election
commission have expressed concerns that the rules were too
``fuzzy'' and have indicated that they may not seek the full
repayment. Dole was not a target for a possible independent
counsel, because he is not a federal official.
</P>
<P>
   Simon spread the blame for the failure to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Reno's) been resistent to looking at this question since we
first raised it in 1996, and she's being very conservative and
getting bad advice from her staff,'' he said. As for the bipartisan
FEC, Simon said, ``They are supposed to be an aggressive watchdog,
and they are more like a napping pussy cat.''

   Many people fear airplane accidents, but they may be focused on
the wrong source of injury. A recent study indicates that thousands
of people are hurt annually in events that do not even meet the
aviation authorities' definition of an accident. By contrast, in
1997, the latest statistics available, the National Transportation
Safety Board listed two deaths and 21 serious injuries in what it
considered accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The leading sources of injuries are items that fall out of
overhead luggage bins. Once meant for coats and other light
articles, these bins are now frequently used for heavier items. A
doctor at the Flight Safety Foundation, a nonprofit group based in
Alexandria, Va., studied 462 incidents of injuries caused by
objects falling from the overhead bins on Boeing 757s belonging to
one airline, which he did not identify, and found bruising or
laceration in half the cases.
</P>
<P>
   Boxes and picture frames were the most dangerous items, followed
by sporting goods and wheeled objects, including carts, strollers
and wheelchair parts. As laptop computers become more popular, they
are a growing hazard, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of injuries were to the head, in many cases
producing minimal traumatic brain injury, according to the study,
which was written by Dr. Leo Rozmaryn, an orthopedic surgeon in the
Washington area.

   An Australian Version of the Orient Express
</P>
<P>
   Fans of long-distance rail travel _ or just of the Orient
Express _ will soon be able to indulge themselves in style on a new
continent: Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Venice Simplon-Orient Express and Queensland Rail are teaming up
for the Great South Pacific Express, a luxury train that will run
along the eastern coast, between Sydney, in New South Wales, and
Cairns, in northern Queensland. Previews of the trips _ 18 hours
between Sydney and Brisbane or 45 hours between Brisbane and Cairns
_ begin Dec. 27, with the official inauguration in April. It is
possible to combine the two legs, a four-night excursion, with a
night in a Brisbane hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The train's northern leg _ Brisbane to just north of Cairns _
brings passengers close to two World Heritage sites: the rain
forest of the Great Dividing Mountain Range and the Great Barrier
Reef. Passengers can take excursions to both areas, including lunch
on a platform on the reef.
</P>
<P>
   The train has 20 cars, including 12 sleepers for 92 people.
Sleeping quarters include state compartments, with twin beds;
Pullman, with upper and lower beds; and commissioner's
compartments, with double beds. All have their own showers, basins
and toilets, and are air-conditioned. The cars feature red cedar
walls and stained-glass clerestory roofs. There will be two dining
cars and a lounge car, with a piano area.
</P>
<P>
   Rates _ per person, double occupancy _ until April range from
$820 on the Brisbane-Sydney leg and $1,150 for Brisbane-Cairns in a
state car, to $3,250 for a combined itinerary in a commissioner's
compartment. Afterward, rates will be $1,470 to $3,710, plus about
$70 for a Brisbane hotel room. Reservations: (800) 524-2420.

   It's Butterfly Weather on the Upper West Side
</P>
<P>
   Even as the winter solstice approaches, every day about 50 newly
emerged butterflies are making their first flights in Manhattan.
They are in an enclosed rain forest at the American Museum of
Natural History's exhibit ``The Butterfly Conservatory: Tropical
Butterflies Alive in Winter,'' continuing through Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Since the opening, Nov. 27, 300 to 500 butterflies have been
flying around a vivarium, a free-standing arched structure of
aluminum, fiberglass and transparent acrylic, where the temperature
is a constant 80 degrees. Visitors stroll through the 65-by-20-foot
habitat of leafy green plants with the recorded sounds of howler
monkeys, parakeets and other animals in the background.
</P>
<P>
   The average life span of a butterfly is two to three weeks, so
about 250 butterfly pupae are shipped to the museum each week from
butterfly farms in Florida and Costa Rica. Most butterflies will be
released in the vivarium after hatching, but some will hang in a
special case within the habitat so visitors can see them emerge
from the chrysalis stage. Butterfly reproduction, development,
evolution, defense mechanisms and conservation are explained on
displays.
</P>
<P>
   Entry to the exhibit requires a timed ticket, which includes
admission to the museum (usually a suggested donation of $8). The
tickets are $13, $9 for students and adults over 60, and $7 for
ages 2 to 12.
</P>
<P>
   The American Museum of Natural History, 79th Street and Central
Park West, opens daily, except Christmas, at 10 a.m. The last entry
time for the exhibition is at 4 p.m. Sunday to Thursday and 7 p.m.
Friday and Saturday. Information: (212) 769-5100 or www.amnh.org.
Tickets: (212) 769-5200.

   A Caribbean Island Is Deserted No More
</P>
<P>
   Parrot Cay, an islet in the Turks and Caicos that until recently
was graced only by white sand, mangroves and flamboyant birds, is
about get a luxury resort.
</P>
<P>
   The Parrot Cay Resort is to open Tuesday with 56 units and more
than three miles of beaches on 1,000 private acres rising from
turquoise waters just west of North Caicos. It is part of an
archipelago in the Caribbean and Atlantic with one of the world's
longest coral reefs, which guests can explore.
</P>
<P>
   The decor is mostly white on white and neutral colors in
two-story buildings with guest rooms and gardens, beachfront villas
with suites, and spacious beach houses with private plunge pools.
Four-poster beds are draped in mosquito netting, but all rooms are
also air-conditioned. Louvered white doors open onto private decks
or verandas. Inside, the floors are terra-cotta tile.
</P>
<P>
   Guests will have the use of mountain bikes, an air-conditioned
gym, two illuminated tennis courts and water sports equipment.
There's an 88-by-66-foot pool and a nature trail. An Asian-style
spa is scheduled to open in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   A resort was planned on Parrot Cay early this decade but never
built. The new owners, identified only as two couples with
interests in other hotels and restaurants, have hired Michel
Neutelings, former manager of the K Club on Barbuda, to run Parrot
Cay. The executive chef is Franck Aubert, who has worked at
restaurants in France, and the cuisine is international.
</P>
<P>
   Winter rates start at $540 for a double room, which includes
full breakfast and dinner, airport transfers by motor launch, and
nonmotorized water sports. It does not include a 19 percent
combined tax and service charge. For reservations, call Parrot Cay,
(649) 946-7788, fax (649) 946-7789, or Crown International, (800)

GANG WAR CASTS PALL ON HANDOVER OF MACAU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Dec. 13)  
(mk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACAU _ Pity the poor tourism officials who work for this
vest-pocket Portuguese colony on the southeast coast of China. One
year before it is handed over to China, Macau is eager to present
itself as a destination for the discriminating traveler: a
Mediterranean port on the South China Sea. But with gangs waging a
bloody war over its lucrative gambling business, Macau seems less a
charming fusion of East and West than a lethal mix of East and Wild
West.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism officials acknowledge ruefully that the crime wave has
scared away many visitors, most of whom come to Macau to gamble in
its somewhat down-at-the-heel casinos. ``Obviously, the incidents
affect tourism,'' said Winnie Pau, the Hong Kong representative of
the Macau government tourist office. ``But if people are enjoying
the tranquillity of Macau, they won't go out on the streets in the
middle of the night, when these incidents occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pau said no tourists had been affected by the violence. That
did not stop Taiwan's foreign ministry from issuing an advisory
urging its citizens to exercise caution when visiting Macau. Taiwan
put out the warning last September, after 15 people were injured in
bomb blasts in central Macau that were aimed at police and news
organizations. The gang wars have subsided a bit since, though a
Hong Kong businessman was recently kidnapped and held in the
colony.
</P>
<P>
   The mayhem in Macau threatens to overshadow its impending
handover to China, which is set for Dec. 19, 1999. But while
Macau's change of sovereignty is not likely to draw the same
worldwide attention as Hong Kong's last year, in some ways it will
be a more historic milestone: When Portugal relinquishes this
territory of 502,000 people, it will be the last European colonial
power to decamp from Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Portuguese seafarers established Macau in 1557 _ 285 years
before Britain signed the lease for Hong Kong. And unlike Hong
Kong, Macau has preserved its European ambiance.
</P>
<P>
   From the Largo do Senado, its magnificent oblong-shaped town
square, to Sao Paulo, a church that burned down in 1831, leaving
only a richly detailed facade, Macau is laden with architectural
treasures. The Portuguese administration has restored many of these
sites to their original splendor, and it recently opened a
remarkably accessible museum chronicling the colony's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``People throughout Macau are desperately looking for ways to
perpetuate our uniqueness,'' said Fok Kai Cheong, a professor at
the University of Macau, who spoke at a recent architecture
symposium.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, Macau owes its Old World atmosphere mostly to the fact
that the modern world left it behind. After thriving as a trading
post during the 18th and 19th centuries, Macau began to lose ground
to Hong Kong, which was blossoming into the commercial and
financial hub of East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   By the 20th century, Macau had become a backwater. But in the
last 30 years, it has refashioned itself as a mecca for gamblers _
a sort of Atlantic City for weekend wagerers from Hong Kong. Today,
Macau's most popular landmarks are its casinos, which have little
of the over-the-top attraction of Atlantic City or Las Vegas, but
draw crowds of gimlet-eyed gamblers. Gambling generates 68 percent
of Macau's tourism revenue, with the rest coming from sightseers.
</P>
<P>
   The casinos have become the prizes in a ferocious tug-of-war
between gangs from Hong Kong, Taiwan and China. Law-enforcement
officials say the gangsters are trying to stake claims to the
casinos before the Chinese government takes control.
</P>
<P>
   Although the gangsters tend to restrict their attacks to each
other or to the Portuguese authorities, their mere presence casts a
shadow. At the Hotel Lisboa, a gaudy wedding-cake edifice that is
Macau's flagship casino, police officers patrol outside the
entrance with automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Portuguese officials say they are making headway in the battle
against the gangs. They point out that in the first 10 months of
1998, Macau actually had fewer homicides than in the same period
last year: 22 vs. 25. In May, police arrested Wan Kuak-Koi, a
43-year-old Chinese who is reputed to be Macau's most powerful gang
leader. Wan, also known as Broken Tooth Koi, is awaiting trial in
an isolated prison cell on a tiny island off Macau.
</P>
<P>
   As the handover nears, the Chinese government has become more
assertive in helping Macau combat crime. Beijing recently announced
that it would station soldiers in the colony after the reversion _
a move that has left the departing Portuguese authorities
distinctly uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Macau is forging ahead with plans for the change in
government. It is building a cultural center on the waterfront,
which will be the site of the ceremony. Unlike Hong Kong, which
mounted a dazzling fireworks and laser show, Macau is keeping
things small, with a single day of festivities. ``We want to have a
cozy, cultural event,'' Ms. Pau said, ``rather than a glamorous,
magnificent event that costs millions of dollars.''

WORLD ILLITERACY RISING AS CHILDREN ARE DEPRIVED OF SCHOOLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Nearly one-sixth of the 5.9 billion people in
the world cannot read or write, according to a survey to be
published on Tuesday by Unicef.
</P>
<P>
   The study predicts that illiteracy rates will steadily grow into
the next century because only one of about every four children in
the poorest nations is now in school. More than half those denied
educations are girls, Unicef, the United Nations children's fund,
says in its annual report, ``The State of the World's Children
1999.''
</P>
<P>
   The study found worsening educational conditions in the former
Soviet Union, where levels had been high.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from deepening divisions between rich computerized
societies and those in the Third World without even the rudimentary
tools of knowledge, the report says, illiteracy has a direct
relationship to important health indicators and fertility rates.
</P>
<P>
   An overwhelming percentage of illiterates are in countries with
high population growth like India and Pakistan, where better
education for women and children could significantly reduce other
problems, the study reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 10-percentage-point increase in girls' primary enrollment
can be expected to decrease infant mortality by 4.1 deaths per
1,000, and a similar rise in girls' secondary enrollment by another
5.6 deaths per 1,000,'' the report says. ``This would mean
concretely, in Pakistan for example, that an extra year of
schooling for 1,000 girls would ultimately prevent roughly 60
infant deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Fertility drops sharply as education rises, Unicef says. In
Brazil, the report found, illiterate women have an average of 6.5
children, and mothers with secondary-school educations have an
average of 2.5 children.
</P>
<P>
   Unicef and other organizations that work with children say
education should be guaranteed under the 1989 Convention on the
Rights of the Child. But the intentions of that treaty are being
overwhelmed by a host of problems, including economic crises in
countries like Russia and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread ethnic conflict has made refugees of millions of
children and destroyed their schools at a time when international
aid for education projects is decreasing. Uprooted children are
often turned into soldiers by military forces.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, is
lobbying governments to add money for classrooms for refugees and
communities where displaced people eventually return.
</P>
<P>
   Education often has to compete with more pressing immediate
needs like food and shelter, although refugee experts agree that
one of the most effective ways to create a sense of stability and
normality among displaced children, many of them orphans, is to
establish classrooms, however rudimentary.
</P>
<P>
   Schooling is also often denied to young people because
governments do not give schools a high priority or make it easy for
families to send children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often when we interview street kids they say they are on the
street because they were kicked out of school,'' said Yodon
Thonden, counsel in the children's rights division of Human Rights
Watch, a rights group in New York. ``Free education is not
necessarily compulsory, and sometimes there are costs, which places
education beyond the reach of many families, costs of things like
books or uniforms or shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   In its survey, Unicef found that once high educational levels
were in ``free fall'' in the countries that made up the Soviet
Union, as costs rise, unpaid or poorly paid teachers are
demoralized and buildings become dilapidated.

2D DEMOCRATIC SITE-PANEL VISIT TO HUB SERIOUS BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Boston could still land the Democratic National
Convention for 2000; but the word on the street is it's LA's to
lose.
</P>
<P>
   If Los Angeles suffered a major earthquake or if Al Gore was so
worried about Bill Bradley's presidential bid that he decided to
keep the convention in the Northeast, insiders quip, Boston could
have a serious chance.
</P>
<P>
   Such cynicism is far from the Menino administration's message
for this week's visit by seven operatives of the Democratic
National Committee. But pragmatism may play a part in their
itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the June gathering of two dozen members of the site
committee, who got the royal treatment _ from the Reebok box at
Fenway to a private shopping tour at Filene's Basement _ this tour
will lack booty. There will be no hand-held computers bestowed at
the airport, Paul Revere bowls, or Rockport shoes sent in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   This gang will spend all of Thursday and Friday at the Parkman
House _ the mayor's entertainment domicile _ and the Fleet Center.
No Duck Tours or Kennedy Library cocktail parties will be thrown in
for respite as they were in June.
</P>
<P>
   That means Menino does not have to spend his political capital
to persuade business leaders to attend various events or seek
donations over and above the cost of lodging and meals for a
two-day stay.
</P>
<P>
   For the DNC it is time to play hardball in the home stretch,
using the head-to-head competition between LA, Boston, and Denver
to drive up the value of their packages.
</P>
<P>
   Boston has undoubtedly made an impressive showing in the
convention sweepstakes and has the telegenic backdrops and
cosmopolitan skills to throw the party, insiders agree. And Menino
has a secret weapon in his deputy chief of staff, Julie Burns,
whose former boss at the Dewey Square Group, Michael Whouley, is
expected to run Gore's campaign. Burns has strong White House
connections and was the second-in-command of the Chicago convention
for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Menino is widely thought to have surprised many people with
Boston's strong showing, especially given the usual reticence of
its business community and the city's lack of experience with big
conventions. But Massachusetts has been a cash cow for the
Democrats, as retiring DNC cochairman Steven Grossman personifies.
</P>
<P>
   Menino has pledges by corporate sponsors to raise more than $1
million, including $250,000 from both Fidelity Investments and Bank
Boston, to throw the big party.
</P>
<P>
   With the work of the site committee complete with the winnowing
of the list to the top three, now politics rules, observers said.
Philadelphia, once Boston's chief rival for the DNC convention,
ironically could help draw the Democrats to the Northeast since it
is hosting the GOP bash in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Hub's chief liability is that even combined with all of New
England, it cannot match California's 56 electorial votes and track
record as a presidential bellwether.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor is doing the responsible thing in putting forth the
effort to attract the Dems to Boston,'' said Peter Berlandi, a
major Republican fund-raiser. ``But it's a difficult decision for
the DNC to turn their backs on a large state like California.''
</P>
<P>
   John Sasso, a political strategist who handled Michael Dukakis's
1988 presidential bid, said, ``Boston passed the initial viability
tests with flying colors and now it's down to politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore has a lot to say about it,'' he said. ``But I think we
have a chance.''

FIRST LADY'S YEAR OF LOWS TO END ON A HIGH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Perhaps it's symbolic of the disconnect in the
nation's capital that as temperatures hit another record for
unseasonable warmth, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on Monday
unveiled the White House's Christmas theme of ``Winter
Wonderland.''
</P>
<P>
   As the impeachment move against her husband continues unabated
despite surveys showing that the public is opposed to it, Hillary
Clinton's year of lows is about to end _ with her at a high.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's public approval ratings recently topped 69
percent in the polls; she graced the December cover of Vogue in an
elegant Oscar de la Renta gown; and she served as a tireless
campaigner for Democrats who defied history by winning additional
seats in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever private anger remains from her public humiliation never
seems to leave the White House residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gives off an enormous, focused energy and, oddly enough, a
kind of radiant peace,'' gushed Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   As she stood in the State Dining Room, which is decorated with a
giant gingerbread castle guarded by a sugary Buddy the dog, she
thanked decorators for a ``wonderful partnership of people who come
in to help us kind of lend an air of fantasy and magic'' to the
White House. She spoke briefly to reporters to highlight the work
volunteers did on decorations but left before questions could turn
to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Later Monday, she appeared on a pre-taped segment of ``The Rosie
O'Donnell Show,'' where she sang a duet with the star and hawked
her new book, ``Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids' Letters to the First
Pets.'' And, much of her time remains devoted to saving America's
treasures that are in need of protection or refurbishment or
speaking on childrens' rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let her actions and her words speak for themselves,'' said
Marsha Berry, the first lady's spokeswoman, declining to provide an
interpretation of Hillary Clinton's current situation.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a California commentator, noted Hillary
Clinton has become ``an object of fascination'' around the world.
Indeed, when President Clinton visited Japan recently a housewife
asked him if his wife and daughter had forgiven him and allowed as
to how she doubted she would have forgiven her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theme of the coverage was how well she has responded to
the problems of her husband and how well she is playing the role of
the wronged, but steadfast, wife,'' Jeffe said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffe added, ``There is a perception out there that `as Hillary
goes, so goes the nation,' and it's been that way since day one.
Had she not responded as she did and had she not rallied to him
then he would have been in graver danger than he is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffe attributed the first lady's continued embrace of her
husband following his acknowledgment of an affair with White House
intern Monica Lewinsky as a key reason the public has continued to
support the president.
</P>
<P>
   The political feelings toward the first lady have only lately
become warm. During the 1996 presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton
remained under wraps, traveling to the nation's smaller cities and
to groups where she would be welcomed. This year, she attended
hundreds of fund-raising events and was a relentless campaigner for
California Sen. Barbara Boxer and New York Senator-elect Charles
Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   Many people soured on the first lady during her handling of the
health care debacle in 1994 in which she led the effort to overhaul
the nation's medical care system. And, for much of independent
counsel Kenneth Starr's four-year investigation, the first lady has
been as much a target of his probe as the president.
</P>
<P>
   Rehabilitation of her reputation and image had been underway for
sometime but hastened dramatically in January once Starr's
investigation of Clinton's affair with Lewinsky became public.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, like the president, makes a public show of
sticking to a schedule of issues unrelated to the scandal and of
pushing her thoughts on rights for women and children.
</P>
<P>
   Last week at Georgetown University's Eleanor Roosevelt Lecture
Series on Children's Rights, the first lady spoke about the women
and children she has met on her many travels abroad where they
struggle daily for basic rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we talk about human rights and freedom, we have to ask
ourselves what does that mean to the 7 million children who still
die every year of malnutrition, what does it mean to the 585,000
women who still die of childbirth complications or the girls who
are fed last and fed least because they are not valued as much as
their brothers. What meaning can it have for a child who doesn't
have access to a school or is shut out of a school,'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   So in Washington this week, the bizarre heat wave is supposed to
break. Seasonal temperatures are supposed to return. The first
lady, also preparing for 180,000 tourists and guests to invade the
Christmas White House, will travel with the president on a historic
trip to Israel. The House Judiciary Committee debates impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   And, there were reports that Hillary Rodham Clinton is being
considered as Time Magazine's Man of the Year.

ELI LILLI BUYS RIGHTS TO PROZAC SUCCESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sepracor Inc., the pharmaceutical company that gives old drugs
new life, said Monday it has sold development and marketing rights
for a successor drug to Prozac to the popular antidepressant's
originator, Eli Lilly &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is worth up to $90 million during its first three
years, Timothy J. Barberich, Sepracor's president and chief
executive said. With royalties he said could go as high as 15
percent, it could yield $250 million more in succeeding years for
the Marlborough, Mass. company.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also sets the stage for Lilly, for which Prozac
delivers $2.6 billion a year in sales, or about 30 percent of all
revenues, to keep a firm hold on the antidepressant market once
patents on its original drug expire, beginning in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Without patent protection, other drug makers would be free to
make and market cheaper, generic versions, cutting into both
Lilly's market share and profits.
</P>
<P>
   Sepracor's version, called R-fluoxetine, is still in trials
being monitored by the US Food and Drug Administration. But it is
expected to have fewer side effects, as is the case with most of
the 18 other products Sepracor has been developing to replace
prescription drugs about to lose patent protection.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly, which will take over development of the product, said the
licensing agreement also provides a platform that could lead to
other depression therapies. ``R-fluoxetine is an exciting molecule
with a good chance of becoming an important new advance in treating
depression,'' Lilly's president and chief executive, Sidney Taurel,
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   For shareholders in the two companies, the news was mixed.
Lilly, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, closed at 86 7/8, up
3/4. But Sepracor, traded on Nasdaq, closed at 84 7/8, down 3 1/8,
after rising earlier in the day to an all-time high of 95 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Barberich speculated the market overanticipated the outcome of
the Lilly deal and the decline was only a correction. ``There was a
huge amount of expectation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was the latest in a series capitalizing on
Sepracor's skill in devising next-generation molecular
``near-twin'' or ``mirror'' versions of popular drugs for which
basic patents are due to expire over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   These versions offer an opportunity not only to produce a new
formula that will win a fresh patent, but also a chance to remove
or reduce side effects that may have held back usage.
</P>
<P>
   Other agreements announced in 1998 include one with
Schering-Plough Corp. for a successor to its Claritin
antihistamine, worth $1.7 billion a year to Schering, and another
with Johnson &AMP; Johnson for an improved version of Propulsid, a
heartburn drug that yields $1 billion annually in sales.
</P>
<P>
   On its own, Sepracor plans this winter to launch the US sale of
an asthma drug, Xopenex, as a successor to two other medications
that already have lost US patent protection.
</P>
<P>
   Together, these developments promise to deliver Sepracor its
first profits as soon as 2001, Barberich said. ``The Prozac deal
with Lilly is important because it can be another very large
royalty stream,'' he said in a telephone interview, ``but it
probably won't get large until about 2002.''
</P>
<P>
   Barberich said Sepracor always saw Lilly as the obvious buyer of
the R-fluoxetine technology. But Sepracor kept Lilly under
pressure, keeping the door open for a possible sale to another drug
maker, and developing its own plan to make and sell the drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``We began to develop the product ourselves to make it important
to Lilly that a timely agreement would be in their interest,''
Barberich said.
</P>
<P>
   Sepracor was founded in 1984 specifically to come up with mirror
versions of established drugs, using a principle that has been
known but underutilized for more than a century.
</P>
<P>
   But its work was largely ignored by the pharmaceutical industry
until recently. ``It was just a year ago that Lilly pooh-poohed
this technology,'' analyst David Saks of Gruntal &AMP; Co. said.
``Schering-Plough also pooh-poohed it. Now they (Sepracor) have
gone from nobody to the partner of choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Barberich said Separacor's market capitalization before the
Lilly deal topped $2.6 billion _ roughly five times the amount
investors have pumped into the company since its founding.

RENO REJECTS INVESTIGATION INTO CLINTON'S ROLE IN DNC ADS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno decided Monday not to
seek appointment of an independent counsel to investigate President
Clinton's role in so-called issue advertisements during his 1996
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Reno notified a three-judge federal court late Monday that she
found ``no reasonable grounds'' to continue investigating
allegations that Clinton or Vice President Al Gore were involved in
planning the advertisements that were financed by the Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   In a 31-page report to the court that oversees independent
counsels, Reno wrote that she found ``clear and convincing
evidence'' that Clinton and Gore were unaware they might be
violating the law and had no criminal intent to circumvent campaign
finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Reno explained that Clinton and Gore had been assured by their
attorneys that the ad campaign complied with federal law. In
addition, lawyers for the Democratic Party screened the ads to be
sure they met legal requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's inquiry was triggered by draft versions of FEC staff
audits that concluded both Clinton and his 1996 Republican
opponent, Bob Dole, committed civil violations of federal spending
limits. Drafts of the audits were delivered to the Justice
Department in August. The audits, which were released two weeks
ago, recommended that Clinton repay the government $7 million and
Dole repay $17.7 million in misspent federal matching money.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC auditors argued that the issue ads, which both Clinton
and Dole personally helped coordinate, went too far and amounted to
advocating the candidate's election. If so, the advertising costs
should have fallen under campaign spending limits Clinton and Dole
agreed to when they accepted public campaign funds, the auditors
argued.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general noted that the bipartisan Federal Elections
Commission last week found that the legal standards for separating
candidates' campaign advertising from the ``issue ads'' financed by
political parties was ``fuzzy'' and ``hardly clear.'' In their
meeting Thursday, four of the six commissioners disagreed with the
auditors' recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, deputy press secretary Amy Weiss said
officials are ``gratified'' by Reno's decision. ``As we have said
all along, the president and the Clinton-Gore campaign complied
with the spirit and the letter of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno's decision was the second in two weeks in which she ended a
90-day preliminary inquiry by declining to ask the court to appoint
an independent prosecutor to take a portion of the campaign finance
investigation her agency has run for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 24, Reno cited ``insubstantial'' evidence in rejecting a
call _ supported by some agency officials and the FBI _ for seeking
an independent counsel to investigate whether Gore lied about
telephone fund-raising calls from his office during the 1996
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, Reno was granted extra time by the three-judge
panel to determine whether an independent inquiry was needed into
allegations against former deputy White House chief of staff Harold
Ickes. The New York Democrat was accused of lying to federal
investigators about his efforts to lend administration support to
union leaders in a California labor dispute. The unions helped
finance Clinton-friendly advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's determination only ends our probe into whether issue
ads paid for by the Democratic National Committee violated federal
criminal statutes,'' Reno said. ``It does not end our vigorous
investigation into allegations of illegal activity surrounding the
1996 elections.''
</P>
<P>
   For two years, Reno has rebuffed Republican efforts to have her
turn over the Justice Department's campaign finance investigation
to an independent counsel. So far, the agency's 120-person campaign
finance task force has secured indictments against 14 people,
including key Democratic donors and fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Her decision Monday drew another round of criticism from
Republicans, a chorus led by Rep. Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican
who chairs the House Government Reform Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it deplorable that she seems to have placed the
president above the law,'' Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson, chairman of a committee that
investigated Democratic fund-raising activities, said Reno's
decision ``is probably the final nail in the coffin of the
independent counsel law.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, who chairs the Senate Judiciary
Committee, said he will continue to look for a way to revise the
attorney general's role in appointment of independent counsels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Janet Reno has sliced this broad scandal into narrower issues
so that common threads, patterns and facts are not considered when
weighing each decision whether to seek an independent counsel,''
Hatch said.

 &HT;    BCS: A work in progress
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Bowl Championship Series might have come up a
little short on what many hoped it would deliver _ a clean,
uncluttered, uncontested game for the national title. But you have
to grant this much to the BCS: It was never boring.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing since the evolution of the facemask generated so much
debate in college football. Fans either liked it or they hated it,
and those who hated it, well, they hated it a lot. But nobody
ignored it or failed to offer an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The final result after all the computer formulas were put
together is that the top two teams in the polls, Tennessee and
Florida State, will play for the national championship in the
Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   At 12-0, no one can contest Tennessee's right to be in Tempe.
The argument against Florida State (11-1) comes from fans of Ohio
State (10-1), Kansas State (11-1) and UCLA (10-1), but it is not
strong. The Seminoles' non-conference schedule was a killer with
No. 7 Florida (9-2), No. 8 Texas A&AMP;M (11-2), No. 24 Miami (8-3) and
Southern California (8-3).
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly ended up with two tremendously deserving teams in
the championship game,'' said SEC commissioner Roy Kramer, the
coordinator of the BCS. ``There is no question in my mind that
Florida State and Tennessee deserve to be in the Fiesta Bowl, and
that's all we were trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The basic structure of the BCS, which calls for the national
championship game to rotate among four bowls _ Rose, Fiesta, Sugar,
Orange _ will not change for at least four years. ABC has a
four-year contract to televise all four bowls, with an option for
three years more. The next national championship game will be the
Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But the formula for the BCS rankings, which are used to
determine the two teams in the title game, could be in store for
some tweaking between now and next season, Kramer said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The current formula has four components: average ranking in the
two major polls, average ranking in three computer polls, strength
of schedule and record. The two teams with the lowest overall
ratings play in the national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Fans who followed the BCS seemed to have no problem with the
polls, the strength of schedule and the record components of the
formula. But the Seattle Times, New York Times and Jeff Sagarin
computer polls were difficult to understand or predict. The
computers sometimes differed widely in ranking teams, because of
differences in the formulas. To try to counteract those
differences, the BCS formula included a standard deviation
component, but it only served to confuse fans more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always said that we will take a look at the formula at
the end of each season and, if there were adjustments that needed
to be made, we would study those areas and make the adjustments,''
Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers, including ESPN college football analyst Lee
Corso, are suggesting that a fifth component be added to the
formula, for margin of victory against Top 25 teams. That would
give a team credit for a strong performance against a nationally
ranked team but would not reward a blowout against a lesser
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been saying it all year,'' Corso said. ``There needs to
be some kind of recognition given when you beat a high quality team
and really play well. When there are a couple of teams that are
really tight, it could make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Such an idea would not receive universal acclaim. Some people
already are critical of the BCS rankings because they believe it
causes coaches to run up the score, thus causing bad blood in the
profession.
</P>
<P>
   Others advocate eliminating the automatic bids for conference
champions and argue that teams should have to play their way into
one of the four games based on their BCS rankings. Because Syracuse
(8-3), the Big East champion, was guaranteed a bid, other teams,
including Kansas State and Arizona (11-1), were left out.
</P>
<P>
   However, that change appears unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still believe that we should reward play in the regular
season, and teams that win conference championships deserve that
recognition,'' Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Saturday's losses by UCLA and Kansas State, the BCS
didn't have to face the prospect of leaving out of the Fiesta Bowl
an undefeated team ranked in the top four. But the debate over the
BCS and its selection formula kept college football in the
forefront all fall. With the NBA on strike and the NFL down to only
a few strong teams, college football was the hot topic on every
sports talk show in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some coaches warned Sunday that fans might grow tired
of trying to figure out the complex formula that establishes the
postseason pecking order. In order to hold fans' attention, with so
many competing entertainment options, football might have to
consider a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think there should be a playoff at some point,''
Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer said. ``This system has worked
itself out very well, and it is certainly better than what we had.
But I know what it's like to have a good team and get left out of
the mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Florida State coach Bobby Bowden, a traditionalist, wonders
if all the complexity and debate that surrounded this season won't
move the game closer to a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way things have turned out, you figure I have to like the
system we've got,'' Bowden said. ``But I've had the feeling the
past few weeks that we're getting closer to a playoff. I've never
been a proponent for a playoff, but it's getting to the point where
even I can see something with four teams, something small like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans who favor a Division I-A football playoff should not expect
it anytime soon. The television contracts aside, the powerful
President's Commission of the NCAA has gone on record in its
opposition to a Division I-A college football playoff. Opposition
from the presidents is enough to make sure that it won't happen.
Besides, Kramer argued, with a playoff, football would lose the
suspense and excitement of Saturday, when two of the nation's top
three teams _ UCLA and Kansas State _ lost and propelled Florida
State into the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ever have a playoff, you lose that drama of the regular
season,'' Kramer said. ``This year, more than any I can remember,
we had a game every week that had some impact on the national
championship. In college football, the regular season is the
playoffs. It's one of the things that makes college football
special.''

 &HT;    BCS Q and A
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: How is this Bowl Championship Series an improvement over the
Bowl Alliance we had last season? Wouldn't Tennessee and Florida
State have played for the national championship under that setup,
too?
</P>
<P>
   A: The No. 1 ranked Volunteers and No. 2 Seminoles would have
played in any Alliance bowl designated the national championship
game. In fact, the same result would have occurred five years ago,
too, before the BCS or the Bowl Alliance. Tennessee would have been
in the Sugar Bowl as the SEC champion, and Florida State would have
gone there as an at-large team.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS format would have made a difference this year if
Tennessee, UCLA and Kansas State all had finished undefeated, by
determining which two of the three should get into the title game.
</P>
<P>
   Also, unlike the Bowl Alliance, the BCS format includes the Rose
Bowl, which meant that the Pac-10 and Big Ten champions were
eligible for the title game instead of being committed to the Rose.
That change avoided last season's situation, in which No. 1
Michigan played in the Rose Bowl against Washington State and No. 2
Nebraska played in the Orange Bowl against Tennessee. When both
Michigan and Nebraska won, they shared the national title _
Michigan winning in the coaches' poll, Nebraska in the AP poll.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If Florida State beats Tennessee in the Fiesta Bowl, will the
Seminoles automatically be national champions?
</P>
<P>
   A: Florida State would automatically become No. 1 in the USA
Today/ESPN coaches poll, because the American Football Coaches
Association agreed earlier this year that the winner of the Fiesta
Bowl will be its national champion. The 70 writers and broadcasters
who vote in the Associated Press poll will cast their ballots after
the Fiesta Bowl, and they have the right to vote for any team.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After the Fiesta Bowl was set, how were the rest of the BCS
bowls filled out?
</P>
<P>
   A: The remaining BCS bowls _ the Rose, Orange and Sugar _ filled
their spots from the remaining conference champions (Big 12, Big
Ten, Big East and Pac-10) and two at-large teams.
</P>
<P>
   For the at-large berths, those bowls had the latitude to pick
the best game for their particular situation. Any team with nine
wins ranked higher in the BCS rating than the lowest-rated
conference winner _ in this case, Syracuse _ was eligible to be an
at-large team.
</P>
<P>
   The Rose automatically got Wisconsin and UCLA, the Big Ten and
Pac-10 champs. The Sugar then picked Ohio State (at-large), the
Orange took Florida (at-large), the Sugar took Texas A&AMP;M (Big 12
champ) and the Orange took Syracuse (Big East champ).
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about the other bowls?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most of the remaining bowls have commitments to pick teams
from certain conferences. The Peach Bowl, for example, has the No.
3 pick from the ACC and the No. 4 pick from the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Conferences differ in how those spots are filled. The ACC, for
example, goes strictly by order of finish, including head-to-head
competition to break ties. Florida State beat Georgia Tech, so it
got the BCS bid. Georgia Tech beat Virginia, so the Yellow Jackets
got the No. 2 spot in the Gator. Virginia beat N.C. State, so it
got the third spot.
</P>
<P>
   In the SEC, the No. 4 pick means just that _ not necessarily the
fourth best team in the conference, but rather the fourth choice of
eligible teams. The SEC works with its bowl partners to determine
the best matchups.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With all that in mind, why did the Outback Bowl , with the
No. 3 pick in the SEC, chose Kentucky over Georgia?
</P>
<P>
   A: Georgia went to the Outback Bowl last season, and Kentucky
has quarterback Tim Couch, who probably will be playing his last
college game. Kentucky has not been to a New Year's Day game since
the 1951 season, and Outback officials were worried whether Georgia
fans would travel after the disappointing loss to Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did 9-2 Florida end up in a BCS bowl, while one-loss
teams Kansas State and Arizona got left out?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Orange picked Florida over K-State and Arizona in order
to improve ticket sales, which have been down in recent years.
Florida has not been to the Orange Bowl since 1967, and chances for
a sellout are good. Bowls not hosting the national championship
game must do everything possible to sell out their games because of
the steep financial commitment _ $12 million per team _ for being
part of the BCS.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Once Kansas State missed on the BCS bowls, why did it fall
all the way to the Alamo Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   A: The logical place for Kansas State after losing in the Big 12
championship would have been the Cotton Bowl, which takes the No. 2
pick from that conference. But the Cotton took 8-3 Texas instead,
because the Longhorns have running back Ricky Williams, the likely
Heisman Trophy winner. The Holiday Bowl, which got the No. 3 pick
from the Big 12, was happy with the response it already had gotten
from Nebraska fans, and it also passed on Kansas State. The Alamo
had the No. 4 pick from the Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And why was Tulane, the only other unbeaten team in Division
I, not included in the BCS?
</P>
<P>
   A: Tulane plays in Conference USA, one of the lowest-rated
leagues in Division I football. The Green Wave plays exciting
football, but the caliber of competition does not equal that of the
ACC, SEC, Big Ten and other top leagues. Tulane will play in the
Liberty Bowl, which gets the champion of Conference USA.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How long is the current TV contract for the BCS, and can
anything be done to push football to a playoff before that contract
expires?
</P>
<P>
   A: The current TV contract between ABC and the BCS runs for four
years with an option for three more. Chances are very strong that
the contract will run its course. While fans and media are
clamoring for a playoff, the college presidents oppose the idea.
The general consensus is that Division I never will hold a 16-team
playoff, which is what they do in Division I-AA, II and III. A
possibility might be a four-team playoff after the bowls, but the
powers that be will fight it. Under the current system, the
conference commissioners control the revenue generated by the
bowls. Under an NCAA playoff, the NCAA would control the money.
</P>
<P>
   The only way the situation would change would be if a huge media
entity _ such as Disney or Turner _ offered the BCS a
multi-billion-dollar, multi-year deal dwarfing any other television
offer in the history of the game. That would get their attention.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After having to raise millions of dollars to be part of the
system, the bowls seem to be talking louder during this time of the
year. Has the BCS given the bowls more power over college football
than they should have?
</P>
<P>
   A: The bowls always had the right to take the two teams that
will help them stage the best possible game. A BCS bowl, for
example, must pay out $24 million to the two participating teams.
Of that total, only $8 million comes from television. The bowl must
raise the rest of that money through ticket sales and sponsorships.
Bowls were created not to rank the teams in the postseason but to
increase tourism and generate business during the winter.

 &HT;    Falcons end year with not-so-certain schedule
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Not long ago, the Falcons appeared to have an easy
schedule down the stretch, something that might help in their
attempt to win just the second NFC West title in the team's 33-year
history.
</P>
<P>
   But the look of things has changed, and now road games at New
Orleans (6-7) and Detroit (5-8) don't look like cakewalks, and the
home finale against Miami (9-4) never did.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Falcons (11-2) will play at New Orleans, where the
Saints are 4-2 and coming off an impressive 22-3 win over Dallas.
New Orleans also is very much alive for the playoffs, currently
tied with Arizona (6-7) in a race for the third and final wild-card
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of looking to roll through an easy schedule, the Falcons
will try to get in a better frame of mind for the tougher
competition they'll see in the playoffs. The team has struggled
against three inferior teams in a row -- the Bears, Rams and Colts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next three games are going to be key for us,'' coach Dan
Reeves said. ``New Orleans has their destiny in their own hands.
These three games should help us, because we're playing three good
teams and we'll see where we stack up.''
</P>
<P>
   Good adjustment
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons had problems early against the Colts when
Indianapolis went with three tight ends, largely because Atlanta
remained in a base defense that often left strongside linebacker
Henri Crockett covering Colts running back Marshall Faulk.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk, who leads the NFL with 76 receptions, faked Crockett for
an 11-yard TD reception to give Indianapolis a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Falcons went with four linebackers against that
set, adding reserve Craig Sauer and taking out cornerback Michael
Booker.
</P>
<P>
   It worked well.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts had 131 yards of offense and three touchdowns on their
first four possessions, as Peyton Manning completed 11-of-14 passes
for 120 yards, two interceptions and no interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   After that, he completed 8-of-13 passes for 39 yards, no
touchdowns and two interceptions. The Colts had just 113 yards and
no scores on their final six possessions.
</P>
<P>
   The quicker Sauer, who is better in pass coverage, also replaced
Crockett in the base defense. He finished with four tackles,
defended a pass, and had his first career interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crockett is very instinctive against the run,'' defensive
coordinator Rich Brooks said. ``When they started completing some
passes, we decided to bring Crockett to the sideline and try to
settle him down, and get Sauer some reps.''
</P>
<P>
   Crockett, probably a future middle linebacker, had five tackles,
and will return to the starting job on the strongside against the
Saints on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll probably find some playing time for Craig, but . . .
Henri did absolutely nothing whatsoever to lose his job,'' Reeves
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bad adjustments
</P>
<P>
   Brooks also decided to blitz Manning in the third quarter. It
worked, with the first play of the second half a perfect example.
Sauer and weakside linebacker Cornelius Bennett pressured Manning
into an ill-advised throw over the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Ray Buchanan got his sixth interception, tying
Minnesota's Jimmy Hitchcock for the NFC lead, to set up Chandler's
4-yard touchdown pass to Terance Mathis. That was good for a 28-21
lead that held up.
</P>
<P>
   But the negative side to the blitzing was that it allowed Faulk
room to run. He had 17 yards on eight carries in the first half. In
the third quarter he had 50 yards on nine carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against two or three tight ends, it's hard to blitz and remain
sound against the run, because you have gap-control problems'''
Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, before the Falcons went to their four-linebacker defense
against the three tight ends, Manning took advantage of a breakdown
in pass coverage on a 30-yard touchdown pass on a post pattern to
Torrance Small.
</P>
<P>
   Small was the only wide receiver on the play, and he lined up
wide to Atlanta's left. Buchanan was there, but his zone
responsibility was the left third of the field. On the other side
was Booker. But because the Colts had three tight ends, strong
safety William White rolled up for run support or to cover a tight
end on that side.
</P>
<P>
   When that happened, the deep middle third of the field became
Booker's responsibility. He was too shallow, though, and he and
free safety Eugene Robinson bit on Manning's play-action fake.
</P>
<P>
   Nice play
</P>
<P>
   Chandler's 3-yard scramble for a touchdown on the final play of
the first half tied the game at 21, but the Colts' third-down play
before it was just as important.
</P>
<P>
   Facing third-and-1 at their 29, Faulk swept left but was dropped
for a 3-yard loss by Atlanta defensive tackle Travis Hall to force
a punt.
</P>
<P>
   Nice numbers
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta and Dallas have allowed 239 points, the fewest in the
NFC and fourth-fewest in the NFL. Before the Packers (314 points)
played Monday night, Atlanta was fourth in the NFL in points scored
with 353.
</P>
<P>
   After allowing the Colts 244 yards, the Falcons have held three
consecutive opponents under 250 yards. Atlanta now ranks No. 7 in
total defense, allowing 297 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   The pass defense, ranked last in the NFL three weeks ago, has
held three opponents in a row to 159 yards or fewer, and five of
the last six opponents to 207 or fewer. Atlanta is ranked No. 22
against the pass.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the game plan
</P>
<P>
   The game plan Sunday called for rookie Bob Hallen, the team's
second-round draft choice, to play every third possession in place
of left guard Calvin Collins. But that plan was scrapped by
offensive line coach Art Shell when the Falcons were facing a 14-0
deficit upon getting the ball for the third time.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves is big on sticking to plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Art (Monday) if you have a plan, you can't get involved
in the score,'' he said. ``If you have a plan, you've got to stick
with it. Bob Hallen is going to play next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Mathis' touchdown reception gave him eight for the season, and
41 in five seasons with the Falcons. He is tied with former running
back William Andrews for third on the all-time list, behind wide
receiver Andre Rison (56) and running back Gerald Riggs (48). . . .
While allowing five sacks, and having mixed success in the running
game for three quarters, the offensive line was erratic Sunday, but
Reeves singled out left tackle Bob Whitfield for a strong game. He
has played well for more than a month. . . . Middle linebacker
Jessie Tuggle, who has 42 tackles in the past five games, had a
team- and season-high 12 tackles Sunday. Tuggle trails Bennett
96-95 for the team lead in tackles. Bennett had eight tackles
Sunday. Tuggle has led the Falcons in tackles the past nine
seasons. . . . Reeves is only the second coach in NFL history to
lead three teams to the playoffs (Denver, N.Y. Giants, and
Atlanta), joining Chuck Knox (Rams, Bills and Seahawks).
</P>

 &HT;    INSIDE PRO TENNIS: Sampras lacking on history homework
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pete Sampras should just say he doesn't want to play Davis Cup
and leave it at that. Instead, he made a couple of unforced errors
last week trying to justify his decision not to play this year or
to commit to the U.S. team for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras' most persistent critic has been John McEnroe, whose 9-1
singles record in Davis Cup finals is the U.S. record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy for McEnroe to criticize,'' Sampras said, ``because
he was only playing 13, 14 events (per year). I'm playing 22
events, so it's a different ball game. I think these guys should
get their facts straight before they pop off.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon further review, it's Sampras who didn't do his homework. In
McEnroe's best six-year run (1979-84), he played 518 singles
matches, 19 more than Sampras has played during his current streak
of six consecutive years at No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe's six-year singles record (456-62, .880) is superior to
Sampras' (415-84, .832). McEnroe was ranked No. 1 in four of those
years and captured seven Grand Slam singles titles while playing
for three winning U.S. Davis Cup teams.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras has won 10 Grand Slam singles titles the past six years
but has played for just one U.S.-winning Davis Cup team (1995).
</P>
<P>
   Also worth noting is that McEnroe added to his workload by
winning seven Grand Slam doubles titles from 1979 to '84. Sampras
has only two pro doubles titles of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not knocking Pete, but just sit back for a minute and have
a look at the two records,'' said ITF president Brian Tobin, who
used former Aussie great Roy Emerson in the comparison. ``Pete has
11 Grand Slams and two Davis Cups (and didn't play in the final of
one of those). Emerson has (a record) 12 Grand Slams and eight
Davis Cup final wins on his record. So how would you compare the
two?''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras also argued that it's not feasible to be No. 1 today and
play Davis Cup full-time. ``If I play Davis Cup,'' he said, ``my
ranking goes to No. 4 or 5 in the world. You can't have
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   By that logic, though, Jonas Bjorkman could've been the tour's
best player last year. He finished No. 4 despite playing singles
and doubles in three rounds of Davis Cup for winning Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   The Davis Cup debate stirred again when last week's final, won
by Sweden over Italy in Milan, became the first played without a
player ranked in the world's top 30. The U.S. was without a top-25
player in its embarrassing 4-1 loss to Italy in the semifinals.
Last week, Tobin said the ITF, which runs Davis Cup, is considering
changes to ensure better Davis Cup participation. His ideas include
reducing early-round ties to a best-of-three-sets format, giving
previous year's finalists a first-round bye and awarding ATP Tour
points to players for their victories.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last decade, Susan, a Long Island, N.Y., businesswoman
who recently turned 50, has been plagued by an annoying and
potentially humiliating problem: She has to empty her bladder a
dozen or more times a day and several times a night, or risk an
embarrassing accident. When she has to go, she has to go, and soon.
Fortunately, Susan is not shy about seeking out lavatories wherever
she may be.
</P>
<P>
   But for more than 17 million Americans who share her problem of
an overactive bladder, opportunities to urinate at a moment's
notice are often limited, forcing them to restrict their
activities, including their employment, to places and circumstances
where lavatories are immediately available. Some become homebound,
going out only when they can be certain of quick access to a
bathroom. Many are forced to wear adult diapers, dressing in loose
clothes to hide the bulge and tell-tale signs of an occasional
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep is often disturbed by the need to urinate often during the
night, resulting in daytime fatigue that can impair work and social
activities. Sexual activity may be avoided for fear of an
embarrassing loss of bladder control.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is far more challenging than the more common
condition of stress incontinence, where a small amount of urine can
escape when a sneeze, cough, hearty laugh or vigorous exercise puts
pressure on the bladder. When a person with an overactive bladder
loses control, the entire bladder is likely to empty at once. And
while stress incontinence is primarily a problem for women,
especially as they age, overactive bladder afflicts men and women
in nearly equal numbers, and can occur at any age.
</P>
<P>
   Although an overactive bladder is hardly rare and often has
costly emotional, social and occupational consequences, most people
with the condition accept it as a normal part of aging, which it is
not, and sometimes are too embarrassed to tell even their doctors
about it. Others remain silent because they believe _ or have been
told _ that nothing can be done to control the problem.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, treatments, including a recently approved drug with
relatively few side effects, are available that can significantly
reduce if not eliminate the distress, discomfort and inconvenience
associated with an overactive bladder.
</P>
<P>
   The bladder has an elastic wall containing a smooth muscle, the
detrusor muscle, which in adults can tolerate a large increase in
urine before a signal is sent to the brain that the bladder is
about three-fourths full and needs to be emptied. Until that time,
signals from the brain suppress contractions of the detrusor
muscle, and thus inhibit emptying of the bladder.
</P>
<P>
   People with normal bladder function usually register a need to
void at a bladder volume of about 250 milliliters, or about 8
ounces, of urine. If voiding is not convenient at that point, it
can usually be delayed through voluntary control until the volume
of urine is about double that amount.
</P>
<P>
   However, an overactive bladder in an adult behaves somewhat like
the normal bladder of babies and young children, whose brains
cannot yet control the time and place of voiding. In those with an
overactive bladder, a sense of urgency typically occurs at a urine
volume of about 150 milliliters. Inhibitory signals from the brain
fail to suppress the overactive detrusor muscle and it contracts
inappropriately during the bladder-filling phase, causing
involuntary voiding.
</P>
<P>
   People with overactive bladders experience at least two of three
major symptoms: a need to empty the bladder more than eight times
in 24 hours, sometimes soon after they have done so; sudden
sensations of urgency, and urge incontinence _ a leakage of urine
or total bladder emptying if the urge is very strong or the person
cannot reach the toilet quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the underlying cause is unknown. However,
overactive bladder sometimes results from certain neurological
disorders, including multiple sclerosis, stroke, Parkinson's
disease, spina bifida and spinal cord damage.
</P>
<P>
   Most important in arriving at a correct diagnosis of an
overactive bladder is obtaining a thorough history of urinary
symptoms and eliminating other possible causes. The most common is
a urinary tract infection, typically determined by a urine culture
and often by the presence of blood in the urine. The doctor should
also perform an abdominal and pelvic examination, looking for such
anomalies as tumors, an enlarged prostate gland, a dropped uterus
or other abnormal sources of pressure on the bladder or urinary
tract.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor may also ask the patient to keep a daily chart of
urinary output to determine whether the bladder empties fully
during voiding since there may be an obstruction or inadequacy of
the detrusor muscle resulting in poor bladder emptying.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a doctor will need to directly record bladder pressure
during filling and voiding, a measurement known as cystometry. In
an overactive bladder, peaks of increased pressure by the detrusor
muscle are recorded during the filling phase, indicating periods of
involuntary muscle contraction at a time when a normal muscle
remains relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   There are two main approaches to treatment: bladder training and
drug therapy. Bladder training aims to restore bladder control by
increasing the capacity of the bladder before it registers the urge
to void. The patient keeps a record of the frequency and volume of
output, gradually increasing the time between voidings by 15
minutes until an interval of two to four hours is reached without
leakage.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor may also ask a patient to keep a record of fluid
intake, in case excessive fluids are contributing to the problem.
However, most patients with overactive bladders have already cut
back on the amount of fluids they consume, and some actually become
seriously dehydrated. Bladder training is very demanding and must
be maintained indefinitely to remain effective.
</P>
<P>
   For those reason, patients much prefer drug treatment. However,
until this year, the available drugs brought side effects like dry
mouth, constipation, blurred vision, confusion and urinary
retention that prompted most patients to stop taking them. Drugs
that are effective against overactive bladder are known as
antimuscarinic agents because they hook up with muscarine receptors
in the bladder and other organs throughout the body.
</P>
<P>
   The newest such drug, tolterodine, has a stronger attraction for
the receptors in the bladder than those in other organs. Thus,
bothersome side effects are much reduced and patients are more
likely to continue therapy. Bettye Roussos, a 57-year-old
saleswoman from Ormand Beach, Fla., says the drug, under the trade
name Detrol, has given her back her life.
</P>
<P>
   She once had a voiding accident while on a podium to receive an
award. She regularly soaked through large protective pads. She
feared going anywhere that was more than an hour's drive, and she
began emptying her bladder hourly in the hope of avoiding
accidents. The urge to void awakened her four or five times a
night, leaving her exhausted every morning.
</P>
<P>
   With Detrol, taken twice a day, her bathroom visits have been
cut in half and she can now control urges without having to worry
about accidents. Although results with the drug are not always so
dramatic, studies show the majority of patients benefit
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   A second new drug, Ditropan XL, taken once a day reduced urge
incontinence by 83 percent and eliminated it entirely in 43 percent
of patients, according to a study of 256 patients reported in June
to the American Urological Association. The manufacturer, Alza
Corp., which developed the drug for Crescendo Pharmaceutical Corp.,
is awaiting marketing approval.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers seeking more information about overactive bladder can

Bladder Health Council of the American Foundation for Urologic
Disease.

COMMENTARY: `A LONG SHADOW'  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Hardly anyone realizes it yet. But this country may
spend the first months of 1999 _ as many as six months _ with the
president on trial before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   For six days a week, under the rules, the 100 senators would be
in their seats on the floor. Chief Justice William Rehnquist would
preside. Congress, the president and the Supreme Court would be
seriously disabled.
</P>
<P>
   That is where the right-wing Republicans who are effectively
running the impeachment process in the House are taking us. Most
Americans do not want to go there. Indeed, they assume that
impeachment is a dead issue. But the House may vote next week to
impeach the president. How can that be?
</P>
<P>
   Henry Hyde, who as chairman of the Judiciary Committee is the
formal manager of the process, is widely respected in the House.
Moreover, he has a strong feeling for our political institutions.
Yet he is driving toward an impeachment that would damage the
presidency and arouse public contempt for Congress. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Some who know Henry Hyde well say that, on partisan issues, he
does not like to stray from the Republican line. And the line on
impeachment is being set by the Republican right. With
Speaker-to-be Robert Livingston silent, the commanding voice is
that of Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, a hard-line
conservative. Other forceful figures are Bill McCollum of Florida
and Bob Barr of Georgia, who has been demanding President Clinton's
impeachment on one ground or another for years.
</P>
<P>
   Many conservatives have a visceral dislike for Bill Clinton.
They reason that, even if he was acquitted in the Senate,
impeachment would mark him as not even President Nixon was marked.
McCollum said the other day that impeachment would satisfy those
who ``believe the president should be branded and given the scarlet
letter.''
</P>
<P>
   The right is affirmatively opposed to what many people favor:
censure instead of impeachment. It would rather lose on impeachment
and then use the negative votes of moderate Republicans to try to
purge them in primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Republican moderates are under heavy pressure from the right.
When Rep. Billy Tauzin of Louisiana let it be known that he might
consider censure rather than impeachment, the far-right magazine
Human Events denounced him as ``pro-perjury.'' His office got
thousands of calls.
</P>
<P>
   The moderates are also said to have been put off by what DeLay
called ``lawyerese'' in Clinton's reply to 81 questions from the
Judiciary Committee. Anyone facing a prosecutor who wants to put
him in prison _ as Kenneth Starr plainly does the president _ will
be advised by his lawyer to say as little as possible. Even so,
Clinton could no doubt have been more forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   But what should be in the minds of the Republican moderates _
and for that matter conservative Democrats _ is history.
Specifically, the two notorious impeachments in our history: of
Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase in 1804 and President Andrew
Johnson in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist published a book in 1992 on those two impeachments and
trials, ``Grand Inquest.'' Both, he said, were highly political.
President Jefferson and his supporters went for Justice Chase
because they did not like his judgments. Johnson was attacked by
the Radical Republicans of his day because he wanted to temper
harsh policies toward the South after the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   If either had been convicted, Rehnquist wrote, ``a long shadow
would have been cast'' over the independence of the courts and the
presidency. But enough Jeffersonians in the Senate voted to acquit
Chase. And Johnson was acquitted by a single vote _ that of a
Republican senator from Kansas, Edmund Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Ross was ostracized and impoverished because of his vote. But
John F. Kennedy listed him in ``Profiles in Courage,'' saying his
``heroic'' act ``may well have preserved ... constitutional
government in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The accusers of Bill Clinton have abandoned all the potentially
serious charges: Whitewater, campaign finance, Filegate. What
remains, however ingeniously framed, is lying about sex. To impeach
him for that would trivialize a grave constitutional process and
cast a lingering shadow on the presidency.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A year ago, the stock of U.S. Office Products was a star. The
company had just reported surging sales and earnings for the
quarter. The shares had more than quadrupled since going public
two-and-a-half years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was a magnificent performance from a company selling the
mundane: paper clips, note pads and swivel chairs. U.S. Office
Products had wanted to be the leader in its field, so it had
followed the lead of much bigger companies in industries as varied
as retailing, banks or health care. It bought the competition.
</P>
<P>
   To acclaim from investors, U.S. Office Products acquired
hundreds of mom-and-pop office-supply stores, and in one year its
sales rocketed to $2.8 billion from $702 million.
</P>
<P>
   But bigness has lost its luster at U.S. Office Products. Sales
growth has slowed, and the company has just announced a quarterly
loss of 11 cents a share. Its stock has tumbled to nearly half its
offering price.
</P>
<P>
   In a month already dominated by mergers of already enormous
banking and oil companies, not to mention the America
Online-Netscape Communications liaison, the story of U.S. Office
Products is a small but cautionary one. For even as the executives
of Exxon and Mobil and Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust contend that
their marriages will create a best of breed, the history of mergers
is often not pretty for shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Although the stocks of some acquirers may rise on the news of a
combination, a variety of studies show that over the longer term _
one year or more _ most mergers result in stocks that lag behind
those of other companies in their industry. And many mergers result
in actual losses for their shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the odds of shares underperforming in current
mergers are almost certain to increase going forward, given today's
sky-high stock prices. When the price of premiums to the acquired
company's shareholders and the costs of integrating two companies
are added, such lofty prices make it almost impossible for these
deals to perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some individual mergers, it could be that size is helpful
in meeting world market demand,'' said Richard Sylla, professor of
economics and financial history at New York University's Stern
School of Business. ``But a lot of history shows us that bigger
isn't necessarily better.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger wave is particularly risky to shareholders because
many deals are not only about what they can deliver to the
customers or the shareholders but also about what they provide,
directly and indirectly, to top management.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the deals often help executives keep their
companies' stock prices high _ at least early on _ by increasing
revenues, essentially making the companies grow faster than they
could ever have done internally, some analysts and academics
contend. And among more aggressive managements, acquisitions allow
them to perform accounting that helps make their financial
statements appear sounder than they actually are.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean, of course, that a number of mergers are not
driven by necessity. In a world awash with $10-a-barrel oil, for
example, combining Exxon and Mobil to cut costs is seen as perhaps
the only way an integrated oil company can thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the oil patch, many of today's corporate combinations
are necessitated by too much competition. Too many goods produced
by nations around the world that are embracing capitalism for the
first time means that more and more U.S. companies are finding it
hard to increase their sales or profit margins. The solution has
been to get bigger, even if it means joining forces with a company
that used to be a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   To the degree that mergers reduce excess capacity, they do
provide a benefit. But since these combinations also usually
involve huge layoffs, these benefits do not come cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   These forces have made 1998 a banner year for mergers. So far
this year, 23,926 deals have been announced or completed worldwide
for a total value of $2.31 trillion, breaking last year's previous
record of $1.6 trillion worth of deals. In 1994, there were 19,166
deals with a value of $560.3 billion, according to Securities Data
Co.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this growing appetite has been whetted by the stock
market. Chief executives' obsessions with ever-rising stock prices,
and the rewards those stock prices deliver, play an increasingly
large role in merger mania today, some academics say.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, today's high-priced stocks make mergers easier than
ever. For chief executives faced with slowing internal sales
growth, an easy solution is to jump-start revenues by buying
another company.
</P>
<P>
   And so, 70 percent of the value of mergers and acquisitions
today is made with stock, according to Mark Sirower, professor of
mergers and acquisitions at New York University's Stern School of
Business. Ten years ago, 90 percent were all-cash deals.
</P>
<P>
   Proof that higher stock prices drive merger activity can also be
seen in the value of deals done during September, when the stock
market was falling. Then, a mere $51 billion in deals was done,
down from about $200 billion a month in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   As merger decisions become driven in part by higher stock
prices, it is almost certain that more combinations will fail. For
shareholders, that is bad news, given that most mergers of the
recent past are already producing dismal returns.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 100 large deals completed between 1994 and 1997,
Sirower found that two-thirds resulted in immediate and outright
losses to shareholders and wound up underperforming their industry
peers over the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is almost identical with one found in a similar study
Sirower did in the 1980s. Even during a bull market, mergers can
undermine stock values. A recent study by Mitchell Madison, a
consulting firm, found that between 1995 and 1998, a period of
great gains for the market over all, stocks of merged banks
underperformed their peers 82 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Such rates of failure are likely to increase in the future. Why?
Expensive stocks make it even more difficult for executives running
the huge combinations to succeed in their marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, acquisitions require more discipline than ever before
because of the overall market value of the firms,'' Sirower said.
``We're looking at companies now that are so highly valued on their
own that they already have to run very hard just to stay in
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with price-earnings ratios on many big-capitalization
stocks at dizzying heights, investors are clearly expecting great
improvements from these companies in the future. Add a takeover
premium to these prices and you get expectations that even the most
brilliant manager could not hope to meet.
</P>
<P>
   History also gives ominous news to shareholders in today's
megamergers. In the past, the larger the target was, the lower the
return to the buyer generally was.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you overpay for a company that is equal to 1 percent of
your overall revenues, whether you overpaid is not going to have a
big impact on shareholders,'' said Eli Ofek, professor of finance
at NYU's Stern School. ``But if you overpay in an Exxon-Mobil case,
it will have a huge impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most acquisitions fail, academics say, because the
postmerger company's business cannot support the price paid to
forge the combination.

 &HT;    AOL picks Smyrna site
 &HT;    By Kelly Simmons
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ America Online Inc. has chosen Atlanta suburb Smyrna
over two other sites in the Southeast as the location for its
computer operations center, a $500 million investment that could
mean 200 jobs for area residents, Cobb County Commission Chairman
Bill Byrne said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Although financial incentive agreements between the company and
the state have not been finalized, Byrne said he expected the deal
would be announced by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my viewpoint the deal is final,'' Byrne said. ``There will
be appropriate incentives from the state and county to bring it to
closure.''
</P>
<P>
   County officials said the AOL facility would be built in
Highlands Park, a 1,000-acre mixed-use development at I-285 and
South Cobb Parkway in Smyrna. Cobb County and the city of Smyrna
both have offered the company economic incentives, which could
include infrastructure improvements and waivers on construction
license fees.
</P>
<P>
   AOL also has asked the state to buy a site for the facility,
state budget director Tim Burgess said Monday. He said the state
was considering the request but had not made a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at AOL's Dulles, Va., headquarters declined to
comment. ``It's premature to discuss any future growth plans,''
spokeswoman Wendy Goldberg said. ``When we have something to
announce, we'll announce it.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL is the largest commercial online service in the United
States, with about 14 million subscribers and 20 million users. In
1998, the company reported $2.6 billion in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   State economic recruiters have shown restraint in the past in
offering financial incentives to woo businesses to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the state offers a standard package of tax incentives
and, sometimes, deals to add industry-specific research programs at
universities. But Georgia generally avoids providing free land or
deep tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Incentives offered by the state depend on the magnitude of the
project, but are viewed by Georgia as an investment that would give
a fairly prompt return, said Randy Cardoza, commissioner of the
Georgia Department of Industry, Trade and Tourism.
</P>
<P>
   While the project might not dramatically increase Atlanta's
status as a high-tech center, AOL is a well-respected company with
a hot brand name in a fast-growing industry, said William Todd,
president of the Georgia Research Alliance, a consortium of
government, industry and universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a continued validation of Atlanta, Ga., as a good place
to grow and develop a technology company,'' Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   AOL would be the second high-tech company in recent years to
move into the Smyrna office park, said Smyrna Mayor Max Bacon. Two
years ago, IBM moved its call center _ one of only three in North
America _ from Atlanta to Highlands Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big coup for us,'' Bacon said. ``I hope this is a
done deal like everyone says.''

 &HT;    State's tech workers tie for fourth in U.S. salary survey
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia, which has become one of the fastest-growing
technology centers in the region, ranks among the top five states
in the nation in terms of salaries, according to a survey released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The survey by Atlanta-based ComputerJobs Store found the Peach
State ranks fourth behind New Jersey, Delaware and Oregon in terms
of pay of information technology professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Information technology professionals in Georgia made an average
salary of $60,000, putting Georgia in a tie with Connecticut for
fourth place.
</P>
<P>
   About 21,000 programmers, technical support workers, operating
systems workers and Y2K programmers responded to the online survey.
</P>
<P>
   Top-placed New Jersey paid its workers an average salary of
$65,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an incredible shortage of professionals,'' said Justin
Williams, the content manager for the ComputerJobs Store.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia companies ``are competing with all firms no matter where
they are, so they're operating on a national pay scale, which is
not set by the cost of living in Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, California _ a hot spot for technology ventures _
ranked seventh, with an average salary of $58,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The national significance to this story is IT (information
technology) professionals add a great deal of value by the very
nature of their work,'' said William Todd, president of the Georgia
Research Alliance, a partnership among the state's research
universities, the business community and the state that is focused
on technology growth.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ``it speaks to the scarcity of talent in this
field,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found this rapidly growing industry suffers from
the same gender and age biases that plague other industries.
</P>
<P>
   Although the salary gap by gender in technology-related fields
is not as wide as in other professions, women are still paid less
than their male counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, women in information technology make 86.5 percent of
men's average salaries. Women account for about a third of the
industry's work force.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are based on responses from 17,086 men and 4,158
women.

 UNDATED: the combination.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consider two cases from 1994. One was Novell's $1.4 billion
purchase of rival software producer WordPerfect. Less than two
years later, Novell sold the company for $200 million to another
software maker. Also in 1994, Quaker Oats bought Snapple, a
beverage manufacturer, for $1.7 billion. Three years later, Quaker
sold its acquisition for $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that stocks of the acquirer may underperform is that
investors realize sheer size by no means translates into higher
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Take the drug industry, one that the United States dominates.
Three of the biggest drug sellers _ Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb and
Johnson &AMP; Johnson _ have generated earnings below the 16 percent
average growth for the group. The two hottest players at the moment
are smaller: Schering-Plough, with earnings growth of 22 percent so
far this year, and Warner-Lambert, with 41 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
   Bigness also has a habit of thwarting innovation. Consider the
great innovation that has transformed the telecommunications
industry since the breakup of AT&AMP;T in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the potential burdens of pricey acquisitions, they do,
at first, provide another way for executives to keep their stock
prices high _ through aggressive accounting tactics that make their
financial statements appear to be stronger than they actually are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mergers give companies an opportunity to take very sizable
write-offs, creating a camouflage to clean up a lot of things on
the balance sheet,'' said Howard Schilit, president of the Center
for Financial Research and Analysis in Rockville, Md. ``Does that
drive the acquisition? Probably not, but it doesn't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking sizable write-offs today can make earnings look rosier
tomorrow. And some companies use huge restructuring charges that
typically accompany mergers as a place to dump regular business
expenses, increasing earnings in the process. Since earnings drive
stock prices, big write-offs and expense-reduction tricks can be
mighty valuable in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   Companies sometimes use acquisitions to pick up a new source of
revenue. For instance, FPA Medical Management Inc., once the United
States' third-largest physician-management company, agreed in July
1996 to buy some operations of Foundation Health Corp. for $220
million. As part of the deal, Foundation Health agreed to pay FPA
$26 million a year in so-called guaranteed access payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than adjusting the purchase price, FPA picks it up as a
source of revenue,'' Schilit said. ``Those are the kind of
interesting tricks that can happen when companies bundle things
with an acquisition. Mergers make it easier for companies to create
these smoke screens. As a result, it's more difficult for investors
to see write-offs or one-time infusions to revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   The tactic used by FPA Medical helped the company for only so
long. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in
July.
</P>
<P>
   Acquisition of another company's revenues can bolster a stock
another way, at least temporarily. The bigger a company's market
value is _ the stock price multiplied by the number of shares
outstanding _ the more likely that it will attract institutional
investors. The huge and growing pools of capital _ pension funds,
mutual funds and hedge funds _ need places they can go to generate
returns.
</P>
<P>
   If a company has billions of dollars in market value, it means
getting in and out of the investment is relatively easy for large
investors. And ease of entry and exit is increasingly crucial to
these investors.
</P>
<P>
   So the influx of money gives the stock a boost. But big
institutional investors can be fickle and such money can flee the
merged company when earnings growth appears to slow.
</P>
<P>
   For the executives in a company being acquired, a merger can
mean enormous, instant wealth. For example, Lucio Noto, the
chairman of Mobil, stands to collect at least $6 million just by
leaving if a sale to Exxon goes through and the board approves his
``golden parachute'' pay package. A company spokesman has said that
Noto's deal to sell Mobil to Exxon was ``in the best interests of
the company.''
</P>
<P>
   But chief executives of the merged companies can also reap a
rich reward from an acquisition, because their compensation is
typically tied to earnings or revenue growth or the performance of
the stock.
</P>
<P>
   And a study of 152 companies in 1995, James Seward, now a
professor at Dartmouth, and James Walsh, a professor at the
University of Michigan, found that a company was much more likely
to be acquired if the chief executive of the concern held a big
stock-option package.
</P>
<P>
   Graef Crystal, an executive-compensation expert, notes that the
chiefs of companies being acquired get a nice premium on the shares
they hold; also all their stock options and restricted shares
automatically vest and become free to trade. Frosting on the cake:
A bonus is typically given that may be the highest ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, you had hostile takeovers with CEOs fighting
them,'' Crystal said. ``Now CEOs are walking around in front of
their buildings with sandwich boards that read: `Company for sale.
Inquire within.'''

HOFFA CALLS FOR END OF FEDERAL OVERSIGHT OF TEAMSTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ James P. Hoffa came out swinging Monday in his
first news conference since being elected president of the
Teamsters, promising to create a bigger, more militant union and
calling for an end to federal supervision of the Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa, son of the Teamsters' most famous leader, presented an
aggressive set of goals, among them uniting the badly divided
union, redoubling organizing efforts and building the nation's
largest political action committee.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that the International Brotherhood of Teamsters had
gone far to root out criminal elements, Hoffa said it was time to
shrink and ultimately phase out federal supervision _ a decade-long
effort to clean up a union notorious for corruption even before his
father ran it.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa complained that the federal oversight has cost the union
more than $80 million since 1989, when the Teamsters agreed to the
supervision to settle a federal racketeering lawsuit that charged
the union with having entered into a ``devil's pact'' with the mob.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should start talking about a diminished role for the
government,'' Hoffa said in an appearance at the National Press
Club. ``It's been 10 years. Is the government going to be here in
the year 2050? In the year 3000? It's something we should talk
about because of the tremendous burden on the members.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of federal oversight, more than 200 corrupt
officials have been ousted from a union in which three presidents,
including Hoffa's father, Jimmy, went to prison and Hoffa's
predecessor, Ron Carey, was expelled. The oversight effort is
elaborate, involving a federal judge, a court-appointed review
board, several investigators, a federal election monitor as well as
judicial hearings, expulsions and appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been tremendous progress made,'' said Hoffa. ``They've
eliminated certain pockets of corruption. I think it's time for us
to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa said he wanted to meet with Justice Department officials
to discuss how to shrink and ultimately end the supervision, saying
he would move at the same time to strengthen the union's internal
watchdog mechanism by, for instance, hiring former FBI agents to do
investigations. .
</P>
<P>
   ``The union is as free of organized crime as any institution of
its size,'' he said. ``But we have to be ever-vigilant.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials indicated that they were in no rush to end
their oversight of the union. Mary Jo White, the U.S. Attorney in
Manhattan, who oversees Teamster investigations for the Justice
Department, said she looked forward to meeting with the union's new
leadership to insure that progress under the consent decree
continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consent decree has been and remains a powerful tool in
ridding the IBT of the influence of organized crime and
corruption,'' Ms. White said.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials said they would consider ending oversight only
when more corruption has been rooted out and union officials
demonstrated over a period of time that they were indeed cleaning
their own house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any outside observer would say now is the time
to do this.'' said Michael Cherkasky, the federal election monitor.
``We just had a election in 1996 which had to be overturned because
of the misuse of union funds. The key here is not only for the
union to be free of criminal elements, but to make sure these
reforms have caught on. We're not at that stage yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa lost to Carey in 1996, but that election was overturned
and Carey was expelled after federal monitors found that three of
his aides had siphoned union money into the Carey campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the 1996 campaign, federal monitors fined Hoffa's
campaign $167,675 after finding that he had filed false reports
about the source of some donations.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly all of the more than 400,000 ballots counted Monday,
Hoffa had 55 percent of the vote, Tom Leedham, his main opponent,
39 percent and John Metz, a St. Louis Teamster, had 6 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hoffa's father was president of the Teamsters from 1957 to 1971
and built it into the nation's biggest and strongest union, helping
double members' wages and establishing the first nationwide
contract for long-haul truck drivers. But Jimmy Hoffa was linked
repeatedly to mobsters who plundered the union and, he served time
in prison after being convicted for mail fraud and jury tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what his father would say about his victory, Hoffa said,
``I think he'd be excited by it. He'd say, `The membership has
spoken.' And he always said, `Trust the membership.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa, a 57-year-old labor lawyer from Detroit, had a strong
message to employers, insisting that he would deliver at the
bargaining table for the union's 1.4 million members _ the nation's
second largest union after the National Education Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a new militancy among the Teamsters,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa recalled that the Teamsters once had the nation's largest
political action committee, but it has declined to sixth or
seventh. He said he would try to make it the largest once again,
noting that money gets members of Congress to pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   In order to increase the union's size, Hoffa said he would
stress organizing, saying the Teamsters should unionize not just
nonunion truck drivers, but also increase the numbers of public
employees, hospital workers and nursing homes in their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa vowed to balance the union's budget, attacking Carey for
letting the union's assets slip to near zero from $162 million when
he took over. He said he would eliminate staff and earn the union
some money from commissions by having companies issue Teamster
credit cards and insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Paff, national coordinator of Teamsters for a Democratic
Union, an anti-corruption group that backed Leedham, said Hoffa
evidently wanted to end supervision because the court-appointed
review board has repeatedly embarrassed him by bringing charges
against members of his slate.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the review board charged that a New York Teamster
official elected as a vice president on the Hoffa slate had lied in
a campaign finance report by hiding that a convicted felon was
working for the Hoffa campaign. He could face expulsion from the
union.
</P>
<P>
   Paff said it was important to have a court-appointed monitor
oversee the Teamsters election in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A court-appointed monitor provides Teamsters with a measure of
protection in elections,'' Paff said. ``Many of the power brokers
behind Hoffa have a long history of rigging elections and
committing violence against members, so without a monitor, having a
fair election would be highly problematic.''

U.N. ARMS INSPECTORS TO BEGIN SPOT CHECKS IN IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ U.N. arms inspectors are about to begin a week
of spot inspections at sites where Iraq is suspected of hiding
prohibited weapons, the head of the commission in charge of
disarming Iraq said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That work will start in the next few hours,'' the commission's
chief, Richard Butler, told reporters late Monday afternoon. He
said that his leading inspector in Iraq had told the Iraqi
government that a series of spot checks would take place with no
additional warning.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Iraq's foreign minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf,
said in Baghdad that the government was about to begin test-firing
short-range missiles, which are permitted for defense. Iraq's
missile program has been a source of extreme concern to inspectors
because equipment used to make and test permitted arms could also
be used in banned systems. Iraq has balked at providing information
on missile parts and fuel supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, is now in Moscow,
where he repeated Monday that Iraq has been cooperating fully.
After a meeting with Aziz, Russia's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov,
said at a news conference that he expected the sanctions on Iraq to
be lifted soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are approaching the end of a long process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The phase of the inspectors' work now about to begin in Iraq,
however, is considered by diplomats here to be the most telling
test of Iraq's intentions of cooperating with the United Nations,
the prerequisite to any lifting of embargoes. Iraqi officials have
already branded as ``commandos'' the special teams that will
conduct the searches. In the past, sharp confrontations have
occurred when inspectors tried to enter sites not previously
designated and were therefore likely to catch the Iraqis off guard.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, executive chairman of the U.N. Special Commission, said
that no details surrounding the visits would be revealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are surprise inspections and that's how they must
remain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   These inspections are the last stage in a five-part process of
re-establishing the work of the international inspection system in
Iraq, which had been disrupted for several months and then cut off
entirely for two weeks in November by the government of Saddam
Hussein. The Iraqis backed down on Nov. 14 in the face of
threatened American and British military attacks.
</P>
<P>
   After the completion of this last round of inspections, led by
teams of experts from around the world now gathered in Iraq, Butler
will prepare a report on the level of Iraqi compliance, he said
Monday. Based on that report, expected in two weeks or less, the
Security Council is to decide whether Iraq has qualified for a
comprehensive review of all its obligations, a first step toward
lifting sanctions imposed in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Some Council members have begun to discuss among themselves what
should be done if Iraq does not qualify. ``What we're getting now
is not full cooperation,'' one of these diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The Council is likely to be under pressure from Russia and
perhaps France to allow Iraq to postpone some unmet demands. Some
diplomats are looking for ways to prevent any delay, and to send
the Iraqis back for a better show of compliance before the Council
authorizes the review, though there are no calls for military
action from any quarter at this point.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At a breakfast with reporters Monday, Scott Ritter, the American
weapons specialist who resigned from the Special Commission in
August, saying that it was being gutted by U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan and by the Clinton administration, said the danger of
the comprehensive review was that Iraq would succeed in whittling
down its responsibility for accounting to only a few crucial areas,
leaving many other potentially dangerous activities undisturbed.
</P>
<P>
   Butler on Monday outlined the five essential components of
inspection work requiring Iraqi cooperation: access to documents,
monitoring, interviews with knowledgeable officials, visits to
sites his commission has previously listed as requiring close
observation because they are places where weapons-related work may
take place, and, finally, disarmament inspections. Butler described
those as ``investigation of sites where prohibited weapons programs
may exist.'' The commission has the right to destroy any banned
item it finds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have restored our work in the first four areas,'' Butler
said. ``We are about to begin our work in the last of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler acknowledged that his inspectors had not gotten the
cooperation they requested on access to documents, but he refused
to begin ``slicing off'' parts of his overall report ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to make a judgment now on full cooperation,'' he
said. ``I told the Council that this is a holistic operation.''

 &HT;    Clinton's lawyers to argue against impeachment todayBy Rebecca
Carr and Bob Deans
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ White House lawyers open their defense of President
Clinton today before the House Judiciary Committee but appear to
have little chance to head off the panel's push for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   White House counsel Greg Craig and Charles Ruff are expected to
argue that Clinton's actions do not warrant impeachment and that
pursuing such a course would set a dangerous precedent.
</P>
<P>
   But Illinois Republican Henry Hyde, the chairman of the panel,
said Monday that it sets an equally dangerous precedent for the
White House to be so uncooperative in his panel's inquiry. The
White House and Democratic response to the impeachment inquiry has
been Shakespearean in nature, Hyde said, ``full of sound and fury,
signifying nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made a compulsive, a compelling case'' for impeachment,
said Hyde, standing in front of four columns of boxes to underscore
the scope of the evidence that the committee has evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has 30 hours spread over today and Wednesday to
challenge that evidence. Under the plan, Craig will deliver a
factual and legal defense of the president, followed by three
panels of legal experts who will discuss a range of topics
including the impact of impeachment on the country and
prosecutorial misconduct. Ruff will conclude the White House
presentation on Wednesday afternoon, followed by questions from the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Noticeably absent from the witness panels is Clinton or any
member from the cast of characters involved in the Lewinsky affair.
There was growing speculation on Capitol Hill over whether the
president would deliver yet another public apology about his affair
with Lewinsky in an effort to head off the so-called impeachers.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum among the Republican-controlled House has been
growing in support of approving at least one article of impeachment
alleging that the president lied under oath. Two additional
articles are under consideration: obstruction of justice and abuse
of power.
</P>
<P>
   There are no plans for Clinton to address the committee or the
nation, but the White House would not rule out the possibility of
the president doing what he does best: taking his story directly to
the American public.
</P>
<P>
   But first the White House will try to present its case before
the Judiciary panel.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde plans to stay on schedule, saying his end of the year
deadline is in response to the ``mood of the country, which does
not want to spend its national life dwelling on impeachment
forever.'' If the committee refers the matter to the Senate, it
will take 67 senators to oust the president.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic committee members lambasted Hyde and the Republicans
on the committee for rushing the process and failing to give the
president the four days of testimony his counsel requested to
present a fair case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice has been denied,'' said Texas Democratic Rep. Sheila
Jackson Lee. ``The Republicans haven't even told us what the
allegations are.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have failed to win enough Republican support for a
proposed motion to censure the president and impose a financial
penalty. And Hyde said he had little appetite for such a measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not ruled out, but it's not a dead-band certainly
either,'' said Hyde, noting that he would not support such a
sanction because he does not believe it is constitutional. The
White House defense team was unsure if it would use all of the 30
hours it has been given over the next two days.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be two days of testimony, I don't know that it will
go to 30 hours,'' said Joe Lockhart, press secretary to the
president. ''They offered us the chance to go well into the night,
and we chose to use the daylight hours.''
</P>
<P>
   In a fresh sign of the political intensity of the issue,
outgoing Speaker Newt Gingrich will not likely preside over the
House vote on impeachment. There is some fear that his presence
could create the impression that the proceedings are a clash
between Gingrich and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has sent word to Rep. Bob Livingston, (R-La.), who is
in line to become speaker in January, that Livingston could take
the gavel.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses scheduled to testify before the House Judiciary
Committee today and Wednesday.

Gregory B. Craig.

 &HT;    Road incident drives home an unattractive generation gap
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of John Updike's early short stories was about a girl who
catches the eye of a boy working checkout at the A&AMP;P. The boy never
learns the girl's name, and she coolly floats off into the parking
lot with two friends, more an illusion than a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road from us is an A&AMP;P, and she was there last week in
the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   She shot me the bird, called me an SOB and 10 minutes later,
applying mascara through her rearview mirror, was telling me I
didn't look half-bad. Even at my age.
</P>
<P>
   We ended up shaking hands _ a reminder, it occurred to me later,
of a few dates I had when I was her age. You take what's offered,
and sometimes it's not much.
</P>
<P>
   But that was my generation, which had its own resentments and
insecurities. Her generation I don't expect to fathom.
</P>
<P>
   Did she say she was 18, or was it 20? One of the two. Some of us
also had cars when we were her age and drove just as recklessly.
But I don't recall (especially in a woman) the fury that contorts
the face into something grotesque. It could have been a pretty one,
and you got the idea that's what she cared about most. In the few
minutes we talked, she applied the mascara, then the lipstick, and
kept looking in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' she said, ``I have a bad case of road rage, OK? My
dispositions sometimes make me do things I can't control.''
</P>
<P>
   She had pulled in front of me on Roswell Road, exiting the BP
station and turning left. Checking the traffic coming from her
right, she was oblivious of anything coming from the other way.
</P>
<P>
   Which, at a little after 3 in the afternoon, was me. I braked
and gave her a quick beep that to me says, ``Watch yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when she whirled in the seat of her red Sidekick and
unloaded on me. Only an air bag could have been more instantaneous.
The middle finger and the face flew out the window, and the curse
came right behind.
</P>
<P>
   You can't execute something so coordinated without considerable
practice. It's hard to find it poignant when you're being cussed
out, but you felt sorry for her, however ugly she had made herself.
</P>
<P>
   And then, as chance would have it, her Sidekick shows up moments
later in the very parking lot I was driving to. It shows up in
front of the A&AMP;P, and she's in it.
</P>
<P>
   You can be too curious about certain people. ``Miss, why'd you
do that?'' I ask, walking up from behind. I say it in as gentle a
voice as I can manage.
</P>
<P>
   The seat swivels again, almost as fast as before, and she
doesn't seem surprised it's me. She even laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You flipped me off, man,'' she says, getting the mascara out
of a suede pouch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I what?'' I say. ``No, I didn't. I gave you a beep. I wasn't
even mad. I just wondered why you'd get so angry . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Now her buddy's coming out of the A&AMP;P. ``Hey,'' she calls out
the window of the Sidekick, ``didn't this guy flip me off? You saw
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The friend's laughing on cue, and she goes into exaggerated
mimicry. I thought of an umpire calling somebody out at home,
except he uses his thumb and not his middle finger. The friend hops
into the Sidekick, and the blonde at the wheel begins telling me
how she has some problems and didn't mean it. She looks healthy but
brittle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' she says as she caps the lipstick, ``maybe you didn't
flip me off, but I'm having a bad day and sometimes I lose it, you
know? But you probably wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Her clothes look expensive. The red Sidekick, I'm guessing, is
from Daddy. She looks pampered and as lost as James Dean ever did.
Neither the clothes nor the Sidekick has done a thing for her, and
the nitwit friend doesn't help either.
</P>
<P>
   But the shell was beginning to crack and I tell her it'll be OK,
still wondering how someone so young could be so angry about so
little. It comes out awkwardly. ``No big deal. Just be careful. I
was your age once too and . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, listen to this guy!'' she says to her friend. ``And how
old are you?''
</P>
<P>
   I tell her it doesn't matter, but older than I want to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't play games,'' she says. ``How old is that?''
</P>
<P>
   There's something raw about her voice that keeps it from being
charming, but I tell her she can wish me a happy birthday in a few
days. The truth is that I was imagining myself at her age, and
couldn't. What was harder still was imagining her at mine.
</P>
<P>
   She put the makeup aside and the Sidekick in gear, checked the
mirror one more time _ for traffic? _ and extended her hand. She
even managed a smile. You wanted to think someone sweet was in
there trying to get out.

 &HT;    Boxer Robinson seen in lights and shadows
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A lot of us are suckers for this kind of story. It's
the male soap opera of choice: boxer rises from nothing to become
world champ; enjoys period of indulgent, rock-'em-sock-'em,
rock-star-style fame; dies broke and broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday they're gonna write a blues song just for fighters,''
the late Sonny Liston, ex-con and heavyweight champ, mused before
expiring in his Las Vegas apartment from a heroin overdose. ``It'll
be for slow guitar, soft trumpet and a bell.''
</P>
<P>
   HBO's ``Sugar Ray Robinson: The Bright Lights &AMP; Dark Shadows of
a Champion'' is a brilliant variation on this irresistibly tragic
theme. The hourlong documentary on the prizefighter many
aficionados consider the best ever is delivered at 10 tonight
E.S.T. with engrossing thoroughness.
</P>
<P>
   But the requisite troubling subtext that runs through it is more
troubling than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should remember Ray Robinson because he was the one perfect
fighter,'' an observer recalls tonight. ``He was an American
original, a genius at his art form, and there was a tragic dark
side, as there is to almost all geniuses.''
</P>
<P>
   We allow for flaws in our heroes _ expect them, even. But wife
beating and child neglect? Somehow being a great boxer _ even an
``artist,'' as filmmaker Woody Allen allows here _ doesn't quite
seem to balance things out.
</P>
<P>
   So by the end, when premature senility leaves Robison unable to
recognize family, we're left hugely conflicted _ in much the way
Robinson's ex-wife and kids are in their painfully profound
interviews. It's this unsettled (and unsettling) conclusion that
elevates this boxer-gone-batty tale into something far more
resonant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bright Lights &AMP; Dark Shadows'' hits all the biographical notes
needed for Liston's blues. Born into poverty in Georgia before his
mother moved the family to Detroit and then to New York, Walker
Smith became Ray Robinson when he subbed for an amateur boxer by
that name. ``Sugar'' was a natural: with size, speed and style
never seen before in a ring, Robinson became the sweetest
practitioner of the sweet science.
</P>
<P>
   His rise as welterweight and middleweight champ _ as well as
black pop icon in an era when attitude wasn't yet marketed by
sneaker companies _ is rendered with home-movie intimacy. Not only
do we see Robinson in his first pro fight, we see him dive into the
public pool where he met his first wife, who flirts for a camera.
It's as if we're witness to the seminal events that would form the
great contradiction Robinson became.
</P>
<P>
   Memorable images float by almost nonstop: Robinson driving his
famous pink Cadillac by his Harlem, N.Y., nightclub; the unmoving
body of Jimmy Doyle, who died after Robinson knocked him out
(Robinson dreamt he'd kill his opponent the night before the fight
and tried to cancel the bout); the entourage he took on a European
tour (including a jester); and film of his happily glazed visage
not long before he died, at age 68, in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's style in the ring, and his sad, addled end, give off
an eerie echo when a photo is shown of him being embraced by a
young Muhammad Ali.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the greatest fist fighter who ever lived,'' writer
Ralph Wiley says of Robinson. ``So if this is what happened to him,
this is what happens to them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds another: ``Muhammad Ali is an homage to Ray Robinson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bright Lights &AMP; Dark Shadows'' wants to please two audiences:
connoisseurs of boxing and connoisseurs of tragedy. It succeeds for
both.

 &HT;    Extra hands help manage holiday hustle, bustle
 &HT;    By Bette Harrison
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Santa's not the only one who needs elves during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, most of us could use an elf or two. So, many of us
hire caterers, party planners and cleaning services to help out
with Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa and New Year's.
</P>
<P>
   Some people take that a step further, getting help for all
manner of holiday chores. If you know where to look, and can afford
it, you can pretty much buy your way out of all the unpleasant
details of the season.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If you deplore addressing Christmas cards, you can call a
calligrapher. For example, Marion Moore of Abby's for All Occasions
in Dunwoody will address cards for you for $1 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting the house in order is no chore if you hire a
decorator. For $300 and up, floral designer Tony Whitlock will come
to your house and turn it into a winter wonderland, using existing
holiday decorations and new ones of your choosing.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Flournoy of Marietta(Ga.) has depended on Whitlock's
decorating expertise for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cut the Christmas trees. Then Tony comes in and saves my
life,'' says Flournoy, laughing. ``What's wonderful is, he gets it
all done in one day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are always surprised (to learn) so many people hire a
professional. They think decorating is a family activity,''
Whitlock says. ``But my clients would rather spend their quality
family time dining out or shopping together.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  For a fee, you can beat the crowds at the mall. Personal
shoppers, such as Michelle Penkava of Two Places at One Time, will
gladly pick up a gift for everyone on your list.
</P>
<P>
   All Penkava requires is your list and a brief description of
each recipient: Uncle Joe likes rock climbing; Aunt Sue loves to
needlepoint. She charges $25 an hour and will match the gifts to
your budget.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Too busy to wrap and mail the presents after your personal
shopper finds them? Wrap and mail stores will take the project from
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We literally have people come in straight from the mall,
shopping bags in hand, saying, `Please help me,' '' says C.J.
Daigle of Mail Boxes Etc. in Sandy Springs(Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   Daigle will take care of just about any gift. ``We've wrapped
and sent a 6-foot-tall teddy bear. And every year we do a few 5- to
7-foot Christmas trees, complete with ornaments.''
</P>
<P>
   Gift-wrapping fees range from $1 for a small gift to $15 for a
large one. Shipping costs vary widely by size and type of
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Still not ready for the holiday social whirl? Company's coming
and someone has to bathe Fluffy, your adorable if bedraggled
Persian cat.
</P>
<P>
   Best Friends Pet Resort and Salon in Alpharetta(Ga.) can put the
fluff back in Fluffy. It also can trim a standard poodle within an
inch of its life _ then dye it blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did that one year. The owner told us dyeing was big in
Europe. I kept thinking, `But this is Georgia,' '' Best Friends'
Maria Toro says with a laugh. Grooming prices vary, but a typical
big dog costs $25, a Persian cat $28.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to banish the animals altogether. A one-night
stay at Pet Lodge Pet Resort in Alpharetta costs $16 for a dog and
$9 for a cat.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Finally, someone must deal with the presents that come
``assembly required.'' Frustration Solvers, a Norcross(Ga.)
company, will send a crew to your home to build anything from
bicycles to barbecue grills.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Frye of southwest Atlanta bought a pool table for her
son to use when he was home from college for Thanksgiving break.
When it arrived in pieces, she called Frustration Solvers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were great and they put it together in no time,'' she
says. ``My son loved it. If it weren't for them he'd have gone back
to college without playing a single game, and I would still be
trying to figure out where to put the first screw.''
</P>
<P>
   Jokes Jim Kovolsky, who owns Frustration Solvers with his
brother, Peter: ``We're the real elves.''

 &HT;    UGA assistant to Tulane
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia's loss is Tulane's gain.
</P>
<P>
   Bulldogs assistant head football coach Chris Scelfo, a
35-year-old native of south Louisiana, was chosen Monday to replace
Tommy Bowden at Tulane. It will be the first head coaching position
for Scelfo, who also coached Georgia's offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like my life has gone a complete circle,'' Scelfo said.
''I am where I dreamed about as a kid, where I want to be for the
rest of my life. You've heard that said before, that's the last
time you'll hear it here.''
</P>
<P>
   Scelfo, regarded as one of the Bulldogs' top recruiters, will
take over the Green Wave program immediately. Instead of coaching
the No. 19 Bulldogs against No. 12 Virginia in the Peach Bowl,
Scelfo will spend New Year's Eve in Memphis, leading No. 10 Tulane
against Brigham Young in the Liberty Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ''My first order of business is to get our game plan for the
bowl in place and get ready for practice,'' Scelfo said. ''I'm glad
we have the game to work on. It'll give the players a chance to get
to know me.''
</P>
<P>
   Scelfo is the brother of Tulane tight ends coach and recruiting
coordinator Frank Scelfo. Another brother, Sam, is president of the
Green Wave booster club. Scelfo, Georgia's second-highest paid
assistant, at $110,000 annually, turned down head coaching jobs at
Southwest Louisiana and Northeast Louisiana earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Tulane athletics director Sandra Barbour's choice of Scelfo was
a surprise to the Green Wave players, who had endorsed offensive
coordinator Rich Rodriguez. Louisiana Tech coach Gary Crowton also
was considered, but he withdrew his name late Sunday night.
Rodriguez, also recommended by Bowden, said he was shocked by the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a shock,'' Rodriguez said. ''I was so sure, I brought
in my green coat and tie this morning. This is so discouraging. I'm
disappointed. I thought I'd done all I could to prove myself. I'm
worried about the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia coach Jim Donnan, who was in New York attending the
College Football Hall of Fame induction ceremonies, wasn't
available for comment. Donnan could shift defensive line coach Pat
Watson, who coached the offensive line for 26 years at various
stops, or tight ends coach Greg Adkins to the offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chris has been with me for every game I've coached as a head
coach and he's been very instrumental in the success we've enjoyed
together,'' Donnan said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting could be more of a concern for Donnan. Scelfo was the
Bulldogs' top recruiter the past two years, helping lure Louisiana
natives Terreal Bierra and Demetric Evans to Athens. This year,
Scelfo was recruiting offensive lineman Kevin Breedlove and wide
receiver Durrell Robinson, two of South Carolina's top prospects.

   In a deal that may prove damaging to the Internet's largest
bookseller, Amazon.com, Microsoft Corp. and Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc.
said Monday that they had agreed to weave together their online
products and services.
</P>
<P>
   The multimillion-dollar marketing arrangement makes Barnes &AMP;
Noble the exclusive bookseller on Microsoft's popular MSN network.
</P>
<P>
   Financial details of the deal were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble, the United States' biggest bookseller, has been
struggling to catch up to Amazon after a slow start in the online
market. And Microsoft has been revamping its MSN site to make
Internet purchasing more appealing to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Amazon advertisements that link browsers to
its online store will still appear on the Microsoft site. But
visitors who click on the book category on the Microsoft shopping
page will automatically be linked to the Barnes &AMP; Noble site.
</P>
<P>
   Other types of shopping will also be integrated. For example,
users of Microsoft's travel site, Expedia, will be told of books
they might want to buy based on the information they request about
plane tickets and hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Barnes &AMP; Noble may be prominently featured in the shopping
section of Microsoft's WebTV Network service, which allows
subscribers to display information from the Internet on television
screens.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said joining forces with a powerful partner like
Microsoft would probably help Barnes &AMP; Noble gain market share in
the rapidly expanding business of selling books on the Internet.
But at what cost _ and to what degree the deal would hurt Amazon _
is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   According to Net Ratings, a Milpitas, Calif., firm that tracks
Web traffic, the MSN site attracted approximately 9 million
visitors in October, ranking fourth after popular ``portal'' sites
like America Online, Yahoo and Netscape, where many Web users go to
begin their searches.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble also has an arrangement with America Online's
proprietary service, which has about 14 million subscribers. But
America Online's site on the Web, which attracted about 21 million
visitors in October, links users to Amazon. And Amazon is the
exclusive music merchant for MSN.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does give Barnes &AMP; Noble significant reach,'' said Ken
Cassar, an analyst at Jupiter Communications, an online market
research firm in New York. ``But this isn't a zero-sum game. The
market is growing so quickly that Barnes &AMP; Noble's gain isn't
necessarily Amazon's loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Each company's shares rallied on Monday. Microsoft shares rose
$6.1875, or 4.8 percent, to a record $133.5625. Barnes &AMP; Noble was
up $3.50 or 11.7 percent to $33.375. Amazon shares rose $2.50, or
1.3 percent, to $191.

IMPEACHMENT CASE `COMPELLING,' HYDE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee has made ``a
compelling case'' for President Clinton's impeachment, the panel's
chairman said Monday, on the eve of a last-ditch effort by White
House lawyers to spare Clinton from the ignominy of joining Richard
M. Nixon as the only presidents this century to face formal
impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   With committee Republicans poised to approve as many as four
articles of impeachment later this week, the chairman,
Representative Henry J. Hyde, issued a final warning to the White
House ``to present some additional evidence that might demonstrate
the president's innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, Hyde said in a news conference on Capitol Hill,
Clinton's legal defense ``has been Shakespearean, `full of sound
and fury, signifying nothing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton's legacy, if not his presidency, at stake, some of
his congressional supporters Monday began calling on him to abandon
his virtual silence on the matter and make a dramatic, 11th-hour
presentation, possibly a prime-time address to the nation, aimed at
reversing the apparent momentum toward his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat on the
Judiciary Committee, said he made the recommendation Monday night
during Clinton's annual Congressional Ball at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for the president to speak directly to
the American people again before this is over,'' Meehan said. ``I
don't think the public recognizes the gravity of what the
Republicans on the Judiciary Committee are about to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's legal defense team announced plans Monday for
their marathon, 30-hour final presentation through Wednesday. The
White House will call a battery of 14 lawyers, scholars and former
Judiciary Committee members to support Clinton's premise that his
actions stemming from his sexual affair with Monica S. Lewinsky do
not meet the constitutional standards for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Notably absent from Clinton's front-line defense team will be
David E. Kendall, the president's private lawyer, who last month
angered some moderate Republicans who are undecided about Clinton's
impeachment by waging a highly confrontational assault on the
independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall's diminished role was seen as part of a shifting White
House strategy aimed more at conciliation than conflict. ``I can
assure you that the contrition is real and is there,'' White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said when asked about Clinton's attitude and
his legal strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart also tried to ease the anger among many lawmakers about
Clinton's highly legalistic responses last month to 81 questions
from the Judiciary Committee asking him to admit aspects of the
allegations against him. ``We certainly regret those who took
offense by the way we answered them,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members in both parties said they do not expect
Clinton's lawyers to prevent the panel from approving impeachment
charges.
</P>
<P>
   But there are pivotal groups of 15 to 20 Republicans and five to
10 Democrats in the full House who are seen as undecided about
Clinton's fate, and several Democratic lawmakers said a public
address by Clinton could help sway them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is sense among the undecided members that the
president's conduct falls short of impeachable and is not
sufficiently serious to justify a prolonged, contentious trial in
the Senate,'' Meehan said. ``If the president focuses a message on
those issues and speaks in an appropriately contrite tone, it might
help his cause on the House floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Two polls released Monday showed overwhelming public opposition
to impeaching Clinton and broad support for an alternative such as
an official censure.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said a Clinton address to the nation or the committee on
the Lewinsky matter ``certainly wouldn't hurt him, but it would
have to be much more comprehensive than anything we've heard thus
far.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House had no official response to the proposal,
although a source said the issue was ``under advisement.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, standing amid stacks of boxes that he said once held
60,000 pages of grand-jury evidence on the Lewinsky matter,
confirmed that the committee is drafting at least three proposed
articles of impeachment related to perjury, obstruction of justice,
and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   Several committee Republicans said they expect the panel to
approve at least the charges of perjury and obstruction of justice.
They said an article charging Clinton with abuse of power probably
will pass the committee if it does not clash with the view of at
least two GOP members that Clinton did not abuse his office by
invoking executive privilege to prevent aides from testifying
before the grand jury. Starr had cited the executive privilege
claim as an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Hyde said, ``We've made a compelling case'' for
Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In response, committee Democrats stepped up their attack on
Hyde's handling of the impeachment proceedings, arguing that
Republicans have designed a process that presumes Clinton's guilt,
at odds with the constitutional right of due process.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Hyde criticized the White House for failing to call a
single witness to directly rebut the allegations against Clinton,
the panel's Democrats said the GOP majority has relied solely on a
``hearsay'' account by Starr of the findings in his eight-month
investigation of the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's cheap press-conference theatrics notwithstanding,''
said Jim Jordan, the committee's Democratic spokesman, ``committee
Republicans have done nothing to assemble or present a case against
the president. These proceedings are not just absurd and chaotic,
they are an offense to the Constitution and a perversion of the
bedrock fundamental principles of the American legal system.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hyde appeared to soften his opposition to permitting
the Judiciary Committee to vote on an alternative short of
impeachment, such as a congressional censure.
</P>
<P>
   Several committee Democrats and a moderate Republican are
pushing censure plans, although House leaders have said they
believe lawmakers have a constitutional duty to vote on impeachment
before they consider any alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not for it,'' Hyde said of permitting the committee to
vote on a censure plan, ``but I'm not saying that I will go to the
death to resist it.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee aides said the panel's final votes on impeachment
charges, and a possible censure plan, are likely to occur on
Saturday, following opening statements Thursday night by committee
members and debate on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The White House special counsel, Gregory B. Craig, is expected
to launch the final presentation Tuesday by acknowledging misdeeds
by Clinton but asserting they are not impeachable. Several legal
specialists will follow, arguing that impeaching Clinton could harm
the presidency, the rule of law and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Then three former Democratic lawmakers who served on the
Judiciary Committee when it passed impeachment charges against
Nixon in 1974 will contrast Watergate and the Lewinsky scandal: the
Rev. Robert J. Drinan, formerly of Newton; Elizabeth Holtzman of
New York, and Wayne Owens of Utah.

SOUTH CAROLINA DROPS OUT OF MICROSOFT SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The attorney general of South Carolina withdrew
Monday from the multi-state lawsuit against Microsoft, saying he
has become persuaded the government's antitrust case will not help
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can no longer justify our continued involvement, or the
expenditure of state resources, on a trial that has been made moot
by the actions of the competitive marketplace,'' said South
Carolina Attorney General Charlie Condon, referring to America
Online's recent acquisition of Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last year, it has become clear that the government's
case has been about Internet competitors, not about consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's announcement came on the same day that Microsoft
chairman Bill Gates held an unusual video news conference to blast
the Justice Department for attempting to destroy his company.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal of South Carolina is an important symbolic
victory for Microsoft, which for the past seven weeks has been on
the defensive in a courtroom featuring a parade of anti-Microsoft
witnesses and the repeated playing of the unflattering videotape of
the deposition of Gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased that Attorney General Condon has made this
decision and we certainly hope that other plaintiff states will
pause and reconsider the wisdom of pursuing this litigation,'' said
Microsoft general counsel Bill Neukom. He said his company is
encouraging other states, especially those with newly elected
attorneys general, to drop out of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we've seen what a feeble case it appears to be and
how long it appears it will run in trial ... I would anticipate
that there will be some serious consideration by some other states
as to whether it's in the best interests of the constituents of
those state attorneys general to continue to participate in this
lawsuit which we think is going nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But state and government officials said the withdrawal of South
Carolina will have no impact on the case against Microsoft, which
is still supported by the federal government, 19 states and the
District of Columbia. None of the other states said they intend to
follow South Carolina's lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a non-event,'' said Marc Wurzel, spokesman for New
York Attorney General Dennis Vacco. New York is the lead state in
the case. ``It's an inconsequential development in what is one of
the most important antitrust trials of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, which has generally seemed to shrug off the
government's litigation against Microsoft, apparently did not view
South Carolina's step as a non-event. Investors sent Microsoft's
stock soaring to an all-time high of $133.5625 Monday, up $6.1875.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was able to gloat about the South Carolina
announcement at a previously scheduled news conference the company
had called to take advantage of a day when the trial was not in
session. At the news conference, the company attempted to persuade
reporters that the government's case is weak and getting weaker.
</P>
<P>
   Gates spoke briefly to reporters at the news conference by
satellite from Redmond, Wash., in his most direct attempt yet to
counter the image of him seen in the deposition.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks Gates has increasingly been visible, allowing
himself to be interviewed by talk show personalities such as Martha
Stewart. But Monday was the first time recently he has subjected
himself to the more adversarial questioning by reporters covering
the antitrust trial.
</P>
<P>
   Gates took three questions from reporters, all about his
performance at his deposition.
</P>
<P>
   The Bill Gates reporters saw Monday was carefully groomed and
positioned before a homey studio backdrop complete with
mantlepiece, bookcase and potted plant. Although Gates appeared to
be struggling with a cold, he smiled, took questions calmly even
when a reporter asked whether he lacked the ``intestinal
fortitude'' to testify, and kept mannerisms to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   The performance contrasted sharply with the deposition, where
Gates is dwarfed in an oversized chair, looks isolated against a
blank, dark wall, and rocks back and forth while looking down and
pausing at great length before giving unhelpful answers to
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Gates defended his deposition performance by saying that the
government misled him by telling him the videotape would not be
shown in court, and said government attorney David Boies ``had made
it clear ... that he is really out to destroy Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I answered truthfully every single question that was put
forward to me,'' he said. But Gates said that had he known how the
tape would be used, ``Would I have smiled a little bit, would I
have made sure that the camera work in this thing was decent? ...
Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates said he is willing to testify at the trial, but that
Microsoft has chosen to call 12 witnesses with more direct
knowledge of the issues being litigated. He said if the government
wants to call him as a witness, he will appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they choose to call me as a witness, that's fine,'' he
said. ``I will be there and address any issue that they ask for,
and you'll see that in that courtroom setting, the judge is
probably interested in getting explanations for what really went
on, instead of badgering to just try and get a `yes' or `no' to a
question that the questioner knows is very ambiguous.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Microsoft filed a motion asking for permission to
subpoena documents and conduct interviews concerning America
Online's acquisition of Netscape and alliance with Sun Microsystems
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to what the government lawyers say, I'd say AOL
paying billions of dollars for Netscape's browser business shows
that the marketplace is working just fine,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department shrugged off Gates's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's latest press statements are another public
relations effort to distract attention from the overwhelming
evidence introduced in court showing that Microsoft has illegally
used its market dominance to block competition from innovative
technologies that threaten its operating system technology,'' said
Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Israelis called it Big Monday. Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu was almost toppled. In what was seen as the most
critical day yet for his faltering government, Israeli lawmakers
postponed a vote, at the last minute, to take the first step toward
dissolving parliament and calling new elections.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, in almost every West Bank city, Palestinian
protests escalated into violent confrontations both with Israeli
soldiers and with the Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
   Together with the political chaos in Israel, the unrest on the
Palestinian street created an uneasy backdrop for President
Clinton's three-day visit to the region, scheduled to begin on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   All day, legislators marched in and out of Netanyahu's office in
parliament as the prime minister struggled to avert what appeared
to be the strong likelihood of a humiliating defeat.
</P>
<P>
   At the last minute, just before a 9 p.m. vote was to be taken,
Netanyahu succeeded in delaying his destiny. He persuaded a
rigorously Orthodox party, United Torah Judaism, to attach a motion
of no confidence in his government to the bill calling for early
elections. For procedural reasons, that postponed the vote and
bought Netanyahu about two weeks to bargain his way out of a
political dead end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The faith in this guy is gone,'' Haim Ramon, a leader of the
opposition Labor Party, said on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   If, in two weeks' time, Netanyahu loses the no-confidence vote,
elections for a new Israeli would be held within the next 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Troubles in Israel _ between the Israelis and the Palestinians,
and within Palestinian society _ have come to a boil, just days
before Clinton's trip. At the same time, still more Israeli
political leaders added their voices on Monday to opposition to the
visit, which many see as an endorsement of Palestinian sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Joining a majority of members of the prime minister's Cabinet
who have already opposed the visit, Dan Tichon, the speaker of
parliament, said he would refuse to take part in any ceremonies
with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's troubles began when he signed a land-for-security
agreement in October promising to turn over a sizable chunk of the
West Bank to the Palestinians. This fractured his right-wing
coalition, forcing him to rely on the Labor Party to get the peace
deal approved by parliament. As his coalition grew steadily more
dysfunctional, he sought to realign it, most significantly by
inviting his former foreign minister, David Levy, back into the
Government.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations with Levy and his five-member Gesher Party broke
down on Sunday. The Labor Party, while backing the movement for
peace, sensed an opportunity to shift the balance of power back to
its side. It called a vote on dissolving the government, which
under the parliamentary system, would have required three readings
to be passed.
</P>
<P>
   With Levy's faction, Labor counted a majority in favor of
removing the prime minister. Judging by the insults flying from
every corner on Monday, Netanyahu could count on few friends
willing to endorse him publicly. If there was a theme to the
insults linking right and left, it turned on a perception that he
is not to be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prime minister cheats all of the time, but not all of us
are willing to be cheated,'' said Uzi Landau, a hard-line member of
Netanyahu's Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators shuffled in and out of the prime minister's office.
The first to come and go were members of the right-wing Land of
Israel front, a small coalition vehemently opposed to any Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank. They were told that the peace
agreement would be frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Then Netanyahu sent out a written message to Israeli Arab
legislators, saying any freeze would be temporary and would be
lifted after Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked for a two-week extension, after which they would
promote the peace, but we would not agree to that,'' said Abdul
Wahab Darawshe, leader of the United Arab List.
</P>
<P>
   Notes were compared, and National Religious Party members went
racing in to ask for a clarification. They apparently left
unclarified. One member, Zvi Hendel, said, ``There comes a point
where they're spitting at us, and it's not rain.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the clearest signs of his desperation, Netanyahu
offered the hard-right party Moledet a seat in his Cabinet. It
turned him down.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the hallway, observing the scurrying, Ramon, of the
Labor Party, smirked and called it a ``disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All this for another day or two, another week or two,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, by buying himself time, Netanyahu took a gamble that
the sooner new elections were held, the better he would fare. The
requirement for elections within 60 days if he loses the
no-confidence vote would bring elections sooner than would occur
under the original opposition bill, in which elections would have
been three months off.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It has been the reigning political wisdom here that the sooner,
the better for Netanyahu. He is not expected to broaden his appeal
over time. And he would fare better in a scenario in which he
himself would be initiating the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing parliament on Monday night, the prime minister
criticized both the Palestinians and the Israeli opposition, almost
in the same breath. Lashing out at Labor, he accused it of
``cynically using the right wing's pain.'' And he tried to distance
himself from the peace agreement, allying himself instead with his
old stance as defender of the Greater Land of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of you who incite against me, who use name-calling _ you
I'm not even going to address,'' he said. ``I want today to turn to
the members of the national camp, the members of the coalition,
those who are really interested in preserving the land, those who
are really interested in preserving Jerusalem, those who are really
interested in preserving Jewish life.''
</P>
<P>
   In discussions on Monday, Netanyahu made it clear that he would
trade on the events of the next two weeks. If the peace effort
seems to be moving forward during and after Clinton's visit, he
could sell himself as the hard-liner who won peace by talking tough
to the Palestinians. Or if Palestinian unrest seems to justify a
freeze in carrying out the agreement, he could try to win back the
right wing.
</P>
<P>
   The violence in the West Bank continued to feed Israeli
anxieties on Monday. For weeks, there have been Palestinian
protests and marches seeking the release of political prisoners
from Israeli jails. Many of the protests have led to confrontations
with Israeli soldiers _ volleys of stone-throwing met by the
shooting of rubber-encased metal bullets.
</P>
<P>
   In every Palestinian city, the relatives of the prisoners have
set up tents, where they are camping and fasting. In Bethlehem on
Monday, the relatives marched from the tent to Rachel's Tomb, where
they were joined by youths who hurled stones at Israeli soldiers as
if it were sport. The Israeli soldiers near the tomb responded with
shooting, wounding about 10 Palestinians before using tear gas to
disperse the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, in Nablus, Palestinian police forces
intervened to prevent hundreds of protesters from clashing with
Israeli soldiers guarding Joseph's Tomb. They used wooden clubs,
beating the protesters, and ended up in a shooting match with
members of Al Fatah, the party of the Palestinian leader, Yasser
Arafat. After the police headquarters were besieged, the
Palestinian authorities shot and wounded 19 rioters.
</P>
<P>
   In Abu Dis, a West Bank town, the Palestinian police stood back
and allowed the clashes to go on, as they did most everywhere else.
A 20-year-old student, Nasser Erekat, was hit in the head by a
rubber bullet and was listed in critical condition at a hospital on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials said four Israeli police officers and two
civilians were wounded in the violence on Monday. One man, a Jewish
settler, was shot while driving between the settlement of Kadim and
the Palestinian town of Jenin in the northern West Bank.

CHAVEZ MOVES FAST TO SHORE UP SUPPORT 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ Just one day after Hugo Chavez was elected
president of Venezuela on a platform of radical change, the former
coup leader worked to soften his militant image and to win over his
fiercest critics.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez was lauded by business leaders and former U.S. President
Jimmy Carter on Monday following a lengthy, election-night press
conference in which Venezuela's new leader mapped out a
surprisingly moderate government program.
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old cashiered army lieutenant colonel, who has no
previous governing experience, assured foreign investors that they
are welcome. He endorsed the notion of government spending cuts,
while promising to root out corruption and pledging to overhaul the
nation's judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Redmond, president of the Venezuelan-American Chamber of
Commerce and a vocal Chavez critic, seemed impressed. Chavez
``seemed to have a good grasp of a lot of issues,'' Redmond said.
``It's amazing. This guy has really polished himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Gillespie, a former U.S. diplomat serving as an election
observer, said, ``On balance, he said a lot of positive things that
bode well for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's election, Chavez easily defeated his chief rival,
former state governor Henrique Salas Romer, by a margin of 56
percent to 39 percent. He will be sworn in Feb. 2 for a five-year
term.
</P>
<P>
   Before the election, one of the most divisive in Venezuelan
history, Chavez had been portrayed by the Venezuelan establishment
as a red menace intent on imposing an authoritarian regime. Most of
the country's entrepreneurs backed Salas Romer, a Yale-educated
businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Despite predictions of violence and vote fraud, the election was
relatively uneventful and was capped by a huge street party for
Chavez on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, Chavez' critics seemed to be coming to terms with his
victory, while Carter, who was in the country heading up a team of
international election observers, gave the former paratrooper a
warm endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said that Chavez' landslide win removed the ``stigma'' of
his role in a failed military uprising Feb. 4, 1992. Carter added
that he had ``no doubt'' that Chavez would be granted a visa to
enter the United States and that relations between the two nations
would be cordial. Oil-rich Venezuela, a nation of 23 million, is
the No. 1 supplier of crude oil to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez' earlier request for a visa was rejected by the State
Department due to his involvement in the coup, which nearly toppled
an elected Venezuelan government and left dozens of soldiers and
civilians dead.
</P>
<P>
   After spending two years and two months in prison, Chavez
received a presidential pardon. He went on to form a populist
political party that won widespread support from Venezuela's poor
majority, paving the the way for his victory Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in favor of coups,'' Carter said, ``but I think it's
accurate to point out that the president-elect was never convicted
of a crime. He was completely pardoned.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The stigma has been removed,'' Carter said, ``not only by
those facts ... but also by the endorsement of the people of his
country yesterday in one of the most overwhelmingly free
expressions of opinion that I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez' victory marked the end of 40 years of dominance by
Venezuela's two largest political parties, and some political
observers speculated that that the corruption-tainted, old-style
parties across Latin America may be on the way out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running scared. We have sweaty palms,'' said former
Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, whose Nationalist
Revolutionary Movement party was defeated in national elections
last year. ``Venezuela is something that will have a great
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   After a campaign in which Chavez portrayed himself as a man of
the poor and promised to ``fry the heads'' of corrupt politicians,
he toned down his rhetoric as election day approached. In fact, his
first message as president-elect was aimed at international
investors.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview Sunday night, Chavez ``guaranteed''
foreigners that their investment were safe in Venezuela. Later,
during a press conference, he announced plans to restructure
service payments on Venezuela's $55 billion foreign debt, and to
impose tighter controls over the semi-autonomous state-run oil
company.
</P>
<P>
   He also ruled out imposing monetary exchange controls, pledged
to cut government spending and to reduce the number of ministries
from 26 to 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legacy of a state that is accustomed to spend and spend
and spend in the name of (political) party patronage _ that's
over,'' Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to his working-class supporters, Chavez promised more
public housing, negotiations for wage increases and social programs
for street children.
</P>
<P>
   At times during his rambling, 90-minute press conference, Chavez
veered away from political issues to discuss sports, psychology and
nutrition. He made reference to the ``inner child'' of Venezuelans
and complained that the national diet contains too much
cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   All along, Chavez has said he has been the victim of a smear
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my adversaries try to use half-truths and lies to hurt
me in the election,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They created an image of Hugo Chavez that is not me, that I
was going to fry heads and expropriate everyone, so I understand
there is a lot of worry in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Soto, the executive director of the National Investment
Council in Caracas, called Chavez' macro-economic comments ``an
important message'' but cautioned that ``the world responds to
concrete actions.``
</P>
<P>
   But Michael May, a South America expert at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington, predicted that,
given the size of his victory, Chavez has won some breathing space
and that even his detractors now seem willing to give him a chance
to govern.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond, the chamber president, said, ``He has a lot of people
on his side, so the benefit of the doubt is in order.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were also warnings that Chavez must stick to the rules
of democracy. He has promised to rewrite the constitution, starting
early next year, and some analysts fear that the move could lead
the temporary closing of the courts and congress.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Carter warned against against any such move.
``There would be a negative reaction,'' he said, ``if
non-democratic principles were used to implement changes in the
constitution.''

NIGERIA JOURNAL: FROM `SECOND COMING' TO RUST AND RUIN  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ A decade after the death of Jesus of Oyingbo _
carpenter, property developer, religious visionary, husband to 34
wives, father to dozens _ the empire of the man who described
himself as the Second Coming lies in ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of his followers once lived on Manor Street, in
buildings called ``Merciful and Mighty'' and ``Everlasting
Father,'' surrounded by statues of Christ, Caterpillar tractors,
sculptures of lions and mermaids with water spurting from their
mouths.
</P>
<P>
   It was an empire befitting the man who, mixing Christianity,
paganism and profit, built his own church and popularized a
movement that has put independent churches seemingly on every
street corner in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   But today, in an otherwise well-kept neighborhood in this city
of 8 million people, weeds have pushed through the cracks in the
imperial courtyards. Dust has settled inside deserted buildings,
blanketing telltale relics of Jesus of Oyingbo's eclectic tastes:
videotapes with sometimes incomplete, handwritten titles, ``From
Russia With Love'' and ``Hawaii Five.''
</P>
<P>
   The only ones left are 30 of his children, who wander through
the remains, forlornly clutching pamphlets of their dead father's
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Seye Immanuel, a 28-year-old son, stood on a second-floor
balcony of the ``Prince of Peace'' building and pointed down to the
empty courtyard, where the followers used to gather to watch movies
every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``After he died, it stopped,'' Seye Immanuel said. ``Everything
stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   The center could not hold, and the place unraveled into factions
fighting over the man's legacy and money, pitting longtime members
against the children, mothers against sons and daughters. The
church fell apart in recent years, after the eldest son took the
longtime members to court.
</P>
<P>
   After winning his lawsuit last year, the eldest son, Olukayade
Immanuel, immediately evicted the members. As the legal owner of
all his father's property, he allowed the children to stay. But now
they accuse him of neglect and call him a thief.
</P>
<P>
   The eldest son _ a 56-year-old, sumo-size man with oven-mitt
hands that he likes to wrap around people's arms _ left his
father's church in search of personal freedom. And yet he seems to
crave his father's standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never have talked to my father the way they talk to
me,'' he said, adding that the children had violated the traditions
of the Yoruba, his ethnic group and one of the three main ones in
Nigeria. ``It's the way of Yorubaland. It's a structured culture.
It makes for order. Follow that man! Follow the man! Not doing your
own thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They do not show me respect as the senior man,'' he added. ``I
will not give money before respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesus of Oyingbo, whose real name was Olufunmilayo Odumosu
Immanuel, lived until age 73. He was working as a carpenter when he
founded the Universal College of Regeneration in the early 1950s.
Before moving to Manor Street, his movement was headquartered in
the neighborhood of Oyingbo, which gave him his lasting name.
</P>
<P>
   He sharpened the concept of religion as a private business, an
idea that seems commonplace now in Lagos and southern Nigeria. More
than 500 followers lived on his compound and worked in his
businesses: a bakery, restaurant, barber shop, construction company
and printing plant.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Yoruba, Jesus of Oyingbo was religiously tolerant,
mixing, for example, Christian statues with Islamic and pagan
symbols on his compound. But he was perhaps too tolerant, in ways
that drew accusations that he was operating a cult.
</P>
<P>
   Many Christian Nigerians have more than one wife. But he had 34
and had at least 40 children, said the children who remain on the
compound, many of whom share striking facial similarities with
their father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was kind and generous,'' said Olulaja Immanuel, 29. ``He
provided everything for me. When I wanted to go anywhere, we had
our own cars and drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   The drivers never let the children out of their sight. They were
so sheltered that most still live in isolation, incapable because
of their lack of education and social skills to venture much beyond
Manor Street.
</P>
<P>
   Bukola Immanuel, 25, was one of the few who was able to study,
thanks, she said, to her mother who had immigrated to New York City
and sent money. The young woman, an economics student at Lagos
State University, began having doubts after her father's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't accept him as my savior,'' she said. ``He's my
biological father. I have only Jesus Christ as my savior.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my father was OK,'' she added, ``but I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime neighbors recalled an ebullient, boisterous man who
made waves whenever he visited them, showing them movies with his
projector, ingratiating himself even as he transformed the area
into a carnival.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would crack jokes and make you reel with laughter from one
corner to another,'' Virginia Akerele, 83, said with a smile. ``He
and his followers used to disturb the neighborhood. Their voices
would be all over the place. They used to wake us up early in the
morning. We could not complain because that was his own way of
worshiping God. We now have some respite with his death.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Akerele and her stepson, Tunde Akerele, 54, both Roman
Catholics, said Jesus of Oyingbo never tired of trying to convert
them. And even as they resisted, they ate the bread from one of his
bakeries. ``His Good Luck bread was cheaper and better in quality
than others sold around,'' Akerele said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the reverend Fathers and Sisters from the nearby St.
Agnes Catholic Church used to come and buy his bread,'' Mrs.
Akerele said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was calling himself Jesus Christ and said he would never
die,'' she added. ``We were surprised that he died.''
</P>
<P>
   Not far from Manor Street, Olukayade Immanuel, the eldest son,
stood outside the gates of his textile factory and shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``For six years before I broke from him, I said, `You cannot
force religion on people,''' he said. ``I said, `You must send
these children to school.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``And look what happened!'' the eldest son said. ``Look at this
one. She's not even my father's daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Adeola Odumosu, a 24-year-old daughter, snickered. Just before
she and Seye Immanuel took a reporter to the factory, she had
called the eldest son ``greedy.'' ``He's wicked,'' she had said.
``He doesn't want to take care of us.'' Now, she pointed to the
factory and accused him directly of building it with their father's
money.
</P>
<P>
   The eldest son laughed. The younger children stood many feet
away from their brother and cowered when the big man turned
brusquely, his belly swaying under his robe.
</P>
<P>
   Just as abruptly, Olukayade Immanuel's mood brightened. He
expressed optimism about the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nigeria has survived, and my father's movement will survive,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   And even though neither of the younger siblings had shown him
any respect on this day, he asked them if they needed money and
called them in behind the gates.

SCHROEDER GIVES ECONOMY THAT OLD CONSENSUS TRY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN, Germany _ Consensus was long the backbone of Germany's
postwar economic boom, and Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder set out on
Monday to prove that it could form the basis of a fight against the
country's cripplingly high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 4 million Germans jobless, or 10.6 percent of the
work force, Schroeder summoned labor unions, employers and several
members of his Cabinet to a first meeting of a much-vaunted
``alliance for jobs.'' But the alliance looked tentative at best,
and its initial achievement little more than a list of good
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   As global competition has increased, while wage costs remained
high here, the economy _ based on both the free market and a high
level of social protection _ has frayed. The rich have grown
richer, but unemployment has risen to levels not seen since 1945.
Schroeder, who took office in October, will be judged largely on
his ability to get people back to work.
</P>
<P>
   His chosen method _ elaborate negotiations among unions,
employers and politicians _ amounts to an attempt to demonstrate
that the German model that has had great difficulty responding to
the challenges of the 1990s can be revived.
</P>
<P>
   With the introduction of a common European currency, the euro,
now imminent, Schroeder also wants to show that Europe's largest
economy can generate employment while preserving a high level of
social benefits and avoiding the wholesale deregulation that has
helped spur rapid job creation in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The excellent atmosphere at the talks makes me optimistic,''
Schroeder said after the meeting. ``This alliance is necessary to
meeting the challenges of an increasingly globalized economy and
will prove anything but a flash in the pan.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement said the parties, who will meet again next Feb. 25,
had agreed to strive to lower labor costs, to reform the broad but
costly social welfare system, to create more workplace flexibility,
to provide better access to venture capital for small companies and
possibly to lower the retirement age, now 65.
</P>
<P>
   All these measures have already been talked about for several
years in Germany _ former Chancellor Helmut Kohl started a similar
round of meetings in 1996 that led nowhere _ and it was not
immediately clear why there should be more success this time. In
practice, reform of pension, health and unemployment systems, the
cost of which add more than 40 percent to wage bills, has met
strong resistance from unions.
</P>
<P>
   The only concrete steps agreed upon on Monday were to move up
tax reforms for small and medium-sized companies from 2002 to 2000
and to create 100,000 training positions for young people. How
these positions would be found, and how they would be paid for, was
not specified.
</P>
<P>
   A real test of the will to compromise is likely to come in the
next few weeks as employers and unions confront each other over
wages. IG Metall, the union that has more than 2.7 million members
in the auto and engineering industries, has called for a 6.5
percent pay increase.

U.S. SCRAMBLES TO SAVE MIDEAST PEACE EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also ISRAEL-POLITICS)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States scrambled on Monday to keep the
October agreement between Israel and the Palestinians on track,
with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warning her Israeli
counterpart, Ariel Sharon, to adhere to the timetable set in the
agreement and not to add new conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Later on Monday, President Clinton dropped by a meeting between
Sharon and Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, and spent
about an hour discussing the new problems in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   With new violence breaking out and the Israeli government
coalition shaky, Clinton's weekend visit to the region is likely to
be devoted to damage control as much as to celebration, one
American official said. Clinton leaves on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In his news conference with Albright, Sharon repeated Israeli
warnings that the second phase of the agreement reached at Wye, Md.
_ requiring Israeli pullbacks from the West Bank in return for
specific Palestinian steps to combat terrorism _ could not go ahead
if the Palestinians did not keep their own commitments.
</P>
<P>
   He accused the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, of
``activating and encouraging'' what Sharon called a ``renewed
intifada, `` or uprising, that represents ``a very difficult and
critical obstacle to the continuation of the peace process, which
we all want to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Sharon again warned that if Arafat unilaterally declares
Palestinian statehood after May 4, 1999, when the steps toward
peace set out in the initial Israeli-Palestinian agreement in Oslo
are formally completed, Israel would annex parts of the West Bank
not yet given to the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see the process moving forward,'' Albright said at
a news conference here with Sharon, and she encouraged both sides
to bring their differences, about the most recent agreement and
everything else, to the negotiating table. ``Violence is not the
answer, differences need to be brought to the table and solutions
can only come from negotiations,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright dismissed questions about whether linton might postpone
his visit, saying that the visit itself is a part of the agreement.
Clinton is scheduled to attend a Dec. 14 meeting in Gaza at which
the Palestine National Council and other Palestinian groups are to
expunge formally from the Palestinian charter all clauses calling
for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon said that Clinton will be welcomed as a friend of Israel.
But he urged the president not to raise ``false expectations''
among Palestinians during his three-day visit.

TWO UTILITY DEALS COULD SPEED CONSOLIDATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., Utah, Wyo., Wash., Idaho, Calif., Mass.)  (lb) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two precedent-setting merger deals were announced Monday in the
U.S. electric power industry that could greatly accelerate the
consolidation among utilities. The deals are certain to receive
careful regulatory scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed takeover of Pacificorp, a major utility in the
Northwest, by Scottish Power PLC, one of the largest utilities in
Britain, would mark the first purchase of a major U.S. utility by a
foreign company. Scottish Power has slashed thousands of jobs at
its own operations, and analysts expect it to make cuts at
Pacificorp.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed merger of BEC Energy, the parent of Boston Edison,
which serves the Boston area, and Commonwealth Energy System, which
is based in Cambridge, Mass., would be the first between adjacent
utilities that only transmit and distribute power.
</P>
<P>
   How the combinations would affect consumers is unclear. Some
analysts, economists and leaders of consumer groups said Monday,
however, that the combinations could lead to strong new competitors
that would become more efficient and eventually be able to pass
more savings on to consumers and higher returns to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Scottish Power said Monday that it was acquiring Pacificorp in a
stock swap worth $7.9 billion based on Scottish Power's closing
price last Friday, when its shares cost 675 pence in London.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would pay 2.32 Scottish Power shares for
each Pacificorp share, worth about $25.85 at Friday's closing price
and well above its $20.75 closing price Friday. But Scottish
Power's shares fell 66 pence Monday to 609 pence and Pacificorp
shares ended down 18.75 cents at $20.5625.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed merger of BEC Energy and Commonwealth Energy
System, the companies will form a new holding company in a
transaction valued at $950 million.
</P>
<P>
   BEC shareholders can choose to get one share of Commonwealth
Energy stock, or $44.10 in cash, for each share they own.
Commonwealth shareholders can choose either $44.10 in cash or 1.05
shares of the new company for each share they now own.
</P>
<P>
   BEC stock closed Monday at $41, down $1, and shares of
Commonwealth Energy closed at $39.875, up $2.0625.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rubin, an analyst with Bear, Stearns, said the Scottish
Power acquisition of Pacificorp would face ``an arduous regulatory
process.'' If it goes through, he said, other large European
utilities such as Powergen PLC of Britain and Tractebel of Belgium
would likely pursue acquisitions in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficult part is that it would be precedent-setting,''
said Robert K. Johnson, the executive director of the Electric
Consumers Alliance, an umbrella group representing 260 consumer
groups around the country. ``Who owns essential infrastructure in
the United States is an acute issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Both transactions will lead to reductions in duplicate staff and
offices.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Robinson, the chief executive of Scottish Power, which has
cut its staff in the last four years from 10,000 to 5,000, said
that reductions in the staff of Pacificorp, based in Portland,
Ore., would be a key component of improving efficiency.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pacificorp, with 1.4 million customers in Oregon, Utah, Wyoming,
Washington, Idaho and California, has one of the largest
transmission systems in the nation and owns coal-fired and
geothermal plants that can produce 8,300 megawatts of power. It is
one of the biggest sellers of wholesale power in the nation.
Earnings have been reduced recently because of losses in trading in
the wholesale market where prices have been very volatile.
</P>
<P>
   Scottish Power was advised by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and
Pacificorp was advised by Salomon Smith Barney International.
</P>
<P>
   Under a deregulation plan implemented by Massachusetts, BEC
Energy and Commonwealth Energy have had to sell their generating
plants and become companies that only transmit power and service
their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Ashok Gupta, an economist with the Natural Resources Defense
Council, an environmental group, said that while the merger will
lead to further cost savings and a more efficient system, the
benefit to customers will depend on how regulators oversee the
utilities.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Iran is scouring the former Soviet Union to hire
scientists who once worked in Moscow's huge germ warfare program
and has succeeded in recruiting several to take jobs in Tehran,
according to Russian scientists and American officials.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian officials who report directly to the leadership of the
Islamic state have approached dozens of scientists who once made
germ weapons, offering as much as $5,000 a month to people who earn
far less than that a year in the increasingly chaotic Russian
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Russian scientists say that most of these entreaties have been
rebuffed. But they acknowledge that at least five of their
colleagues have gone to work in Iran in recent years. Others have
accepted contracts that allow them to continue living in Russia
while conducting research for Tehran, the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in Russia and neighboring Kazakhstan, more than a
dozen former germ warriors reported contacts with Iran, and two
said they had been asked specifically to help Tehran make
biological weapons. American officials say that many more Russian
scientists have revealed such contacts and believe Iran is
developing a germ arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has powerful reasons to want such weapons and even
expressed interest in acquiring them a decade ago. Most Iranians
believe that Iraq used biological, as well as chemical, weapons in
the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980's, and many countries in the region,
including Israel, Syria and Iraq, are suspected of having germ
arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   Gholamhossein Dehghani, counselor to Iran's mission to the
United Nations, said that many foreign scientists worked in his
country, but were doing only peaceful research. He also stressed
that Iran had ratified a 1972 international treaty banning germ
warfare. He said he ``categorically rejected'' the claim that Iran
is hiring Russian biologists to work on germ warfare. ``We do not
believe that having such weapons increases our security.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Iranian officials have said Iran's research is being
conducted for purely peaceful purposes. But veterans of the Soviet
and American germ programs dismiss such claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's often hard to distinguish between a drug and a weapon, or
between offensive or defensive research,'' said Lev Sandakhchiev,
the director of the state laboratory known as Vector, which made
deadly viruses for weapons in Soviet times. ``What counts is
intent. And that complicates trust.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials say Tehran's recruiting successes are
troubling because they suggest that the people who were crucial to
the once-secret Soviet germ weapons program, which at its height
employed some 70,000 scientists and technicians, are in danger of
being lured away by anyone with enough influence or cash, including
rogue states and even terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   An important figure in the Iranian buying network, Russian
scientists and western officials say, is Mehdi Rezayat, an
English-speaking pharmacologist in Tehran who works directly for
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami as a ``scientific adviser,''
according to his business card, which was provided by a Russian
scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Russians approached by the Iranians say the recruitment style
alone raises suspicions. Visiting delegations, they said, are
sometimes led by Iranian clerics, who wield ultimate power in
Iran's theocracy, and other nonscientists who are studiously
ambiguous about what, precisely, they want the Russian scientists
to do.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Iranians on other occasions have shown particular
interest in learning about microbes that can be used in war to
destroy or protect crops, as well as genetic engineering techniques
that are vital both to legitimate research and to making deadly
germs for which there may be no antidotes.
</P>
<P>
   American officials assert that Tehran's biowarfare program may
have already turned some germs and toxins into weapons, but they
have scant information on Iran's progress. There is direct
evidence, the officials said, that Russia has significantly
improved Iran's missile and nuclear capabilities, but the value of
Russian assistance to biological programs is less clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside assistance is both important and difficult to prevent,
given the dual-use nature of the materials and equipment being
sought,'' the CIA said recently in a report on Iran and its
biological weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   To counter recruiting efforts by Iranians and others, the United
States has quietly launched an effort to become the largest and
best-funded competitor for the allegiance of Russia's former germ
warriors. Washington is sponsoring scientist-to-scientist
exchanges, joint research projects, and programs to convert
laboratories and institutes once associated with the Soviet germ
program to civilian use.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with a modest base of less than $10 million dollars,
the United States expects to spend at least double that sum next
year, trying to keep Russian scientists gainfully and peaceably
employed at home and the countering efforts not only of Iran, but
also of North Korea, Syria, and China to lure biological talent and
technology to their countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a high-stakes game to win the hearts and minds of
Russia's best scientists, who are dangerous simply because of what
they know,'' said Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., who recently visited
former Russian weapons sites now engaged in peaceful research.

CLINTON DEFENSE PROBABLY WILL MAKE LITTLE DIFFERENCE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
and JOHN C. HENRY 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawyers for President Clinton will present his
defense to the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, but their
arguments and testimony from 14 scheduled witnesses over the next
two days is not likely to head off Republican efforts to impeach
him for his conduct in the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said Monday that
independent counsel Kenneth Starr has already built ``a compelling
case'' against Clinton alleging perjury, obstruction of justice and
abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   Although he said he is still open to hearing evidence from the
Clinton camp that will repudiate ``the facts'' presented thus far,
Hyde made it clear the committee will likely vote out at least one
article of impeachment by week's end.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman also said the Democrats had failed ``to contradict
in any way whatsoever`` the evidence of impeachable offenses
against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House and the Democratic committee members' response
to the (Starr) referral has been Shakespearian _ full of sound and
fury signifying nothing,'' Hyde added.
</P>
<P>
   He met with reporters as the White House released a letter to
the committee outlining its plans to call 14 witnesses in an
attempt to persuade the panel of 21 Republicans and 16 Democrats
not to take action that could lead to the president's removal from
office.
</P>
<P>
   The witness list was released Monday along with a softer line
from the White House about cooperating with the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to dropping witnesses who would have continued to
attack the credibility of Starr's investigation, presidential
spokesman Joe Lockhart sought to placate Republican lawmakers
angered by Clinton's legalistic answers to 81 questions posed by
Hyde to the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We answered those questions in good faith,'' Lockhart said.
``We certainly regret those who took offense by the way we answered
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton's team would address Starr's report ``but
mostly in the context of exculpatory evidence that was not used in
the referral and some issues where there are some questions of
interpretation of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Clinton witnesses are three former members of the
House Judiciary Committee that voted to impeach President Nixon:
the Rev. Robert Drinan, a Roman Catholic priest and former
Massachusetts Democrat; Elizabeth Holtzman, D-N.Y.; and Wayne
Owens, D-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Also scheduled to testify are former Attorney General Nicholas
Katzenbach, Yale law professor Bruce Ackerman, Princeton history
professor Sean Wilentz and Harvard government professor Samuel H.
Beer, who will discuss the ``historical precedents and
constitutional standards'' for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   A third panel of witnesses will evaluate the evidence gathered
by Starr and contrast it to the process used in the Watergate
investigation. That group will include former Watergate prosecutor
Richard Ben-Veniste.
</P>
<P>
   The last witnesses called will be five former federal
prosecutors, including former Treasury Department chief of
enforcement Ronald Noble. They will discuss prosecutorial standards
for obstruction of justice and perjury. Another former Watergate
prosecutor, Richard Davis, will answer questions on that panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two days to make a case here, and we will spend a good
bit of time talking about the constitutional issues (of
impeachment),'' Lockhart said. ``We will discuss what our view of
both the facts and the law are at great length.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House asked for three or four days to present the
president's defense. But Hyde, under some pressure to wrap up the
impeachment inquiry before Christmas, held Clinton's legal team to
a total of 30 hours over two days. Under those guidelines, the
hearings could run until midnight today and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the panel's GOP members have already made it clear that
they intend to vote for at least one article of impeachment either
accusing the president of perjury, obstruction of justice or abuse
of his presidential powers. The only question that remains is what
the final impeachment resolution will say and whether the White
House can attract enough Republicans to defeat the measure on the
House floor next week.
</P>
<P>
   Articles of impeachment have already been drafted by Republican
lawyers, but won't be finalized until after Clinton's defense. The
articles include charges of perjury in connection with a court
document he signed last December denying a relationship with
Lewinsky, a deposition he gave Jan. 17 in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment lawsuit, and his videotaped testimony Aug. 17 before the
federal grand jury investigating the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   They also include charges of obstructing justice in which
Clinton is accused of interfering with Starr's investigation by
trying to get Lewinsky to deny their relationship, hiding gifts
they exchanged, and coaching his secretary Betty Currie to say he
and Lewinsky were never alone.
</P>
<P>
   In his news conference, Hyde said that he has not ruled out
allowing a vote on censure as an alternative to impeachment. But he
suggested that the Republicans on the committee were unlikely to go
along with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't ruled out, but it's not a dead-bang certainty
either,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle said Monday that the
outcome of a vote in the full House is too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   But even if a majority of House members support impeachment, it
would still take a two-thirds majority in the Senate to convict and
remove Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., one of the moderates who
opposes impeachment, said ``more contrition'' from the president
would help persuade more GOP members to support him. He encouraged
Clinton to drop his legal arguments and admit to lying under oath
about his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president committed crimes. I think they are
serious crimes. But I don't think he committed impeachable
offenses,'' Shays said.

MOSCOW: peaceful research.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Russian scientists who have been courted by Iran describe what
amounts to a fairly predictable recruiting pattern. First, they
say, there is a call, sometimes from a Russian colleague, or a
faxed letter from an Iranian scientist that proposes a visit. Then
there are initial discussions of vague scientific cooperation and
hints of large sums of money.
</P>
<P>
   At subsequent sessions or in follow-up calls, letters and faxes,
specific invitations to visit Iran are issued, and the Iranians
begin discussing their needs more bluntly. Often, they said, the
weapons question is raised through hints and implication.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Persian Gulf war, Russian scientists said,
Iran attempted to recruit Russian biological talent from leading
germ laboratories. The effort largely failed, the scientists said,
and Rezayat and other Iranian agents turned their attention to
smaller institutes.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Gennadi Lepyoshkin, the former director of
Stepnogorsk, a sprawling germ weapons plant in Kazakhstan, said
that he had been approached in 1991 by Iranian middle men who
presented themselves as private entrepreneurs interested in
establishing commercial contacts. ``But their proposals were such
that we immediately declined and ceased contact with them,'' said
Lepyoshkin, whose plant once specialized in developing and
producing anthrax weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say the Iranians' 1997 visit to the All-Russian
Institute of Phytopathology in Golitsino, which is about 30 miles
west of Moscow, was typical of approaches to smaller institutes
involved in the Soviet germ program.
</P>
<P>
   Under communism, the institute made pathogens that would kill
crops, thus starving their enemies. But since the collapse of the
Soviet Union, it has struggled to do purely peaceful research. In
the past seven years, its staff has dropped from 1200 to 276, and
employees are paid only intermittently. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hard times, the institute has become a leader in
pesticide research and in transgenic plants, whose genes are
manipulated to resist certain herbicides, insects and diseases. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, one of its scientists bumped into an Iranian
while visiting a Moscow-based laboratory. The man was Rezayat, and
his business card described him as the director of Tehran Medical
Sciences University's pharmacology department and also as a
scientific adviser to the Office of Scientific and Industrial
Studies of Presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rezayat seemed to have visited most labs and institutes in the
area,'' recalled the Russian scientist, who invited him to come to
Golitsino and meet his colleagues. Eventually, a five-man Iranian
delegation made the trip and met, among others, Yuri Spiridonov, a
crop expert who is now head of the herbicide department.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranians expressed great interest in scientific exchanges
between Russia and Iran, according to Spiridonov.
</P>
<P>
   He told the Iranians he had no objection in principle to such
collaboration. But the delegation made Spiridonov nervous. For one
thing, he said, only half of the Iranians were scientists. ``The
others just sat their with their hands folded and said nothing,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, they asked ``troubling'' questions about
substances related to biological warfare. Spiridonov declined to
elaborate.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``These were not scientific questions,'' he recounted 18 months
later in an interview in that same office.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wary of his guests' intentions and fearful of endangering his
growing ties to Western scientists and companies, Spiridonov
declined invitations to visit Tehran or to discuss his research in
any detail. But three of the institute's other scientists did visit
Tehran, and invitations keep coming _ including another last month.
</P>
<P>
   Rezayat, reached by phone in Moscow on Sunday and asked about
allegations that he was helping to recruit Russian scientists for
germ warfare, said he could say nothing without Tehran's approval.
He added that such claims were both common and spurious. He
promised to seek permission. On Monday, his assistant said that
Rezayat was no longer in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials identify Rezayat as a key official in the
biology branch of an Iranian office that covertly shops for talent
and technology involving nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
It also has responsibilities for public health.
</P>
<P>
   That office, said Ahmad Hashim, a Middle East expert who is a
consultant for the U.S. government, is well known for its
relentless pursuit of expertise and technology in deadly weaponry,
and not just in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are definitely hunters,'' an American official agreed. &QL;

 MOSCOW: official agreed. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the scientists Rezayat courted last year was Valery
Lipkin, a biochemist and deputy head of the Shemyakin and
Ovchinnikov Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The institute, built with Soviet Ministry of Defense funds, used
to do research on vaccines and biological toxins. Though it is
struggling financially, it still has valuable assets, including a
laboratory where advanced vaccines and other biological agents not
designed for military use are tested on animals.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, Lipkin met in the institute's branch in
Pushchino, about an hour outside of Moscow, with a six-man Iranian
delegation that included Rezayat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Iranians seemed to defer to a senior cleric in a black
turban and flowing robe, the Russians said.
</P>
<P>
   His name was Mahmoud Hosseini and his business card in Russian
identified him as the general secretary of the Iranian Society's
Office of Scientific-Technical Cooperation with the Russian
Federation, based in Tehran. The Iranian embassy in Moscow said
that Hosseini was a diplomat who held the title of first secretary
for Economic Affairs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The meeting went well, Lipkin said in an interview at his
sprawling Moscow headquarters, though some things struck him as
odd.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said the mullah, though well educated, was not a scientist.
And though the Iranians spoke of possible exchanges of students and
technology and seemed willing to pay handsomely for them, the
delegation was vague about what it wanted.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing they repeatedly asked about,'' said Sergei Feofanov,
Lipkin's deputy, ``was human genetic engineering.''
</P>
<P>
   In germ weaponry, the prospect of targeting human genes is the
most chilling possibility of all, military experts agree. In
theory, genetic engineering could produce ethnic weapons that kill
or cripple selectively by race and nationality. Such developments,
if they are possible, would be years away.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 18 months, the Iranians made three visits to the
Shemyakin institute, Lipkin said. But they never responded to his
offer to train Iranian students in Russia. Instead, they bombarded
the institute with invitations to younger researchers, asking them
to come to Tehran for a year or longer to teach genetic engineering
and other advanced techniques.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was also a personal invitation faxed to Lipkin from Abbas
Keshavarz, deputy chief of a research organization in Iran's
Agriculture Ministry. It invited him to visit Iran to discuss
possible ``future collaboration.'' A copy was sent to Rezayat's
office.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to discuss weapons,'' said Lipkin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``So I kept pressing them, `What will I do in Tehran? What is my
program?''' Lipkin said. ``But they would not tell me. And that
made me nervous. For while they were cautious here, had I gone
there, I think they would have raised weapons and other
inappropriate topics.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lipkin said that before refusing the offer, he had sought advice
from a friend at the Russian Ministry of Science, who warned him
that an Iranian visa in Lipkin's Russian passport would not enhance
his prospects of cooperation with American scientists _ especially
if the trip was sponsored by Rezayat.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Iran has succeeded in attracting several Russian biologists to
Tehran, said colleagues who, in recent interviews, named them. One
is said to be Valeri Bakayev, a senior biologist at the Institute
of Medical Biotechnology in Moscow who accepted a teaching post in
Iran more than seven years ago, one colleague said. A spokesman for
the Moscow institute said she had no idea where Bakayev had gone
after leaving his post.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another scientist said that Vladimir Rishinski, an expert at the
Institute of Molecular Biology, recently took a second
leave-of-absence to go to Iran for two months of teaching. His
institute, which a former senior Soviet official said conducted
research in biological weapons, said he was ``on leave'' for an
``extended vacation,'' that did not involve Iran. But his mother,
reached by phone, said her son was in fact in Iran.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another Russian scientist said that during a visit to Tehran
last year he encountered three former colleagues from the Institute
of Biological Protection in Moldova who had already been in Tehran
for about six months. They described the working conditions they
had left behind in Moldova. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me their institute had neither heat nor electricity,
never mind money for salaries or research,'' the scientist
recalled. ``Russian scientists may not trust or like Iranians,'' he
added. ``But these are not love matches. They are marriages of
convenience, and often, of necessity.''  &QL;

 MOSCOW: of necessity.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is now known that the Soviet Union built the most
pestilential biological arsenal of all time. At the program's peak,
Russian and Western experts say, scientists at scores of sites
studied some 50 biological agents and prepared a dozen or so for
war. Bombers and intercontinental missiles were ready to
disseminate hundreds of tons of smallpox, plague and anthrax,
enough to wipe out entire nations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many of these biological agents were developed and tested at
Vector, formally the State Research Center of Virology and
Biotechnology, which made deadly viruses in Siberia; the State
Research Center for Applied Microbiology, or Obolensk, near Moscow,
where lethal bacteria were perfected and Stepnogorsk, a sprawling
germ factory in Kazakhstan, which specialized in deadly anthrax.
</P>
<P>
   This proud scientific elite was part of a culture that had a
deep historic distrust of Islamic regimes, which threatened to
undermine the Soviet empire. Thus, any current Iranian successes
are all the more striking.
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of Soviet Communism, these scientific
centers, as well as far smaller ones, have seen their operating
budgets slashed and research money disappear. But institute
directors say they have fought to keep their top scientific talent
intact, dismissing junior scientists and technical workers instead.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even top scientists have been tempted to sell their
expertise. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Igor Domaradskij, a founder of the main Soviet program to make
germ weapons, lives in a spacious apartment in a fashionable part
of Moscow, a reminder of the special privileges and status he once
enjoyed as director of the anti-plague institutes in Irkutsk and
Rostov-on-Don and later, a key figure at Obolensk.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But his doorbell consists of two wires that must be twisted
together to ring, and his preoccupation with earning a living is a
theme of the ``The Troublemaker,'' his memoir of his years as a
germ warrior. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Domaradskij, 73, said he lives off his pension and his savings.
And he is fortunate in having a computer and e-mail that connect
him to scientists outside Russia. But he disclosed in his book that
he was so desperate for work in 1992 that he offered his services
to China, Russia's longtime rival, as well as to the Kalmyk
Republic inside Russia. Neither responded, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economic chaos, which worsened with the collapse last
August of the ruble, has taken a huge toll on nearly all of the
institutes once lavishly funded by the biological bureaucracy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Obolensk, one of the top former centers, lost 54
percent of its staff between 1990 and 1996 but only 28 percent of
its top scientists, according to the institute's figures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prospects may seem better almost anywhere else to the scientists
at institute after institute, who work wrapped in layers of
sweaters in unheated buildings and get no pay for months on end.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Like everyone else, we're just trying to survive,'' said
Eugeniy A. Nepoklonov, 42, the director of Narvac, an animal
vaccine company founded in 1990 which employs some 50 scientists,
many from the former weapons program. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Narvac, with $3 million in total sales, is testing a vaccine
against hog cholera that would be Russia's first
genetically-engineered animal vaccine. The laboratory has great
hopes for the product, if it can survive Russia's economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government has sent mixed signals about the Iranian
overtures.
</P>
<P>
   In May of 1997, Moscow went so far as to sponsor a biotechnology
trade fair in Tehran. More than 100 leading biologists from Russian
institutes that once were part of the germ-warfare program,
including Vector and Obolensk, the two most prominent facilities,
participated as guests of the Islamic republic.
</P>
<P>
   And President Boris Yeltsin has kept in senior civilian
biotechnology posts several key military figures from the old
Soviet germ program, some of whom are openly hostile to the growing
cooperation between American and Russian scientists. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has embraced the Clinton Administration's programs to
forge closer ties between American and Russian scientists even as
it allows some institutes to strike commercial deals with Iran. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vector for example, has been permitted to sell diagnostic kits
for hepatitis to Iran. But the institute has refused Iranian
requests for broader technological cooperation or the exchange of
dangerous strains, according to American officials and
Sandakhchiev, Vector's head.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very fine line between good and bad dealings,'' he
said, ``which is why I am concerned about the challenge of
bioterrorism.'' &QL;

FASHION NOTES AND NEWS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fit for a First Lady &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton may be the first first lady to pose for
the cover of Vogue, appearing in the December issue, but that
doesn't mean her gown is treated differently from those of other
cover models. The design is for sale. Readers wishing to own a
dress of their own _ a burgundy velvet design by Oscar de la Renta
_ may do so by special order. So, how many have bought it?
</P>
<P>
   De la Renta modified the gown, chosen by Anna Wintour, Vogue's
editor in chief, from one in his fall haute couture line for Pierre
Balmain, removing the train from it. The original costs $19,600;
the de-trained version, $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the first lady, who is a size 8, paid for hers, de la Renta
said. ``She pays our company the wholesale price,'' he said, ``and
what she buys is ready-to-wear. She cannot afford to buy haute
couture.'' (At normal wholesale prices for designer clothes, or 53
percent of retail, it cost Mrs. Clinton about $2,120.)
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswomen for the three stores where the dress will be
available _ Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus _
said that there have been inquiries about it but that no one had
placed an order yet. De la Renta is not discouraged. He plans to
include it in his ready-to-wear line for fall 1999, available in
stores next June and July.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Handbags for a Cause &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The elephant-head minaudiere with garnet eyes and rhinestone
tusks created by Judith Leiber and once owned by Nancy Reagan may
be the most politically appropriate accessory at Sotheby's
first-ever auction of handbags Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Reagan, who is donating it, is not expected to attend the
auction, a benefit for Community Research Initiative on AIDS, to
see whether it brings in the estimate of $3,000 to $4,000. But
other donors have told Tiffany Dubin, Sotheby's fashion department
director, that they will be there when the sale begins at 6:30.
They include Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece, her sister Alexandra
Von Furstenberg, Anne Bass, Helena Bonham Carter and Patty
Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   Their gifts are in the first 37 lots of celebrity-donated bags,
which also include a green leaf-patterned silk crepe bag worn by
Madonna to the London premiere of ``Evita.'' Its estimated sale
price: $1,000 to $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dubin says the sale will make it possible for the AIDS group
to pack its bags and move to a new site. She expects 600 bidders.
Gucci, Hermes, Ms. Leiber and Louis Vuitton represent more than
half of the labels.
</P>
<P>
   Collecting high-fashion accessories as an investment may have
been spurred by the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis auction, but the
real impetus may be the difficulty in finding things with great
craftmanship. ``It's getting more and more difficult to find
clothes and accessories handmade with the same care as the old
artisans created,'' Ms. Dubin said. ``Besides, people love
collecting things as social history.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; New Designer at Barneys &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The game of musical chairs set in motion when Alber Elbaz left
the Paris design house of Guy Laroche in November to become the new
ready-to-wear designer for Yves Saint Laurent continues. Elbaz's
replacement, Ronald Van der Kemp, who was the designer of the
in-house collection for Barneys New York, was succeeded last week
by Behnaz Sarafpour, the former senior design director for Isaac
Mizrahi.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sarafpour recently found herself out of a job when Mizrahi
closed down. Despite reports of lagging Mizrahi sales at many
stores, Judy Collinson, an executive vice president at Barneys,
called the Mizrahi business there ``wonderful.'' ``We obviously
have the customer for his clothes, and we look to grow that
business with Behnaz,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Collinson said that Barneys also plans to increase sales of
its in-house line substantially in the next two to five years. A
typical jacket is $495 to $1,200, depending on fabric.
</P>
<P>
   And how does Ms. Sarafpour's former boss assess her talent?
``She is better at what I was supposed to do than I was,'' Mizrahi
said.

DOLLAR IS WEAPON OF CHOICE IN WAR ON BACTERIAL PERILS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With IRAN-GERM-WARFARE) 
(htv) 
 By JUDITH MILLER with WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In Russia's scientific despair, the United States has
sensed great danger and opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have been worried about Russia's weapons
programs from the moment the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
Initially, the focus was on improving security for nuclear weapons
and scientists. The germ warfare program was hardly considered.
</P>
<P>
   That changed after several top scientists from the former Soviet
biological weapons program defected to the West and told
intelligence officials that the program was far more lethal and
ambitious than had been suspected during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon's request, and with its money, the National
Academy of Sciences began a program in 1995 to expand cooperation
between Russian and American biologists. Eager to stem the brain
drain, discover more about the Soviet germ arsenal, and learn from
the Russian strides in biological defenses, the Clinton
administration has now greatly intensified the effort.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Washington is paying $1.5 million now and plans to
spend up to $6 million to upgrade security at Vector, which is
Russia's germ bank for all strains of smallpox, which has been
eradicated in humans.
</P>
<P>
   While fewer than 120 of the more than 15,000 strains in Vector's
virus collection are highly lethal, scientists say any theft or
diversion of the most dangerous ones could be catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has also persuaded Europe and Japan to join
the United States in financing the International Science and
Technology Center, based in Moscow, which tries to find peaceful
work for former weapons scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Randall Beatty, the center's deputy director, said about 1,055
of the 17,800 scientists receiving payments of $300 to $500 a month
for joint research are biologists. That proportion has grown
sharply from less than 1 percent of the center's payments to about
15 percent this year, and Beatty said it ``will inevitably grow
further.''
</P>
<P>
   While the payments are less than what the Iranians are said to
be offering, American officials believe the stipends are attractive
because they allow Russian scientists to stay in their country with
friends and family and to collaborate with respected Western
researchers on peaceful work.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said these contacts and exchanges are
providing valuable information about both the Soviet Union's
biological programs and current research in Russia. ``There has
been a quantum leap in their openness in the past 18 months,''
Beatty said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is spending millions of dollars on
more than a dozen programs essentially intended to make former
Soviet scientists and research institutes ``a better offer'' than
Iran or other rogue nations, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to them to chose,'' said Anne Harrington, the State
Department's coordinator for threat reduction programs, ``and many
of them are deciding they want to work with us.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials say the rudimentary programs have already
achieved some successes.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific institute at Obolensk, the heart of the program
to produce deadly germs, has had no contact with Tehran since last
year when the United States greatly expanded its financial support.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 10 months close to a hundred Russian scientists from
the former Soviet germ warfare program have visited American labs
and institutes, and more than a hundred American scientists and
officials have visited, many of them on several occasions, the
formerly off-limits Russian biological institutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Agriculture, at the Pentagon's request,
succeeded in buying samples of Uzbekistan's entire collection of
plant germs, helping to track strains and create antidotes.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say the threat remains significant, and that
they are learning every day about new efforts to capitalize on
Russia's economic crisis and scientific brain drain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like the little Dutch boy running around with my fingers
in the dike,'' said a Pentagon official during a recent field trip.
``Every time we visit a new Russian institute, we find another
Iranian business card.''

CASTRO CRITICIZES HIS OLD FRIEND, MEXICO  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM DILLON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Fidel Castro has long kept a special place in his
heart for Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Mexico stood alone among Latin American countries,
defying Washington's entreaties to break relations with Communist
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two decades of Castro's revolution, Mexico was the
only major Latin country whose guerrillas he refused to train.
Castro even held his tongue in recent years, as Mexico has mostly
abandoned its ``anti-Yankee'' foreign policy in favor of closer
economic integration with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, Castro suddenly abandoned his discretion.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing an economic conference in Havana, he derided
contemporary Mexican policies, criticizing the North American Free
Trade Agreement, accusing the Mexican government of turning its
back on the third world and of letting American culture overwhelm
Mexican traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they ask Mexican children,'' Castro said, ```Who is the
father of your country?' it's possible that many don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But they sure know Mickey Mouse,'' he added, to the nervous
titters of diplomats and economists.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Rosario Green, who recently made a cordial
visit to Havana, called in the Cuban ambassador, Curbelo Padron, to
express ``deep puzzlement'' over the outburst and called the
Mexican envoy in Cuba back here for consultations.
</P>
<P>
   A congressman from President Ernesto Zedillo's governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party, Francisco Javier Santillan
Oceguera, called Castro's remarks an intervention in Mexico's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Foreign Affairs Committee in Congress,
Julio Faesler, urged Castro to ``keep in mind that we Mexicans feel
sorry about the lack of success he's had with his own economic
development.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts suggested that Castro had aimed his remarks at
former president Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who engineered the
Nafta accord. But there was little evidence of that, because
Salinas visited Havana recently and seems to enjoy excellent
relations with Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts suggested that Castro, sensing the PRI's potential
defeat in presidential elections in 2000, was currying favor with
opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   Edelmiro Castellanos, a Cuban journalist here, saw a wider
motive: that Castro was seeking to rebuild bridges to leftists all
over Latin America, many of whom have grown disenchanted with him.
``His image with the left is in tatters,'' Castellanos said.
</P>
<P>
   A Brazilian Socialist, Luiz Inacio da Silva, whose movement has
included some of Castro's most enthusiastic supporters, criticized
Castro this fall because the Cuban has forged cozy relations with
the Brazilian government, which da Silva views as conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Castro's backing among prominent Mexican intellectuals has
cooled in recent years. A political scientist, Sergio Aguayo, has
traced Mexican leftists' irritation back to 1988 when Castro was
one of the few world leaders who supported PRI claims that Salinas
had legitimately won presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   When Castro attended Salinas' inauguration, Aguayo and other
intellectuals were invited to meet him at dinner. Castro launched
into a long monologue about the time that he spent in Mexico in
1956, preparing his insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an offensive situation,'' Aguayo said.

LIVINGSTN LETS DELAY DO THE MESSY WORK ON IMPEACHMENT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, La., Tenn., Mich., Calif., N.Y.)   (Eds: See also IMPEACH, IMPEACH-CLINTON) 
(mk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the third-ranking House
Republican, whips and wheedles his colleagues toward impeaching
President Clinton, he seems to be filling the space between the
departure of Speaker Newt Gingrich and the arrival of Speaker-to-be
Robert Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   But as crucial votes approach, it is increasingly clear that
DeLay is filling not so much a leadership vacuum as a need of the
new speaker. Livingston is more than happy to let DeLay take the
lead on impeachment, and to pressure undecided moderate Republicans
by denying them a vote on a censure alternative.
</P>
<P>
   While DeLay's power has grown, not diminished, since the
disastrous midterm elections that cost Gingrich his job, House
Republicans say it is inconceivable that Livingston of Louisiana
would let DeLay of Texas maintain such a high public profile if he
did not approve of the Texan's tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``DeLay's role gives Livingston the chance to be a statesman,''
said Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., who is a close Livingston ally.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Livingston has been busy courting conservatives
wary of his tendency to cut deals with Democrats. He is
strengthening ties with his leadership lieutenants, like DeLay, the
chief Republican vote counter. And he is opening a long-closed door
to conservative Democrats, beckoning them to join Republicans on
addressing issues from Social Security to tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   What Livingston does not want, in the weeks leading up to his
formal assumption of the speaker's job next month, is to be
remembered as the man who let Bill Clinton off. Nor, with an eye on
a future when Clinton may still be president, does he want to be
known as a fanatic for impeachment. For those reasons, he gives
DeLay lots of running room _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a strategy, a psychology, for someone in a leadership
position to take a leadership point of view,'' said Rep. Joe
Knollenberg, R-Mich., a Livingston supporter.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's frontal assault spares Livingston the messy infighting
with House Democrats and the White House _ at least until the House
Judiciary Committee sends articles of impeachment to the House
floor later this week _ and postpones Livingston's crucial decision
on whether to allow a censure vote if impeachment fails.
</P>
<P>
   While publicly pooh-poohing his influence, DeLay acknowledged as
much on Sunday. ``Gingrich is referring and deferring to Bob
Livingston, and Bob is waiting for the report to come from the
committee before he decides,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's Capitol Hill office is humming with the buzz of
impeachment. Squadrons of young aides are readying their
speed-dialers to summon lawmakers back to vote on one or more
articles of impeachment the week of Dec. 14. Staff members are
clearing their desks to give dozens of Republican lawmakers who are
retiring or lost their elections _ and lost their offices _ a place
to pen notes and call colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   With Livingston lying low, Gingrich all but gone and Rep. Dick
Armey, R-Texas, the majority leader, still licking his wounds from
a bruising fight to keep his leadership job, DeLay has filled the
breach, using his vaunted whip operation to lead the impeachment
charge against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The very fact that DeLay, a pugnacious, steely-eyed son of an
oil driller, is virtually alone among his fellow House Republican
bosses on the impeachment stage, is tilting the way the drama is
playing out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you combine his leadership role and ability to count
votes, and his personal feelings on this issue, it'd be hard for
him not to be a central player,'' said Rep. Howard McKeon,
R-Calif., one of DeLay's assistant whips.
</P>
<P>
   A hard-core conservative with close ties to the Christian right,
DeLay painted a bull's-eye on Bill Clinton soon after the scandal
involving Monica Lewinsky broke in January. He was one of the first
Republicans to call on Clinton to resign, and in August, when other
Republicans were shying away from challenging Clinton, DeLay
brought his whip staff back from vacation to go on the attack.
</P>
<P>
   His office acted as a congressional scandal clearinghouse,
sending Republicans a thick binder of newspaper clippings,
political history and Clinton's remarks from 1974 on Richard
Nixon's impeachment inquiry, even before Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel, sent his report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me,'' DeLay told radio listeners recently, ``it's already
been established that anybody who lies to the grand jury ought to
be impeached.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With Gingrich retiring, House Democrats and the White House are
trying to paint DeLay as their new bogeyman _ the Republican that
Democrats love to hate.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, a 51-year-old former pest exterminator from Sugar Land,
Texas, is practically itching for a fight. ``They tried to demonize
Henry Hyde, they tried to demonize Linda Tripp, they tried to
demonize Newt Gingrich, so I guess I'm the next candidate,'' said
DeLay, whose nickname is the Hammer. ``I'm ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   What has turned DeLay from just another sharp-edged critic of
the president to the man who may deal Clinton his most stunning
defeat is the Texan's close ties to Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   A deft politician, DeLay was one of the earliest backers of
Livingston's campaign to succeed Gingrich, bringing with him the 65
whips in his vote-counting organization. The alliance sealed the
speakership for Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   As a reward, Livingston implicitly agreed to increase DeLay's
budget and staff, and to give DeLay more say over the scheduling of
legislation. DeLay also captured his most coveted empire-building
prize: liaison to business groups, conservative groups and trade
associations.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay insists he is not formally keeping tabs on Republicans'
impeachment votes. Both he and Livingston say any vote to impeach
the president would be a vote of conscience for each member.
</P>
<P>
   But moderate Republicans like Rep. Peter King of New York say
that DeLay's views, combined with many Republicans' annoyance at
the tone of Clinton's replies to 81 questions from the Judiciary
Committee, have swung the momentum toward impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In three separate conference calls last Wednesday with his
whips, DeLay took the temperature of House Republicans. This is
what he heard: an up or down vote on impeachment this year, and no
censure.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with that information, DeLay is tightening the screws on
undecided Republicans. ``His clout derives from his consistency,''
Wamp said. ``He's a bulldog on the positions he takes. He's tough.
His staff is tough. They take no prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   If DeLay's skills lie in his powers of persuasion, it is
instructive to note that on impeachment he has a hard sell and a
soft sell that seem to be at odds.
</P>
<P>
   First, the hard sell. DeLay insists his crusade against Clinton
is guided not by politics but by the Constitution, a pocket-sized
copy of which he carries with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a travesty to the Constitution for us to lower the
standards for breaking the law by not voting for impeachment,''
DeLay said last month.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's softer pitch plays down the significance of what would
be a historic House vote. ``All impeachment is, it's like a grand
jury that looks at the evidence, and the House decides whether the
evidence warrants sending it to the Senate for trial,'' DeLay said
on Sunday. ``That's all it is.''

INTERACTIVE PLAYMATES ARE THE TALK OF THE TOY WORLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's cute, it's furry, it makes lots of adorable
noises. It knows when you're around, and it misses you terribly
when you're not.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not the new pug puppy the kids just got. It's the
Furby, the toy kids _ and many adults _ are clamoring for this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you'd rather have Stop My Hiccups Dil Pickles, Interactive
Babe, Sing-Along Blue, or Amazing Amy. Take your pick. Plush toys
wrapped around simple computer chips have taken over toy store
shelves, at least until frantic parents snatch them up and take
them home.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the Furby and other interactive toys have been high,
with Furby-maker Tiger Electronics projecting that it will sell 2
million of its tiny products by Christmas _ and still won't meet
all demand. Other companies are also reporting great sales success
in an otherwise desultory season.
</P>
<P>
   But should you bother to buy one of these interactive toys,
given prices of $30 to $75 apiece?
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go ahead and buy these things if you must,'' said Dr.
Stevanne Auerbach, director of the Institute for Childhood
Resources in San Francisco, and operator of a Web site
(www.drtoy.com) that rates toys based on their appropriateness and
playability. ``But no toy is a substitute for parents interacting
with the child. ... To rush out and buy a Furby is really for the
parents. It's a marketer's dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, marketers are smacking their lips over parents' frenzy
over the flurry of new computerized products this season.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive plush toys have come a long way since they first
emerged a decade ago in the form of Teddy Ruxpin, the teddy bear
backed with a cassette tape of responses. Relatively few similar
toys were successful at pushing the technological limit until last
year, when such tiny electronic doo-hickeys as the Tamagotchi from
Bandai Electronics and Giga Pets from Furby maker Tiger Electronics
arrived on the toy frontier. And as dazzled as kids were by those
attention-starved gadgets, they're almost primitive compared to
this year's generation of fuzzy, logical fun.
</P>
<P>
   My Interactive Pooh, one of the few interactive toys this season
that needs a computer connection, has substantial power to do such
things as learn and remember a child's age and birth date.
</P>
<P>
   The talking toys that need no link to a computer are equally
impressive by toy standards. The Amazing Amy doll, for example,
speaks about 10,000 words and has sensors that let it know whether
the outfit it's dressed in or the food it's being fed is
appropriate for the time of day, said Gina Beebe, Playmates Toys
senior vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amy knows what she needs and asks for it,'' said Beebe. ``She
will say she doesn't want to wear pajamas at noon, with sensors in
her clothes so she knows what she's wearing. If you try to feed her
a cookie at 8 a.m., she won't want it because it's not breakfast
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-inch-tall Furby, thanks to the microprocessor chip, fits
comfortably into its compact little coat of fur. It has an infrared
send/receive sensor array in its forehead that can send data to (or
communicate with) another Furby. There's a microchip wired to a
microphone, enabling Furby to respond to noise. Switches planted on
the Furby lets it respond to petting and motion. And as if that
weren't enough, its computer brain lets the toy put together about
800 phrases from a 200-word ``Furbish'' vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the appeal of these toys?
</P>
<P>
   ``What (kids) responded to was when the toy responded and
interacted to their questions and the issues that come up in their
everyday life,'' said Keith Cohn, vice president of marketing for
Equity Toys of Los Angeles, makers of Interactive Babe. ``It also
had all the hugging and kissing that the kids really like.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, you mean the Furby does all the things a parent, a sibling
or a friend should? How novel.
</P>
<P>
   If your child won't stop whining until you join the growing
masses of interactive toy buyers, so be it. But, Auerbach advises,
``In addition to that, take the time to play with your child,
whether it be art or playing jump rope or something else. Kids
really appreciate their parents doing things with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Feinberg, a psychiatrist at the UCLA Medical Center
who specializes in child development, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best toy is the box that the toy came in, because it
becomes a flying saucer,'' said Feinberg. ``It's a blank screen
that allows a child to expand their imagination. The toys that
don't allow you to imagine don't get played with. It's not fun.
There's not a lot of creativity with it.''
</P>
<P>
   That tabula rasa for the imagination is a key to a toy that
stimulates a child's mind, Feinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive toys are beginning to provide a broader array of
options and interactions with children, but Feinberg remains
skeptical that it is broad enough, at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the Tamagotchis, no one has them anymore,'' Feinberg
said. ``There may be a few of them hanging from backpacks, but no
one's playing with them anymore. Whereas if you give a kid a teddy
bear, they are playing with them for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some toy company execs acknowledge there are limits to what
they've created.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of technology, toys have gotten more sophisticated,''
Beebe said. ``Maybe to us its strange, because we didn't have that.
But these kids expect it. But I also think there will always be a
place for basic imaginative play.''
</P>
<P>
   So you want to get a real interactive toy? Get down to the
playroom with your child. And think about getting that pug puppy.

ELI LILLY TO PAY SEPRACOR TO LICENSE DRUG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (lb) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. said Monday that it would pay Sepracor Inc. up
to $90 million to license a molecule that is a purer form of
Prozac, Lilly's market-leading anti-depressant.
</P>
<P>
   Sepracor, based in Marlborough, Mass., will also receive an
undisclosed royalty on sales of the drug, R-fluoxetine, which is
expected to have fewer side effects than Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the deal would benefit both companies. For Lilly,
R-fluoxetine could extend the competitive life of Prozac, its
biggest drug, which could face an onslaught of generic versions
when its patents begin expiring in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   For Sepracor, the deal brings a welcome influx of cash, a
potentially large contributor to revenue and a validation of its
strategy of developing improved drugs based on existing ones.
Sepracor's patents on R-fluoxetine run until 2015.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Sepracor fell $3.125, to $84.875, after hitting a
midday high of $95.25 in Nasdaq trading. Lilly rose 81.25 cents, to
$86.9375, on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts said the deal
had been expected and was already reflected in the strong
performance of Sepracor's shares in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   R-fluoxetine is in the first of the three phases of human
clinical trials typically required by the Food and Drug
Administration for the approval of new drugs. Lilly said that it
hoped to complete clinical trials by 2001 and that it would file
for regulatory approval at that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``R-fluoxetine is an exciting molecule with a good chance of
becoming an important new advance in treating depression,'' Sidney
Taurel, Lilly's president and chief executive, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This licensing agreement with Sepracor, coupled with our
internal progress in developing new anti-depressants, will enable
Lilly to introduce new and advanced treatments for this
debilitating illness and to build upon our leadership position in
neuroscience products,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly said animal studies showed R-fluoxetine had the potential
to offer greater flexibility in treating depression and to provide
treatment benefits for more patients than most currently available
anti-depressants, including Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced more than 10 years ago, Prozac was the first of a
family of anti-depressants known as selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors, which also includes Zoloft, made by Pfizer Inc., and
Paxil, made by SmithKline Beecham PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Although safer and more effective than earlier drugs for
depression, Prozac and its competitors do have side effects,
including sexual dysfunction and jittery nerves. Nevertheless, the
drugs are a huge category, with Prozac alone producing worldwide
sales of approximately $2.6 billion in 1997.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Founded in 1984, Sepracor developed a technology to exploit the
century-old discovery that most chemicals are formed with two
mirror-image compounds, called isomers. For most drugs, only one
side of the pair is active, and the other may cause side effects.
By isolating the active isomer, Sepracor can develop a safer or
more effective drug.
</P>
<P>
   Sepracor patented the isomeric forms of many leading drugs
before their manufacturers devised ways to copy its technology.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those companies have been willing to license the
improved version of the drug from Sepracor; the most successful to
date is Hoechst Marion Rousell's antihistamine Allegra, which
replaced Seldane after that drug was found to cause cardiac damage
in some patients. Sepracor is also awaiting FDA approval for an
improved version of albuterol, a common asthma drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic strategy of Sepracor is low risk,'' said Sergio
Traversa, an analyst with Mehta Partners. ``When you have behind
you Johnson &AMP; Johnson, Schering Plough and Lilly, you're pretty
safe,'' he said. ``If you look at the list of drugs they have under
development, it's very, very long. This is just the beginning of
the story.''

HOW A TOP BANKING LAWYER RAN AFOUL OF CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By many people's calculation, John D. Hawke Jr. looked like the
perfect candidate to be the nation's top banking regulator and
Monday he became just that _ sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Brilliant and affable, Hawke appeared to be a shoo-in for the
job of comptroller of the currency. Just look at his resume: He was
considered the dean of American bank lawyers for more than three
decades. Court cases that he argued have paved the way for a vast
expansion of banks into new and different businesses. Many of the
biggest and boldest bank mergers were his cases. He held top
positions at the Federal Reserve and Treasury and a generation of
bank lawyers studied under him in courses he taught as a visiting
law school lecturer.
</P>
<P>
   But, in the last few weeks, Hawke's appointment stalled. Over
the objections of some members of the Senate Banking Committee, the
Clinton administration Monday gave Hawke a temporary or one-year
``recess'' appointment. Behind that action is a tale in how Hawke,
who no one thought would have a problem, became hung up in the
crosscurrents of politics, policies and personalities. Under the
recess appointment, Hawke will not be allowed to serve out his
entire five-year term, until approved by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, the objections to Hawke's appointment came from
the Democratic side of the Senate Banking Committee and at the 11th
hour _ after Hawke's late October confirmation hearing before the
committee. Senators led by Paul Sarbanes of Maryland put a hold on
Hawke's confirmation, delaying it until the next Congress. The
Clinton administration, which nominated Hawke in July, finally
intervened with the recess appointment, breaking the logjam.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment became hung up for a number of reasons. Some
Democratic senators objected to the positions he took on consumer
banking issues that the Democrats felt were made only to placate
Republicans. Other lawmakers were still smarting over Hawke's
aggressive behind-the-scenes lobbying that helped scuttle
legislation to overhaul the nation's banking laws this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Hawke knows his banking law,'' Sarbanes said. ``But the
question is to what purpose will he put that knowledge to work?''
</P>
<P>
   So the 65-year-old Hawke, who, many say, has wanted all his life
to be comptroller, found himself in bureaucratic no-man's land.
</P>
<P>
   Even his detractors acknowledge that on the basis of his brains
and experience alone, Hawke deserves the job of overseeing more
than 2,700 national banks with $2.5 trillion in assets. Perhaps
more than any other single lawyer, Hawke has shaped the nation's
banking system with his free-market attitudes and legal work on
behalf of bank clients that broke down regulatory barriers in court
while Congress dithered on the issue. In doing so, his views made
him many friends _ and some influential foes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Hawke is enormously able, talented and one of the
pre-eminent banking lawyers in the world,'' said Kenneth Guenther,
executive director of the Independent Bankers Association of
America. ``But he is philosophically at odds with many members of
Congress, and they have gotten royally mad at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawke, who has been undersecretary for domestic finance in the
Treasury Department since 1995, would not comment Monday. Still, it
is apparent that he sprang some congressional tripwires.
</P>
<P>
   Sarbanes has been particularly upset at the Treasury's slow
response and Hawke's lackluster answers to his concerns about a new
federal program to transfer electronically all government checks to
recipients. The senator contended that the program was ripe for
consumer abuse, and held up an advertisement for a Baltimore liquor
store that said government checks could be sent there
electronically for cashing. Hawke ``was not fully forthcoming in
his responses'' on this issue, Sarbanes said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., was troubled by Hawke's vigorous
defense of the comptroller's hand in overseeing the insurance
industry, at the expense of state regulators.
</P>
<P>
   And many Democrats said Hawke did not embrace strongly enough
one of their favorite pieces of legislation, the Community
Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to provide services to low-
and moderate-income neighborhoods. Indeed, the Democrats said Hawke
leaned over backward to placate Republicans who want the act
abolished _ including writing a apology to Sen. Richard Shelby,
R-Ala., who is one of its staunchest critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Hawke apologized to Senator Shelby that was galling, that
really stuck in people's throats,'' said one Democratic staff
member of the banking committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has it in for Hawke,'' Sarbanes said. ``There is no
personal antagonism towards him. But these are very important
issues and there wasn't time to get them worked out before the end
of session. If we can get these items resolved that would place his
nomination in a different light.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hawke joined the Arnold &AMP; Porter law firm in New York in 1962
after graduating from Yale University. He served in the Air Force
and received a law degree from Columbia Law School. One of his
first cases challenged the government's banking laws and required
him to take the deposition of the comptroller at the time, James
Saxon. He won the case.
</P>
<P>
   For the next three decades, except for three years in the late
1970s when he was the Federal Reserve's general counsel, Hawke
spent his career largely suing the government. With regulators and
Congress often reluctant to deregulate banking, aggressive
financial institutions relied on lawyers like Hawke to outfox the
law. Banking law, once a sleepy practice, became hot. As Arnold &AMP;
Porter's banking practice swelled, Hawke rose in the firm, becoming
chairman in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Hawke helped break down laws prohibiting regional bank mergers,
was an early engineer of interstate banking and won victories that
reduced the Fed's authority to challenge bank mergers. His most
famous case resulted in an 8-to-0 Supreme Court decision in 1986
that created ``nonbank banks,'' or commercial companies that
provide financial services, further blurring the line between banks
and other financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   He followed up his courtroom victories by helping to put
together complex bank purchases in Florida, Pennsylvania, Virginia
and New England. He was also a founding member of the Shadow
Financial Regulatory Committee, a group of academics, lawyers and
bankers who joined to keep tabs on the regulators, and he headed a
Chicago Mercantile Exchange study into the 1987 stock market crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry has a free-market and pro-competitive point of view,''
said William Isaac, former chairman of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. and a banking partner at Arnold &AMP; Porter. ``He also
believes that regulators have to make sure banks are behaving in a
safe and sound fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawke has repeatedly favored sweeping away Depression-era laws
that separate banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies. But
when the chance to do just that came up in Congress this year,
Hawke backed away.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of supporting deregulation, he ended up opposing the
bill when it created a corporate banking structure for new
financial services activities that would have weakened the
oversight authority of the Treasury Department, which regulates
banks, and strengthened that of the Federal Reserve, which
regulates bank holding companies. Hawke became a strong backroom
player on behalf of the Treasury Department in the resulting turf
battle.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown pitted Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan against Hawke's
boss, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who threatened a
presidential veto if Greenspan got the upper hand. The question was
whether new financial activities would be carried out in
subsidiaries of banks or in affiliates of bank holding companies.
</P>
<P>
   Many lobbyists say Hawke made this a personal battle that
frustrated a fragile industry coalition that had, for the first
time in decades, banded behind the bill. Moreover, lobbyists
describe a mud fight led by Hawke who, they say, telephoned them
after the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, the giant
hedge fund, to rail against the Fed, which helped orchestrate a
rescue of the fund by banks and brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were frustrated by the hard-line position
taken on the regulatory issue,'' said Sam Baptista, a lobbyist for
the Financial Services Council, which represents banks and Wall
Street. ``A lot of banks were happy with the Federal Reserve and
didn't care. Jerry played a real behind-the-scenes role and he made
it clear where he was on this issue. It got down to Treasury saying
one thing and the Fed saying another. And when it comes to who
carries the most weight in Congress, it is Alan Greenspan, even
though Jerry is a forceful advocate in making his case.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how tough Hawke will be as comptroller is unclear. Banks
are now allowed to have operating subsidiaries with broad powers,
but their reach remains undefined. It is up to the banks to propose
what these new powers will be, whether they are underwriting
revenue bonds, engaging in real estate development or starting
leasing businesses. They must then apply to the comptroller to see
whether he will allow them.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Hawke's misfortune is an object lesson in the
vicissitudes of Washington. H. Rodgin Cohen, a banking lawyer at
Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell in New York, said, ``I think he will try to
innovate and expand bank powers. But in Washington, you can only go
so far before you blow yourself up with Congress and the
administration. He will have to have a pretty good sense of where
that is.''

`HIGH' ROAD IS FULL OF POT HOLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The first time I talked to Josh Berner (two years ago
this month) he gave me his favorite recipe for eggnog. First, you
pour some of the store-bought variety into a blender. Then add in a
banana, a little honey and two heaping tablespoons of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Mix to a froth. Add nutmeg.
</P>
<P>
   `'That's still one of my favorites,'' Josh told me Monday.
``Wish I could whip some up right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But he can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I had some pot was a week or 10 days ago,'' he
said. ``I'm having a little trouble finding some right now. But I
will, hopefully. Otherwise, I won't be able to eat at all. I'll be
finished. I won't let that happen. I won't let the bastards win _
pardon my French.''
</P>
<P>
   No need.
</P>
<P>
   I figure a guy in his 50s can speak any language he wants when
he has throat cancer and is experiencing constant nausea from the
disease and the radiation treatments. Particularly when he lives in
a state that already has passed a referendum permitting the medical
use of marijuana _ twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without an implementation plan to go along with the
proposition, the situation of people like me hasn't changed a bit
since we passed the first proposition back in '96,'' Josh said.
``So, that's my job now. To get it implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   NEEDS A PRESCRIPTION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new law says a person in Josh's position needs to have a
prescription for marijuana from two doctors. That's not likely to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   According to Andrea Smiley of the Arizona Medical Association,
most doctors are afraid they'll be busted by federal authorities
for prescribing an illegal drug.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but there's no pharmacy where a guy like Josh can
go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you where that leaves me,'' Josh said. ``Picture me
walking through the desert on a local Indian reservation, handing
money through barbed wire fence and having a bag of pot passed back
to me. Why? Because there's an 80-year-old World War II veteran who
called me to help him, because marijuana is the only thing that
keeps him from getting sick from chemotherapy. That's not right. I
can't let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Josh is now working with activists in other states
that have passed laws similar to Arizona's Proposition 300. He
wants to create a national implementation plan.
</P>
<P>
   `'The only thing that keeps this from happening is superstition,
ignorance and arrogance,'' Josh said. ``That's the basis for all of
this. We're not talking about the complete legalization of all
drugs. We're talking about medical use. All we can do is hammer
away at the negative attitude that exists out there. Someone like
me can help. I'm not intimidated. I just don't feel too good.''
</P>
<P>
   CHANGE IS DIFFICULT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Josh believes that if enough states get together and demand a
change, the federal government will come around. It won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Arizona passed the referendum, Sen. Jon Kyl said,
''I must tell you I am extraordinarily embarrassed'' by Arizona's
vote. Kyl had nothing but disdain for what he called ``pothead
doctors'' who might help someone like Josh.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you take a position like mine, people are going to attack
you,'' Josh said. ``But I don't worry about it. A long time ago my
dad told me, `If they try to run you out of town, get out in front
and make it look like a parade.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That's not easy when you're weak and sick and all you want for
Christmas is a few plump joints.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, a friend brought Josh the nub of a marijuana
cigarette, a ``roach,'' and after a few puffs he felt good enough
to eat a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``You live day to day and fight day to day,'' he said, ``and you
try to keep your dignity and your sense of humor and your sense of
determination.''
</P>
<P>
   His resolve was shaken a couple of days ago, however, when the
temperature dropped and there was snow in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Oh, no, I'm a goner,' '' he said, laughing. ``I
had told all my friends I was going to fight this damn thing until
hell freezes over.''

`HIGH' ROAD IS FULL OF POT HOLES

   PHOENIX _ The first time I talked to Josh Berner (two years ago
this month) he gave me his favorite recipe for eggnog. First, you
pour some of the store-bought variety into a blender. Then add in a
banana, a little honey and two heaping tablespoons of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Mix to a froth. Add nutmeg.
</P>
<P>
   `'That's still one of my favorites,'' Josh told me Monday.
``Wish I could whip some up right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But he can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I had some pot was a week or 10 days ago,'' he
said. ``I'm having a little trouble finding some right now. But I
will, hopefully. Otherwise, I won't be able to eat at all. I'll be
finished. I won't let that happen. I won't let the bastards win _
pardon my French.''
</P>
<P>
   No need.
</P>
<P>
   I figure a guy in his 50s can speak any language he wants when
he has throat cancer and is experiencing constant nausea from the
disease and the radiation treatments. Particularly when he lives in
a state that already has passed a referendum permitting the medical
use of marijuana _ twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without an implementation plan to go along with the
proposition, the situation of people like me hasn't changed a bit
since we passed the first proposition back in '96,'' Josh said.
``So, that's my job now. To get it implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   NEEDS A PRESCRIPTION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new law says a person in Josh's position needs to have a
prescription for marijuana from two doctors. That's not likely to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   According to Andrea Smiley of the Arizona Medical Association,
most doctors are afraid they'll be busted by federal authorities
for prescribing an illegal drug.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but there's no pharmacy where a guy like Josh can
go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you where that leaves me,'' Josh said. ``Picture me
walking through the desert on a local Indian reservation, handing
money through barbed wire fence and having a bag of pot passed back
to me. Why? Because there's an 80-year-old World War II veteran who
called me to help him, because marijuana is the only thing that
keeps him from getting sick from chemotherapy. That's not right. I
can't let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Josh is now working with activists in other states
that have passed laws similar to Arizona's Proposition 300. He
wants to create a national implementation plan.
</P>
<P>
   `'The only thing that keeps this from happening is superstition,
ignorance and arrogance,'' Josh said. ``That's the basis for all of
this. We're not talking about the complete legalization of all
drugs. We're talking about medical use. All we can do is hammer
away at the negative attitude that exists out there. Someone like
me can help. I'm not intimidated. I just don't feel too good.''
</P>
<P>
   CHANGE IS DIFFICULT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Josh believes that if enough states get together and demand a
change, the federal government will come around. It won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Arizona passed the referendum, Sen. Jon Kyl said,
''I must tell you I am extraordinarily embarrassed'' by Arizona's
vote. Kyl had nothing but disdain for what he called ``pothead
doctors'' who might help someone like Josh.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you take a position like mine, people are going to attack
you,'' Josh said. ``But I don't worry about it. A long time ago my
dad told me, `If they try to run you out of town, get out in front
and make it look like a parade.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That's not easy when you're weak and sick and all you want for
Christmas is a few plump joints.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, a friend brought Josh the nub of a marijuana
cigarette, a ``roach,'' and after a few puffs he felt good enough
to eat a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``You live day to day and fight day to day,'' he said, ``and you
try to keep your dignity and your sense of humor and your sense of
determination.''
</P>
<P>
   His resolve was shaken a couple of days ago, however, when the
temperature dropped and there was snow in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Oh, no, I'm a goner,' '' he said, laughing. ``I
had told all my friends I was going to fight this damn thing until
hell freezes over.''

14 WHITE HOUSE WITNESSES TO ARGUE AGAINST IMPEACHMENT
</HEADLINE>
   (See also IMPEACH, IMPEACH-DELAY) 
(nk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House, in a last-ditch effort to sway
some impeachment votes in the House, will present a detailed
defense over the next two days against some of the accusations in
the impeachment report of Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The president's case will be made by two White House lawyers,
and will be buttressed by 14 friendly witnesses who will address
the law and history of impeachment in a two-day seminar beginning
Tuesday. They will argue that the president's conduct in the
Lewinsky affair, while shameful, does not meet the standard of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our time has come,'' declared White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   The overall message of the White House lawyers and scholars,
former Watergate prosecutors and former members of Congress will be
that the president's conduct does not warrant the grave
constitutional remedy of impeachment, according to the standards
set by the authors of the Constitution or previous Congresses,
White House officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will discuss what our view of both the facts and the law
are, at great length,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rising calls from Congress for the president to publicly
justify his actions, there are no plans now for Clinton to speak to
the committee or to the nation about the Lewinsky matter or the
impeachment inquiry, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is second to none in recognizing what was wrong
in his behavior and apologizing to those who he's affected and
hurt,'' Lockhart said Monday afternoon, seeking to dampen
speculation about a dramatic presidential appearance or written
defense. ``He has spoken, I think, on many occasions to that and
that view has not changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House will make its case over two days, opening with a
statement by Gregory B. Craig, the White House special counsel for
impeachment matters, and closing with a summation by Charles F.C.
Ruff, the White House counsel and former Watergate prosecutor. The
two will carry the burden of presenting a defense against the
charges of perjury, obstruction of justice and abuse of power
contained in Starr's 445-page impeachment referral.
</P>
<P>
   Between the lawyers' statements, scholars, prosecutors and
prominent defense attorneys will argue that the framers of the
Constitution did not design impeachment to punish personal
misbehavior. They will also testify that the case against Clinton
was unfairly brought and that the evidence against the president on
perjury and obstruction of justice is not sufficient to justify
trial and conviction, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee chamber will echo with the voices
of numerous veterans of the last impeachment debate, which
concluded in 1974 with a committee vote to approve three articles
of impeachment against President Richard M. Nixon. Nixon resigned
in August 1974 rather than face an impeachment vote of the full
House.
</P>
<P>
   The White House presentation is designed in large measure to
remind the Congress _ and through them, the public _ of the
solemnity of the impeachment process and to contrast the serious
constitutional offenses of Nixon against the admitted personal
misconduct of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're moving into a different phase,'' Lockhart said,
``which, given the serious nature of it, given the fact that the
House of Representatives is discussing removing the president,
removing him from office, overturning the will of the people, it's
important that this be done in a serious way.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Judiciary Committee on Monday afternoon, the
White House said it would present four panels of witnesses to argue
against impeachment over two days. The White House had asked for
four days to make the president's case, but Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said on Sunday he
would allow no more than 30 hours of testimony over two days.
</P>
<P>
   The three former members of Congress who will appear on
Clinton's behalf _ Elizabeth Holtzman of New York, the Rev. Robert
F. Drinan of Massachusetts and Wayne Owens of Utah _ all sat on the
Judiciary Committee in 1974 and voted in favor of the impeachment
articles against Nixon. Under the schedule submitted to the panel
by the White House on Monday, the former members will speak Tuesday
afternoon about abuse of power, one of the three charges against
Nixon and one of three potential accusations against Clinton being
considered by the current committee.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the three former members would compare
Nixon's actions to those of Clinton and argue that Clinton's
behavior, while personally objectionable, does not constitute an
impeachable abuse of his office.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Also speaking on Clinton's behalf will be Richard Ben-Veniste,
chief of the task force in the Watergate special prosecutor's
office from 1973 to 1975, and James Hamilton, who was assistant
chief counsel on the Senate Watergate Committee.
</P>
<P>
   They plan to tell the committee that Starr did not follow
precedents established by the Watergate prosecutors and presented a
biased and incomplete case to the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, a Washington lawyer, has written a book on
congressional investigations and has informally advised Clinton on
how to control the damage from scandal inquiries. Among his points
of advice: Say as little as possible, provide few documents to the
press and public, and invoke attorney-client and executive
privileges when applicable.
</P>
<P>
   The first panel to be presented Tuesday by the White House
includes Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, former attorney general under
President Lyndon B. Johnson; Bruce Ackerman, professor of law at
Yale University; Sean Wilentz, professor of history at Princeton
University; and Samuel H. Beer, professor of government emeritus at
Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   They will address the historical precedents of impeachment and
the standards that should be met before articles of impeachment are
approved.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning, the White House defense will be presented
by five former federal prosecutors: Thomas P. Sullivan, Richard J.
Davis, Edward S.G. Dennis Jr., William W. Taylor III and Ronald
Noble.
</P>
<P>
   The main point of their presentation, according to the White
House, is that few prosecutors would bring criminal charges based
on Starr's chief accusations against Clinton _ perjury, obstruction
of justice and witness tampering. They will also raise questions
about the conduct of Starr's investigation, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton does not plan to address Congress in person or in
writing on impeachment, the president and Hillary Rodham Clinton
will entertain more than 1,000 members of Congress, spouses and
aides on Monday night at an annual holiday ball at the White House.
Officials would not rule out a little gentle anti-impeachment
lobbying by the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't preclude the fact that the subject doesn't come up,''
Lockhart said. ``It certainly is a topic of great conversation in
this town.''

 &HT;    Stinchcombs, Stanfill make Hall first for Dogs
 &HT;    By Michael Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jon Stinchcomb will never play alongside his older
brother, Matt, with the Georgia Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, however, the freshman lineman will join the senior
tackle and Bill Stanfill, the 1968 Outland Trophy winner, to make
Georgia football history. For the first time, three Bulldogs will
be honored by the National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame
with three of its most prestigious awards at the Waldorf-Astoria in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Stinchcomb brothers will receive scholar-athlete
recognition, while Stanfill will be become the 10th Georgia athlete
inducted into the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful,'' Jon Stinchcomb, 19, said. ``It's one of the
best honors we could've received together. For us to be here at the
same time, it couldn't be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he hasn't played a down yet in Athens, Ga., Jon
Stinchcomb is the High School Scholar Athlete for 1998. The award
honors the top scholar athletes in four regions of the country for
their academic, athletic and leadership for the 1997-98 school
year. He maintained a perfect 4.0 through his 12 years in public
schools and, like Matt, also was a Parade and USA Today high school
All-American lineman. Jon Stinchcomb enrolled at Georgia in March,
where he once again got straight A's. This summer, he received the
only B of his life, in calculus. ``First and, I hope, my last,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Next fall, he probably will be a starting offensive lineman as a
redshirt freshman, but he will have some huge shoes to fill; not
just on the field, but in the classroom as well, where Matt
Stinchcomb is one of the most decorated student-athletes ever to
play Georgia football. Today, Matt Stinchcomb will become one of 17
National Football Foundation Scholar-Athletes nationwide and will
receive a graduate scholarship worth $18,000 to $25,000. Matt
Stinchcomb has been selected an All-American twice, and, with a
3.96 GPA, he should repeat as an Academic All-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been proud of him,'' Jon Stinchcomb said about his
brother, who will play his final game in the Peach Bowl on Dec. 31.
``He has maintained a high standard of excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanfill was a consensus All-American and an Academic
All-American in 1968, before an All-Pro career with the Miami
Dolphins. He was starter on the 1972 and 1973 championship teams
and holds the team record for career sacks (67 1/2) and sacks in a
season (18 1/2 in 1973).
</P>
<P>
   Other Bulldog Hall of Famers are former coaches Vince Dooley,
Wally Butts and Glen ``Pop'' Warner and former players Bill
Hartman, Bob McWhorter, Frank Sinkwich, Vernon ``Catfish'' Smith,
Fran Tarkenton and Charley Trippi.

PLAYOFF NEEDED _ AND NOT THE BCS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several years ago, before the BCS android was created and
national title-mania became the rage in college football, a coach
tried to explain why he liked the old system.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, reasoned the since-retired coach, half of the
Division I-A teams in the nation could put the shoulder pads away
feeling good about some part of their season. There were multiple
levels of success available.
</P>
<P>
   Teams could reach a goal if they had a winning season. They
could fulfill a goal by beating a rival or upsetting a ranked team.
</P>
<P>
   They could win their conference. Even if they didn't, they could
still earn a bowl bid. About a third of the Division I-A teams in
the nation could say they went bowling, and half that number would
win its last game.
</P>
<P>
   If you put all of college football's emphasis on having a
well-defined national champ, Terry Donahue believed, then you
devalue all of these other goals and accomplishments. And why would
you want to do that? Why would you want any system that creates one
winner and 100 losers?
</P>
<P>
   More than once this season, the former Bruin coach was mocked by
some media critics and the whiny contingent of UCLA followers.
Every time Bob Toledo encouraged the notion of shooting for the No.
1 moon, someone would remark what a refreshing change it was from
Donahue's mannered approach.
</P>
<P>
   Well, how refreshing are things now?
</P>
<P>
   For the first in the history of the Rose Bowl, a team will slink
into the game, wishing it was anywhere else. The fact that it's
UCLA just multiplies the refreshing nature of this bogus
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea how Cade McNown or any Bruin will find the
strength to Trudge On against Wisconsin after the devastating loss
to Miami. The only thing which could excite McNown now would be the
chance to play against his own defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins certainly will not find solace in beating a
non-descript Wisconsin team that's only Pasadena-bound because it
didn't play Ohio State. Perhaps they will follow the lead of UCLA's
basketball team and wear black uniforms, fitting for a team in
mourning.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison to the Bruins, USC is absolutely elated to be
heading to I'll Paso
</P>
<P>
   for the Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Things are so refreshing, in fact, that I can accurately tell
you how Bruin fans will respond: Many of them will sell out their
team by selling their tickets to the hoard of Badger fans headed
west, just as they did five years ago. ComeJan.1, the Rose Bowl
will become the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose here isn't to mock anyone's desire to be No.1 or to
make Donahue sound like a prophet. I may like the chaos of the
past, but I know I'm in the minority, and Donahue himself now
advocates a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that the system being imposed by the Bowl
Championship Series (BCS) is sucking the life out of college
football while also giving student-athletes an education in
hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   As bad as the Bruins may feel today, their pain doesn't come
close to the anguish Kansas State is feeling. The Bruins at least
bounced back to the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, Kansas State was ranked No.1 by one of the
major polls. Saturday evening, it lost to a good Texas A&AMP;M team in
double overtime. Sunday afternoon, it was left out of the
BCS-controlled Big Four bowl games altogether
</P>
<P>
   This has to be a Guinness freefall record, doesn't it? If I'm a
lawyer and a K-State alum, then I wake up this morning and sue
someone, because I have just been assaulted in broad daylight.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS system pretends to have the best interests of college
football in mind, but it truly only cares about how many tickets
can be sold and hotel rooms filled. Why else would a two-loss
Florida team be in the Orange Bowl ahead of one-loss Kansas State,
or one-loss Arizona? K State got the same shaft this year that UCLA
did a year ago by the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't there a conflict of interest when the President of the
SEC, Roy Kramer, is also the CEO of the BCS? Isn't it intriguing
that the BCS, like the bowl alliance and coalition before it, has
rules giving member bowls the right to pick the teams they want and
not according to the final BCS standings?
</P>
<P>
   This sport needs to either take a step back and rediscover the
mythology of its past, or take a step forward with a full and fair
playoff system.
</P>
<P>
   A playoff system can work, and on the kind of multiple levels
Donahue spoke about. A 16-team tourney would not have to kill the
other bowls, and it would create a new level of success (playoff
berths) that is an easy sell in other sports.
</P>
<P>
   With a playoff, a loss like UCLA's against Miami or Ohio State's
to Michigan State does not necessarily kill the season. With a
playoff, Kansas State is not a victim of ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   Step forward or step back, but under no circumstances can
college football afford to stand still. Kill the BCS, before it
kills the sport.

`ICICLE LIGHTS' RULE THIS CHRISTMAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAWN GILBERTSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Forget about Furby.
</P>
<P>
   This holiday season's must-have _ and therefore can't-find _ is
icicle lights, those dainty white lights that dangle off the house.
</P>
<P>
   Stores have already sold out despite loading up on them after
strong sales during their big debut last year, disappointing
countless consumers who went shopping for decorations over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tripled or quadrupled our order this year and they just
flew out the door,'' said Marty Feldman, assistant manager of
Artie's Paradise Valley Ace Hardware.
</P>
<P>
   The store, at Tatum Boulevard and Thunderbird Road, sold its
last set of white icicle lights a week ago. All that's left on the
display are the less popular colored ones, and then only a few.
</P>
<P>
   The Target store in Peoria ran out of the icicle lights Saturday
morning, manager Joe Larson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Target stores here in the city are experiencing the
same thing,'' he said. ``I have no idea who has them anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Larson, who says he ordered 10 to 15 times as many icicle lights
as a year ago, said he thinks they are so popular because they're a
novelty.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see them (on somebody's house) and go, `How cute.' ''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   For transplants from the Midwest and Northeast, the lights bring
back memories of real icicles, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Biffie Kelly of Phoenix picked up a big box of the lights at
Toys `R' Us more than a month ago, and a couple of more at a
Michaels arts and crafts store.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just looked fun,'' she said. ``They remind me of the
things that we've seen at ZooLights'' at the Phoenix Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, whose 13-year-old son Robbie is known as the neighborhood
light man because he covers the family's house with them, wanted to
pick up more when she saw them on sale at Kmart a week ago. The
store nearby didn't have any, and neither did another Kmart she
tried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really aware that they were such a rage,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Target and other retailers in the Valley spent the weekend
turning light-seekers like Kelly away, in person and on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone, gone, gone,'' is what Donna Walker, manager of the
Michaels in Chandler, told anyone inquiring about the lights.
</P>
<P>
   The store had been referring customers to a nearby craft store
but it sold out, too, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Wal-Mart at Tatum Boulevard and Bell Road in north
Phoenix on Sunday, the switchboard was filled with callers checking
to see if the lights were in stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a few calls ahead of you and they're all asking the
same thing,'' a receptionist warned as she placed a caller on hold.
</P>
<P>
   A neighboring Osco drugstore took down a banner advertising the
lights Sunday, as the shelves were empty. A couple of Phoenix-area
Osco stores, including the one at Shea Boulevard and Scottsdale
Road in Scottsdale, said they had some in stock Monday.
</P>
<P>
   John Baker, an associate in the seasonal department at the
HomeBase in Tempe, said, ``Every other question (this weekend) was
if we had them.''
</P>
<P>
   Target's Larson said nothing matches the icicle light fervor,
not even the hunt for that interactive stuffed toy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of requests for Furby, but not anywhere near
the icicle lights'' requests, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Internet sites that sell Christmas decorations also are flashing
some sold-out signs.
</P>
<P>
   At Betty's Christmas House (www.bettyschristmashouse.com), &QL; 
all but one of four offered are sold out.
</P>
<P>
   At www.christmasdepot.com, which bills itself as the largest
Christmas store on the Internet, three of the eight sets offered
were sold out.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the shortage, one Phoenix woman got creative. She
bought Ace Hardware's display of icicle lights Saturday, shelling
out $144. The store took the lights down for her and she picked
them up Monday. The lights generally sell for $10 to $20 for a
150-light set.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people asked. She had the gumption to do it,''
Feldman said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hot demand, Feldman isn't planning on increasing his
order for next year. He figures the fad will probably fade after
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is sold now,'' he said. ``Maybe we'll go with the
same amount as this year and pray that we get rid of them.''

 &HT;    NFL ready to bring back instant replay for playoffs
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coming off a second straight weekend of officiating blunders,
the NFL decided Monday to seek approval from its team owners to
implement an instant replay system for this season's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Although commissioner Paul Tagliabue could not be reached for
comment, league vice president Greg Aiello confirmed the unusual
move. Several owners contacted Monday by the Journal-Constitution
said they were unaware of the action.
</P>
<P>
   The league office worked much of Monday formulating a proposal
it feels will win the support of many of the owners whose teams
have been affected by officiating snafus. A vote, likely within the
next 7-10 days, is expected to be conducted by conference call.
</P>
<P>
   The components of a proposed ''challenge-based'' system would be
similar to those used during preseason experimentation with replay
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Then-Dallas Cowboys president Tex Schramm attempted in 1985 to
have replay adopted for postseason play but the proposal was
rejected. The NFL implemented replay in 1986 and used the system
through the '91 season. It was voted out in 1992 and recent votes
have failed to return it.
</P>
<P>
   The game officials, along with senior director of officiating
Jerry Seeman, have come under fire much of this season for
questionable calls. The furor reached unprecedented levels the past
two weekends and, in the wake of what one high-ranking league
official agreed was a crisis of credibility, the NFL has been under
pressure to respond.
</P>
<P>
   The latest incident occurred Sunday when New York Jets
quarterback Vinny Testaverde was credited with the game-winning
touchdown against the Seattle Seahawks when TV replays clearly
showed he failed to cross the goal line. The league admitted Monday
the touchdown call was erroneous.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle players told the Journal-Constitution that coach Dennis
Erickson, whose job is on the line, wept bitterly after the loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution confirmed Tagliabue has
deferred $50,000 fines levied last week against owners Ralph Wilson
of Buffalo and Detroit's William Clay Ford, and that those
penalties probably will be rescinded.

RENO DECLARES EVIDENCE INSUFFICIENT FOR INDEPENDENT COUNSEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno announced Monday that
she had no reasonable grounds to seek the appointment of an
independent counsel to investigate President Clinton's role in a
multimillion-dollar Democratic advertising campaign for the 1996
election. Her decision swept away a lingering campaign finance
issue that had haunted the White House for months.
</P>
<P>
   On the final day of a 90-day review period provided under the
independent counsel law, Reno concluded that no further criminal
investigation of Clinton was warranted because there was ``clear
and convincing evidence that the president and vice president
lacked the criminal intent to violate the law.'' The conclusion was
based on Reno's finding that their decisions had been guided by
legal advice that the advertisements were lawful.
</P>
<P>
   Reno did not reach any judgment on the legality of the
advertisements' financing itself. But she said the laws that
regulated them were ambiguous, noting that members of the Federal
Election Commission just last week described the standards as
``fuzzy'' and ``hardly clear.'' The commission is expected to
consider at meetings later this week whether the 1996 advertising
campaigns of both the Democratic and Republican Parties amounted to
civil violations of election law.
</P>
<P>
   The $46 million television campaign at issue in Reno's decision
Monday was financed by the Democratic National Committee and, under
the law, was permitted to convey only broad party messages.
Instead, federal election auditors have found, it communicated
specific electioneering messages that directly benefited the
Clinton-Gore re-election candidacy. It was as a result of that
finding, three months ago, that Reno set out to determine whether
an independent prosecutor should investigate Clinton or his aides
on the ground that they might have knowingly evaded the law in
directing the advertising drive.
</P>
<P>
   During the course of the subsequent inquiry, in which Clinton
himself was interviewed by the Justice Department, the president's
lawyers argued that his reliance on legal advice insulated him from
a charge of wrongdoing, since, they said, it showed that he had had
no intention of violating the law.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, in her filing with the special federal court that
oversees independent-counsel matters, Reno acknowledged that
Clinton and Gore had been intimately involved in the advertising
campaign, raising money, formulating the advertising strategy, and
reviewing and commenting on specific campaign messages. But she
found that their lawyers had also been deeply involved, so much so
that ``media consultants periodically complained about the
constraints the lawyers were placing on them.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, officials expressed their pleasure with the
Attorney General's move.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we've said all along, the president and the Clinton-Gore
campaign complied with the spirit and letter of the law,'' said Joe
Lockhart, the White House press secretary. ``We are gratified by
the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Reno disappointed Republicans, who had hoped
that the investigation into the so-called issue ads might finally
force her to seek an independent prosecutor into campaign finance,
an appointment they had sought for nearly two years through the
course of inquiries into several aspects of fund-raising
irregularities. Of all those inquiries, this one was surely among
the most significant, because an independent counsel would have
focused directly on Clinton's activities and cut to the core of the
Democrats' fund-raising operations for the 1996 election.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Republicans complained Monday that Reno had compartmentalized
the campaign finance investigations, effectively diluting any
accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Janet Reno has sliced this broad scandal into narrower issues
so that common threads, patterns and facts are not considered when
weighing each decision whether to seek an independent counsel,''
said Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, who is chairman of the Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, a Tennessee Republican and chairman of the
governmental Affairs Committee, which held extensive campaign
finance hearings last year, found the outcome predictable.
``Everyone knew this was coming and it's another banner day for the
lawyers,'' Thompson said. ``Lawyers advised the president that what
he was doing was OK. Lawyers at the Justice Department advised Reno
that the independent counsel law didn't apply. She relied on every
lawyer around except the ones responsible for the investigation _
FBI Director Louis Freeh and the head of the Justice Department's
campaign finance task force, Charles La Bella.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson was referring to confidential memorandums by Freeh and
La Bella who recommended an independent prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's independent counsel decision was her third on
fund-raising cases in the last two weeks. In an earlier inquiry,
Reno cleared away a potentially serious obstacle from Vice
President Al Gore's presidential path. In that case, Reno found on
Nov. 24 that there was insufficient evidence for an outside
prosecutor to investigate whether Gore lied about his White House
fund-raising efforts in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Taken as a whole, Reno's independent counsel decisions represent
what campaign finance lawyers said was probably the last chance for
her to allow an outside prosecutor to examine the actions of senior
White House officials in financing Clinton's reelection. In effect,
her decision Monday meant that no such inquiry is likely to ever
take place.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, in two years of episodic inquiries, Reno has issued
a string of decisions that have effectively absolved the White
House of wrongdoing related to a panopoly of activities like
presidential and vice presidential phone calls seeking campaign
donations, intimate White House coffees for large donors and
special plums such as overnight stays at the executive mansion.
</P>
<P>
   The action on Monday, however, did not bring an end
investigations into campaign finance. On Nov. 30, Reno obtained a
60-day extension of her inquiry into whether Harold Ickes, formerly
Clinton's deputy chief of staff, lied to a Senate panel about his
activities in behalf of the Teamsters union in a labor dispute at a
California walnut processing plant.
</P>
<P>
   An audit report released last week showed that the presidential
campaigns of both Clinton and Bob Dole had illegally benefited from
issue advertising paid for by their parties. The staff recommended
that the Clinton campaign committee be forced to repay the
government $7 million and the Dole campaign $17.7 million. But
election officials said that the full six-member commission would
almost certainly reject the staff recommendation, given that the
members, three Republicans and three Democrats, are beholden to
their parties.

MAY'S CAREER COMING TO END AT LONG BEACH STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM McCURDIE  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ It all began with a little girl, a balloon,
and the living room of a modest Santa Monica apartment. The little
girl would repeatedly bat the balloon into the air, refusing to let
it hit the floor. Her father, who had some experience in games like
this one, watched and beamed.
</P>
<P>
   This was how Misty May first learned the basics of a game she
would come to master. Her parents, proud holders of Ph.D.s from the
old school of volleyball, taught their daughter well. By the time
she reached her teens, she was looking for older kids to play with,
because those her own age couldn't give her much of a game.
</P>
<P>
   She's all grown up now, and the ball only touches the floor when
she decides it is time. May runs the show for Long Beach State's
women's volleyball team, which is unbeaten and ranked No.1 in the
nation. Oh, she has an assortment of talented athletes on her side
of the net. But make no mistake about it. It is Misty's show.
</P>
<P>
   And the curtain is slowly coming down. The 49ers play host to
the Mountain Regional finals beginning Thursday night against
Illinois at the Pyramid. The Misty May Era will end when their time
in the tournament ends. They hope that doesn't come until Dec.19 in
Madison, Wis., in the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   So pardon some of the patrons and participants at the Pyramid if
they seem a bit Misty-eyed these days, for they know their time is
short. As Coach Brian Gimmillaro put it, there is this sense of
urgency to ``exhaust all possibilities'' before May leaves. The
players feel it. Every point, every practice, every team meeting
has become more precious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every minute we have?,'' asked 49er senior outside hitter
Jessica Alvarado, May's teammate for the past four seasons.
``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about that since August I only have one more
season with her,'' said 49er assistant coach Debbie Green, perhaps
the biggest reason May came to Long Beach four years ago. ``I
already miss her, and she hasn't even left yet. Yeah, I'm counting
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach officials paid tribute to May last Saturday night by
retiring her jersey before the 49ers' sweep of Illinois State. May
is the seventh 49er to be so honored, but the first to have a
replica of her jersey hung from the ceiling before she was finished
wearing the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   May had offered to sing the national anthem before that ``Senior
Night'' match, figuring that she and her high-pitched voice could
step up to the mike. She had sung in the choir in junior high,
after all. But she was politely told to stick to setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian and Debbie said I couldn't do it, because they thought
it would turn into a Roseanne Barr deal,'' she said. ``I do have a
serious side. I guess they don't believe me when I say I can be
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   That is seldom at issue once the first serve crosses the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she has a great perspective of what's important and
what's not,'' Gimmillaro said. ``She has a perspective of life that
I wish a lot of us older people had. She isn't bothered by trivial
things. And she's able to be incredibly serious when she needs to
be, and not serious when she doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has all the qualities to be a great friend, and a great
teammate.''
</P>
<P>
   And if she comes away with a national championship and gets
selected the nation's player of the year for the second consecutive
season, one could make a compelling argument that the little girl
with the balloon grew into the most celebrated athlete Long Beach
State has ever produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that this university's ever had an athlete that's
been more recognized than Misty,'' said Dr. Robert Maxson, the
school's president and a regular at courtside for 49ers home
matches. ``She obviously is the best college player in America (No,
Dr. Bob doesn't have a vote for player of the year), but she's just
such a wonderful representative and ambassador for the university.
She represents everything I believe a student athlete ought to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   (subhd) Beautiful Mist
</P>
<P>
   She was born Misty Elizabeth May, but her parents still hope she
will one day incorporate ``Kehaunani'' into her legal name. Her
father is nearly half Hawaiian and, to natives of the islands, the
word means ``Beautiful Mist.''
</P>
<P>
   May spent much of her childhood on or near Santa Monica's State
Beach, one of the true Meccas of volleyball. Her father, Butch,
played on the U.S. Olympic team in 1968. He and her mother,
Barbara, coached briefly at Santa Monica City College, and both
spent many a long weekend toiling in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   Although Butch May said the family lived a mostly ``paycheck to
paycheck'' existence in those days, the Mays became sort of
honorary members of the Sand and Sea Club, a social and athletic
gathering place with a largely Jewish membership. There, they
rubbed elbows and played volleyball and paddle tennis with wealthy
Angelinos, and let their daughter swim in the Olympic-sized pool
and play in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to compare incomes,'' Butch May said, ``ours
probably wasn't much more than the people who were taking care of
the grounds. We were always thankful that we had a place like that
to go. We tried to give back to the club, play with some of the
older people no one else would play with ... we made lifetime
friends, people who let us into their lives to watch their kids'
successes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mays came into some inheritance money, so they bought a
house and moved from Santa Monica to Costa Mesa when Misty was in
the eighth grade. She was already developing into an extraordinary
volleyball and soccer player, but had to fit in and find new
friends at that awkward-adolescent age where growing up is hard
enough when you know your surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was tough was that a lot of girls in the eighth and ninth
grade would have birthday parties, and Misty wouldn't get
invited,'' Butch said, ``just because she wasn't part of the
group.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the time she reached Newport Harbor High, she was fast
becoming the life of the party. It didn't hurt that she could pound
a volleyball to the floor from the moment she walked onto campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for freshmen to step in and play varsity,'' said Dan
Glenn, who is in his 13th season as the coach at Newport Harbor.
``She wasn't unique in that way. But I haven't had a kid who was as
talented as a freshman as she was. Ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn admits that it wasn't always smooth sailing at Newport
Harbor between he and May's parents, who had strong opinions about
how their daughter should be coached. Parents will be parents, but
the Mays were a bit different. One had played the game at Olympian
heights. The other had played it and coached it. This is a coach's
worst nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, that's what we're labeled,'' Barbara said, half
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've never interfered with any of her coaches,'' Butch
said. ``We've just kind of debriefed her.''
</P>
<P>
   Misty said she let's old Dad have his say.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's tried talking to coaches before, but egos get in the
way,'' she said. ``So he kind of tells me things I should try to do
differently. I listen to him, because he's smart and his coaches
were good. The stuff he says makes sense. I've never really shunned
anyone out. I listen to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Told that some of his coaching philosophies may be getting
``debriefed'' out of his star player, Gimmillaro took a diplomatic
high road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it's really, really difficult to be a parent,''
the father of two said. ``You want so much for your kids. No matter
what's going on ... you're always worried about your kids. It's
just so hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I completely admire the professionalism of her parents and
their support of me and this program. My God, between Butch and
Barbara, I think they've sent 100 kids to our camps. I told them at
our banquet last year how proud they must be of their daughter. Do
you have kids? Could you imagine if they turn out to be as good as
Misty May as a volleyball player and as a person?''
</P>
<P>
   (subhd) Aloha and Mahalo
</P>
<P>
   ``Kehaunani'' May had to say no to Hawaii, and Hawaii didn't
appreciate it much.
</P>
<P>
   May decided to attend Long Beach before her junior year in high
school. Gimmillaro said he got the word on an August afternoon when
he was gathering his new team at his home for a get-acquainted
barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of in shock,'' he said. ``We thought the
(recruiting) war was just going to get started.''
</P>
<P>
   But May called a truce, and decided there was no point in going
through the charade of visiting three or four other campuses. Long
Beach was getting the player who was at the top of the wish lists
of most of the powerhouse programs of major college volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always come to their camps,'' she said. ``I had been to
the campus a lot to come to games. Maybe because I had been around
it so much, I just felt at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the schools that had hopes of landing her took the news
hard. Butch May said Hawaii coach Dave Shoji cq
</P>
<P>
   appealed to her to consider her heritage. ``He said, `You're
part Hawaiian, Misty. You owe it to the state, you owe it to
everybody here.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Misty's never forgotten that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor has she forgotten how maddening that time was for a
17-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard, because you've got to say no to all the other
schools, and you're scared,'' she said. ``You get yelled at on the
phone. A lot of coaches are disappointed in you. They say, `I can't
believe this. You never gave our school a chance,' and this and
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, when you play them, they're really nice to you.''
</P>
<P>
   It was her relationship with Green, an inductee in the
Volleyball Hall of Fame and former setter for the U.S. National and
Olympic teams, that helped push Long Beach over the top. They met
when May began coming to the 49ers' summer camps at 13, and quickly
formed a bond, one that has only grown stronger over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always talk and hang out together on road trips,'' May
said. ``We share girlie things. She's not just a coach, she's a
friend. She's like my mom away from home. I can talk to her about
boyfriend problems ... anything. Maybe she was like me when she was
my age. Just crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Green is understandably proud of her prized pupil.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something that I see,'' she said, as May signed
autographs for a group of adoring children after a recent match at
the Pyramid. ``These little girls - they want to be like Misty May.
From adults down to the young girls, she (creates) an excitement.
She's just so much fun to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   As the focal point of a high-profile program, May gets a lot of
the attention. She was selected player of the year by the American
Volleyball Coaches Association and Volleyball Magazine last year.
She keeps winning all those tournament MVPs. She gets most of the
media attention. It's her show.
</P>
<P>
   But if all that hype has created any jealousy among her
teammates, it is certainly wearing a clever disguise.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be jealous of her,'' said Alvarado. ``It's
impossible. ``She has a way of knowing how to treat others. She has
a sixth sense about her. She just ... knows
</P>
<P>
   . On the court, off the court, someone else's feelings, what to
say to them when, how to get the best out of you as a player, how
to get he best out of you as a person, just everything. She's
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Said junior middle blocker Brandy Barratt, one of May's
roommates in a rental house near campus: ``She doesn't really get
upset with anyone. She knows she's a team leader, and Brian does
enough of that, so she doesn't need to reinforce it. You know that
you did wrong, and she'll let you know about it. But she does it in
a way that doesn't put you down.''
</P>
<P>
   With May at the controls, the 49ers have built a 30-0 record,
and enter the NCAA Tournament having swept their past 17 matches.
They have lost only six games all season. They are the top-seeded
team in the tournament, and are well positioned to win the national
championship that eluded them last year, when they lost to Stanford

   ``It's our year,'' May said. ``This is the first team since I've
been here that, when we play a team that's really not at our level,
we still play with the same intensity. Past teams I've been on will
maybe have a 15-11 game with one of those teams. But this team has
all been on the same page, just going for one thing. I feel like
the time is right.''
</P>
<P>
   For May, it is one more chance to rise above the mist, and enjoy
the view from the top of the mountain. Don't let those pigtails
fool you. This little girl is all grown up.

ASTRONAUTS CONNECT ELECTRICAL PARTS OF SPACE STATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Astronauts Jerry Ross and Jim Newman scaled the first
components of the new international space station during a
seven-hour spacewalk late Monday, connecting thick electrical power
and computer cables.
</P>
<P>
   The excursion, the first of three planned by the men this week,
began shortly after 4 p.m., CST, as the astronauts crawled from an
airlock in the cargo bay of the shuttle Endeavour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, oh my,'' gushed Ross, his attention momentarily drawn to
the brilliant rays of the sun setting on the Earth's horizon 240
miles below. ``We're going around the world awfully fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The American ``Unity'' and Russian ``Zarya'' modules, joined by
the shuttle crew Sunday, towered nearly eight stories above the
airlock, secured to Endeavour's docking mechanism for the series of
spacewalks.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's stroll was considered by far the most crucial of the
three excursions. Without the nearly 40 cable connections at three
locations, power generated by Zarya's winglike solar arrays would
not reach the computers and other electronics called avionics
aboard Unity.
</P>
<P>
   Power is essential to Unity, a 33-foot long cylinder with a
half-dozen docking ports that will link future station components,
including stabilizing gyroscopes, the U.S. laboratory, an airlock
and more powerful solar arrays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assembly sequence stops if we can't get these avionics
working,'' said Bob Castle, NASA's lead flight director for the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   The first hours of Monday's spacewalk went well, reflecting the
more than 500 hours of ground training the veteran spacewalkers
invested in their preparation for the often tedious work.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, a 50-year-old Air Force colonel who had logged four
previous spacewalks, secured himself on the tip of Endeavour's
50-foot robot arm, which afforded a mobile platform from which to
connect the cables.
</P>
<P>
   Newman, a 42-year-old physicist who conducted a previous
spacewalk five years ago, released each of the snaking 20-foot long
cables to hand to Ross. He worked from a portable mechanical foot
restraint that he moved and plugged into fasteners located around
the work sites.
</P>
<P>
   Assisting them from inside the shuttle were Nancy Currie,
Endeavour's robot arm operator, and pilot Rick Sturckow, their
timekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's spacewalk called for Ross and Newman to work first at
the base of the Unity module, which was latched to the shuttle's
docking mechanism. They spent nearly two hours attaching eight
cables.
</P>
<P>
   Each time his colleague handed him a new power line, Ross would
remove a protective cover installed before the equipment was
launched to prevent debris from lodging between the connector pins.
Using a flash light, Ross also inspected the dozens of fragile pins
in each connector to ensure they had not been bent. He carried a
``pin straightener'' tool to correct any problems.
</P>
<P>
   Cold temperatures, as low as 200 degrees below zero, stiffened
some of the thick cables. More than once, Ross and Newman jokingly
referred to the electrical bundles as ``the octopus.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the cables were plugged to a receptacle, a twist of Ross'
wrist moved a locking collar into place. He also slipped a sleeve
of fabric thermal insulation over each connection.
</P>
<P>
   Ross and Newman then moved to the top of Unity, where the U.S.
module was joined to Zarya where most of the connections awaited
them in the final hours of the spacewalk.
</P>
<P>
   The final half-dozen connections will make it possible for the
power generated by Zarya's solar arrays to flow into Unity. That
power will make it possible for the shuttle astronauts to turn on a
pair of computers mounted on the left and right sides of the
American module.
</P>
<P>
   If their efforts were successful, NASA planned to give
Endeavour's six astronauts a half-day off Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The mission's second spacewalk was scheduled for Wednesday.
After donning spacesuits, Ross and Newman will install a pair of
communications antennas on the outside of Unity, allowing mission
control teams in Houston to monitor activities aboard the new
station over a satellite network.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Endeavour commander Bob Cabana and his crew will
enter the two station modules for the first time to complete the
installation of the communications gear and to prepare its interior
for station crews.
</P>
<P>
   During the third spacewalk Saturday, the astronauts will place
tools and other equipment on the outside of the station, ready for
space station construction workers.
</P>
<P>
   NASA planners estimate that building the new station will take
six years and require 162 spacewalks.

 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee
asserted Monday that his panel had built a ``compelling case'' for
the impeachment of President Clinton and challenged the president
and his lawyers one last time to contest the evidence against him.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of a critical two-day presentation of the president's
defense before the Judiciary panel, the committee chairman, Rep.
Henry Hyde, impatiently dismissed Clinton's decision to call
constitutional scholars and legal experts to argue that the framers
of the Constitution did not envision impeachment as a punishment
for personal misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``For almost two months, I have been pleading with the White
House and the committee Democrats to present some additional
evidence that might demonstrate the president's innocence,'' said
Hyde said at a news conference, surrounded by four stacks of legal
boxes reminding television viewers of the 60,000 pages of evidence
sent to the House by the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. ``I
haven't heard anybody say Monica Lewinsky is a liar.''
</P>
<P>
   As committee Republicans worked behind closed doors Monday to
refine three or four articles of impeachment against Clinton, the
president's allies, across the political spectrum, beseeched
Clinton and his lawyers to do more than offer a legalistic defense
against the perjury and obstruction charges related to his affair
with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in releasing the list of 14 witnesses who will
help make Clinton's defense, said it would indeed extensively
address both the facts and the law before the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But with sentiment in the Republican-controlled Congress
hardening against Clinton, and his fate dependent on perhaps 20 to
30 wavering moderate Republicans, Clinton's allies called for one
more public apology or written statement or dramatic gesture to
reverse the momentum before the full House votes next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know from talking to a number of Republicans that they need
some comfort, some assurance that he understands what he's done,''
said Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican who has been trying to
build support for censure. ``He's got to make some admissions. He's
got to come forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt the momentum is against censure and for
impeachment,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats made the same appeal, telling the White House that the
president had to somehow show he was more concerned with the
possibility of impeachment than with protecting himself from
prosecution for perjury after he leaves office. ``I think it would
be a good idea if the president again faced the American people,''
said Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, a White House spokesman, seemed to downplay the
chance of such an appearance. ``The president is second to none in
recognizing what was wrong in his behavior and apologizing to those
who he's affected and hurt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say it is now inevitable that the Judiciary
Committee will report out one to four articles of impeachment
against the president by the end of the week. The committee's
Republicans were working to set down one or two counts of perjury,
a count of obstruction of justice and a count of abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   They called the drafts still a work in progress. ``It's very
fluid,'' said Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.. ``It depends on where we
come out when the evidence door is closed.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, he and Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla.,
suggested that Republicans were even considering citing Clinton's
legalistic answers to 81 questions from the House Judiciary
Committee as an instance of lying under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Canady said the answers contained ``willful misstatements of the
facts'' in the way the president characterized his conversations
with his personal secretary, Betty Currie, about gifts he had given
to Ms. Lewinsky and about conversations he had with his secretary
the day after he had denied that he and the intern had an affair
during his deposition in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct case.
``I think that he's lying in those answers,'' Canady said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they were still debating whether there should
be one count of perjury or two. And they said they were most
divided over whether to charge Clinton with abuse of power.
``That's the one where there's some divergent views,'' said Rep.
Steve Chabot, R-Ohio. Rep. Howard Gekas, R-Pa., said he had
reservations about charging abuse of power based on the president's
invocations of executive privilege. ``I have trouble with it,'' he
said.

 &HT;    Nurse's internet posting becomes White House protest
 &HT;    By Julia Malone
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just over two months ago, Michelle Hellgeth, a
nurse from Marietta, Ga., was in her home, tapping out Internet
messages urging the impeachment of President Clinton. That was too
passive, she concluded.
</P>
<P>
   So she sent out a call to on-line conservatives. ``I said,
'Let's have a march,''' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   And although she admitted she had no idea how to pull it off, on
Monday she was standing on a platform between giant loud speakers
to welcome a modest lunch-hour protest across from the White House
in Lafayette Park. For more than two hours, a dozen Clinton critics
assailed the president in front of a crowd bearing signs such as
``Impeach the rat.''
</P>
<P>
   A vote to impeach Clinton is ``by no means'' certain, Howard
Phillips, chairman of the Conservative Caucus, told the gathering.
``Bill Clinton will use all of the power of his presidency'' to
stop it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As she watched the results of her first-time political
organizing, Hellgeth said she would have liked to have had a bigger
turnout than the roughly 70 people who showed up. But Hellgeth, the
mother of three grown children, allowed that she wasn't
disappointed. ``We're glad we had some to come and hear the
message,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, her political activism had extended to telephoning
the White House to offer comments. But using her bedroom computer
to search conservative Web sites on the Internet, Hellgeth made
enough contacts to set up the Washington rally.
</P>
<P>
   Her partner was another self-proclaimed political neophyte,
Debbie Cragg of Virginia Beach, Va. ``Michelle and I got together
over the Internet,'' she said. ``I'm just a normal person. I just
got mad. I'm not part of the 'vast right wing conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The two women hooked up with veteran Clinton foes, including
Garland Favorito, a computer consultant from Peachtree Corners,
Ga., who linked them with speakers and ordered up the loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   The two women then worked the Internet sites to send out the
word.
</P>
<P>
   That message got through to Susan Sarver, of Parkersburg, W.Va.,
who brought her four children, ages 4 to 11, who joined a march
around the park with signs, including one saying, ``Dear President,
My parents punish me for lying.''

A SCHEDULED EXECUTION IN TEXAS STIRS PROTEST FROM CANADIAN
GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Joseph Stanley Faulder, a 61-year-old Canadian
national who has already had eight dates with the Texas executioner
during more than two decades on Death Row, now finds himself at the
center of an international tussle over whether his ninth date, this
Thursday, will be his last.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian government, which outlawed the death penalty in
1976, wants Faulder's sentence commuted. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright wants Texas to delay the execution until an
argument over his rights under an international treaty can be
settled. And a disparate coalition of human rights advocates and
death penalty opponents has converged on Texas this week to trumpet
his cause. Among them was a Canadian delegation led by Rubin
(Hurricane) Carter, an American boxer who moved to Toronto after
spending 19 years in prison for three killings that he did not
commit.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder's case has risen to the attention of foreign ministers
because, at the time of his arrest and questioning, he was never
informed that he had the right _ under Article 36 of the Vienna
Convention on Consular Relations, which the United States signed in
1969 _ to contact the Canadian consulate and ask for help.
</P>
<P>
   This right, which the United States demands for its citizens
arrested abroad, has been routinely denied over the years to
foreigners arrested in this country, human rights advocates
contend. Amnesty International said it knows of 73 foreign
nationals from 24 countries being held on death rows in the United
States, but has found only three cases in which the condemned were
properly informed of their consular rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until very recently, consular notification was the rare
exception,'' said Mark Warren, U.S. coordinator for Amnesty
International in Canada. ``Until last year, we found that virtually
no one in the U.S. knew of the treaty, even though the State
Department sent out periodic bulletins to local law enforcement
officials. Even now, it's a slow sell.'' The largest number of
foreign nationals on death row are Mexicans imprisoned in Texas and
California.
</P>
<P>
   In the Faulder case, Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy of Canada
contacted Albright and Gov. George Bush of Texas last month to ask
that the lethal injection scheduled for 6 p.m. Thursday at the
Texas death house in Huntsville be delayed until it can be
determined whether Faulder's failure to get consular help did
indeed contribute to the sentence of death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking here about freeing someone; we're talking
about reducing a death sentence,'' said Richard Dieter, director of
the Death Penalty Information Center in Washington. ``If he had
been advised about consular notification and gotten some legal help
from Canada, it might have made the difference in what sentence he
received.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright agreed to to ask Bush to grant a 30-day reprieve, as
much as the governor is empowered to do under Texas law. She
pointed out that there are 12,500 American citizens in foreign
jails, including some 300 Texans, who are afforded this most basic
consular protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ability to provide such assistance is heavily dependent,
however, on the extent to which foreign governments honor their
consular notification obligations to us,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says he will accede to whatever recommendation he receives
later this week from the Texas Board of Paroles and Pardons, a body
that has not shown itself inclined toward clemency in death penalty
cases.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, lawyers for Faulder have asked the U.S. Supreme
Court to delay the execution and reconsider the case. They have
three days to decide.
</P>
<P>
   There is little dispute about the basic facts of the crime:
Faulder, a drifter with a prison record, met a woman in an East
Texas pool hall in 1975 and hatched a plan to rob an elderly oil
widow. It went badly. The safe in the widow's house was empty, the
two women began to struggle over a gun and Faulder first bashed in
the widow's head with a blackjack and then buried a kitchen knife
in her chest.
</P>
<P>
   Arresting officers said that they didn't know that Faulder was a
Canadian citizen because he was carrying a Texas driver's license.
It was not until he was on Death Row for 15 years that a new
attorney thought to contact his family and alerted Canadian
authorities, who said they would have provided legal assistance to
Faulder if only they had known.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Faulder are asking the Supreme Court to delay the
execution, both on these grounds and because, his lawyers contend,
prosecutors withheld important evidence during his second trial.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be the first time that the court has considered the
issue of consular notification. Angel Breard, a Paraguayan
national, was executed in Virginia earlier this year after the
Supreme Court ruled that it was too late for him to make a request
for clemency on such grounds. He had already petitioned the court
on other grounds, the court held, and he had not brought up the
consular issue before the state courts.
</P>
<P>
   The court went on to say that Breard had also failed to make the
case that the denial of consular rights had had any significant
effect on the outcome of his case, said Dieter of the Death Penalty
Information Center.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder's case is different, said Sandra Babcock, his chief
lawyer, because he did bring up the consular issue before Texas
state courts and because there is reason to believe that the
Canadian government would have provided legal help if it had been
contacted. Such help might have saved Faulder from the death
penalty, she said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has routinely in recent years made
``lackluster appeals'' for clemency at the urging of foreign
governments, Warren, the Amnesty International coordinator, said,
as it did in the case of Breard.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Villafuerte, a Honduran national, was executed in Arizona
in April for a 1983 murder, despite protests from the Honduran
government and the State Department that he had not been advised of
his consular rights. In Illinois, lawyers are trying to win a new
trial for Gregory Madej, a Polish national convicted of a 1981
Chicago murder, by arguing that he, too, had not been advised of
his consular rights.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights activists estimate that there are 50 cases being
argued in U.S. courts on a variety of charges that are based, in
part, on a failure to provide proper consular notification.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a golden rule,'' Warren said. ``If the United States
expects the rights of its citizens to be protected abroad, it must
provide those rights to foreigners in the United States. This is
not rocket science. And the U.S. State Department is painfully
aware, I think, that they are on very thin ice.''
</P>
<P>
   But the case involving Faulder differs from Breard's, he said,
because for the first time Albright argued in her letter to Bush
that ``the consular notification issues in this case are
sufficiently troublesome that they may provide sufficient grounds
for according discretionary clemency relief.''
</P>
<P>
   A State Department spokesman said on Monday night that consular
notification would probably not have resulted in a dismissal of the
case against Faulder, but might be reason enough to grant special
clemency to commute the death sentence. All Albright wants is for
Bush to seriously consider the Canadian request for a 30-day
reprieve to consider such clemency, said the spokesman, who would
not comment on charges that previous State Department responses in
such cases were ``lackluster.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush returned from an overseas trip last week and told reporters
that he would make no final decision on Faulder's execution until
he received a recommendation from the Texas Board of Paroles and
Pardons, and saw no need for giving the board more time to ponder
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, I will uphold the laws of the state of Texas,
regardless of the nationality of the person involved,'' Bush said.
``People can't just come into our state and cold-blood murder
somebody. That's unacceptable behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a strong supporter of the death penalty, has generally
acceded to the recommendations of his parole board.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Rodriguez, chairman of the Texas parole board, said its
recommendation on Faulder's case would be given to the governor
``in a timely manner,'' but Faulder's supporters said they had
little hope that the board would recommend clemency.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Supreme Court decided not to take up Faulder's case,
Ms. Babcock said there is still one avenue for his supporters to
pursue.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a Texas judge ruled in a class action suit brought on
behalf of all death row inmates that the parole board had acted
with improver secrecy over the years. Ms. Babcock said she will
file an appeal in Texas courts arguing that Faulder's execution
should be delayed until this issue is resolved, too.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Canada said they were still hoping for the best in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still looking at all of the possible avenues,'' said
Sophie Legendre, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Foreign Ministry.
``The case has attracted quite a lot of attention in Canada,
especially in recent days. We have received a lot of calls from
people asking what they can do to help. Generally, you know, there
is not a lot of support in Canada for the death penalty.''

DIMAGGIO SUFFERS MAJOR SETBACK  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE NOBLES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD, Fla. _ Hospitalized for nearly two months now, Joe
DiMaggio suffered another serious setback over the weekend, his
doctor acknowledged Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe has had a significant and serious turn for the worse,''
Dr. Earl Barron told the Associated Press. ``The outlook has dimmed
over the past 72 hours. He's not in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   The 84-year-old DiMaggio, who had lung cancer surgery on Oct.
14, two days after he was admitted to Memorial Regional Hospital
here, again is suffering from a lung infection and blood pressure
drop, Barron said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Famer's relapse occurred on Sunday morning, said
longtime friend Morris Engelberg, who responded to Barron's beeper
message that ended with 911.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's wrong,'' a somber Engelberg said Monday. ``Fever.
Fluid buildup. Dr. Barron gave me a list a mile long this
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg, a tax attorney, said he has canceled all of his
appointments for the week so he can be near the former Yankee
center fielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just devastated,'' he said. ``I cried all day yesterday. I
was sick last night. I couldn't sleep. My blood pressure went up.''
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg spent part of Monday advising DiMaggio family and
close friends of his third major setback since Nov. 16. And some
are flying in _ including granddaughter Cathy, her husband and two
children, as well as Joe Nachio, who has been DiMaggio's friend for
56 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't want him to have any pain, that's it,'' Engelberg
said of DiMaggio. ``He's a very dignified man and I'm going to make
sure he's dignified right to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend faxed Engelberg Monday's AP story depicting DiMaggio's
condition as worsening.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, it's worse than what the report said,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Are DiMaggio's chances of a full recovery sinking?
</P>
<P>
   After a pause, Engelberg said, ``If I cancel appointments for a
week, you can read into it. I can't call anything medically. But
I'm a tax lawyer. This is my busiest time of year. If I've canceled
everyone out Monday through Friday, you get some idea of how
serious this is.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many things I have to do, but I can't work. It's
serious. It's bad.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's serious relapses began on Nov. 16, when his blood
pressure suddenly plunged 30 points and Barron acknowledged fearing
for his life. But by the time Engelberg arrived the next morning,
DiMaggio was in front of a mirror shaving himself.
</P>
<P>
   The next setback came Thanksgiving weekend. DiMaggio celebrated
his 84th birthday that Wednesday and Barron gave an upbeat medical
report. DiMaggio appeared to be heading toward such a recovery that
Engelberg talked about his rehabilitation once he left the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Then the man voted in 1969 as baseball's greatest living player
fell victim again to a lung infection and blood pressure drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``He takes two steps forward and one back,'' Barron said at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   That was a week ago. Monday is DiMaggio's 56th in the hospital,
a magic number more associated with his major league record hitting
streak, which happened in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that certain medication sends DiMaggio's
blood pressure plummeting. That has put the six-doctor team
treating him in the position of ``reacting to what happens rather
than anticipating,'' Barron said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are continuing supportive care,'' the doctor said Monday.
``The outlook is not as good as it was a few days ago.''
</P>

WB EXECUTIVE STEPS ASIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Garth Ancier became the third top programmer in the last month
to leave his network when he announced Monday that he was stepping
down as president of entertainment for WB.
</P>
<P>
   He will be replaced by Susanne Daniels, who had been the
executive vice president for prime-time series. Ms. Daniels becomes
the third woman to hold the job of president of entertainment at a
network, following Jamie Tarses at ABC and Nancy Tellem at CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Ancier will remain at WB, owned by Time Warner, as a programming
consultant until his contract expires in May. He also intends to
retain an ownership stake in the network.
</P>
<P>
   He is not permitted to open negotiations for a new position
until February, but it is widely expected that NBC will pursue him
for the job as its president of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Under Ancier, WB has recorded more growth in the last two years
than any other network and has established a core of shows, like
``Dawson's Creek,'' ``Seventh Heaven'' and ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer,'' which have strong appeal to young viewers, especially
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   WB executives on Monday credited Ms. Daniels with having a hand
in the acquisition and development of all those programs and
several others.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to promote Ms. Daniels now moves up a timetable
already set in motion by the network. Ms. Daniels, 33, said her
contract had called for her to be named president of entertainment
in June, at which time Ancier, 40, would have been elevated to
president of the network.
</P>
<P>
   Ancier had been negotiating a new contract with the top WB
executive, Jamie Kellner, over the last few months, but they could
not reach an agreement. According to several executives at WB,
Ancier, who started his career at NBC, has wanted a chance to
program one of the full-time networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them some time ago the direction I wanted to go in,''
Ancier said Monday. ``I do think it's better for the company to
have this kind of orderly transition.'' Both Ancier and Ms. Daniels
said they had worked well together. ``I'm really going to miss
Garth,'' Ms. Daniels said.
</P>
<P>
   Ancier predicted that WB, which has surpassed the other
fledgling network, UPN, in the competition to become a viable fifth
broadcast network, would continue to grow. ``I think they're in
great shape,'' he said. ``The new show development looks terrific.
I'm going to be keeping my ownership stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Ancier owns 2 percent of WB. That will put him in an unusual
position should he join a competing network like NBC. He said: ``It
is a little odd. How often to do you help start up a network and
then wind up competing against it?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Daniels will have an unusual conflict of her own. She will
program shows to compete with Fox's ``King of the Hill,'' a show
whose executive producer, Greg Daniels, is her husband. Ms. Daniels
will also be adding the title of president of Kids WB, the
network's schedule of weekday afternoon and Saturday morning blocks
of programs for children. And she will begin heading WB's in-house
production company.
</P>
<P>
   She said WB would add two more hours of prime-time programming
next fall, bringing the network's total to 13. ``And if we find the
right show, we might move into late night,'' Ms. Daniels said.
Movies are also likely to become part of the lineup, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Ancier said he would remain active consulting on the development
and casting of WB's prospective new shows for the fall. But he will
not be able to consider any offer from NBC or anyone else until
February.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something I have a choice about,'' he said. ``How it
all works out, I've got to wait and see.''

 GATES CRITICIZES PROSECUTION'S METHODS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his most tart and aggressive comments yet about
the antitrust case against his company, Microsoft's chairman, Bill
Gates, blamed the government Monday for what has been widely
perceived as his uncooperative attitude in a taped deposition,
saying the real problem was not the answers he gave, but the
questions he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had expected Boies to ask me about competition in the
software industry,'' Gates said, referring to David Boies, the
government's lead lawyer in the antitrust suit against Microsoft
Corp. ``But no, he didn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said during a news conference, Bois was just
``badgering'' him ``to give yes-or-no answers when he knew the
questions were ambiguous.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates has discussed the case before, including at last month's
meeting with Microsoft's shareholders. But his comments Monday were
the first time he has publicly criticized prosecutors for their
questioning of him during his deposition.
</P>
<P>
   While gathering evidence for the antitrust trial, Boise and
other lawyers for the government interviewed Gates for 20 hours in
August. And as they have played excerpts from the deposition at the
trial during the past eight weeks, criticism of Gates has mounted.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the potentially most damaging criticism was a comment
two weeks ago by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is hearing the
case in U.S. District Court here. ``It's evident to every spectator
that for whatever reasons, in many respects Gates has not been
particularly responsive to his deposition interrogation,'' Jackson
told Microsoft lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the judge's remarks Monday, Gates said, ``I answered
every question, but Boies made it clear that he is out to destroy
Microsoft and make us look very bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates spoke over a satellite video link to a news conference
held here and organized by Microsoft to accuse the government of
attempting to try the case in the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to turn this into a P.R. spectacle,'' said
Charles Rule, a former head of the Justice Department's antitrust
division who is now a Microsoft legal consultant.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, Rule was flanked by the leaders of Microsoft's
legal team and large video monitors for Gates' appearance. ``Our
focus is in the courtroom,'' Rule said, ``but we cannot and will
not stand by without responding.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Justice Department filed suit against Microsoft in
May, the government has not held a news conference relating to the
case, nor has it issued a news release, except those about
scheduling matters.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, on the other hand, holds one or two news briefings
each week and regularly issues position papers and releases.
Monday, for example, the company distributed a 21-page report
titled ``A Case of Trial in Error: The Microsoft Antitrust Suit,''
which largely repeats legal and political arguments the company has
already made several times.
</P>
<P>
   Monday afternoon, the Justice Department did issue a
one-sentence statement: ``Microsoft's latest press statements are
another public relations effort to distract attention from the
overwhelming evidence introduced in court showing that Microsoft
has illegally used its market dominance to block competition from
innovative technologies that threaten its operating system
monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's arguments have resulted in at least one convert.
South Carolina's attorney general, Charles Condon _ one of the 20
state attorneys general who filed their own antitrust suit against
Microsoft _ said Monday he was dropping out of the case. In
announcing his decision, Condon cited the planned acquisition of
Netscape Communications Corp. by America Online Inc. as evidence of
healthy competition in the Internet industry.
</P>
<P>
   That has been a Microsoft argument since the proposed
acquisition was announced last week. In fact, Microsoft filed a
motion with the court Monday asking for permission to subpoena
documents from Netscape, America Online and Sun Microsystems Inc.,
which has agreed to work closely with the merged companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties to the transactions are all witnesses for the
government in this case, and the fact that they are working
cooperatively against Microsoft in the area of Web browsing
software goes to the very heart of the government's claims,''
Microsoft said in its motion.
</P>
<P>
   New York is the lead state among the 19 states that remain
involved with the suit. Marc Wurzel, a spokesman for New York
Attorney General Dennis Vacco, called Condon's decision ``a
non-event.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have no impact on the case,'' Wurzel said. ``And in
the context of multistate efforts like this, it's not at all
unusual for states to come in and drop out as the matter
proceeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Wurzel noted that Texas, a leader of the multistate
investigation of Microsoft early this year, dropped out just before
the suit was filed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Separately Monday evening, the government made public the
direct, written testimony of the next witness in the case: David
Farber, a computer-science expert at the University of Pennsylvania
who takes the stand on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Farber disputes Microsoft's assertion that
bundling Internet software with the Windows operating system
improves the efficiency of both products. In its suit, the
government accuses Microsoft of bundling the two products as a tool
to put Netscape, its chief rival in the market for Web browsers, at
a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``These same efficiencies can be achieved without bundling of
the Web browser software with what Microsoft calls its Windows
operating system,'' Farber testified. ``This is because there are
no technical barriers that prevent Microsoft from developing and
selling its Windows operating system as a stand-alone product
separate from its browser software.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``There are no technical efficiencies for users
achieved by combining Microsoft's browser software with the
remainder of the software sold as Windows 98 that could not be
achieved by writing two programs in a manner that later could be
loaded and `integrated''' by manufacturers or consumers later.
</P>
<P>
   Responding in a news release Monday evening, Microsoft said:
``Farber has provided nothing more than an opinion piece on how he
thinks Microsoft could have or should have designed Windows. But in
our market economy, government consultants don't get to redesign
software products.''

A CLOSER LOOK: POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS FOR SOCIAL SECURITY
</HEADLINE>
  (See also SOCSEC-CONFERENCE) 
 (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are the major options to shore up Social Security, with
their pros and cons:
</P>
<P>
   INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS
</P>
<P>
   PROS: An opportunity for nearly all workers to build wealth by
investing in stocks and bonds. Higher rates of return than from the
current system. Still receive a guaranteed benefit payment but
lower than under the current system.
</P>
<P>
   CONS: Individuals face the risks of financial markets. Unequal
benefits depending on investing skill or luck. Costs of
administering 140 million accounts would be steep. Would require
deep cuts in guaranteed benefits or large tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT
</P>
<P>
   PROS: Much lower administrative costs than individual accounts.
Market risks would be spread across income levels and generations.
Returns could close a substantial portion of the financial gap
facing the system.
</P>
<P>
   CONS: Makes government a major force in stock and bond markets,
raising the possibility of Washington meddling in private
enterprise. Investment decisions subject to politics.
</P>
<P>
   RAISING RETIREMENT AGE
</P>
<P>
   PROS: Would reflect increased life expectancies. Further
increases would keep constant the portion of adult life spent in
retirement. Could eliminate some long-term problems.
</P>
<P>
   CONS: Already scheduled to rise gradually over the next two
decades to 67. People who do physical work cannot be expected to
continue working longer than they do now. Raising the age would
hurt older workers who lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   CAP ON TAXABLE EARNINGS
</P>
<P>
   PROS: Raising the amount of income taxed from the current limit
of $68,400 puts much of the burden for fixing Social Security on
those who can afford it most. Cap leaves a greater portion of total
earnings untaxed than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   CONS: Amounts to a substantial tax increase. Social Security is
already a relatively bad deal for upper income people, and raising
the cap would make it worse.
</P>
<P>
   REDUCING COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS
</P>
<P>
   PROS: Many economists think the consumer price index overstates
inflation and gives Social Security recipients a bigger increase
than is justified.
</P>
<P>
   CONS: Some economists think the consumer price index understates
the cost of living for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   REDUCING BENEFITS FOR THE WEALTHY
</P>
<P>
   PROS: Places the burden on those who can most afford it either
through tax increases or benefit reductions. Cutting benefits by 30
percent for people with retirement income above $60,000 a year and
by 85 percent for people with retirement income over $110,000 a
year would eliminate three-quarters of the program's long-term
problems.
</P>
<P>
   CONS: A big tax increase. Taxing benefits might unduly hurt
people who get high levels of benefits but have little or no other
income.

SUN MICROSYSTEMS IS MOVING TO `OPEN SOURCE' MODEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In an effort both to broaden support for its
Java programming language and to nurture innovation, Sun
Microsystems plans to announce on Tuesday that it will move a step
closer to the ``open source'' model for freely sharing the work of
programmers.
</P>
<P>
   The planned announcement is both an acknowledgment of the
growing force of the open source philosophy _ which embodies free
programs like the Linux operating system _ and an effort by Sun to
attract the expertise of companies across a wide spectrum of
manufacturing and services in developing Java to meet the needs of
their own industries.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing Java 2.0, at an industry trade conference in New
York, Sun will also announce that the original programmers'
instructions, or source code, will be freely available in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   However, unlike traditional open source licensing plans,
companies that license Java will still be required to pay a royalty
when shipping a usable program based on the source code. Their
products must also pass a Java compatibility test before they can
be shipped. However, Sun said it planned to retain
PricewaterhouseCoopers to audit the process of who determines which
new functions can be added to the language.
</P>
<P>
   While industry analysts and developers welcomed the opening of
the platform, they noted that it would still fall short of the open
source movement's goal of doing away with limits on the exchange of
software.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds very elegant, but it's very tricky,'' said Esther
Dyson, publisher of Release 2.0, an industry newsletter. ``You have
to define what you're getting royalties for, and you have to wonder
what Sun's real motivation is.''
</P>
<P>
   However, programmers who value the ability to get their hands on
the inner working of the tools they use to write their programs
generally welcomed the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you a little more trust in the product, because you
can go in and fix something if you need to,'' said Howard Katz, a
Canadian Java software developer.
</P>
<P>
   Sun executives said they were hoping to generate new interest in
Java by lowering the cost of developing the language and by
encouraging more vibrant development though freely shared ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we are making this change is, on the one hand,
we've seen some of the success that the open source community has
had in driving innovation,'' said Alan Baratz, president of Sun's
Javasoft division.
</P>
<P>
   Sun might also be acting to defuse any plans to clone its
technology, a fear that stems in part from its court victory last
month in its lawsuit accusing Microsoft Corp. of violating its Java
licensing agreement by making unapproved changes to it.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Judge Ronald Whyte of U.S. District Court in San
Jose, Calif., ruled that Microsoft must stop shipping the
incompatible version of its program within 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft later said it was considering various options,
including dropping its Java support. A more likely possibility,
many analysts say, is that Microsoft might consider cloning Java,
an approach already taken by a consumer products division of
Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   By changing its licensing terms, Baratz said, Sun was also
opening up the process by which other corporations and software
developers will be able to contribute to the way the language
evolves.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, he said, Sun held that control unilaterally, and
only its partners were able to offer ideas for new functions and
standards.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A number of companies intend to endorse the new Sun licensing
plan, including some corporations that had been thinking about
cloning Java, but Hewlett-Packard will not be one of them, Baratz
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, Hewlett-Packard provided good input, and we developed
a model that achieved many if not all of the things that were
important to them,'' he said. ``I think there are other political
reasons that H-P is choosing not to participate.''
</P>
<P>
   There were also indications Monday that Microsoft planned to
continue to participate in the Java market. The company said it was
releasing a new version of its Java that offered better performance
than Sun's current version. Microsoft also added support for Jini,
Sun's distributed Java technology that had been a source of
divisiveness between the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Baratz said Monday that it had not yet been possible to compare
performance of Microsoft's and Sun's new versions of Java, because
neither company had yet received copies of the other's product.

ANALYSIS: WITH SOFT MONEY, ANYTHING GOES

   WASHINGTON _ More than two years of uproar and investigation _
into White House coffees and endless advertising, mysterious
gardeners and munificent nuns, Indonesian bankers and Arkansas
restaurateurs _ faded further into the background Monday with
Attorney General Janet Reno's decision not to recommend an
independent counsel to investigate President Clinton's role in 1996
campaign commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The decision lightens Clinton's load of troubles, coming as it
does after Kenneth Starr dropped several lines of inquiry and the
Paula Jones sexual misconduct suit was settled. The president would
have cause to celebrate, if not an impending impeachment vote over
the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   The decision also strengthens what is emerging as the one
unbendable campaign finance rule for any presidential aspirant who
hopes to be competitive: Almost anything goes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is not out of the woods. A Justice Department task force
will keep investigating possible campaign finance abuses, and the
few journalists who are still excavating the 1996 campaign may yet
find something damaging to the president. Ms. Reno could still
recommend an independent counsel into another, distantly related
matter, involving Harold Ickes, the former deputy White House chief
of staff.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Ms. Reno takes that step, it poses little threat to
Clinton. After Starr got permission to expand his investigation
from real estate deals to presidential affairs, future independent
counsels are likely to be kept on a tighter leash.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reno had already effectively dismissed most of the
accusations of shady dealings on the part of President Clinton in
financing his re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, however, she ordered a review of whether
Clinton violated campaign finance rules in promoting his
re-election in 1996 with commercials paid for by the Democratic
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had a strong defense: He had listened to his lawyers
every step of the way. But, more important, he did not need a
strong defense, because of the profound weakness of the campaign
finance rules he was accused of violating.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the commercials did not expressly advocate the
election or defeat of a candidate, Clinton was advised, they did
not have to be paid for with federally regulated campaign money,
which is given in limited amounts. Instead, they could be paid for
by the party, with the unrestricted donations known as soft money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized we could run these ads through the Democratic
Party, which meant we could raise money in $20,000 and $50,000 and
$100,000 wads,'' Clinton boasted to a group of donors two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was to snatch up such wads that the Democrats engaged in the
questionable practices that produced the biggest scandal of his
presidency, until the next scandal came along.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials, which began to be broadcast as early as August
1995, never explicitly urged a vote for the president. But they
were not subtle. ``Dole-Gingrich vote no _ no to America's
families,'' intoned one advertisement, fusing Sen. Bob Dole, then
the front-runner for the Republican nomination, to Newt Gingrich,
the unpopular House speaker.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Republicans paid for commercials providing a
stirring biography of Dole. They said that such advertising did not
call for anyone's election.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Republican cries of outrage Monday, the political
market has long since discounted the decision. That is, politicians
who have lambasted Clinton for his practices have also studied them
closely and have been following his example without fear of
possible prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998 campaign, the Republicans used soft money to pay for
commercials assailing Clinton over his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
Presidential hopefuls have already begun raising soft money to pay
for advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision suggests that such candidates may have less
reason to fear the kind of aggressive investigation that could lead
to a tightening of campaign finance laws. But Rep. Christopher
Shays, R-Conn., who is pushing one such measure, said that he did
not ``see it playing one way or other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The system is broken and needs to be fixed,'' he said. ``Soft
money is the loophole that ate the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno's decision and the impending impeachment vote share a deep
historic connection, and they may in the end result in significant
changes. Modern campaign finance laws and independent counsels both
arose from the reforms put in place after the last bout with
impeachment, during Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton fund-raiser and top aide,
predicted that Congress would soon begin rethinking those reforms,
partly because of the campaign finance and Lewinsky investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last gasp of the independent counsel statute and
the Watergate reforms,'' he said, ``and these institutions will
begin to be changed in the next five years.''

SERVICES FOR ALBERT GORE SR., A CONGRESSIONAL MAVERICK 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will head the delegation of
Cabinet members, lawmakers and other prominent politicians at a
memorial service on Tuesday for Albert Gore Sr., the father of the
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who died on Saturday at his home in Carthage, Tenn., three
weeks before his 91st birthday, was a maverick progressive Democrat
from Tennessee who was at the forefront of the national debate over
civil rights and international affairs in seven terms in the House
of Representatives and three terms in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Twice, in 1956 and 1960, he was close to becoming the Democratic
nominee for vice president himself. One of the most memorable
images of the 1992 Democratic National Convention was of Gore, 82,
standing with his 9-year-old grandson, Albert III, in his arms,
flashing a V-for-victory sign and acknowledging the cheers of the
throngs as his son accepted the No. 2 spot on the Democratic
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have been that close, it was quite understandable why I was
so exuberant,'' he told a reporter afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The public memorial service will start at noon at the War
Memorial Auditorium in Nashville. The main eulogies will be
delivered by Benjamin L. Hooks, the Memphis minister, lawyer and
judge who was executive director of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People, and Bishop Jane Holmes Dixon,
the Episcopal suffragan of Washington. Both are said to be family
friends.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, who was born when his father was in
Congress, declined on Monday to be interviewed, but the story has
often been told about how from the time he was a child, Al Gore was
groomed by his father for high office.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Gore Sr. _ no one called him Al _ was a mainstay of
Washington politics from the time he was elected to the House in
1938 until he was defeated in 1970 when he ran for a fourth term in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when most successful Southern politicians were arch
conservatives, Gore generally sided with the liberal wing of the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of three Southern senators _ Lyndon Johnson of Texas
and Estes Kefauver, also from Tennessee, were the others _ who did
not sign the Southern manifesto in 1956 protesting the Supreme
Court's decision two years earlier outlawing segregation in public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   And in the 1960s, he was a staunch opponent of the war in
Vietnam, which he once called ``an American nightmare come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Those stands and others that were out of step with his region
led to his defeat in 1970 by Bill Brock, a Republican, in a race
that for its time was unusually vituperative. Brock was a
standard-bearer for Richard Nixon's ``Southern strategy,'' the
largely successful effort to turn the once solid South for the
Democrats into a Republican stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Monday, former Sen. Mike Mansfield of
Montana, who entered the Senate with Gore in 1953 and who was the
Democratic leader in Gore's last term, remembered his colleague
this way: ``Albert ran his boats along the lines his conscience
dictated. It took a lot of guts. He had them, but he paid for it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement from the White House, Clinton said that by
standing against segregation and the war, Gore had been ``truly a
real role model for people like me in the South in the 1960s.''
Gore ``helped to connect the South with the rest of America,'' the
president added.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Albert Arnold Gore was born the day after Christmas in 1907 near
Granville, Tenn. His forebears had crossed the Appalachians shortly
after the American Revolution and settled in the hill country of
middle Tennessee that drew Andrew Jackson and spawned Sam Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Gore attended a one-room school in Possum Hollow and worked his
way through Middle Tennessee State Teachers College and night law
classes at the YMCA in Nashville. At the Y, he met Pauline La Fon,
and they married after they graduated. She survives him, as do the
vice president's four children. The vice president's only sibling,
Nancy Gore Hunger, died in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, when Gore was 29, a place opened in the Tennessee
congressional delegation. The seat had once been held by Cordell
Hull, who went on to become a prominent New Deal senator and
secretary of state and whom Gore once described as ``my ideal in
public life.'' Gore decided to run. He defeated five opponents and
won the seat.
</P>
<P>
   He was a maverick from his first days in Congress. In his maiden
speech, he took on the Roosevelt administration and the Democratic
leadership in the House and spoke against expanding the borrowing
authority of the U.S. Housing Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported that his address ``stopped the
show'' and was given ``an ovation of proportions such as are
usually reserved for elder statesmen.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech was credited with changing a number of votes, and the
measure was defeated.
</P>
<P>
   But generally in his 14 years in the House, Gore backed the New
Deal social programs and international policies of Presidents
Roosevelt and Truman.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, Tennessee's 83-year-old senator, Kenneth D. McKellar,
had begun to slip, and Gore took him on in the Democratic primary.
It was not a gentle challenge. A hillbilly band that often traveled
with Gore played a theme song that concluded with the line,
``Albert Gore, he's only 44.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore won the primary and the general election and entered the
Senate in a class of freshmen that included not only Sen. Mansfield
but also John Kennedy, Henry Jackson, Barry Goldwater and George
Bush's father, prescott, a Republican from Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   With his close-cut gray hair and florid style of speaking, Gore
seemed immediately at home in the Senate. In a Harper's magazine
article many years later, David Halberstam wrote: ``Albert is an
old-style senator, a Roman senator, really. One can almost imagine
him seated with Webster, Calhoun and Clay. In fact, it is hard to
imagine Albert as anything but a senator.''
</P>
<P>
   At once, he made his mark as an accomplished orator. Russell
Baker, who covered the Senate for The New York Times, described
Gore's speaking style: ``His accent is piney-woods Southern rather
than magnolia Dixie; its distinctive mark is the omission of the
`g' on all words with `ing' endings. Thus Sen. Thomas C. Hennings
of Missouri is always `Senator Hennin's.'''
</P>
<P>
   But he spoke differently in the Senate from the way he did at
home. ``On the stump,'' Baker wrote, ``he is a crowd-pleasing
hell-raiser, but his formal Senate speeches run to Ciceronian
solemnity.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when cigars provided the atmosphere of the Capitol and
bourbon and martinis the lubrication, Gore neither smoked nor
drank. He tended toward stuffiness even by Senate standards, and he
often irritated his colleagues with his strait-laced demeanor and
refusal to bend.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see something that needs to be done,'' he once
explained, ``I want to do something about it. I'm slower to
compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was blessed with an outgoing, gregarious wife who had
quick political instincts and the ability to smooth out wrinkles
Gore had caused. They lived in a hotel on Massachusetts Avenue, and
that is where the vice president was raised.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter, Nancy, once described her parents this way: ``He
just doesn't know how to gossip, how to make small talk. He doesn't
like to pull off shoes, drink beer and shoot the bull. Mother will
talk 45 minutes to a person, where Daddy will talk 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield recalled: ``The force behind Albert was Pauline. She
was with him all the time, and she had a great influence on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was involved in nearly all the big issues of the middle
third of the 20th century. He was an early proponent of Medicare.
He was a strong advocate of nuclear power to generate electricity.
He favored foreign aid and fought tight money. He supported higher
taxes on insurance companies and the oil and gas industry. He
opposed an antiballistic missile system. He was instrumental in
killing Nixon's Supreme Court nominations of two Southerners, F.
Clement Haynsworth and Harrold G. Carswell.
</P>
<P>
   He often said that his proudest accomplishment in politics was
his sponsorship of the legislation that authorized the Interstate
Highway System.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not always take the liberal side. He called for using
nuclear weapons in Korea. And in a stand he said he later
regretted, he voted against the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964,
the law that prohibited discrimination in public accommodations, in
a year when he was up for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   But long after he had left the Senate, it was his stands for
civil rights and against the war in Vietnam that were most
remembered. In ``The Eye of the Storm,'' a campaign autobiography
that was published in 1970, he described why he had decided not to
sign the Southern manifesto:
</P>
<P>
   ``I was placed in the anguishing position of either violating my
legislative conscience by signing a thoroughly unsound document or
of appearing to go `against the South.' I took a stand on
principle, and the people of my state approved.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, in 1958, he was re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's support for civil rights was not entirely a political
drawback. It was one of the elements that made him a prime
candidate for the Democratic vice presidential nomination in 1956.
Rather than picking his running mate himself, the presidential
nominee, Adlai E. Stevenson, left the selection to the convention
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   As the convention opened, the three main candidates were Gore,
Kefauver and Kennedy. After two ballots and most of a third, Gore
held on. But then he withdrew in favor of Kefauver, who won the
nomination and a place on a ticket that was trounced by Eisenhower
and Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, when Kennedy was looking for a Southerner to
balance his ticket, Gore's name came up once again. But Kennedy
picked Lyndon Johnson, a choice that Gore later acknowledged gave
the Democrats the strongest possible team.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's positions on race and war became his undoing in the
1970 election. Busing and patriotism were the issues of the
campaign. Gore became the No. 1 target of Vice President Spiro T.
Agnew's withering attacks. And even when young Al, right out of
Harvard, enlisted in the Army and made television commercials in
uniform for his father, it was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Brock won 51 percent of the vote, and Gore went back to
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Out of office, Gore ran a profitable cattle-breeding farm in
Tennessee and served on corporate boards, including those of the
Occidental Petroleum Co. and the Island Creek Coal Co. He and his
wife were clearly influential in their son's political campaigns,
but they normally stayed out of the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, when his son was still in the House of
Representatives and pondering higher offices, Albert Gore Sr. told
a reporter: ``I'm hopeful for him, but I recognize that the flux of
events, times and issues makes for a hazardous journey.''
</P>
<P>
   This cautious view of politics and life, his friends say, Gore
maintained until his dying day.

SPORTS COLUMN: ANOTHER MALE COACH HIRED IN WNBA  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ His credentials to coach women's professional
basketball were unassailable, though Van Chancellor admits his
original intentions were not altogether pure.
</P>
<P>
   It was during the mid-1960s when Chancellor, teaching math and
coaching boys' basketball in Horn Lake, Miss., went to the
principal one day and said he needed a study hall break. ``There
weren't too many math teachers in Mississippi in those days,'' the
coach of the Houston Comets drawled recently on the phone. ``They
told me they also needed a coach for the girls' team. If I took it
over, I'd be able to get out of two classes a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor never did get out of women's basketball after that,
though he admits he was ``devastated'' when, as the University of
Mississippi women's coach, he was passed over for the men's job in
1985. Now he says ``thank God I was,'' for he got to coach his
daughter, Renee, at Ole Miss and win the Southeastern Conference
title against Pat Summitt and go on to the first two championships
in the Women's National Basketball Association with Cynthia Cooper
and Sheryl Swoopes.
</P>
<P>
   He coached women for $4,800 a year, back when the rules said
three offensive and defensive players couldn't cross midcourt. He
is, at 54, a committed lifer, and proud of it.
</P>
<P>
   The same, unfortunately, can't yet be said for every WNBA male
coach, the number of which will reach five (out of 12) when the
Liberty, as expected, announces Richie Adubato as Nancy Darsch's
successor Wednesday in New York. The last four league vacancies, in
fact, have gone to men, as have a couple (K.C. Jones and Jim
Cleamons) in the rival American Basketball League. Only Brian
Agler, lifted by the WNBA's new Minnesota franchise from the
two-time champion Columbus Quest of the ABL, would qualify in the
way Chancellor did.
</P>
<P>
   If it is premature to scream Old Boy Network, it is not too soon
to point out that the WNBA teams are owned, overseen and in some
cases operated by men. Under the stress of turning a profit, sports
people tend to make the safe hire, usually someone they know, or
best relate to.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening is that our teams are still trying to
determine what the ideal profile for a women's pro coach really
is,'' said Val Ackerman, the WNBA president.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, the WNBA began with 9 of 10 female coaches, has
several women as general managers and, as Ackerman said, ``Last
time I checked, I was a woman.'' The biggest names in the college
game, female or male, have not wanted to surrender tenured
positions for the less prestigious pros. The pool of known coaching
talent is not Olympic-size. That said, when Scott Layden hired his
father, Frank, to rescue the slumping Utah Starzz last summer, no
one pronounced the hire a triumph of the women's movement.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Lieberman-Cline, who once hoisted a few jazzy jumpers in
one of Layden's summer camps, took her Detroit team into Utah
shortly thereafter. Half joking, half raising a most salient issue,
she asked Layden, ``So am I going to see you out scouting the
women's college games?''
</P>
<P>
   Layden cleared his throat, then assured her the Starzz were
looking for another coach, presumably a woman, one not yet found.
</P>
<P>
   Next came Orlando Woolridge, the former NBA no-conscience gunner
who spent last season as an assistant in Los Angeles, where he was
eventually elevated to the Sparks' head position. Agler's hire in
Minnesota was an obvious strike against the enemy. Now, in all
likelihood, comes Adubato, a respected product of the Hubie Brown
stable, though three times dismissed from NBA head-coaching jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect to Frank, Orlando and Richie, women only
have one shot,'' Lieberman-Cline said. ``Guys, it seems now, can
get fired in the men's game, go to the women's game and make a
couple of hundred thousand. And when it comes to choosing a women's
coach, if you're not a female g.m., how would you even know who the
qualified ones are?''
</P>
<P>
   In the Liberty's case, General Manager Carol Blazejowski
presumably did, and has apparently chosen a man. Swoopes, in town
last week for the March of Dimes luncheon, likewise said she did
not believe that women's leagues have a mandate to just hire women.
``But what I would also like to see are some opportunities for
women in the men's game,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The best Lieberman-Cline could do on that score was a rumor she
picked up somewhere that George Karl might be interested in Cheryl
Miller, the Phoenix Mercury coach, as an assistant in Milwaukee. As
that would be a first, an old math teacher might advise Swoopes and
the others to not hold their breath, waiting for this equation to
balance out soon.

COMPANIES GIVEN LITTLE TIME TO REPRICE STOCK OPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Companies that want to reprice options because their
stock price is depressed, but thought that they had months left to
act, scrambled Monday to get the job done before Dec. 15, when
favorable accounting treatment will end.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Accounting Standards Board has been moving for
months to require that repriced options be recorded as an expense,
just like wages, on a company's profit-and-loss statement. But in a
surprise move, the board decided Friday that regardless of when the
new rule is formally adopted it will be effective Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board created a narrow window to reprice _ and a trap for
the uninformed,'' said Brian Foley, an executive compensation
lawyer in White Plains, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   That narrow window was criticized by Nell Minnow, a principal at
Lens Inc., an investment firm that has fought option repricings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board should make its rule retroactive to Jan 1, 1998,''
Ms. Minnow said. ``You shouldn't have a window of any kind because
it creates all kinds of perverse incentives for managements to give
themselves extra holiday presents.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Johnson, a New York compensation consultant to companies,
said that since Friday ``the accounting firms have been out telling
people this is the last bite at the apple.''
</P>
<P>
   Paula Todd, a principal at Towers Perrin, a compensation
consulting company, said her company and its competitors ``were
counseling clients when the market dipped to not rush, to wait and
see what the market was going to do because one of the problems
about repricing was to do it prematurely.'' She added: ``So, there
are a lot of companies that were sitting tight, trying to be
responsible, that now find themselves in a tough spot. This is one
of those no-good-deed-goes-unpunished stories.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she worked with two companies Monday that were trying
to decide if they would reprice and if they could move fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   But at Mercer Management Consulting, the nation's largest
compensation advice firm, not one client of its New York office had
called by Monday evening to ask how to reprice before next Tuesday,
said Yale Tauber, a principal.
</P>
<P>
   A Towers Perrin survey, to be released soon, found that
repricing was being considered by only about one in six companies
that have options priced significantly above the company's current
share price.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Todd and Tauber said interest in rapid repricing would be
concentrated in high-technology companies that use options as the
most important part of a pay package.
</P>
<P>
   Stock options have become an increasingly popular way to pay
executives, and even some nonmanagerial-level employees, because no
expense is recorded on a company's annual profit-and-loss
statement, yet the company gets an income-tax deduction. Instead,
the expense is treated as a change on the company's balance sheet,
where assets and liabilities are recorded.
</P>
<P>
   As options have become more common, the practice of repricing
them when a company's stock price falls has also spread. Some
companies have repriced options three, four or five times in recent
years. Since the stock market's dip over the summer, repricings
have been disclosed in regulatory filings by more than 100
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Lucas, the accounting board's research director, said
that requiring companies to treat repriced options as an expense on
their profit-and-loss statement was consistent with a 1972 opinion
by the board's predecessor. That opinion held that a variable stock
option plan _ in which the number of options or their strike price
would be determined based on future events _ had to be treated as
an expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think repricing options makes them variable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the short deadline was part of a pattern by the
board to tighten the availability of options that are not recorded
as an expense. He noted that the board tried two years ago to
require that all options be treated as expenses, but that fierce
opposition from corporations, and a Senate vote overwhelmingly
supporting the companies, persuaded the board to relent.
</P>
<P>
   He said the board ``is doing what all regulators do when they
can't get what they want directly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are rewriting the regulations to get closer to what they
want,'' he said, adding, ``The result is more confusing
regulations, which creates more fees for people like me, and which
is wonderful for people like me, but not for U.S. business.''

WHITE HOUSE LAWYERS STAY FOCUSED AMID SEASONAL FESTIVITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Days before a vote on whether to impeach President
Clinton, the atmosphere at the White House Monday was as surreal as
celebrating the Christmas season when the temperature outside is 70
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton was showing off the glittery holiday
decorations at the White House, where the theme this year is ``A
Winter Wonderland.'' The president was in a downstairs room taping
his appearance on a television special called ``Christmas in
Washington,'' a show he won't attend live this year because of his
trip to the Middle East later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   While the Clintons went through the motions of the holiday
season, the buzz from the House impeachment vote seemed to create
more noise than a Marine Band trio's playing of `` 'Tis the Season
to Be Jolly.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the possibility that Clinton could be impeached has not
registered with much of the American public, White House aides
said, the point has not been lost on the president's aides and
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking this very seriously indeed, and I think we are
working on it in the appropriate manner,'' said Ann Lewis, director
of White House communications.
</P>
<P>
   So alarmed are the president's aides and lawyers by the growing
prospect that the Judiciary Committee and full House will vote this
week and next to impeach Clinton that not only are they warning
about the ``grave and serious consequences'' of impeachment, but
they are also modulating their criticism of Republicans who want to
impeach Clinton to avoid turning off critical GOP moderates, some
of whom are undecided.
</P>
<P>
   They are also emphasizing to members of Congress how the
impeachment vote is likely to be the most important they will cast
in their career.
</P>
<P>
   And in a counterpunch to the Republican argument that voting for
impeachment would be the equivalent of censure, since conventional
wisdom is that the Senate will not remove the president from
office, aides are stressing that sending the matter to the Senate
has the potential to paralyze the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It basically would be a longer version of the goverment
shutdown,'' a senior White House official said. ``With all the
focus on the . . . partisan squabbling, sometimes people forget
this isn't just a vote over a trade bill.''
</P>
<P>
   The seriousness with which the White House has come to view the
process was evident in its announcement Monday that White House
lawyers Charles F. C. Ruff and Gregory B. Craig will present
Clinton's defense Tuesday and Wednesday before the House Judiciary
Committee's impeachment hearing.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said it was more appropriate for
government lawyers to represent Clinton before the committee rather
than Clinton's private lawyer, David Kendall, who cross-examined
the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, when he appeared before
the committee last month. Kendall, however, is expected to be
present at the hearings.
</P>
<P>
   And rather than criticize Starr, White House lawyers will
present a defense that is ``serious, that doesn't attempt to lay
blame with someone else, and makes a case that both on the facts
and the law and on the constitutional standards . . . the president
shouldn't be impeached,'' said the White House press secretary,
Joseph Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining this turnabout, he said, ``We are moving into a
different phase. . . . Given the fact that what the House of
Representatives is discussing is removing the president, removing
him from office, overturning the will of the people, it's important
that this be done in a serious way.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart did not entirely dismiss the possibility that Clinton
could decide this week or next to amplify his expressions of
contrition over lying to the country for eight months over his
affair with the former White House intern, Monica S. Lewinsky. ``If
it's appropriate to say something, he will,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Although some speculation has centered on whether Mrs. Clinton
might also make some statement of support for her husband before
the House vote, a source close to her said Monday: ``That would
surprise me very greatly. I haven't heard anything that makes me
think that's the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The source, however, said of Mrs. Clinton: ``Obviously, she is
one of his advisers on a very basic level . . . obviously one of
the people he talks to,'' about the evolution of his defense
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said White House officials, based on polling data, are
worried that many Americans have not grasped the fact that the
president may be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know one of the responsibilities is to say to people, `This
is real,' '' she said. ``That's one of the things this hearing is
going to do. The biggest effect, the most important, is likely to
be people learning from the news and seeing it for themselves . . .
that a significant number of members of Congress want to go forward
and do something that the American public emphatically said it
doesn't want to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those members of Congress were the Clintons' guests
Monday night at the annual Congressional Ball at the White House,
to which all 535 members of the House and Senate were invited.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said, ``This is a tradition at the White House to, on
Christmas time, bring down members on a bipartisan basis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the people's house; it's not a Democrat White House or
a Republican White House,'' Lockhart said Monday before the ball.
``And I hope that Republicans feel welcome to attend.''

HOFFA CALLS FOR END OF FEDERAL OVERSIGHT OF TEAMSTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing; replaces TEAMSTERS-HOFFA, eliminated
earlier.)  (nk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ James P. Hoffa came out swinging Monday in his
first news conference since being elected president of the
Teamsters, promising to create a bigger, more militant union and
calling for an end to federal supervision of the Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa, son of the Teamsters' most famous leader, presented an
aggressive set of goals, among them uniting the badly divided
union, redoubling organizing efforts and building the nation's
largest political action committee.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that the International Brotherhood of Teamsters had
gone far to root out criminal elements, Hoffa said it was time to
shrink and ultimately phase out federal supervision _ a decade-long
effort to clean up a union notorious for corruption even before his
father ran it.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa complained that the federal oversight has cost the union
more than $80 million since 1989, when the Teamsters agreed to the
supervision to settle a federal racketeering lawsuit that charged
the union with having entered into a ``devil's pact'' with the mob.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should start talking about a diminished role for the
government,'' Hoffa said in an appearance at the National Press
Club. ``It's been 10 years. Is the government going to be here in
the year 2050? In the year 3000? It's something we should talk
about because of the tremendous burden on the members.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of federal oversight, more than 200 corrupt
officials have been ousted from a union in which three presidents,
including Hoffa's father, Jimmy, went to prison and Hoffa's
predecessor, Ron Carey, was expelled. The oversight effort is
elaborate, involving a federal judge, a court-appointed review
board, several investigators, a federal election monitor as well as
judicial hearings, expulsions and appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been tremendous progress made,'' said Hoffa. ``They've
eliminated certain pockets of corruption. I think it's time for us
to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa said he wanted to meet with Justice Department officials
to discuss how to shrink and ultimately end the supervision, saying
he would move at the same time to strengthen the union's internal
watchdog mechanism by, for instance, hiring former FBI agents to do
investigations. .
</P>
<P>
   ``The union is as free of organized crime as any institution of
its size,'' he said. ``But we have to be ever-vigilant.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials indicated that they were in no rush to end
their oversight of the union. Mary Jo White, the U.S. Attorney in
Manhattan, who oversees Teamster investigations for the Justice
Department, said she looked forward to meeting with the union's new
leadership to insure that progress under the consent decree
continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consent decree has been and remains a powerful tool in
ridding the IBT of the influence of organized crime and
corruption,'' Ms. White said.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials said they would consider ending oversight only
when more corruption has been rooted out and union officials
demonstrated over a period of time that they were indeed cleaning
their own house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any outside observer would say now is the time
to do this.'' said Michael Cherkasky, the federal election monitor.
``We just had a election in 1996 which had to be overturned because
of the misuse of union funds. The key here is not only for the
union to be free of criminal elements, but to make sure these
reforms have caught on. We're not at that stage yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa lost to Carey in 1996, but that election was overturned
and Carey was expelled after federal monitors found that three of
his aides had siphoned union money into the Carey campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the 1996 campaign, federal monitors fined Hoffa's
campaign $167,675 after finding that he had filed false reports
about the source of some donations.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly all of the more than 400,000 ballots counted Monday,
Hoffa had 55 percent of the vote, Tom Leedham, his main opponent,
39 percent and John Metz, a St. Louis Teamster, had 6 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hoffa's father was president of the Teamsters from 1957 to 1971
and built it into the nation's biggest and strongest union, helping
double members' wages and establishing the first nationwide
contract for long-haul truck drivers. But Jimmy Hoffa was linked
repeatedly to mobsters who plundered the union and, he served time
in prison after being convicted for mail fraud and jury tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what his father would say about his victory, Hoffa said,
``I think he'd be excited by it. He'd say, `The membership has
spoken.' And he always said, `Trust the membership.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa, a 57-year-old labor lawyer from Detroit, had a strong
message to employers, insisting that he would deliver at the
bargaining table for the union's 1.4 million members _ the nation's
second largest union after the National Education Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a new militancy among the Teamsters,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa recalled that the Teamsters once had the nation's largest
political action committee, but it has declined to sixth or
seventh. He said he would try to make it the largest once again,
noting that money gets members of Congress to pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   In order to increase the union's size, Hoffa said he would
stress organizing, saying the Teamsters should unionize not just
nonunion truck drivers, but also increase the numbers of public
employees, hospital workers and nursing homes in their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa vowed to balance the union's budget, attacking Carey for
letting the union's assets slip to near zero from $162 million when
he took over. He said he would eliminate staff and earn the union
some money from commissions by having companies issue Teamster
credit cards and insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Paff, national coordinator of Teamsters for a Democratic
Union, an anti-corruption group that backed Leedham, said Hoffa
evidently wanted to end supervision because the court-appointed
review board has repeatedly embarrassed him by bringing charges
against members of his slate.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the review board charged that a New York Teamster
official elected as a vice president on the Hoffa slate had lied in
a campaign finance report by hiding that a convicted felon was
working for the Hoffa campaign. He could face expulsion from the
union.
</P>
<P>
   Paff said it was important to have a court-appointed monitor
oversee the Teamsters election in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A court-appointed monitor provides Teamsters with a measure of
protection in elections,'' Paff said. ``Many of the power brokers
behind Hoffa have a long history of rigging elections and
committing violence against members, so without a monitor, having a
fair election would be highly problematic.''

WASHINGTON: he said.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Democrats insisted that the committee was marching ahead with
impeachment even though it had never called factual witnesses of
its own or done anything to settle some of the discrepancies
between witnesses who testified before Starr's grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not up to someone accused of wrongdoing to prove his
innocence,'' said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. ``It's up to the
person who says he's guilty to prove his guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats would like the House to censure the president instead
of impeach him. But Hyde said Monday that he had not yet decided
whether he would allow a committee vote on censure. ``It's not
ruled out but it's not a dead-bang certainty either,'' he said. He
said that he does not believe censure is ``an appropriate
sanction.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the House Judiciary Committee hears from Clinton's
defenders on Tuesday, it plans to vote to make public the videotape
of Clinton's deposition in the Jones case. Republicans say the vote
is designed to allow their chief investigative counsel, David
Schippers, to show portions of it, if he chooses, in questioning
the president's representatives or in making his summation Thursday
of the case against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were also expected to seek the release of other
information still under seal that they consider exculpatory or
embarrassing to the president's accusers. Both Schippers, and Abbe
Lowell, the Democrats' chief investigative counsel, are to sum up
their cases Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With the committee looking to finish its work by Saturday,
strategists for both parties began turning their attention to the
full House. House Democrats and the White House began focusing on
the 20 to 30 Republican moderates who they believe could be
persuaded to oppose impeachment either on the merits or because
their districts had voted for Clinton in 1996. ``We've got 10 days
here,'' said one House Democratic official. ``There's ample time to
convice them on the politics and the facts themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of moderates is heavily tilted to the Northeast. It
ranges from Republicans who have already come out against
impeachment, such as Rep. Jack Quinn of New York and Rep.
Christopher Shays of Connecticut, to ones who have kept their own
counsel such as New York Republicans Rick Lazio and Michael Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   It also includes Republicans like Rep. Brian Bilbray of
California who only narrowly won re-election and Rep. Nancy Johnson
of Connecticut, who faced a tough race four years ago when she when
she led the ethics inquiry into Speaker Newt Gingrich. Democrats
were also looking at Rep. Jay Dickey of Arkansas, on the theory
that any Arkansas member could be vulnerable at home if he votes
against the president.
</P>
<P>
   In his own effort to keep a censure measure from the House
floor, Rep. Tom DeLay, the House Majority whip, circulated a letter
Monday that argued against censure. It was co-signed by Shays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we disagree on whether President Clinton's lying
constitutes an impeachable offense, we both think every member of
Congress should make that judgment,'' the letter said. ``We oppose
establishing a new precedent _ censure _ when there is an
established method in existence and underway.''
</P>
<P>
   While Shays opposes both impeachment and censure, many other
moderates would like to show their disapporval of the president's
actions without going so far as to impeach him. If censure is
banned from a floor vote, they have to make the hard choice between
impeachment or nothing.

 UNDATED: ... it back.

<P>
   ``The game is played on the field between 22 people,'' he said.
``That's 22 human beings, and human beings are prone to human
error. The game's played on the field, not in the press box. I
officiated four Super Bowls in my time. I worked one in Miami when
Jackie Smith was in the end zone with nothing between him and Fort
Lauderdale, and he dropped a touchdown pass, bounced right off him.
You know why he dropped it? Because he's human, prone to human
mistake. You could replay that 100 times and he'll drop it 100
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about officiating is, we're the only people who
can't make mistakes. And when you do, everybody wants to crucify
you, they want to stone you, they want to put you in a stockade in
a public square and throw rocks at you. I stuck around for 30 years
and I didn't cause a team to lose a game. My feeling is, if you
make too many mistakes, it's like any job _ they should fire you.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past implemenation of replay, there were some annoyances,
such as the sometimes protracted timeouts necessary for the replay
judge to review various camera shots. Unspoken, too, was the
possible resentment that could fester between officials if a replay
judge, cloistered in his private viewing box, overruled the
decisions made by the on-field crew.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Young pointed out, the science of replay technology
occasionally proved inexact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the six years we used it, it worked out to be about 80
percent accurate,'' he said. ``By Wednesday of each week, you'd
start getting film of all these different angles and you'd find out
that about 20 percent of the calls shouldn't have been reversed.
So, yes, it took a long time and it had its different problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Patriots general manager Patrick Sullivan, opposed to the
use of video replay in his days with the club, said he now would be
in favor of using it. In the late '80s and early '90s, he said,
there was a great disparity between the broadcast technology used
in a regionally televised game and one that was aired nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``That regional game 10 years ago would have only four or five
cameras assigned and maybe only one or two tape machines working,''
said Sullivan, now owner of Game Creek Video in Amherst, N.H., a
remote TV production company. ``Now even the regional game has
maybe nine cameras and six tape machines. Before, the difference
was just too much. It was as if you had one game worked by two
extra officials.''
</P>
<P>
   With increased technology and stakes so high, said Sullivan, the
league should reinstitute replay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important to make the corrections when you can,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A rush to judgment?
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, 10 of the league's 30 owners, meeting in their annual
March congress, vetoed a proposal to bring back video replay. In
March 1998, 9 of the 30 shot it down. In March '99, provided it is
proposed again, it will take a three-quarters majority of 31 owners
(a total of 24) to ratify the reinstitution of video replay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been proposing it, and the thrust of each proposal has
not been to use it as a panacea, not try to right every wrong,''
said Young. ``In what we've proposed before, we didn't want to try
to micromanage the officials. If it comes back, it would apply to
certain big plays _ plays that might change a game, a change of
possession, a catch or no-catch situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde's controversial TD had pundits speculating Sunday
night that replay could be rushed back for this season's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have to do it before the playoffs start,'' said
ESPN's Tom Jackson, commenting on the network's ``NFL PrimeTime''
show Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Such a prospect, said Young, is virtually impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league always has maintained the same rules of competition
in the regular season right through the playoffs,'' he said. ``The
only change is, in the playoffs, we play overtime to sudden death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I don't run the league, but how in the world, if we're
still working on perfecting instant replay and we're not yet
comfortable with it, how could we then go into the most critical
part of the season with it? What kind of logic is that?''
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press report out of New York Monday said the
league is considering some use of replay for the upcoming playoffs.
The AP quoted league spokesman Joe Browne as saying that if owners
approve, ``a limited form of replay for use in the upcoming
postseason is a possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners could approve it in a phone vote, but none has been
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman, who now works for the Big 12 college conference,
helping to rate officials, believes NFL officials could improve
their on-field performance by working more as a team when it comes
to making difficult calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole crew as a unit has to be more involved,'' he said.
``Right now they don't want to get involved in someone else's call.
They're afraid how their rating might be involved. Personally, I'd
throw the entire rating system out. I'd rate their mechanics and
their positioning, whether they're in the right place to make the
call. But I wouldn't rate them on right or wrong calls. If they all
got more involved in making a call, take maybe 20 or 30 seconds to
discuss it, ask what this guy saw, what that guy saw, that could
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's controversial call was made by head linesman Earnie
Franz. As soon as Testaverde crashed the line on his keeper, Franz
flashed high his arms to signal the TD. There has yet to be a TV
replay that supports Franz's call. Every angle shows the Jets
signal-caller being repelled at least 12 inches shy of cracking the
goal-line plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what he's going through and what he'll go through,''
said Bergman, who worked that linesman position for three decades.
``In 1975, I worked a game in Miami _ Miami against Buffalo _ and I
made a call, a fumble. Everyone said it wasn't a fumble, and Ralph
Wilson (the Bills owner) wanted me fired immediately for
incompetence. The headlines screamed for three weeks, calling for
my neck. But for three weeks, the commissioner and the supervisor
of officials stuck by me, and eventually, I was proven right _ by a
picture taken by a still photographer in Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``So unless you're right there, looking straight down that goal
line, you can't make the call. The game's not officiated in the
press box. Sometimes it's just one person who sees it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Aiello, his office received several dozen calls
Monday from media members and fans seeking explanations and voicing
opinions after the latest controversial call, Testaverde's phantom
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We mostly listen,'' said Aiello, asked what the callers were
told. ``Hey, we know it's our responsibility to get it right.''

SOME CALL FOR THE RETURN OF INSTANT REPLAY 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Young, the NFL senior vice president in charge of
football operations, reached across his desk for his new folder.
Subject: Instant Replay.
</P>
<P>
   A possible subtitle could be: ``Officiating Faux Pas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I've got it labeled: `Instant Replay Panic!' ''
Young said Monday, contacted by phone at the league's New York
headquarters. ``I get these calls, people asking, `Why can't we
have replay?' So now I've got the folder _and it's in red ink.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of instant replay in NFL games, which ended after the
1991 season, is back in the spotlight after a recent rash of
controversial officiating calls. The subject reached a roiling boil
Sunday when Vinny Testaverde was credited with the winning
touchdown against Seattle _ despite the fact that video replay
clearly showed that the New York Jets quarterback never broke the
imaginary plane of the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   Young emphasized Monday that the league continues to consider
the reinstitution of replay, and in the last two years, club owners
only narrowly shot down proposals by the league's Competition
Committee to get the technological gadgets back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something the league has addressed and will continue to
address,'' said Young, the former New York Giants general manager
who is considered the game's quality control engineer. ``It's not
something we've hidden under the rug somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Young added, ``We are trying not to have controversial
games.''
</P>
<P>
   But controversy and the gridiron have become inseparable of
late, especially since Thanksgiving Day when a botched coin toss
prior to overtime in Detroit helped lead the Pittsburgh Steelers
down the path of defeat. On that afternoon, referee Phil Luckett,
who also was in charge of Sunday's Jets-Seahawks game, incorrectly
awarded the Lions the right to receive or kick the ball, though the
Steelers won the coin toss. The Lions elected to receive and soon
were celebrating victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``A coin toss would not be a replayable event,'' said Young.
``We've probably had, what, 500,000 coin flips. I don't know why
that was the way it was.''
</P>
<P>
   The only way to guard against such incidents, said Young, would
be to ``put a microphone on everybody.'' He was not being
facetious.
</P>
<P>
   Since the miscall in Detroit, the league has changed its coin
flip procedure. The referee now asks for a ``heads'' or ``tails''
call before the coin is flipped, as opposed to asking for the call
while the coin is in the air. Two other game officials, one
standing next to each team captain, will serve as added witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason for asking heads or tails before the flip is so you
don't have people calling two different things,'' said Greg Aiello,
the NFL's vice president of public relations. ``Some of this stuff
. . . it's almost comical.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The status quo
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the coin toss procedure, the league has not called for
any changes in officiating, or in officating personnel, in the wake
of recent controversial incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing else I can point to, as of today,'' said
Aiello.
</P>
<P>
   All NFL officials have a minimum of 10 years of officiating at
the college level. Many, if not all, also would have worked high
school games. In recent years, said Aiello, the league has expanded
its number of full-time employees assigned to the officiating
department, administrators and supervisors working under director
of officiating Jerry Seeman.
</P>
<P>
   None of the NFL's on-field officials is employed full-time by
the league, a point that is often debated in times of controversy.
One school of thought is that full-time professional officials
would make for a cleaner, better-officiated game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that whole subject will get another thorough
discussion,'' said Aiello. ``It could be, though, that the only
thing that might make officials better is if they're able to work
more games. Otherwise, if they only sit and watch videotape of
games, that's not going to make them better officials.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Bergman, retired after 30 years as an NFL head linesman,
doesn't believe full-time officials would make for better
officiating.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get game experience from watching films,'' said
Bergman, reached by phone Monday night at his home in Pittsburgh.
``You only get experience by working games, and there are only so
many games. It's not like baseball, basketball, and hockey. Do you
think the New England Patriots would like to see, oh, seven
officials standing on the sidelines watching over their practices
two and three days a week? Of course they wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Aiello added that Young often has said over the years that he
likes the fact that the league's on-field officials are not part of
the NFL corporate mainstream. Their independence from the league,
in that sense, could be viewed as an asset, eliminating suspicion
that they could be corrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if we went (exclusively) to full-time officials, we'd
likely lose a lot of good people,'' said Aiello. ``Some of the
people working our games are lawyers, business executives,
educators, admininstrators. Many of them wouldn't want to give up
that part of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It might help _ sometimes
</P>
<P>
   Two other highly controversial calls came to the fore Nov. 28
when the Bills faced the Patriots in Foxborough, a game New England
won, 25-21, with no time on the clock after the officiating crew
penalized the Bills for pass interference in the end zone. On the
play prior to the interference call, the officials let stand a
catch by Patriots receiver Shawn Jefferson, on which television
replays showed he was out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Replay, if brought back as it was used earlier in the decade,
could have been applied on the pass to Jefferson, said Young.
However, he said, it would not have been implemented on the Hail
Mary pass to Bledsoe that triggered the interference call. Judgment
calls, such as pass interference, holding, and illegal contact,
would not be reviewable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the problem with using replay before was that it was
viewed as a panacea,'' said Young. ``We wanted to eliminate every
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergman was no fan of replay when it was used, and he remains
against the idea of bringing it back.

MORGAN STANLEY CONSOLIDATES ITS ASSET UNITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year and a half after Morgan Stanley Group, a leading
investment bank, merged with Dean Witter, Discover &AMP; Co., the
United States' third-largest retail brokerage firm, the two are
starting to look more like a couple. The company said Monday that
its three asset-management divisions would now report to one
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Merin, who is 45, will oversee $356 billion in assets
by heading the combined division, which includes institutional and
individual asset management and the firm's mutual funds. Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter ranked as the United States' ninth-largest
asset manager at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   The move unites divisions that had remained separate after the
May 1997 merger of Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter. It also expands
the turf controlled by executives who came to the merged company
from Dean Witter. Merin will report to Philip Purcell, the
company's chief executive, who came from Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   Merin now heads individual asset management. He served as Dean
Witter's chief administrative officer when the companies merged.
His appointment comes a week after James Allwin, 45, the head of
institutional asset management and a Morgan Stanley executive,
announced his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given Mitch's industry expertise and experience, he will
provide the right leadership to take our asset-management business
to the next level,'' Purcell and John Mack, the company's
president, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation makes sense, analysts said. Like all brokerage
firms, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter wants to increase the assets it
invests for clients, a business that generates steady fees in good
times and bad. Unifying management should help to cross-sell
products like mutual funds through the firm's distribution channels
to ordinary investors.
</P>
<P>
   The executive changes appear to complete a reshuffling of
asset-management personnel that had been announced in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Worley, chairman of Miller, Anderson &AMP; Sherrerd, an
institutional money manager in Pennsylvania that Morgan Stanley
bought in 1996, will replace Allwin as head of institutional asset
management. Richard DeMartini, who had managed retail asset
management, was named to a new post developing an international
brokerage business.
</P>
<P>
   Worley and Richard Powers, head of Van Kampen funds, will report
to Merin.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Israelis called it Big Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was almost toppled. In what
was seen as the most critical day yet for his faltering government,
Israeli lawmakers postponed a vote, at the last minute, to take the
first step toward dissolving parliament and calling new elections.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, in almost every West Bank city, Palestinian
protests escalated into violent confrontations both with Israeli
soldiers and with the Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
   Together with the political chaos in Israel, the unrest on the
Palestinian street created an uneasy backdrop for President
Clinton's three-day visit to the region, scheduled to begin on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   All day, legislators marched in and out of Netanyahu's office in
parliament as the prime minister struggled to avert what appeared
to be the strong likelihood of a humiliating defeat.
</P>
<P>
   At the last minute, just before a 9 p.m. vote was to be taken,
Netanyahu succeeded in delaying his destiny. He persuaded a
rigorously Orthodox party, United Torah Judaism, to attach a motion
of no confidence in his government to the bill calling for early
elections. For procedural reasons, that postponed the vote and
bought Netanyahu about two weeks to bargain his way out of a
political dead end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The faith in this guy is gone,'' Haim Ramon, a leader of the
opposition Labor Party, said on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   If, in two weeks' time, Netanyahu loses the no-confidence vote,
elections for a new Israeli parliament would be held within the
next 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Troubles in Israel _ between the Israelis and the Palestinians,
and within Palestinian society _ have come to a boil, just days
before Clinton's trip. At the same time, still more Israeli
political leaders added their voices on Monday to opposition to the
visit, which many see as an endorsement of Palestinian sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Joining a majority of members of the prime minister's Cabinet
who have already opposed the visit, Dan Tichon, the speaker of
parliament, said he would refuse to take part in any ceremonies
with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's troubles began when he signed a land-for-security
agreement in October promising to turn over a sizable chunk of the
West Bank to the Palestinians. This fractured his right-wing
coalition, forcing him to rely on the Labor Party to get the peace
deal approved by parliament. As his coalition grew steadily more
dysfunctional, he sought to realign it, most significantly by
inviting his former foreign minister, David Levy, back into the
Government.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations with Levy and his five-member Gesher Party broke
down on Sunday. The Labor Party, while backing the movement for
peace, sensed an opportunity to shift the balance of power back to
its side. It called a vote on dissolving the government, which
under the parliamentary system, would have required three readings
to be passed.
</P>
<P>
   With Levy's faction, Labor counted a majority in favor of
removing the prime minister. Judging by the insults flying from
every corner on Monday, Netanyahu could count on few friends
willing to endorse him publicly. If there was a theme to the
insults linking right and left, it turned on a perception that he
is not to be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prime minister cheats all of the time, but not all of us
are willing to be cheated,'' said Uzi Landau, a hard-line member of
Netanyahu's Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators shuffled in and out of the prime minister's office.
The first to come and go were members of the right-wing Land of
Israel front, a small coalition vehemently opposed to any Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank. They were told that the peace
agreement would be frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Then Netanyahu sent out a written message to Israeli Arab
legislators, saying any freeze would be temporary and would be
lifted after Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked for a two-week extension, after which they would
promote the peace, but we would not agree to that,'' said Abdul
Wahab Darawshe, leader of the United Arab List.
</P>
<P>
   Notes were compared, and National Religious Party members went
racing in to ask for a clarification. They apparently left
unclarified. One member, Zvi Hendel, said, ``There comes a point
where they're spitting at us, and it's not rain.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the clearest signs of his desperation, Netanyahu
offered the hard-right party Moledet a seat in his Cabinet. It
turned him down.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the hallway, observing the scurrying, Ramon, of the
Labor Party, smirked and called it a ``disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All this for another day or two, another week or two,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, by buying himself time, Netanyahu took a gamble that
the sooner new elections were held, the better he would fare. The
requirement for elections within 60 days if he loses the
no-confidence vote would bring elections sooner than would occur
under the original opposition bill, in which elections would have
been three months off.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It has been the reigning political wisdom here that the sooner,
the better for Netanyahu. He is not expected to broaden his appeal
over time. And he would fare better in a scenario in which he
himself would be initiating the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing parliament on Monday night, the prime minister
criticized both the Palestinians and the Israeli opposition, almost
in the same breath. Lashing out at Labor, he accused it of
``cynically using the right wing's pain.'' And he tried to distance
himself from the peace agreement, allying himself instead with his
old stance as defender of the Greater Land of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of you who incite against me, who use name-calling _ you
I'm not even going to address,'' he said. ``I want today to turn to
the members of the national camp, the members of the coalition,
those who are really interested in preserving the land, those who
are really interested in preserving Jerusalem, those who are really
interested in preserving Jewish life.''
</P>
<P>
   In discussions on Monday, Netanyahu made it clear that he would
trade on the events of the next two weeks. If the peace effort
seems to be moving forward during and after Clinton's visit, he
could sell himself as the hard-liner who won peace by talking tough
to the Palestinians. Or if Palestinian unrest seems to justify a
freeze in carrying out the agreement, he could try to win back the
right wing.
</P>
<P>
   The violence in the West Bank continued to feed Israeli
anxieties on Monday. For weeks, there have been Palestinian
protests and marches seeking the release of political prisoners
from Israeli jails. Many of the protests have led to confrontations
with Israeli soldiers _ volleys of stone-throwing met by the
shooting of rubber-encased metal bullets.
</P>
<P>
   In every Palestinian city, the relatives of the prisoners have
set up tents, where they are camping and fasting. In Bethlehem on
Monday, the relatives marched from the tent to Rachel's Tomb, where
they were joined by youths who hurled stones at Israeli soldiers as
if it were sport. The Israeli soldiers near the tomb responded with
shooting, wounding about 10 Palestinians before using tear gas to
disperse the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, in Nablus, Palestinian police forces
intervened to prevent hundreds of protesters from clashing with
Israeli soldiers guarding Joseph's Tomb. They used wooden clubs,
beating the protesters, and ended up in a shooting match with
members of Al Fatah, the party of the Palestinian leader, Yasser
Arafat. After the police headquarters were besieged, the
Palestinian authorities shot and wounded 19 rioters.
</P>
<P>
   In Abu Dis, a West Bank town, the Palestinian police stood back
and allowed the clashes to go on, as they did most everywhere else.
A 20-year-old student, Nasser Erekat, was hit in the head by a
rubber bullet and was listed in critical condition at a hospital on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials said four Israeli police officers and two
civilians were wounded in the violence on Monday. One man, a Jewish
settler, was shot while driving between the settlement of Kadim and
the Palestinian town of Jenin in the northern West Bank.

PLAYOFF PICTURE OPAQUE WITH MEDIOCRITY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are so many losing, undeserving teams still in the
National Football Conference playoff hunt one would think the game
officials were calling the race.
</P>
<P>
   But even instant replay couldn't fix a situation that has five
losing teams _ none with more than six victories _ chasing the
final wild-card spot in the conference. It's a playoff race so
clumsy that the 5-8 Giants are still in it.
</P>
<P>
   If the Giants could somehow defeat Denver at Giants Stadium on
Sunday, you could even call them contenders because an NFC team
with an 8-8 record by season's end could practically be the runaway
winner for the third wild-card berth.
</P>
<P>
   While they're flailing away in the NFC, the American Football
Conference picture is a contrast in proficiency.
</P>
<P>
   If the season ended today, four AFC East teams &UR; _ &LR;  the Jets,
Miami, New England and Buffalo &UR; _ &LR;  would qualify for the playoffs.
Three winning teams from other AFC divisions _ Pittsburgh,
Tennessee and Oakland _ would be excluded.
</P>
<P>
   If the Jets win at Miami this weekend, they clinch a playoff
berth. And if they go on to win one of two remaining games after
that, they win their first division title in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   There is precedent for one division claiming all the wild-card
spots _ the NFC Central sent four teams to the playoffs in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Sorting out the current NFC playoff possibilities, however, is
far from a study in aptitude. Before Monday night's Green Bay-Tampa
Bay game, the 6-7 Arizona Cardinals would qualify for the playoffs
over New Orleans (6-7) or the Buccaneers (5-7 entering Monday's
game) because of a slightly superior conference record.
</P>
<P>
   For the Cardinals, it would be their first post-season
appearance in a nonstrike season since 1975, when they lost a
division playoff game. The Cardinals franchise, which has been in
the National Football League for 79 seasons, has established an
amazing penchant for avoiding the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   They have qualified for the post-season only five times and have
only one playoff victory, a league championship won 51 years ago
when the then Chicago Cardinals defeated Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The other ``contenders'' for the final NFC wild-card spot are an
assortment of teams struggling to make something positive of
otherwise gloomy seasons. One of them seems poised to become the
first .500 team to qualify for the playoffs since the 1991 Jets.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints put themselves back in the playoff picture with their
surprising rout of Dallas Sunday afternoon, a remarkable turnaround
for a team that had lost seven of its previous nine games. New
Orleans' victory sets up a pivotal game at Arizona on Dec. 20, if
you can call a game between two teams that could have losing
records pivotal.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans plays host to high-flying Atlanta this weekend and
the Buffalo Bills on the final Sunday of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Cardinals, the Saints are dogged by some sorry
post-season history. New Orleans has never won a playoff game in
four attempts.
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, the 5-8 Lions have won only one road game and are
yielding an average of 23 points a game. They had a three-game
winning streak halted Sunday at Jacksonville, and with a poor
conference record (4-6) they are not well positioned to challenge
Arizona, New Orleans or Tampa Bay, who each already have at least
five conference victories.
</P>
<P>
   Conference record is the second tie-breaker after the
head-to-head record between teams.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit may also have the most difficult remaining schedule: at
San Francisco on Monday night, home to Atlanta and at Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay, which was considered a sure playoff team during the
preseason, is home against Pittsburgh on Sunday and finishes its
season at Washington and at Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the Giants. Their conference record is poor
(4-7), but if they somehow tied with the Cardinals _ and only the
Cardinals _ they would advance because they defeated the Cardinals
twice this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not mathematically eliminated, so we're still fighting
for the playoffs,'' Giants Coach Jim Fassel said after his team's
victory in Arizona on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if, practically speaking, he considered his team part of
the playoff chase, Fassel, perhaps with a nod to Yogi Berra, said:
``Until you're out of it, you're in it.''

   Online banking functions in some versions of Intuit Inc.'s
Quicken personal-finance software may stumble when the year 2000
arrives, but this is no basis for suing Intuit now, said a New York
state judge who dismissed three class-action lawsuits against the
company last week.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Ira Gammerman's ruling that software companies cannot be
sued for Year 2000 problems before actual damage has occurred
echoed the conclusions reached in August by a Santa Clara County
judge in California in the first such suit against Intuit.
Gammerman also said software companies cannot be sued before being
given a chance to fix year 2000 problems.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit has announced that Quicken upgrades that prevent the year
2000 problems will be available without charge by June.
</P>
<P>
   The cases have been closely watched by lawyers, who say similar
suits could generate $1 trillion in damages and fees if the year
2000 date transition creates widespread computer problems, as has
been widely predicted.

PATRIOTS LUXURY SEAT DEAL TO GET SCRUTINY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hoping to head off any dissent at Wednesday's public hearing on
their proposal to lure the New England Patriots to Hartford,
Connecticut officials Monday said they are taking a second look at
a controversial part of the plan in which the state would guarantee
the sale of expensive luxury seats at the new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   That guarantee, one of the most financially lucrative aspects of
the deal for team owner Robert Kraft, could cost the state $175
million over 10 years if the team cannot sell the seats outright.
Under a preliminary agreement Kraft signed with the state last
month, the state would pay him $2,500 for each of the 4,000 club
seats unsold out of the 6,000 expected to be built; and $100,000
for each of the 75 luxury suites not sold among the 150 expected to
be built. In a worst-case scenario, the state would be forced to
pay Kraft $17.5 million a year for the duration of the lease.
</P>
<P>
   But those numbers may be revised before the deal goes before the
public at Wednesday's scheduled hearing at the Connecticut State
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guarantee is the last remaining part that's generating a
lot of discussion,'' said House Speaker Thomas Ritter. ``We're
trying our best to keep the agreement intact. But they are talking
about the guarantee and that may be something we're going to have
to take a look it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Kraft and Governor John Rowland have said they expect
the memorandum of understanding both signed Nov. 19 to be approved
by the Legislature unchanged, other specifics in the document could
come under scrutiny, officials said Monday. The General Assembly is
scheduled to vote on the package next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other issues being scrutinized is the 30-year
commitment Kraft made to keep the team in Hartford. Moira Lyons of
Stamford, the majority leader, has successfully lobbied to tighten
the exit clause on the 30-year lease to include early withdrawal
penalties. Should Kraft move the team before the 30 years were up,
he would have to pay for any unpaid portion of the stadium debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we talk today, there have been no changes,'' said Patriots
vice president Jonathan Kraft. ``Our deal is, we're there for 30
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's hearing is expected to be a marathon session. The
first four hours are reserved for proponents of the deal and
consultants.First up will be Kraft, Rowland, and KPMG Peat Marwick
consultants whose report showed the state would break even on the
$350 million-plus stadium project, which the state will pay for
entirely through borrowing, ticket taxes, and perhaps a portion of
the revenue surplus. They are already gearing their testimony
toward defending some of the more controversial issues, including
the seat guarantees, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be good to let people know how negotiations went,''
Ritter said. ``For instance, originally, Kraft asked to have every
seat guaranteed. The governor said no. It will be good for people
to see how we came to that deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft is expected to reveal how much money he expects to take in
from the stadium. Because NFL teams shares most other revenues,
stadium deals are the most important factor in a team's bottom
line.
</P>
<P>
   Stadium revenue in 2002, Kraft said in documents provided to
Rowland's office, will be about $56 million a year. This includes
$18 million in regular ticket sales and $18 million in club seat
sales if all are sold. The team will get about $9 million from
playing at other venues and, if all luxury boxes are sold, the team
will get $11.25 million in revenue a year.
</P>
<P>
   TV and radio revenue will total about $85 million per club,
including Internet and satellite television; $9 million in
advertising, including $1 million to $2 million in possible naming
rights; and $6 million in net revenue from concessions. The total:
$157 million in net revenue.
</P>
<P>
   But after paying taxes, giving visiting teams their share of
gate proceeds, player payroll of $102 million, coaching, staff and
$6 million in operational expenses, Kraft says the team will be
left with about $16 million a year _ money he says would help pay
for signing bonuses and other factors to make the team more
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, this year the team took in a little more than $90
million in revenue, including $23 million in annual gate proceeds,
$2.5 million in luxury suite sales, $62 million in TV and radio
deals, $5 million in advertising and $2 million in concessions,
according to individuals close to the team.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the team paid players about $65 million and spent
another $22 million in team expenses, including other staff and
travel, and operational expenses for the stadium are about $4
million, totaling $91 million, making the team just about a
break-even enterprise, those individuals said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Rowland spokesman Dean Pagani, the governor will be
the first witness called before the legislative panel Wednesday at
3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are bracing for the largest public hearing in recent
memory. The hearing will be held in the biggest room designed for
such functions at the Capitol, with other areas wired with closed
circuit television to handle the overflow crowd, which could be
watching the proceedings unfold until well after 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The last time so many people crammed a hearing was in 1991, when
the state took the historic step of instituting an income tax,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kraft's testimony will be important because people still want
to see how serious he is,'' said Larry Perosino, a spokesman for
the House Democrats. ``I think he'll explain why he feels it's a
great thing for Hartford and the state to have the Patriots come
and that if he thought it was bad for the taxpayers he wouldn't
have gone for it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the hearing will address all questions raised so far,
including environmental and financial concerns, and timing issues
surrounding the move, which is targeted for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the questions, though, the bill is expected to pass
easily next week, mostly because it is the centerpiece of a $1
billion downtown revitalization that the legislature has already
enthusiastically endorsed.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 percent of Republicans and at least half the
Democrats are expected to approve the stadium plan.
</P>
<P>
   There are opponents, however, though many of them will not be
heard from until later in the hearing, well after the 6 p.m.
newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's unfair,'' said Debbie Weinstein, a retired shop
owner from Essex, ``if they give all the daytime hours to the
people who are speaking for it and make the opposition wait 'til
the evening . . . that is not a fair way of structuring this.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein and group of friends from southern Connecticut plan to
attend the hearing to voice their concern over what they view as
``corporate welfare.''

BLANKETS FOR HOMELESS IN SHORT SUPPLY AS PHOENIX TEMPERATURES
DROP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KARINA BLAND  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ On the coldest nights, as many as 40 blankets are
given to homeless teenagers, their only protection against the
wind. But the stash of blankets at Homebase Youth Services _ as
well as at other Arizona non-profit agencies _ is running low, and
soon there could be no blankets to hand out.
</P>
<P>
   In a cost-cutting measure, Congress this year eliminated Project
Freeze, a federal program that provided blankets to non-profits
that deal with homeless people and others in need.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the state received 29,000 blankets from the program,
said Vic Hudenko, homeless coordinator at the state Department of
Economic Security. This year, it didn't get any.
</P>
<P>
   State officials did manage to squeeze some money out of the DES
budget to buy 2,928 discount blankets from a mill in North
Carolina. They arrived in Arizona on Friday and were distributed
Monday _ too late for Sunday's cold snap, when temperatures dropped
into the 30s throughout metropolitan Phoenix. So, with shelters
crammed, many people spent the night on the street uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt so bad that they didn't arrive on time,'' Hudenko said.
``We just didn't expect it to get this cold this fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Agencies in Tucson have been hit the hardest. They asked DES for
8,000 blankets and received 1,000 of the newly arrived shipment,
Hudenko said, leaving even more people out in the cold.
</P>
<P>
   Most Phoenix agencies will go without. Those who work directly
with people living on the streets will get first dibs on the
blankets distributed in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates are that there are 10,000 homeless people in the
Valley and 15,000 statewide, though agencies that work with that
population say those figures are probably too low.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Homebase _ which helps homeless young people with
food, shelter, clothing, counseling and other services _ received
300 blankets. This year, it got none.
</P>
<P>
   The kids don't care what color the blanket is or even if there
is a hole or two in it, said Kristin Bolken, director of outreach
services for Homebase. They just care that it's warm.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in temperatures this week _ including light snowfall in
central Phoenix on Sunday _ left more blue-lipped teenagers than
usual clamoring for blankets, as many as 40 in one night instead of
the usual five or six. All did manage to get a blanket, but the
supply won't last long, Bolken said.
</P>
<P>
   At Central Arizona Shelter Services Inc., a non-profit homeless
shelter at 1209 W. Madison St., workers are having to refuse people
looking for a place to stay, and they don't have enough blankets to
supply those turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, CASS received 900 blankets through Project Freeze.
Like Homebase, it got none this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're appealing to the public for help,'' said
David Hammond, director of development for CASS. ``If anyone wants
to donate any blankets or warm clothing _ hats, coats, gloves _ we
need everything we can get.''
</P>
<P>
   One woman gave CASS 100 blankets that she had purchased at
thrift stores, even having them cleaned before dropping them off.
</P>
<P>
   Wool-blend blankets are best for outdoors, although shelters
also need blankets for beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time of year it is very critical,'' Hammond says. ``The
cold weather came on suddenly _ I know it caught me off guard _ and
I could imagine that for a person who chooses to live on the
street, it must be devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   The St. Vincent de Paul Society, one of the Valley's largest
non-profit agencies serving the homeless, received a truckload of
blankets last week to distribute to its programs, community
relations director Jennifer Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has not yet experienced a shortage, Walker said,
though this is the first major cold spell of the winter.

NFL WANTS INSTANT REPLAY USED IN PLAYOFFS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The National Football League said Monday that it
would ask owners to vote on instant replay for the playoffs and the
Super Bowl, a decision that came barely 24 hours after an official
ruled incorrectly that the Jets' Vinny Testaverde had scored the
game-winning touchdown against Seattle with 20 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   The system would permit coaches two challenges a game and would
most likely include a provision allowing referees to review a
disputed play within the last two minutes of a game after a coach's
challenges have been expended.
</P>
<P>
   Such a system would have enabled Seattle Coach Dennis Erickson
to challenge the ruling by Earnie Frantz, the head linesman at the
Seahawks-Jets game, that Testaverde had scored on a quarterback
sneak. The television replay definitively showed that the ball did
not break the plane of the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's greatest fear is what happened yesterday happening
in the Super Bowl,'' said Greg Aiello, a league spokesman. He
added, ``We acknowledge today again that Testaverde hasn't
scored.''
</P>
<P>
   Changes to the rules governing games are generally adopted
during the off season, and the league's decision to call for an
in-season adjustment reflected the seriousness of the situation,
and the league's acknowledgment that the credibility of its
competition was being compromised.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're aware of what's going on and the reaction to it, and
we're trying to be responsive,'' said Aiello, who added, ``We're
doing this quickly, but not in a panic.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar proposals to reinstitute instant replay have failed with
owners before the past two seasons, falling short of the 23
required votes. Now, with a 31st team, the Cleveland Browns, the
proposal will need 24 votes to pass.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has not set a date for the vote but intends to spend the
next few days framing the proposal. The issue, as it has before, is
certain to generate intense debate over the imposition of
technology on human judgment, and the added burden on coaches to
manage replay challenges as they do timeouts, and do it for the
first time in the playoff pressure cooker.
</P>
<P>
   Aiello said the league canvassed the nine teams that spurned
instant replay last March, and ``several who voted against it
voiced a desire to vote for it for the post-season, as an insurance
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Paul Tagliabue and his senior staff met for several
hours to discuss the proposal, amid intense pressure from aggrieved
teams, the news media and fans to bring back some form of instant
replay. It was in effect from 1986 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
   One vote that Tagliabue can count on will come from Ralph
Wilson, the Buffalo Bills' owner who voted against the use of
instant replay last March. ``Anything is better than we have now,''
Wilson said. ``Jeez, I'll vote for somebody spotting the calls
going over the field from a blimp.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson raged at the league last week for ``awful'' officiating
in last Sunday's game against New England; Tagliabue subsequently
told him that he would be fined $50,000, leading Wilson to
fulminate, saying: ``I do know I don't need pompous lectures from
the commissioner, and I feel that the $50,000 is not only
unwarranted, but punitive in nature. The next time, he may ask me
to stand in the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Owners are specifically prohibited from criticizing officials.
</P>
<P>
   The other teams that voted against instant replay last March
were Arizona, Chicago, Cincinnati, Kansas City, the Giants,
Oakland, San Diego and Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets voted for replay last March, a reversal of a previous
position. How the Jets vote for the playoff proposal remains to be
seen. Monday, Coach Bill Parcells said: ``I don't want the old
system back. I don't want coaches' challenges. I only want the
calls right.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Moore, a spokesman for Kansas City, said that Chiefs Coach
Marty Schottenheimer opposes the challenge system ``because it puts
coaches in the official business.'' Jack Brennan, a Bengals
spokesman, said that Mike Brown, the team owner, always felt too
much time was spent on replay in its earlier incarnation without
much of a result _ ``and sometimes it wasn't even right.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carmen Policy, the Browns' president and a longtime advocate
of instant replay when he was the 49ers' president, said he will
vote for the plan. But he added: ``What concerns me is it might not
be staged as positively as if it had more time. I hope this doesn't
hurt it going into effect next season.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the past two weeks of criticism of league officiating,
which began with the botched coin-toss at the Pittsburgh-Detroit
game on Nov. 26, had turned the tide of league thinking toward
trying to bring instant replay back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we didn't have instant replay for the playoffs, I
think the chances of voting it in in March were good,'' Policy
said. ``But if it goes well in the playoffs, it's a slam dunk for
March.''
</P>
<P>
   The league has experimented with the challenge system in 10
games each in the 1996 and 1998 preseasons. In that system, coaches
received two challenges. If they used a challenge during the last
two minutes of each half, they were penalized with a timeout if
their claim was proved wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The system was a compromise between the 1997 plan that failed to
get enough votes, in which each challenge cost a timeout, and the
1998 plan, which also fell short of approval, in which a timeout
was lost if the challenge proved wrong.
</P>
<P>
   John Madden, the Fox Sports commentator, and a critic of league
officiating, said: ``You just hope the league's ready to implement
the system and do it right. What's happened during the last two
weeks, is the league's become vulnerable. The pile is open and you
can pile on.''
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, the new proposal is expected to limit challenges
to plays involving ball possession; in-bounds calls; whether a
touchdown is a touchdown; whether a ball has been fumbled, and
whether a ball was actually caught.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a possible return to instant replay, the 16
officiating teams of seven men apiece _ who are paid $1,431 to
$4,300 for regular season games and $11,900 each for the Super Bowl
_ will still be the subject of carping by unhappy coaches, players
and owners. Not every questionable call, like penalties, would be
covered by instant replay's parameters.
</P>
<P>
   If the league returns to instant replay, it would join the
National Hockey League as the only major sport to have it.

FOSSIL FOUND OF GORGONOPSID, PRE-DINOSAUR RULER OF EARTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the top predator on Earth hundreds of millions of years
before Tyrannosaurus Rex and so horribly ugly it almost makes you
happy for mass extinctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of the biggest, most ferocious lion you can imagine, but
with lizard skin,'' said Peter Ward, a University of Washington
paleontologist.
</P>
<P>
   It's a gorgonopsid, or gorgon, named after the beast of Greek
mythology whose terrifying gaze would turn anyone who looked at it
into stone.
</P>
<P>
   Ward and Roger Smith, a paleontologist at the South African
Museum in Capetown, have discovered what is believed to be the only
complete fossil ever found of this half-mammal, half-reptilian
creature that ruled the land before dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's absolutely fabulous,'' said Robert Bakker, the maverick
paleontologist made famous as the inspirational model for the lead
character in the movie Jurassic Park. ``It's an incredibly
important find.''
</P>
<P>
   James Hopson, a University of Chicago expert in these ancient
``mammal-like reptiles,'' said the discovery of a complete gorgon
skeleton is exciting because it will provide new information about
this strange creature and perhaps even new insights into the debate
over whether dinosaurs were warm-blooded.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a skeletal structure that shows an upright gait
indicates a faster metabolism, which would suggest the creature was
warm-blooded.
</P>
<P>
   Bakker, a leading proponent of the warm-blooded theory, is
looking for evidence that gorgons were these fast-moving,
warm-blooded predators. If so, he contends evolution wouldn't have
favored cold-blooded dinosaurs to take over as top predator after
the reign of the gorgons.
</P>
<P>
   Hopson says the evidence on both gorgons and dinosaurs, so far,
tends to support a ``lukewarm'' attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they were something in between,'' he said. ``Not fully
warm-blooded but not cold-blooded either.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all still debatable, he said, but perhaps Ward and Smith's
new find in the Karoo Desert of South Africa will shift the debate
in favor of one side or the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``This appears to be a very complete skeleton and an enormous
one for this kind of animal,'' Hopson said. He talked to Smith over
the weekend about the find, who estimated the creature to be about
seven feet long.
</P>
<P>
   The largest gorgons weighed as much as 800 pounds, though some
were as small as house cats. They were the first saber-toothed
animals on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things were really well-adapted killing machines,''
Hopson said. ``They had blade-like and serrated teeth that could go
through your flesh like a warm knife through butter.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorgons were wiped out by one of the planet's massive
extinctions, the worst one known, which occurred some 250 million
years ago. Ward, funded by the National Science Foundation, has
been in the Karoo Desert looking for fossil evidence from this time
period known as the Late Permian.
</P>
<P>
   This was about 50 million years before dinosaurs appeared on
Earth, when the planet's continental land masses had yet to drift
apart from the primordial supercontinent known as Pangaea.
</P>
<P>
   The Karoo Desert is one of the best places to dig for fossils
older than 250 million years because it was a basin that rapidly
filled in with sediment _ preserving the dead _ and has remained
relatively undisturbed by geological change since then.
</P>
<P>
   Ward and Smith's expedition in the Karoo, which began in a
snowstorm and ended in blistering heat weeks ago, was focused on
finding fossil evidence of the planet's worst mass extinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest question is about the rapidity of that
extinction,'' Ward said. Their digging, he said, was focused on
establishing how quickly species died off during the largest mass
extinction ever known.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows what caused this massive die-off, but it killed all
the gorgons and much of the rest of life on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Just below the sedimentary level marking the extinction, Ward
said, are numerous fossils telling of a world full of activity and
diverse forms of life. Just above this geological demarcation, Ward
said, the sediment is empty. Signs of life are disturbingly
missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is there,'' Smith said. ``That's what Peter and I were
looking at ... We want to know what happened just before and just
after the extinction event. We weren't looking for gorgons.''
</P>
<P>
   Their project was drawing to a close several weeks ago, after
the team had already spent a month in the desert and collected some
70 fossil skeletons. On a walk, Smith spotted a small scrap of bone
sticking out of the dirt. He dug a bit more and could see that it
appeared to be the skull of a gorgon.
</P>
<P>
   Ward joined him in the digging and, with every new inch of
skeleton uncovered, their interest blossomed into the full-blown
ecstatic thrill of a major discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some here in South Africa are calling it the find of the
century,'' Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good probability it was buried with its skin
intact,'' Smith said. That would be a major discovery by itself,
Smith said, because one of the areas of debate on gorgons is
whether they had scaly skin like reptiles or leathery skin like
mammals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the thing's complete is probably of most
importance to paleontology,'' Ward said. ``We're looking at a key
transitional animal here, the top predator of the Permian world.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be many people interested in having a look at this
gorgon, Ward said, because a complete skeleton promises answers to
many more questions.
</P>
<P>
   Bakker wanted to know if the fossil's toes were all there and
the structure of its limbs, since these both offer clues to how it
moved _ which offers clues about warm-bloodedness. Hopson seemed
interested in finding out if the feet were intact.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's special interest is in coprolites, fossilized excrement.
He's hoping to find these in the belly of the gorgon, which will
provide crucial dietary information.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be months before even these simple questions can be
answered, and years before the fossil is fully prepared for public
display.
</P>
<P>
   Ward and Smith's team couldn't remove the large fossil with the
field equipment they brought with them. So they re-buried it _
making it appear to be a human grave to discourage curious digging
_ and will return next spring with the larger equipment needed to
excavate it.
</P>
<P>
   Time reversed the Greek myth in this case, turning the gorgon to
stone and rewarding mankind's curiousity with a new look into the
deep past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really cool,'' Ward said.

PATRIOTS LUXURY SEAT DEAL TO GET SCRUTINY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Hoping to head off any dissent at Wednesday's public hearing on
their proposal to lure the New England Patriots to Hartford,
Connecticut officials Monday said they are taking a second look at
a controversial part of the plan in which the state would guarantee
the sale of expensive luxury seats at the new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   That guarantee, one of the most financially lucrative aspects of
the deal for team owner Robert Kraft, could cost the state $175
million over 10 years if the team cannot sell the seats outright.
Under a preliminary agreement Kraft signed with the state last
month, the state would pay him $2,500 for each of the 4,000 club
seats unsold out of the 6,000 expected to be built; and $100,000
for each of the 75 luxury suites not sold among the 150 expected to
be built. In a worst-case scenario, the state would be forced to
pay Kraft $17.5 million a year for the duration of the lease.
</P>
<P>
   But those numbers may be revised before the deal goes before the
public at Wednesday's scheduled hearing at the Connecticut State
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guarantee is the last remaining part that's generating a
lot of discussion,'' said House Speaker Thomas Ritter. ``We're
trying our best to keep the agreement intact. But they are talking
about the guarantee and that may be something we're going to have
to take a look it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Kraft and Governor John Rowland have said they expect
the memorandum of understanding both signed Nov. 19 to be approved
by the Legislature unchanged, other specifics in the document could
come under scrutiny, officials said Monday. The General Assembly is
scheduled to vote on the package next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other issues being scrutinized is the 30-year
commitment Kraft made to keep the team in Hartford. Moira Lyons of
Stamford, the majority leader, has successfully lobbied to tighten
the exit clause on the 30-year lease to include early withdrawal
penalties. Should Kraft move the team before the 30 years were up,
he would have to pay for any unpaid portion of the stadium debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we talk today, there have been no changes,'' said Patriots
vice president Jonathan Kraft. ``Our deal is, we're there for 30
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's hearing is expected to be a marathon session. The
first four hours are reserved for proponents of the deal and
consultants.First up will be Kraft, Rowland, and KPMG Peat Marwick
consultants whose report showed the state would break even on the
$350 million-plus stadium project, which the state will pay for
entirely through borrowing, ticket taxes, and perhaps a portion of
the revenue surplus. They are already gearing their testimony
toward defending some of the more controversial issues, including
the seat guarantees, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be good to let people know how negotiations went,''
Ritter said. ``For instance, originally, Kraft asked to have every
seat guaranteed. The governor said no. It will be good for people
to see how we came to that deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft is expected to reveal how much money he expects to take in
from the stadium. Because NFL teams shares most other revenues,
stadium deals are the most important factor in a team's bottom
line.
</P>
<P>
   Stadium revenue in 2002, Kraft said in documents provided to
Rowland's office, will be about $56 million a year. This includes
$18 million in regular ticket sales and $18 million in club seat
sales if all are sold. The team will get about $9 million from
playing at other venues and, if all luxury boxes are sold, the team
will get $11.25 million in revenue a year.
</P>
<P>
   TV and radio revenue will total about $85 million per club,
including Internet and satellite television; $9 million in
advertising, including $1 million to $2 million in possible naming
rights; and $6 million in net revenue from concessions. The total:
$157 million in net revenue.
</P>
<P>
   But after paying taxes, giving visiting teams their share of
gate proceeds, player payroll of $102 million, coaching, staff and
$6 million in operational expenses, Kraft says the team will be
left with about $16 million a year _ money he says would help pay
for signing bonuses and other factors to make the team more
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, this year the team took in a little more than $90
million in revenue, including $23 million in annual gate proceeds,
$2.5 million in luxury suite sales, $62 million in TV and radio
deals, $5 million in advertising and $2 million in concessions,
according to individuals close to the team.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the team paid players about $65 million and spent
another $22 million in team expenses, including other staff and
travel, and operational expenses for the stadium are about $4
million, totaling $91 million, making the team just about a
break-even enterprise, those individuals said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Rowland spokesman Dean Pagani, the governor will be
the first witness called before the legislative panel Wednesday at
3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are bracing for the largest public hearing in recent
memory. The hearing will be held in the biggest room designed for
such functions at the Capitol, with other areas wired with closed
circuit television to handle the overflow crowd, which could be
watching the proceedings unfold until well after 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The last time so many people crammed a hearing was in 1991, when
the state took the historic step of instituting an income tax,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kraft's testimony will be important because people still want
to see how serious he is,'' said Larry Perosino, a spokesman for
the House Democrats. ``I think he'll explain why he feels it's a
great thing for Hartford and the state to have the Patriots come
and that if he thought it was bad for the taxpayers he wouldn't
have gone for it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the hearing will address all questions raised so far,
including environmental and financial concerns, and timing issues
surrounding the move, which is targeted for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the questions, though, the bill is expected to pass
easily next week, mostly because it is the centerpiece of a $1
billion downtown revitalization that the legislature has already
enthusiastically endorsed.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 percent of Republicans and at least half the
Democrats are expected to approve the stadium plan.
</P>
<P>
   There are opponents, however, though many of them will not be
heard from until later in the hearing, well after the 6 p.m.
newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's unfair,'' said Debbie Weinstein, a retired shop
owner from Essex, ``if they give all the daytime hours to the
people who are speaking for it and make the opposition wait 'til
the evening . . . that is not a fair way of structuring this.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein and group of friends from southern Connecticut plan to
attend the hearing to voice their concern over what they view as
``corporate welfare.''

 Internet-stock investing requires love of risk  &HT;       
 By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Until three months ago, you probably never heard of eBay, a little
San Jose company that maintains an online flea market where people
can trade things like Beanie Babies, firearms and aphrodisiacs over
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Today, if you haven't heard of eBay, you probably haven't heard
of Monica Lewinsky either.
</P>
<P>
   EBay has become the quintessential Internet stock. Although the
company boasts scant revenues and earnings, its stock market value
is a staggering $7 billion. The company went public on September 24
at $18 per share and closed yesterday at $174.25.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the latest installment of the Great Tulip Craze.
</P>
<P>
   Speculators have been making huge profits this year on
practically any company that promises to exploit the commercial
potential of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Turner, president of Pring Turner Capital in San Ramon, says
today's market reminds him of the late 1960s, when everyone was
looking for the next Xerox. ``If a company's name had an `x' in it,
you bought it. Now, `x' has become `dot com.' ''
</P>
<P>
   If all the ruckus, and those easy profits, tempt you to plunge
into these stocks yourself, you're only human. But don't do it
unless you have money to burn and are willing to accept huge risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later, this mania will end _ like all other manias _
with a really stiff correction,'' warns Tony O'Bryan, a technical
analyst with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Son in St. Louis. ``It will be across
the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Wall Streeters acknowledge that the Internet already ranks
among the greatest technological revolutions in history. And they
expect companies that effectively exploit the Net's commercial
potential to succeed beyond the dreams of avarice.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody can be certain which companies will succeed and which
will fail. What's more, the market prices of virtually all Internet
stocks have risen so sharply that few, if any, still look like good
buys.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question about the future of the Internet _ it's
huge,'' says Will Weinstein, head of Genesis Merchant Group
Securities in San Francisco. ``But the prices of these stocks today
are just an outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Internet stocks can't be evaluated by traditional means.
Price-earnings ratios are meaningless in most cases, because few
Internet companies are profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Even some Internet issues that analysts include among the
``first tier'' _ the most likely to succeed _ are still losing
money.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are Santa Clara's Yahoo, which maintains an immensely
popular search engine, and Amazon.com, of Seattle, the dominant
Internet book retailer.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, the Virginia Internet service provider that is
generally considered tops among the first-tier companies, eked out
a small profit in the fiscal year ended in June after suffering a
big loss the year before.
</P>
<P>
   People who buy these and other Internet stocks are betting on
the Net in general, and on promising concepts in particular.
</P>
<P>
   But how does one evaluate a concept? Companies that look
promising today could be dead and gone two years from now.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of earnings, analysts must look at other ratios.
For example, they are comparing the total market value of a
company's stock to its revenues, or its cash flow, or the number of
daily hits on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon has lately been selling for more than 20 times revenues.
AOL, now that it is profitable, sells at an absurdly high 350 or so
times earnings, but only about 13 times revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Those price-to-revenues ratios don't seem so high considering
that Microsoft, a much larger company, currently trades at around
20 times revenues. Can Amazon and AOL grow faster than Microsoft
from here on? Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't necessarily warn people away from all Internet
stocks, even at these levels,'' says Jessica Martin-Rice, an
analyst with Chicago's Driehaus Capital Management. Driehaus
pioneered momentum investing, which involves buying stocks that are
moving up rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Investors might want to at least hesitate before buying Yahoo,
which is trading at an eyebrow-raising 120 times revenues, or eBay,
now selling for around 300 times revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Internet stocks can go down as well as up.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama's Books-a-Million, until two weeks ago a little-known
chain of retail bookstores in the Southeast, announced on November
25 that it would sell books on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Its stock rose from $4.38 the day before the announcement to $47
three market sessions later.
</P>
<P>
   But investors had second thoughts after the Wall Street Journal
reported that the company's executives were selling shares like
crazy at the lofty new levels. Books-a-Million closed yesterday on
Nasdaq at $14.94.
</P>
<P>
   As Internet stocks have soared, many institutional investors
that bought them at much lower prices have either sold them or
stopped buying.
</P>
<P>
   Even some momentum investors are getting scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made a lot of money on Internet stocks we've held for a
long time, but now things are getting crazy,'' says Jamie Atwell,
head of Nasdaq trading with Nicholas-Applegate Capital Management
in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Wrona, co-manager of the PBHG Tech Fund, sold a small
holding in eBay recently. ``We bought it at the time it came out,
and even then it was expensive, but within the realm of reason,''
he says. ``Now it's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   With institutions largely on the sidelines, the market for
Internet stocks has lately been dominated by day traders _
individuals who trade in and out of stocks many times per week and
even per day. Appropriately enough, many of them trade on the
Internet itself, through online brokerage sites.
</P>
<P>
   The day traders typically trade an average of only a few hundred
shares at a time, compared to the thousands of shares that an
institution might buy or sell in a single trade. But there are so
many day traders trading so frenetically that the total mounts
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   On one recent market day, for example, 8.2 million shares of
Books-a-Million changed hands. The average trade was 437 shares, or
less than $12,000 worth.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, the trading volume of General Electric, an
institutional favorite, was 4.8 million shares. The average trade
was 1,171 shares, worth more than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Spewing out orders like so many tommy-gun slugs, the day traders
have helped push the turnover in eBay stock to more than 5 million
shares per day five times in the past seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty amazing considering that eBay's float _ the number
of shares held by the public, rather than by management and other
insiders _ is only 3.5 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Trading in Internet stocks may simmer down a bit now that many
online brokers are tightening the rules for investors buying these
stocks on margin.
</P>
<P>
   Ameritrade, DLJ Direct, E-Trade, Charles Schwab, Suretrade and
Waterhouse, among others, recently increased the so-called
maintenance requirements for Internet stocks bought on margin, or
with some borrowed money.
</P>
<P>
   They have done this because they fear the stocks will plummet,
causing investors to default on their debts.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage firms routinely reassess their margin requirements for
individual stocks that become volatile, but they rarely crack down
on an entire industry at once.
</P>
<P>
   Customers with margin accounts can buy stocks with up to 50
percent margin _ meaning that half the price is paid with the
buyer's own money and the other half with money borrowed from the
broker.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, brokers require investors to hold cash or un-margined
securities in their accounts with a total value equal to at least
30 percent of the value of the margined stocks in the account.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the brokers have boosted the maintenance
requirement to between 40 percent and 100 percent for certain
Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Schwab boosted its maintenance requirement to 50
percent from 35 percent on 22 Internet stocks starting last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``To investors that want to drive these stocks, we're saying you
have to wear seat belts,'' says Schwab spokesman Tom Taggart.

ADVERTISING: OPTIMISTIC OUTLOOKS FOR '99 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The light at the end of the tunnel may not be an
approaching freight train after all, two respected forecasters of
advertising spending predicted Monday in offering optimistic
outlooks for 1999 despite the recent concern about worldwide
economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at
McCann-Erickson USA in New York, and John Perriss, chairman and
chief executive at Zenith Media Worldwide in London, presented
their upbeat assessments at the opening session of the 26th annual
Paine Webber Media Conference. The conference, at the McGraw-Hill
Building in midtown Manhattan, continues through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The peaks and valleys of advertising expenditures by marketers
in the media are carefully followed because they are considered an
important gauge of the strength of the economy. The global
financial difficulties since the summer _ particularly in Asia,
Latin America and Russia _ had thrown into doubt earlier forecasts
made by Coen and Perriss about the robustness of ad spending next
year.
</P>
<P>
   But in their presentations, Coen and Perriss agreed that barring
any drastic worsening of the world economies _ particularly
disruptions in the United States or Europe _ ad spending ought to
reach record levels in 1999. And Perriss predicted accelerating
rates of growth through 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think 1999 will be a pretty good year for advertising,''
Coen said. ``Not as good as 1998, but still a good year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the percentage gain for 1999 will be the lowest in
six years, he added, ``the overall trend certainly looks better
than any of us thought possible'' during the steep stock market
slump in late summer.
</P>
<P>
   The primary reason for the improved outlook, said Coen, who has
been tracking advertising and media trends since 1948, is that
American consumers ``will be in a position to feel fairly secure
and spend'' as a result of low inflation rates and low
unemployment. Ad spending closely tracks consumer spending and as
American ad spending goes, so usually goes worldwide ad spending.
</P>
<P>
   Perriss, who sometimes differs with Coen in his forecasts,
echoed him.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``there are some cautionary clouds on the horizon,''
Perriss said, ``broadly, I'm not going to say anything to
contradict Bob's pretty great outlook.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In September, we were looking for pretty grim times in 1999
and 2000,'' he added. ``Thankfully, I am able to stand here today
and say that's not our view.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the very worst has now passed in Asia,'' Perriss
said. ``Nineteen ninety-eight was our `soft landing' and in 1999 we
will go forward virtually everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Coen predicted that marketers would spend a record $212 billion
in the United States next year, an increase of 5.5 percent from the
$200.8 billion that he now forecasts for 1998. The 1998 figure
represents a 7.1 percent gain from the $187.5 billion spent in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The 5.5 percent increase for 1999 would be the smallest in
percentage terms since a 5.2 percent increase in 1993. Still,
advertising as a percentage of gross domestic product in 1999 would
reach 2.40 percent. That would set a record, beating the figure of
2.36 percent for 1998. Before this year, the record had been 2.35
percent in 1987 and 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Coen's figure of $200.8 billion for 1998 marked the third time
he had raised his forecast for the year since an original
prediction in June 1997 of $196.5 billion. That was increased to
$198.4 billion in December 1997 and to $200.3 billion in June. Coen
adjusts his figures every time he makes a semiannual forecast,
based on updated data.
</P>
<P>
   Among the national media that Coen predicted would do
particularly well in 1999 are cable television, radio, syndicated
television and newspapers. Among the local media, he cited radio
and television, fueled by growth in retail advertising from store
openings.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas in 1999, Coen forecasts ad spending of $223.9 billion,
up 3.5 percent from a revised figure of $216.3 billion for 1998.
The figure for this year marked the third time that Coen revised
downward his total for international ad spending.
</P>
<P>
   The figure of $223.9 billion is lower than a prediction of
$228.2 billion made by Coen in June. That reflects continued
ad-spending weakness in countries such as Indonesia, Japan,
Malaysia and South Korea, which he said would offset strength in,
say, Hungary and Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Coen's worldwide total for 1999, then, is $435.9 billion, which
would represent an increase of 4.5 percent from a revised worldwide
total of $417.1 billion in 1998 _ the first time world ad spending
has exceeded $400 billion. The 1998 figure marks an increase of 4.9
percent from the $397.5 billion spent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Perriss, who uses a different methodology, tracking only major
media, said the Asian economic tumult had caused him to shave about
$3 billion off his prediction for 1998 worldwide ad spending, which
now totals $300.3 billion, and about $7 billion from his forecast
for 1999, which now totals $312.9 billion. Last December, he
predicted that the 1998 total would be $317.8 billion and the 1999
total would be $336.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, his revised forecasts are ``pretty optimistic
against where we thought things would be'' at the deepest point of
the summer gloom when ``great horrors'' were foreseen.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To illustrate that, when Perriss mentioned Russia, he said,
smiling, ``That's a word I've hardly heard mentioned in the last
six months.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``all forecasts are highly dependent on the United States
continuing to grow,'' Perriss said. ``A hiccup here, a loss of
consumer confidence here, and it will change around these
forecasts.''
</P>
<P>
   The worldwide total of $300.3 billion for 1998 from Perriss is
up only 1.9 percent from the 1997 total of $289.1 billion, which he
said was the smallest gain since the recession of the early 1990s.
But the gains are then to increase from year to year in constant
prices, he added, to 2.2 percent in 1999, 2.5 percent in 2000
($329.5 billion) and 2.7 percent in 2001 ($348.7 billion).
</P>
<P>
   Among reasons listed by Perriss for those gains were
accelerating economic growth in European nations like Germany and
Italy and recoveries in some economically battered Asian markets.
There will be a stronger second half in 1999 than a first half, he
said, as Asia gradually recovers from the problems of 1998.

 Benefits of Dollar-Cost Averaging  &HT;       
 By Arthur M. Louis  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;   &LR; I recently sold my house in San Francisco for a
substantial sum. I currently am renting and may not purchase
another property in the future. I want to invest in the stock
market but wonder what is the best way to do it. Should I invest
the entire sum at once, or should I spread it out over several
months and take advantage of dollar cost averaging?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Because the stock market tends to rise over the long
term, the most logical move would be to invest all the money at
once. There's a better-than-even chance that shares you buy now
will be worth more when several months have elapsed.
</P>
<P>
   But that takes guts because you never can be sure that the
market will rise in any given period. What if you had invested your
entire fortune in mid-July, just before the market went into a 19
percent nose-dive? Far better to have invested it at the end of
August, when the market reached bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can predict the market's highs and lows with certainty,
so dollar-cost averaging is a sensible alternative for the faint of
heart.
</P>
<P>
   With dollar-cost averaging, you invest equal sums of money in a
stock _ or group of stocks _ at regular intervals over a
predetermined period of time. If prices go down, the number of
shares you buy goes up. When prices rise, the number of shares you
buy goes down.
</P>
<P>
   To take a simple example, suppose you decide to invest $10,000
in XYZ Co. every two months. The first time, the stock is selling
for $50 and you buy 200 shares. (We'll ignore commissions.) The
second time, the stock is down to $45 and you buy 222 shares. The
last time, the stock is up to $55 and you buy 182 shares. You have
accumulated a grand total of 604 shares at an average price of
$49.67 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Because you bought more shares when prices were relatively low,
your average cost per share was slightly lower than the average
cost _ $50 _ for the three dates on which you bought. That's all
you can reasonably expect, unless you happen to own a crystal ball
that really works.
</P>
<P>
   Gift of Giving to Kids
</P>
<P>
   Q: It is my understanding that parents may give up to $10,000
per year to each of their children as a nontaxable gift. Is this
correct, or are there other limitations or liabilities? Also, is
the year a calendar year or a fiscal year? Or do you have to wait
at least a full year between gifts?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: There is indeed a $10,000 annual exclusion, which applies
to the sum of all gifts you give each child during a calendar year.
If you give a child $10,000 or less during the year, there is no
tax liability and no need to file a federal gift-tax form. Each
parent can give each child that much each year without incurring a
tax liability.
</P>
<P>
   If your child isn't a minor _ in California, a minor is someone
under age 18 _ you can hand the $10,000 over directly without any
tax liability.
</P>
<P>
   If the child is a minor, things become more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   When you give a minor any sum of money directly _ above and
beyond what the Internal Revenue Service calls ``normal support'' _
the gift is not tax-exempt. ``Normal support'' can include birthday
and Christmas presents and other gifts of reasonable size, says IRS
spokesman Jesse Weller.
</P>
<P>
   You can avoid a gift tax even when giving money to a minor if
you do it through a trust account with a bank or other financial
institution, under the terms of the Uniform Trust to Minors Act.
The first $10,000 you pay each year into an UTMA account is
tax-exempt.
</P>
<P>
   With an UTMA account, you have full control of the way the funds
are invested. You also can decide how the money will be spent for
the child's benefit _ whether for education, shelter, to buy a car,
or whatever. However, you are forbidden to use the money yourself:
The gift belongs to the child irrevocably.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling Over to a Roth
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am almost 72 years old. Last year, as required by tax law,
I took the first distribution from my deductible Individual
Retirement Account. I'm thinking of converting the balance to a
Roth IRA. If I do that, can I avoid taking a distribution this
year?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Yes. But your question is more complicated than you may
realize.
</P>
<P>
   You should think twice before converting to a Roth because this
will force you to pay all the taxes owed on your present IRA. If
you convert this year, you can spread the taxes out over four
years. If you wait until after the New Year to convert, you must
pay the taxes all at once.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't convert and instead stick with your old IRA, you
will have to pay taxes on the distributions as you receive them.
But you will be able to spread the distributions over more than
four years.
</P>
<P>
   A lot depends on which tax bracket you are in now, which bracket
you expect to be in during the next four years, and which bracket
beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   If your tax rate in the near term will be significantly higher
than your anticipated future rate, it probably wouldn't make sense
to convert out of your old IRA. The tax bite would be too high.

PEG LEG BATES, 91, ONE-LEGGED DANCER  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clayton (Peg Leg) Bates, a one-legged tap dancer who became a
star, died on Sunday in Fountain Inn, S.C., where he was born. He
was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Bates was being honored by Fountain Inn and had danced there on
Saturday in an event to raise money for a life-size sculpture of
himself to be placed at City Hall. He was given the Order of the
Palmetto, the state's highest honor.
</P>
<P>
   Bates lost his leg at age 12 in an accident at a cottonseed-gin
mill where he worked. He had been dancing for his own pleasure from
the age of 5, ``before I even knew I was tap dancing,'' he told
Rusty E. Frank in an interview for Ms. Frank's 1990 book ``Tap!''
``After losing the leg, for some unknown reason, I still wanted to
dance,'' Bates told Ms. Frank. ``At first, I was walking around on
crutches, and I started making musical rhythm with them.''
</P>
<P>
   He began dancing again after his uncle whittled him a wooden
leg. ``See, I did not realize the importance of losing a leg,'' he
recalled. ``I thought it was just like stubbing my toe and knocking
off a toenail that was going to grow back.''
</P>
<P>
   Bates went on to become one of the most popular tap dancers in
the nation, an irrepressible performer who was as much acclaimed by
his fellow dancers as by his audiences. He performed from the 1920s
through 1989 in a career that included vaudeville and clubs, stage
musicals, film and television.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many tap dancers, Bates did not specialize in any one
genre. Hard-working as well as ubiquitous, he mastered a variety of
styles and pyrotechnical flourishes, reinventing everything for a
wooden leg whose half-rubber, half-leather tip gave Bates' tapping
an unusually deep and resonant sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm into rhythm and I'm into novelty,'' he told Ms.
Frank. ``I'm into doing things that it looks almost impossible to
do.'' One reason he had mastered so many styles, he said, was to
surpass two-legged dancers, adding that he often did.
</P>
<P>
   At 15, Bates began drawing attention and entered amateur shows,
where he regularly won first prize. A black performer, he moved on
to minstrel shows and then carnivals, later joining a circuit that
took black performers to black theaters throughout the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   One of those houses was the Lafayette Theater in Harlem, where
Bates was seen by Lew Leslie, the producer of the ``Blackbirds''
musical theater revues. He was signed to perform on Broadway in
``Blackbirds of 1928'' and went on to travel to Paris with the
revue in 1929. After the revue closed, he performed in the Keith,
Loews, and Fanchon and Marco vaudeville circuits. He appeared in
major New York theaters like the Paramount, the Roxy and the
Capitol, and played such Harlem clubs as Connie's Inn, the Cotton
Club and Club Zanzibar. In 1938, Bates played the Tivoli circuit in
Australia, the only black performer in the shows.
</P>
<P>
   Many leading tap dancers performed with the big bands of the
1930s, becoming associated with several of the bands. Bates topped
them all, dancing with the bands of Jimmy Dorsey, Charlie Barnet,
Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Count Basie, Erskine Hawkins, Jimmie
Lunceford, Claude Hopkins, Louis Armstrong and Billy Eckstine. He
also danced in a command performance for Britain's royalty.
</P>
<P>
   Also during the 1930s, he met Ed Sullivan, then a newspaper
columnist, and danced as the opening act for the touring Ed
Sullivan Revue. In the 1950s, he performed on ``The Ed Sullivan
Show'' 21 times, more than any other tap dancer.
</P>
<P>
   He opened a resort in the Catskills, the Peg Leg Bates Country
Club in Kerhonkson, in the 1960s and ran it through the 1980s. The
resort catered to a predominantly black clientele, a novelty in
that largely white, Jewish resort area. ``At first the natives were
resentful,'' Bates said in a 1969 article in The New York Times.
``But now everything is kosher, beautiful.'' He leased the club in
1989, following the death of his wife, Alice, in 1987. His
survivors include a daughter, Melodye Preston.
</P>
<P>
   Bates performed frequently for the disabled, first in the 1940s
in Army and Navy hospitals. He would imitate a dive bomber, leaping
high into the air and coming down on his wooden leg, and then tell
the applauding soldiers and sailors that with that kind of
encouragement he would be happy to break his other leg. After all,
he told his cheering audiences, he had more legs in his dressing
room. There were 13, one to match each of his suits. After his
retirement from the stage in 1989, Bates continued to perform for
the handicapped, as well as children and the elderly.

 Robertson Stephens Fund Group Fetches a Paltry $20 Million  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
What's in a name?
</P>
<P>
   Roughly $10 million if you happen to be BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   The Beantown bank has agreed to pay $10 million to the
management buyout group led by Robertson Stephens Investment
Management President Randy Hecht for undisputed rights to the
Robbie Stephens moniker, BankBoston sources confirm.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston, of course, shelled out about $800 million to buy the
former Robertson Stephens brokerage and trading units last summer
from Bank of America, leaving the money management arm of Robertson
Stephens to fend for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble was, the fund group still had dibs on the Robertson
Stephens brand name, and that didn't sit well with BankBoston's
brass. In fact, failing to secure total control of the brand
bothered BankBoston enough for it to seriously consider buying the
entire fund group, investment banking sources say.
</P>
<P>
   However, once BankBoston's bid for the fund group was derailed,
the bank opted to settle for acquisition of just the name from
Hecht's buyout group.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why the Hecht-led LBO has agreed to cede the
``Robertson Stephens'' name in exchange for &UR;  &LR; its new name: RS
Funds. (It should be noted that the name change had been mulled by
previous management for a few years.)
</P>
<P>
   The $10 million price tag for the nameplate will cover half of
the nearly $20 million that Hecht has agreed to pay for the entire
fund business.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, the new Bank of America (formerly NationsBank) is
so eager to unload the leftover fund group that it is willing to do
the deal for nearly nothing. In addition, the severely slashed
price tag is also indicative of the degree to which the performance
of the Robbie fund complex has slumped.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America has agreed to Hecht's LBO bid for the struggling
fund group, but there are still plenty of loose ends to the
transaction, including how many of the funds' well-known portfolio
managers are going to work for Hecht after the buyout. Most of the
portfolio managers' contracts expire at the end of 1998. A date for
a Bank of America board vote on the sale of the fund group has not
yet been announced, a Bank of America spokesman says.
</P>
<P>
   What's even more intriguing is that Bank of America considered
pulling the plug on the funds. As it turns out, internecine rivalry
within the premerger Robertson Stephens family almost derailed
Hecht's LBO bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was the possibility that Bank of America was going to
shut down the fund business,'' a BankBoston source says.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Robertson Stephens co-founder Sandy Robertson
aligned with Robertson Stephens Investment Management fund manager
Jim Callinan to make unsuccessful multiple bids for parts of the
fund group, according to sources at BancBoston Robertson Stephens,
Bank of America and Robertson Stephens Investment Management.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, there is little love lost between Robertson, who no
longer works for any current incarnations of his former firm, and
Hecht. Few dispute that Sandy Robertson and Callinan discussed
putting together buyout bids to counter Hecht's initiatives. But
after that, the picture gets a little murky as to whether Callinan
approached Robertson or the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the competing bids divided sentiment among the fund
managers to the extent that it was difficult for either side to
garner majority support for their proposals, sources say. Sandy
Robertson was unavailable for comment, and Callinan referred
inquiries to a spokesman at BofA, which is his current employer.
</P>
<P>
   And, despite their differences behind closed doors, Hecht and
Callinan are now doing their best to display a unified front.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect Mr. Callinan to play a senior executive role at the
new group,'' says Hecht through a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``(And) I am working closely with (Jim) to craft a new
organization that will serve our clients and shareholders well,''
Hecht states.
</P>
<P>
   Question is: How many of Callinan's money-manager colleagues
will go along for the ride?

 Bottom-Fishing in Biotech  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Biotech stock indexes have risen as much as 60 percent this year,
leaving little apparent room for bargain hunters.
</P>
<P>
   What the indexes don't tell you is that the biotech market has
split like a strand of DNA. The top-tier companies that dominate
the indexes, such as Genentech, Chiron and Amgen, have soared. But
midsize and smaller biotech firms have actually stagnated or lost
ground this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 20 or so largest stocks have done very well,'' said Mark
Lambert, who manages the Biotechnology Value Fund in San Francisco.
``But going forward, I believe the greatest values and the biggest
returns are going to be from the small stocks that have been left
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambert and others believe the bottom half of the industry may
be poised for a comeback, largely because many of these overlooked
companies have drugs that are close to being approved.
</P>
<P>
   Since the industry was born, about 100 biotech drugs have been
approved. Today, more than 200 products are awaiting U.S. marketing
approval, according to consulting firm Ernst &AMP; Young.
</P>
<P>
   And even if the rule of thumb holds true, and just one in five
candidates passes FDA review, that still leaves 40 or more winners
out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 20 years in this business, I've never seen a better crop of
promising young startups,'' said Scott Morrison, a biotech industry
consultant with Ernst &AMP; Young in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   Small stocks have been shunned largely because Wall Street's
volume traders _ institutions and mutual funds _ cannot buy them
without affecting their price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big funds need to move large blocks of money in and out of
stocks quickly, and a lot of biotech issues just don't have the
market cap or the trading value to make this possible,'' Morrison
said.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison thinks a biotech firm needs to have a market value of
$200 million to $250 million to catch institutions' attention.
Other analysts think it takes a market cap of $500 million or even
$1 billion to interest big money managers.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cutoff point, the fact is that out of nearly 400
publicly traded biotech firms, 250 to 350 have been left out of the
stock rebound that has occurred since September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to think that a rising tide lifted all ships,'' said
David Flores, publisher of the BioCentury industry newsletter in
San Carlos. ``Now, what you see is that the market cap makes a huge
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't be misled into thinking that picking biotech winners
is as easy as hooking the minnows that have slipped through Wall
Street's net.
</P>
<P>
   Flores said it can take a biotech firm 10 years to take a
promising biotechnology drug through the three phases of scientific
trials that the Food and Drug Administration requires a drug to
pass before it can be sold to the public.
</P>
<P>
   During that long development cycle, which can cost up to $250
million, most biotech firms run in the red, using proceeds from
venture capital and stock sales to cover their losses.
</P>
<P>
   That means biotech shareholders must wait and worry that factors
ranging from unexpected scientific setbacks to the vagaries of
FDA's drug review process could sink the company.
</P>
<P>
   Flores likened investing in young biotech firms to putting money
into one of the mercantile companies of 17th century Europe. Both
investments were bets on explorations into the unknown, be it the
frontiers of science or the passage around Cape Horn.
</P>
<P>
   As Flores said: ``Once those ships went out over the horizon,
you never knew when or whether they'd return.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the unusual risks and long lead times of investing in
small biotech firms, Karen Bernstein, editor of the BioCentury
newsletter, suggested wannabe investors ask themselves this
question: ``Is this money I can afford to lose?''
</P>
<P>
   If the answer is yes, and you can stand the risks, investing in
the small biotech firms overlooked by Wall Street could lead to big
returns in the long run, said Matt Berry, a biotech analyst with
the Medical Technology Stock Letter in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of young companies that have drugs in pivotal
Phase III trials that we think are undervalued by the market,''
Berry said. ``A lot of them have tiny share prices, but they can
shoot up in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues his newsletter recommends are these two small
and one midsize companies:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Immunogen.  &LR; This Massachusetts firm is in the very early
stages of testing a new cancer-fighting technique that targets
tumor cells directly, promising fewer side effects. The stock
gained 3 cents yesterday to close at $2.19.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Cor Therapeutics.  &LR; The South San Francisco firm recently won
FDA approval to sell Integrilin, a drug that can be used to scour
blood vessels of plaque, perhaps in conjunction with angioplasty.
Integrilin competes with similar drugs from Merck and Centacor. The
stock, which was below $10 last month, slipped 44 cents to close at
$12.31 yesterday. ``We still think there's lotsa room for it to
move,'' Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Agouron.  &LR; This midsize biotech firm based in La Jolla (San
Diego) is making a run for the top tier. Its anti-AIDS drug,
Viracept, grossed $466.50 million in fiscal 1998. ``That was the
most ever for a biotech drug in its first year,'' Berry said. With
other promising compounds in the works, Berry thinks it's a bargain
at $47.88. The stock gained $2.38 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts declined to share their picks and pans but did
offer some tips for how to research young biotech firms:
</P>
<P>
   _ Check the company's market cap and trading volume. The smaller
these numbers are, the less likely the company is going to get
noticed by Wall Street, which could mean you'll hold the stock a
long time before seeing a gain.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make sure the company has at least two years worth of cash on
hand to cover its current rate of annual expenses (called the burn
rate).
</P>
<P>
   _ Try to find companies with more than one or two promising
drugs going through the clinical trial process.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be prepared for plenty of ups and downs. Investing in a small
biotech firm is like pulling chance cards in a Monopoly game.
Unexpected news events, like the success or failure of a clinical
trial, could double _ or halve _ the value of your shares in a day.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if picking individual issues seems too daunting,
Morningstar, the mutual fund tracking company in Chicago, has data
on several funds that specialize in the sector.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Select Biotechnology has the longest and best record
over the past three years, when it returned an average of 14.6
percent per year. This year, through November 30, it's up 14.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Monterey Murphy New World Biotech has also been around three
years, but it's lost an average of 1.8 percent per year during that
period, and so far this year it has lost 14.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dresdner RCM Biotechnology, one of the newer funds, is up 6.6
percent this year, while Franklin Biotechnology Discovery, another
new fund on the block, is up 4.7 percent year to date.

STEWART EARNS SUGAR BOWL START FOR TEXAS A&AMP;M
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A strong performance in the Big 12
championship game has allowed Texas A&AMP;M quarterback Branndon
Stewart to regain the starting job he lost at midseason.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum said yesterday that Stewart, who threw for
a season-high 324 yards and three touchdowns Saturday in a 36-33
upset of Kansas State that sealed the conference title, will start
Jan. 1 in the Sugar Bowl against Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart lost the starting job Oct. 3 to Randy McCown, who missed
the Kansas State game because of a broken left collarbone. Slocum
said uncertainty about McCown's availability, plus Stewart's
crunch-time dissection of the Wildcats' secondary, made the
fifth-year senior from Stephenville the clear choice to handle the
offense when No. 8 A&AMP;M (11-2) meets No. 3 Ohio State (10-1) in New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things look very doubtful for Randy,'' said Slocum, noting
that the medical prognosis puts McCown out of action for another
three weeks. ``That eliminates him from any practice time before
the bowl. We'll go on with Branndon and get Shane Lechler ready to
go as a backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all proud of Branndon Stewart. We had confidence he
could do the job, and he played extremely well. I'm happy to see
him get some recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   During the fourth quarter and two overtime periods against
then-unbeaten Kansas State, Stewart completed 11 of 20 passes for
235 yards, three touchdowns and a pivotal two-point conversion in
leading A&AMP;M back from a 27-12 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Lechler, the Aggies' punter, is 2-of-2 passing this season for
37 yards and a touchdown. Slocum said Lechler, a former high school
quarterback, can run only ``about 50 percent'' of the Aggies'
offense, but will be brought up to speed as much as possible before
game time. Snyder sounds off Kansas State coach Bill Snyder, whose
team is 11-1 and ranked No. 4 in The Associated Press college
football rankings, joined school president Jon Wefald in objecting
to the Wildcats' omission from a Bowl Championship Series game or a
Jan. 1 bowl. Instead, Kansas State will play unranked Purdue (8-4)
in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 29 in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Wefald voiced his concerns Sunday. Snyder declined to comment
until a conference call for Big 12 coaches yesterday. Then he
unloaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like to be able to say life is fair. Obviously, that's
not the case,'' Snyder said. ``This is an example ... where the
system does not work. But I can't blame anybody. I can only blame
myself for not having the football team prepared enough to win the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kansas State had defeated A&AMP;M, the Wildcats would have earned
a berth in the Fiesta Bowl to meet top-ranked Tennessee (12-0) on
Jan. 4 for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he is concerned about his team's mental state,
Snyder said: ``Yes, I certainly am. Somehow, I have to make sure I
don't allow our youngsters to lose sight of the tremendous things
they have done.'' Tech doubles its efforts Texas Tech defensive
coordinator John Goodner said he plans to prepare his players to
face two offenses when the Red Raiders (7-4) meet Mississippi (6-5)
in the Independence Bowl on Dec. 31 in Shreveport, La.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi will be coached by David Cutcliffe, who took over
the team yesterday after serving throughout the regular season as
Tennessee's offensive coordinator. Goodner said Tech coaches are
unsure whether Cutcliffe will run the offense of former Ole Miss
coach Tommy Tuberville or institute his system during prebowl
workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they'll use what their coach did at Tennessee, but we
have to try and get ready for both,'' Goodner said. ``It'll be a
little different for us, but we're looking forward to the
challenge. The one good thing is, the Tennessee offense isn't that
far from what Mississippi has done in the past.''

THRILLING WEEKEND REVEALS BCS IS WINNING FORMULA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Other than perhaps New Year's Day 1984 when
Texas let a national championship slip away and Miami upset
Nebraska, I can't remember a more exciting day in college football
than Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Upsets. Drama. Big plays. Mood swings. Reversals of fortune.
Would it have been a perfect first round of a playoff? Yes. Would
the following games be better? Doubtful. Will another season of
deciding a ``national champion'' instead of a playoff-produced
national champion lead us to a playoff? Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, the vaunted football experts and talking heads were
screeching about how the Bowl Championship Series was flawed, how
there were going to be three (or more) undefeated teams and how the
BCS computer rankings were a failed bit.
</P>
<P>
   Am I a ``BCS guy?'' Guess so. But I'm more for patience and
seasonlong perspective. All I know is that the BCS was criticized
from its inception. Had these critics been around Kitty Hawk, the
Wright Brothers would have said, ``Ah, forget this'' and gone back
to fixing bikes.
</P>
<P>
   What needed to happen, happened. The season _ the entire season
_ was played. The Fiesta Bowl national championship game is
unanimous No. 1 Tennessee facing No. 2 Florida State. In the end,
all the BCS system did was help designate Florida State as the team
most worthy to face the undefeated No. 1 team. The Seminoles'
strength of schedule was far superior to the other contenders.
</P>
<P>
   What if there had been no BCS rankings? The national
championship game would have pitted the teams ranked No. 1 and No.
2 in the polls. And those teams are _ well, how about that? _
Tennessee and Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   More and more coaches favor a playoff. Of course, the coaches
want it both ways. They want a playoff ``and'' the bowl system.
Making those two compatible not only requires Solomon-like wisdom,
it ignores the fact that a playoff system would probably kill the
bowls.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't matter how much the coaches, fans and news media
yap about wanting a playoff. It won't happen until Division I-A
presidents say it will happen. The presidents, who tend to blow
with the wind, might eventually give in to public opinion. But
those scales haven't tipped far enough.
</P>
<P>
   Is college football's postseason a perfect system? Far from it.
Is the NCAA Tournament perfect? Nope. It has flaws. Are NFL
officials infallible? Well, duh.
</P>
<P>
   This is sports, people. A microcosm of life. Life is not fair,
ergo the games we play are not fair. Deal with it. Ask UCLA if that
was a fumble or Kansas State if Sirr Parker actually broke the
plane of the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to this season's Designated Victim (which, as
our judiciary process teaches us, is a necessary component to any
argument). That loud, jet-engine-type noise coming from up north is
the whining of Kansas State and its fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``''We just can't \Rsniffle\S believe that \Rwhimper\S we wound
up in the Alamo Bowl \Rsob\S just because we lost one game
\Rwail\S.''''
</P>
<P>
   This game of musical bowls occurs every year. TCU got to find
out what it's like to sit down because they were lucky enough to be
near a chair (the Sun Bowl) when the music (Kansas State and UCLA
losses) stopped.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way the game is played. Kansas State shouldn't be
unhappy; the rules weren't changed at the last minute. It's like
the IRS: If you don't like to pay taxes, find another country.
These are the rules and the laws; deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 9-2 UCLA and 10-1 North Carolina were unhappy because
they weren't invited to alliance bowls. A 10-1 team that brings
tons of fans got an-large berth in the Fiesta. The team? Kansas
State.
</P>
<P>
   Did Kansas State get a raw deal, falling from a BCS bowl to the
Alamo Bowl? Yes. Did Kansas State deserve a better bowl? Yes.
Should the Wildcats be kicking and screaming about fickle fate?
Yes. But not after today. Then it's time to get on with life.
</P>
<P>
   It was heartbreaking to see Kansas State come so close to a
national championship only to see it slip away. But the Wildcats
can blame no one but themselves. Here's my advice: Next time you've
got a 15-point fourth quarter lead, don't blow it.

GATES GOES ON ATTACK AGAINST ANTITRUST EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Launching a fierce media campaign to try to rebuild his
company's tattered image, Microsoft Corp. chairman Bill Gates
Monday accused the government of trying to ``destroy'' the software
firm by pressing an antitrust suit he claimed was calculated solely
to bolster the interests of his competitors.
</P>
<P>
   For seven weeks, Microsoft has been under siege from federal
prosecutors and business rivals as the government pressed its case
that the world's largest software company used predatory tactics in
an effort to maintain a monopoly in personal computer operating
software and expand its dominance over software designed to
navigate the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Gates, who has offered little public comment since the
antitrust trial began in US District Court in Washington, struck
back, taking direct aim at David Boies, the Justice Department's
lead trial lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Boies has made it clear in the negotiations leading up to
the case that he's really out to destroy Microsoft,'' said Gates,
speaking to reporters at the National Press Club in Washington via
a satellite hookup from the company's headquarters in Redmond,
Wash. ``He is out to take all the work we have done and make us
look very bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates added that the suit, joined by 20 states, was designed to
provide relief to companies like rival Netscape Communications
Corp., which claims Microsoft used its monopoly power to try to
drive it from the Internet browser market. But Gates said Microsoft
was being punished for defeating its competitors in the marketplace
and that there was no evidence its business practices had harmed
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is the government representing?'' he asked. ``A handful of
competitors, or consumers?''
</P>
<P>
   Gates's attack on the antitrust suit received a boost Monday
when South Carolina Attorney General Charles Condon announced the
state would withdraw from the antitrust action. In a written
statement, Condon, a Republican, said America Online Inc.'s
decision to purchase Netscape for $4.2 billion ``proves the forces
of competition are working'' and that further government
intervention is ``unwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Condon questioned whether it ever made sense to bring the case.
``Over the last year,'' he said, ``it has become clear that the
government's case has been about Internet competitors, not about
consumers. The government's witnesses are either Microsoft's
competitors or paid government experts. Consumers have not taken a
leading role in this action.''
</P>
<P>
   News of Condon's decision sent Microsoft stock soaring by 6 3/16
to 133 9/16 on the Nasdaq exchange, an all-time high, as investors
expressed optimism about the company's chances of winning the
antitrust suit, which resumes Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But other state attorneys general, including Massachusetts's
Scott Harshbarger, said South Carolina's decision would have no
impact on the case. ``We're still in the case,'' said Harshbarger's
spokeswoman, Debbie Banda. ``We respect South Carolina's decision,
but we feel the merger doesn't resolve all the issues the case
raises.''
</P>
<P>
   The office of New York Attorney General Dennis Vacco called
Condon's withdrawal ``an insignificant event,'' and a Justice
Department spokeswoman said it would have ``zero impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates also pointed to America Online's proposed acquisition of
Netscape and alliance with Sun Microsystems Inc. as proof that the
computer industry is still intensely competitive, contrary to the
claims in the government's antitrust complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the AOL-Netscape deal, it's hard to believe
that the government can still press their case with a straight
face,'' Gates said. ``Three of our biggest competitors are banding
together and yet the government is still trying to slow us down.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gates spent much of the news conference attempting to
counter the portrait Boies has painted of him at trial as a chief
executive who has been less than forthcoming about his company's
tactics in dealing with competitors. Although Gates has not been
scheduled as a witnesses by either side in the case, Boies grilled
him during a pretrial deposition in which Gates repeatedly dodged
questions and quibbled with Boies over the meaning of words such as
``ask'' and ``compete.''
</P>
<P>
   During his deposition, Gates often used lengthy pauses before
saying he didn't know the answers to even simple questions about
Microsoft's business plans.
</P>
<P>
   Boies has used videotaped portions of the deposition five times
during the trial, to great effect, as he has attempted to show that
Gates and Microsoft set out deliberately to harm its rivals. During
one presentation, US District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
shook his head in disgust at Gates's answers.
</P>
<P>
   Seizing the opportunity to explain his appearance and behavior
during what he called the ``three long days'' last August when he
was questioned by the government's lawyers, Gates said: ``I
answered truthfully every single question that was put forward to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates characterized many of the questions put to him as
``strange'' and defended asking Boies to explain what he meant by
the word ``compete.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my question there is an absolutely legitimate
question, which anybody in that situation . . . would have asked,''
Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft continued its attack on the antitrust suit following
Gates's remarks. The company issued a 16-page single-spaced press
release entitled ``A Trial in Error'' that charged the suit is
``the last refuge of antitrust plaintiffs who do not have a viable
case: The government is throwing every bit of mud from Microsoft's
competitors at the wall, in the hope that at least some of it will
stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the company also filed a motion asking Jackson to
allow Microsoft access to documents connected to the proposed deal
involving AOL, Netscape, and Sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see the documents from all three of these companies
. . . so we can defend ourselves against the notion that somehow
Microsoft or any other single company could possibly hope to
control access to the Internet,'' said Microsoft's general counsel,
William Neukom. He argued the documents may help Microsoft counter
the testimony of some of the government's previous witnesses,
including Netscape's chief executive, James Barksdale.
</P>
<P>
   But ProComp, a Washington-based lobbying group that supports the
antitrust lawsuit, said the AOL-Netscape-Sun merger is not relevant
to the real issue at trial. ``The issue in this case is whether
Microsoft has a monopoly in the operating system and whether this
harms consumers,'' said Kevin Arquit, an attorney for the group.

NOWITZKI SAMPLES NBA ACTION DURING VISIT TO DALLAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Dirk Nowitzki received a shovel pass from Derek Harper,
thundered to the basket and threw down a tomahawk dunk.
</P>
<P>
   That was one of the few highlights for Nowitzki, the German
wonder boy the Mavericks' acquired in a three-team trade on draft
day in June, during a pickup basketball game at the Tom Landry
Center. Nowitzki arrived Saturday in Dallas from Germany to look
for a place to live. He will work out the next two days with
Mavericks players and current and former NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki was averaging 21.6 points and 8.3 rebounds for
Germany's senior national team. The 20-year-old Nowitzki and his
coach, Holger Geschwindner, decided to skip their German team's
Sunday game to fly to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is new to me,'' Nowitzki said. ``There are a lot of
good players out here, so I have to get used to it because they're
much more athletic than myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki might have struggled at times, but former Mavericks
player Harper said he expects Nowitzki to get used to the NBA game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands the game quite well, and I think he's going to
do well,'' Harper said. ``With 20-year-old kids, you have to be
patient with them and give them room for errors, because they're
going to make a few mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   His moves might not be all there yet, but his future teammates
admire his move of coming to Dallas to get used to the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a smart move on his part to come over here and
practice,'' Mavs guard Steve Nash said. ``He got a chance to play
against some NBA players today and got used to his teammates a
little bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day when he starts playing _ his first new training camp
and his first day of the season _ is going to definitely be
influenced by his time out here.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA lockout, which has reached 161 days, mystifies Nowitzki.
He doesn't understand what the union and NBA management are
squabbling about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's a lot of money involved,'' Nowitzki said.
``Hopefully the season will start in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if it doesn't, that's not the biggest problem for me,
because I have good competition in Europe. I have a lot of time to
grow and develop.''

COMPUTER FAILURE PRODUCES JUMBO JET NEAR MISS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A computer that Boston center air traffic controllers rely on to
provide them with identifying data about the aircraft they direct
malfunctioned Sunday night, resulting in two Europe-bound jumbo
jets nearly colliding off Long Island, air traffic controllers
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration, which has consistently
asserted that the nation's air traffic system is protected by
numerous backup systems, said it is investigating the incident but
has not yet determined whether the loss of safe separation between
the two aircraft was the result of a system failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The matter is under investigation, and until that
investigation is complete, we cannot attribute the error to the
(computer) outage,'' said FAA spokeswoman Arlene Salac. ``The air
traffic system in the United States is safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The two aircraft _ a British Caledonian L-1011 with 271 people
on board heading from Montego Bay to Manchester, England, and a
Delta Airlines Boeing 767 going from Atlanta to Zurich with 101 on
board _ came within a little more than 1 mile of each other while
flying at more than 500 miles per hour, both at 33,000 feet. At
that altitude, safe separation is either 2,000 feet vertically or 5
miles horizontally.
</P>
<P>
   Controllers at the Boston air-traffic control center in Nashua,
N.H., who have had to deal with repeated computer outages in the
last year, were literally in the dark about the near collision
until the pilot of British Caledonia Flight 5199 said he was going
to file a report upon landing, controllers said.
</P>
<P>
   The on-board computer systems on the two airplanes, known as
TCAS, for Traffic Collision Avoidance System, alerted each flight
crew of the approaching aircraft. The Delta jet, Flight 66, was
told by its TCAS to climb _ it went to 33,600 feet _ and the L-1011
plane was told to descend. It went to 32,700 feet. The two planes
passed within 1.07 miles of each other, according to the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   The incident is being independently investigated by the airlines
involved.
</P>
<P>
   William Johannes, Boston center president of the National Air
Traffic Controllers Association, credited TCAS with averting a
tragedy. But he placed the blame for the incident squarely on the
computer failure at the Boston center.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the (FAA) wants to say that safety was never compromised,
that is their point of view,'' Johannes said. ``When you can't
separate airplanes because the tools you use are no longer there
and you are having rapid system failures, I think they are failing
to acknowledge there is a major problem there.''
</P>
<P>
   The system usually operates with a mainframe computer known as
the Host, which processes flight information, and another system
known as the Computer Display Channel, a 1972-era computer that is
the main radar processing computer at Boston center. Its
replacement system is still at least a year away from being
operational.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, which officials have not yet determined, the
interface between the Host and CDC was lost around 9:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Officials went to a backup computer system known as DARC, but
that was partially disabled, so controllers were forced to
handwrite notes about flight information, including the flight
number, type of aircraft, destination, altitude, and airspeed.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, a computer screen flashed the message ``DARC
disabled,'' heightening tension among the controllers who were
uncertain if DARC, the backup, was working at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of hollering and people were saying they were
locked out,'' said Johannes. ``There was a lot of confusion about
who was supposed to do what. Surrounding facilities were calling
attempting to hand off airplanes.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Michael, manager for quality assurance in air traffic
control at the Boston center, depicted the atmosphere during the
computer outage as calm: ``Controllers are trained for this, and in
a nutshell, operations continued normally at the center.''
</P>
<P>
   But the confusion stemming from the computer failure in the
sector, which handles planes east of New York's John F. Kennedy
Airport, apparently deteriorated even further, resulting in the
near collision, controllers said.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal conditions, if two planes are on a collision
course, the data blocks containing the flight information begin to
flash. Controllers then have 2 1/2 minutes to intervene. But that
system was disabled.
</P>
<P>
   If controllers have to rely on handwritten notes, they can
slowly rebuild the system by keyboarding the information back in.
But in this one sector, where three controllers were juggling 15
planes, the keyboard was locked up and controllers could not
operate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this sector, there was an additional problem with the
keyboard,'' Michael acknowledged. ``Exactly what the problem was,
is still under investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The data blocks on some planes began to disappear, as well as
the flight tracks of some of the planes, including Delta Flight 66,
controllers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all of what was happening, they might as well have been
sitting there blindfolded,'' said Johannes.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston center, which controls about 165,000 square miles of
airspace from out into the Atlantic into New York state, and from
Canada to south of Long Island, has had numerous computer and radar
problems this year.
</P>
<P>
   During one period this spring, the center was averaging a
disruption in normal function on a daily basis. The interruptions
would last from seconds to 37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While the on-board TCAS systems on the two planes may have
averted a tragedy Sunday night, those systems nearly caused a
mid-air collision south of Albany on Tuesday. On Saturday, The
Boston Globe reported that an Air Ontario de Havilland Dash 8 came
within 300 feet of a Northwest Airlines Airbus A-320, when its TCAS
told it to climb to avoid a US Airways Boeing 737 and the Northwest
plane's TCAS told it to descend.

   William Hague, the leader of Britain's Conservatives, has
abandoned plans to press for a new regional Parliament to represent

RANGERS TALKING TO PITCHER CLARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers, who continue to be involved in
the pursuit of Toronto Blue Jays right-hander Roger Clemens, might
be close to strengthening their rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Calm down.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander in question is Mark Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've discussed Mark Clark,'' Rangers general manager Doug
Melvin acknowledged yesterday. ``We've talked figures.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin did not divulge whether an offer has been tendered to
Clark, but the Rangers' general manager mentioned it to Joe Bick,
who represents free-agent right-hander Bob Tewksbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that they were involved in the Clemens trade
possibility and that he had one additional offer to a free agent
out there,'' Bick said. ``Doug said he would get back to me by
Wednesday at the latest.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who this past season earned $5.05 million, went 9-14 with
a 4.84 earned-run average during 33 starts for the Chicago Cubs.
The 30-year-old right-hander went 28-19 with a 3.62 ERA during the
1996-97 seasons with the New York Mets and Cubs. CLEMENS' LIST CUT
</P>
<P>
   Blue Jays general manager Gord Ash spent this weekend narrowing
the list of Clemens' suitors from 14 to six organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a couple of offers for more than I expected,'' Ash
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ash identified only one of those organizations _ the New York
Yankees _ and for the first time acknowledged that a trade for
Clemens could involve three organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin, who spoke briefly yesterday with Ash, declined to
divulge whether the Rangers could be involved in a multiple-team
trade for Clemens. ARBITRATION OFFERED CLARK, PAVLIK
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers offered salary arbitration yesterday to two of their
six free agents: right-hander Roger Pavlik and first baseman Will
Clark, who Saturday signed a two-year contract worth $11 million
with the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Offering Clark arbitration ensures the Rangers two draft
selections _ a sandwich pick between the first and second rounds
and what now stands as the Orioles' fourth-round choice _ as
compensation for losing Clark.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers offered Pavlik arbitration ``to give us a little
more time to determine whether there's interest from our level
later on,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Pavlik, who earned $1.6 million this past season, likely
guaranteed the Rangers that he would not go to arbitration in order
to have an opportunity to return.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers did not offer salary arbitration to left-handers
Scott Bailes and Greg Cadaret, right-hander Xavier Hernandez and
catcher Bill Haselman. The Rangers cannot re-sign those four to a
major-league contract until May 1, and therefore likely ended their
stint with the organization. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Juan Gonzalez married recording artist Olga Tanon
last night in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Diamondbacks' signing of free-agent center fielder
Steve Finley did not hurt the Rangers. Finley, a Type A free agent,
was rated lower than right-hander Todd Stottlemyre by the annual
Elias Player Rankings. That means the Rangers still will receive
the Diamondbacks' fourth-round draft selection and a sandwich pick
between the first and second rounds for losing Stottlemyre as it
stands now.

POLICE ASKED TO VISIT 100,000 HOMES TO CHECK VOTER ELIGIBILITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Claiming fresh evidence that thousands of New
York City residents had cast ballots illegally, lawyers for
Republican Attorney General Dennis Vacco called Monday for police
officers to conduct door-to-door visits to verify the eligibility
of more than 100,000 voters.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Vacco asked a state judge to declare him the
winner of the Nov. 3 vote over Eliot Spitzer, the Democratic
challenger, or to order the state to conduct a new election.
Spitzer holds a narrow lead in the state tally, including a sizable
advantage in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   In requesting the police visits, lawyers for Vacco took
advantage of a seldom-used provision in the state's election laws.
</P>
<P>
   The request drew a strong response from Spitzer, who charged
that Vacco was trying to intimidate voters in heavily Democratic
areas, particularly black and Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Vacco campaign based its request on a computer database
search that compared the names of registered voters in New York
City with a list provided by a private credit reporting company.
Thomas Spargo, Vacco's lawyer, said the search turned up 103,000
people on the voting rolls ``for whom there was no apparent record
that they had engaged in routine activity in the community or
otherwise existed.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Keegan did not rule on the requests to hold a new
election or to declare Vacco the winner. He asked the two sides to
return to court next Monday, the day before the election results
are to be certified by the State Board of Elections. At that
hearing, on the basis of findings from the police canvass, Keegan
is expected to determine whether there is merit to the attorney
general's complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The State Election Board reported Monday that it had completed
its tally, with Spitzer leading by 26,011 votes out of 4.2 million
votes cast.
</P>
<P>
   The judge asked lawyers for both campaigns to meet with the
police department, the city corporation counsel and the City Board
of Elections on Tuesday to scale down the number of voters whose
eligibility is to be verified. Keegan suggested that it was
impossible for police officers to visit the homes of more than
100,000 people in the six days that the election laws mandate for
such investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Spargo said the Vacco campaign discovered ``a substantial number
of irregularities which would either cause this election to be
decided in favor of Dennis Vacco or to cause doubt to the outcome
of the election to be reason enough to hold a new election.'' He
charged that some voters had cast ballots twice, and that there was
a large number of voters registered at the same apartment or at
companies that provide mailbox services.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said he was outraged that the Republican Party has
``demanded that the police knock on the doors of over 100,000
voters who don't show up in the files of a credit-reporting firm
that doesn't keep records on economically disadvantaged voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer made it clear that his representatives had no intention
of participating in the meeting with Vacco's lawyers and the
police. ``I have also asked my attorneys to investigate whether the
Republicans' conduct is a violation of the United States Civil
Rights and Voting Rights Acts,'' Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Under state election laws, a commissioner of the board of
elections may challenge the eligibility of a voter who is suspected
of registering illegally. When such a challenge is registered, the
police department is asked to visit the home of the voter and file
a report within six days.
</P>
<P>
   If the officer reports that there is no evidence of a voter
living at the address where he is registered, the board of
elections is required to send a letter to the voter, informing him
that a hearing will be held to determine his eligibility to vote.
If he is found ineligible to vote, his name is then expunged from
the rolls.
</P>
<P>
   In Vacco's case, Vincent Velella, a longtime Republican
commissioner, signed an order asking for such a process to extend
to 103,000 voters in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Connor, the state Senate minority leader and a lawyer for
Spitzer, said that under state law the police findings, whatever
they may be, would be irrelevant in determining the outcome of an
election that took place more than a month ago.

PANEL RECOMMENDS STRONGER ROLE FOR POLICE INSPECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A City Council committee asked city legal
officials on Monday to draw up plans to strengthen the police
department's inspector general, a job created in the wake of the
worst riots in Los Angeles history.
</P>
<P>
   The committee acted after advocates for changes in police
procedures and city officials testified at a hearing of the
council's public-safety committee that the inspector general should
have unfettered access to police documents, be free to conduct
investigations of police conduct and report directly to the board
of police commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   The committee asked the city attorney's office to draft a City
Council bill to put those proposals into effect.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was called after the department's first inspector
general, Katherine Mader, resigned last month, accusing the board
and its executive director, to whom she reported, of undercutting
her authority. Ms. Mader also complained that aggressive monitoring
of the police department was no longer welcome since a popular new
police chief, Bernard Parks, took office last year.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of a police inspector general, who oversees the
police disciplinary system and citizen complaints against police
officers, was recommended by a commission that examined the
department after the beating of the motorist Rodney King in 1991.
The office was created after riots were set off when police
officers were acquitted in the beating the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mader, who served less than three years in the job,
testified at the hearing that the position needed more power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interests of the inspector general do not always coincide
with the interests of the department,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also said that whistle-blowers in the police department
needed better protection. In one instance, she said, police
officials came to her office to retrieve an anonymous letter that
requested an investigation. She said the officials wanted to check
the letter for fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, police commissioners, who have been accused of
forcing out Ms. Mader, said they too favored a stronger
inspector-general position that would report directly to them and
have unfettered access to documents.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the board and the board's executive director,
Joe Gunn, though, have called Ms. Mader's work substandard and said
the commission wanted to dismiss her before she resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, The Los Angeles Times reported that Edith Perez, the
president of the commission, had been sending anonymous letters and
press clippings to police-reform experts condemning Ms. Mader in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And several commissioners who spoke at the hearing said the
inspector general's autonomy should not compromise confidential
police activity or undercut the police commissioners' authority.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A central point of the controversy over Ms. Mader's resignation
is that the commission that recommended the creation of her job
left unclear to whom the inspector general would report.
</P>
<P>
   The fine print of the proposition creating the post, which was
approved by Los Angeles voters in 1995, said the inspector general
would report to the executive director of the board of the police
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mader and some members of the investigative commission,
which was headed by Warren Christopher, who went on to become
secretary of state, have advocated having the inspector general
report directly to the police board.
</P>
<P>
   That, they said, would lessen the potential for interference,
provide a clearer line of communication on sensitive investigations
and enhance the inspector general's appearance of independence,
both with the public and with the police that she investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mader's resignation raised concerns that the city's
commitment to police reform was fading. Several prominent civil
rights leaders, including Ramona Ripston, the executive director of
the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, said the
city need to do more to change the police department.

DESPITE POLICE, SCHOOL LEADS NEW JERSEY IN BOMB THREATS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By KIRSTY SUCATO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE HILL, N.J. _ When Shayna Barford was transferred from a
parochial school to Overbrook Regional Senior High School here last
April, she had never experienced a bomb threat. She did not even
know what one was. But on her first day of school, the ninth-grader
was forced outside with 1,800 other students for more than an hour
as the police scoured the brown brick building for nonexistent
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the threats have become almost as common as physical
education or study hall. Last year, there were more than 30 such
evacuations, all sparked by anonymous telephone calls to 911. And
last week, Overbrook High received a bomb threat every day, causing
students to lose eight hours of class time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dumb because it takes away from the kids who want to
learn,'' Shayna said.
</P>
<P>
   But to law enforcement authorities and school administrators, it
is more than stupid, so when students arrived for class on Monday,
their campus resembled the scene of a hostage standoff: Armed
officers wearing black combat pants stood guard atop the roof,
while four patrol cars and uniformed police officers monitored the
grounds, amid video cameras and microphones.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Judd Booker said the show of force was intended to
ease the fears of students and parents who have threatened to keep
their children at home. But it apparently did little to deter the
hoaxers, who issued two more bomb threats during the day. ``Enough
is enough,'' Booker said. ``I mean we have to end this pattern of
every day. We'll do whatever it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the spate of bomb threats began last year, the Camden
County school, situated about half way between Atlantic City and
Philadelphia, was known for little more than its successful
football team, the Rams, which this weekend won the Group Four
state championship.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when the first calls trickled in a year ago, the
temptation was to write off the hoaxes as a symptom of suburban
ennui _ a nuisance, but far more manageable that the guns and
violence plaguing many inner-city districts. But the threats have
persisted for so long and involved so many different students that
even those not given to introspection wonder what has made
Overbrook the bomb threat capital of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Michael Shreiner said the threats did not seem to
be the work of students angered by particular grievances but rather
a snowballing series of pranks that had left faculty members
frustrated and angry. ``We pride ourselves in our teacher-student
contact,'' he said. ``That's what education is all about, teachers
working directly with kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students theorized that the hoaxes were a diversionary
tactic carried out by those who wanted to avoid class.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Rodgers, an 11th-grader who had skipped class to smoke a
cigarette with friends Monday morning, said he hoped the school
would be evacuated again because it was ``perfect bomb-threat
weather.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We sit out there in the field and do nothing,'' he said.
``It's time off from class, and they can't do nothing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But some students said they had grown weary of the disruption.
Karen Abernathy said she had to make up three papers as homework
last week after missing three straight world history classes. She
also complained that the police presence made it harder for her to
skip class.
</P>
<P>
   Booker said the police had had difficulty tracing the calls,
which were made from various pay phones around the county and from
cellular phones. To check students' phone records, officials have
been forced to obtain search warrants, he said. The department has
also relied on undercover surveillance, including stakeouts, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the department has identified dozens of suspects,
largely through other students' informing on them. Booker said two
students were expected to be arrested on Tuesday. But he said the
investigation was being hampered by a lack of witnesses despite a
school reward of $500 for information.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the serious nature of the threats, the authorities
have not turned up any explosives in their searches. The closest
they came was last February, when a fake bomb was found on the roof
of the gymnasium. The device, a plastic packing crate with an
antenna sticking out of it, contained wires sprinkled with
gunpowder, said Principal Paul Harmelin.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the gunpowder was intended to attract
bomb-sniffing dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The incident led to the arrest of two 18-year-old students,
Kevin Matthews and David Ottaviano, who were sentenced to five
years in prison after pleading guilty to causing false public
alarm, said Greg Reinert, a spokesman for the Camden County
Prosecutor's Office.
</P>
<P>
   In other incidents, 12 students, all juveniles, were arrested
last year; they either served probation or paid fines, Reinert
said.
</P>
<P>
   Booker said the police would stay at the school until the bomb
threats died down.

 &HT;    Lowe's uses Home Depot 'blueprint' to compete
 &HT;    By R. Michelle Breyer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the battle over Austin's burgeoning home
improvement market, the lines are being drawn in bright orange and
red.
</P>
<P>
   They are marked on places on the map like North Austin and south
Williamson County.
</P>
<P>
   From its massive warehouse on Research Boulevard, The Home Depot
used to own the market in that part of town.
</P>
<P>
   Then, seven months ago, Lowe's Home Improvement Warehouse opened
just a few miles away at RM 620 and Highway 183.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the two stores are duking it out for the business of
do-it-yourselfers like John Valkenaar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shop at both stores, Valkenaar said recently while walking
into Home Depot. ``I like having a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Across Austin and throughout the country, similar scenes are
playing out in between the aisles of lumber and carpet and
hardware.
</P>
<P>
   As in Northwest Austin, Home Depot and Lowe's elsewhere are
known for opening stores next to each other, like burger
restaurants or gas stations looking to corner a market. They've
been known to copy what works in each others' stores. Sometimes,
they even sue each other for the prime retail spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``All's fair in capitalism,'' said Home Depot spokesman Don
Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot, the Atlanta-based behemoth that pioneered the
warehouse home improvement concept, was the first of the two to
reach the Austin area. It has four area stores already and is
planning others from South Austin to Cedar Park, including one just
a mile from a Lowe's. Nationwide, it operates 742 stores in four
countries.
</P>
<P>
   North Wilkesboro, N.C.-based Lowe's is no newcomer to Texas,
having opened its first store 13 years ago in Tyler. It arrived in
Central Texas in January 1997, with a big store in San Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   It plans to open several more stores in the Austin area,
including stores at the proposed Forum retail center planned at
William Cannon Drive and MoPac Boulevard and in La Frontera, a
shopping center planned at Interstate 35 and RM 1325. Nationwide,
Lowe's has 474 stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see Austin as a strong growth region of the country,'' said
Lowe's spokesman Brian Peace. The two companies face smaller
competitors everywhere _ in Austin they range from local players
like McCoy's Building Supply Centers and Calcasieu Lumber Co. to
bigger companies such as BMC West Corp.'s Stripling-Blake Lumber
Co. Inc. and HomeQuarters, formerly Builders Square. They also
compete with small hardware stores and home improvement departments
of big discounters like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Kmart Corp. But in
the $300 billion home improvement industry, there's no fiercer
battle than the one between Home Depot and Lowe's, which are No. 1
and No. 2 in sales, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, these are the only two companies in the
home center industry that are growing,'' said Daniel Wewer,
managing director of Robinson-Humphrey Co., an Atlanta investment
banking firm.
</P>
<P>
   'Big box' concept
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Lowe's and Home Depot would have seemed unlikely
rivals _ like apples and oranges when it came to home improvement
retailing.
</P>
<P>
   Founded 20 years ago, Home Depot pioneered the ``big box''
concept in the home improvement industry. The idea was to offer
multiple stores under one roof, Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Depot is the innovator in this industry,'' Wewer said.
</P>
<P>
   It worked.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Home Depot had 35 stores. Today it has more than 21
times that number. The company just recorded its 51st consecutive
quarter of double-digit growth, and its astounding stock growth has
made millionaires out of employees and early investors.
</P>
<P>
   For most of its 52-year history, Lowe's sold building supplies
and lumber from stores that were one-tenth the size of its current
100,000-square-foot-plus warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, seeing Home Depot's successes, the company reinvented
itself into a chain of large home improvement stores. Lowe's has
spent the past decade closing and relocating its older stores,
replacing them with the new warehouse format. ``Customers have told
us they want one-stop shopping,'' Peace said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of Lowe's stores has not grown dramatically,
the total square footage that the company operates has jumped
nearly 30 percent over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to increasing the size of its stores, the company
has broadened its scope. While it once concentrated on smaller
markets in outlying areas, it has been moving into major urban
markets in recent years. It has invested more than $250 million in
the Dallas area alone over the past 2 1/2 years, Peace said.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's, which now has stores only as far west as Lubbock, plans
to open more than 100 stores in the Western United States between
1999 and 2003. Last month, it announced plans to buy Eagle Hardware
and Garden, a chain with 32 stores in the Pacific Northwest, Alaska
and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few major differences between Lowe's and Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's sells appliances, from washers and dryers to VCRs; Home
Depot doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The Lowe's in Austin has several aisles of holiday decorations
and gifts; Home Depot sells Christmas trees but has a limited
selection of holiday goods.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot recently launched its Expo Design Centers, home decor
stores aimed at upper-income shoppers; Lowe's has yet to spin-off a
separate store concept.
</P>
<P>
   But except for their names and colors _ Home Depot favors bright
orange, Lowe's likes red _ the chains are almost indistinguishable
from one another to many customers.
</P>
<P>
   They have similar formats, similar product lines, similar
advertising and have roughly the same number of employees per
store. They both carry 40,000 to 50,000 products, with access to
hundreds of thousands more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lowe's used Home Depot as its blueprint,'' said John
Caulfield, executive editor of National Home Center News, a New
York-based publication that tracks the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Both chains say they place a premium on customer service and
innovation. They both offer such services as fax-in orders, how-to
clinics and free computer design services for kitchen remodeling
projects, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   They both also boast about their low prices. Signs at both
Lowe's and Home Depot stores offer customers 10 percent discounts
on products if they find them at a lower price elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   With all the similarities between the two, the choice comes down
to convenience for shoppers like Jeanne Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lowe's is closer,'' said the Cedar Park resident.
</P>
<P>
   At least for now.

 By WARREN E. LEARY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two astronauts became electricians Monday as they
left the shuttle Endeavour and meticulously assembled dozens of
electrical cables to connect the first two sections of the
international space station.
</P>
<P>
   Moving from Endeavour's airlock a half-hour ahead of schedule,
at a little before 5 p.m. ET, two experienced space walkers floated
up the sides of the two-station modules stacked above the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Jerry Ross of the Air Force and Dr. James Newman, a
physicist, ventured into the shuttle's cargo bay for tools and then
hooked themselves up to safety tethers before moving up the space
station modules docked to Endeavour.
</P>
<P>
   While Newman maneuvered up the sides of the modules using
footrests and handholds, Ross moved about the seven-story structure
attached to the end of the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm, which was
controlled from inside by Lieut. Col. Nancy Currie, a former Army
helicopter pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Although their space walk had been billed as one of the most
complicated in the history of spaceflight, the astronauts moved
through their tasks so quickly that NASA Mission Control officials
said they were far ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The space-walking team members appeared in good humor as they
methodically worked through their duties, frequently joking with
each other and laughing as they checked off work completed from
their lists. Taking a moment to look up at the space station
segments looming above, Newman remarked: ``This is sure a beautiful
piece of hardware.''
</P>
<P>
   The astronauts were to connect about 40 cables that will carry
power and data through the space outpost as it grows over the five
years expected for construction.
</P>
<P>
   They began by joining eight connectors from the American Unity
module to a docking adaptor at one end that now connects the unit
to the shuttle. The adaptor will remain with Unity when the shuttle
returns to earth. Then the astronauts installed a permanent safety
wire up the side of the three-story Unity along which they and
future astronaut-builders will be able to slide.
</P>
<P>
   The space walk, the first of three planned for the mission,
comes after Sunday's successful mating of the Russian-made Zarya
logistics module with the American-made Unity connecting module.
After Endeavour, with Unity mounted in its cargo bay, rendezvoused
with Zarya 240 miles above the Earth, Currie used the robot arm to
grab the 40,000-pound cylinder and pull it down to meet with the
American module.
</P>
<P>
   The units together form a seven-story, 35-ton tower perched on
Endeavour's bay, ready to be fitted with the 40 electrical
connections that will allow both modules to operate together with
electricity generated by Zarya's solar power panels.
</P>
<P>
   Newman unclamped each of the connectors, which are attached to
cables 20 to 30 feet in length, and handed them to Ross. Before
putting the connectors together and locking them in place, Ross had
to inspect each end to make sure the tiny pins inside were not bent
or blocked by debris. When the connection were completed, he
attached a protective cover to each joint.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen nations, led by the United States and Russia, are
working together to build the space station, which is expected to
cost between $40 billion and $60 billion. The venture will require
connecting more than 100 major components, hauled into space on 45
shuttle and rocket flights and assembled during 162 planned space
walks, or EVA's, short for extra-vehicular activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first EVA is by far the most critical one,'' Ross, a
veteran of four previous space walks, said in a pre-flight
interview.
</P>
<P>
   After the astronauts complete all of the electrical connections,
space station controllers in Houston and near Moscow were to send
signals to the modules to activate them and to verify the links.
</P>
<P>
   The astronauts also were going to remove thermal covers from two
exterior computers on Unity during the space walk.
</P>
<P>
   On a second space walk, set for Wednesday, the same astronauts
are to install several handrails and footrests on the outside of
the modules. They will also remove the restraints and connectors
that helped hold Unity in the shuttle bay during launching. And
they are to install two antennas for a communications system,
connect more cables and place a sunshade over the Unity computers.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, members of Endeavour's crew of six will venture
into the station for the first time, slowly working its way through
numerous hatches, making sure the pressure and air in each unit are
acceptable before moving on.
</P>
<P>
   Station officials say they should find the insides like the
unfinished interior of a new home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long corridor, basically, that doesn't have a lot of
features from one end to the other,'' Frank Culbertson, operations
manager for the station program, said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   One of the last jobs of this mission will be to transfer
supplies and tools from Endeavour that will be left behind for
future crews.The first crew to use the units will go up in January,
2000, after a Russian service module with living quarters and an
American power array are in place.

 By JUDITH MILLER with WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Iran is scouring the former Soviet Union to hire
scientists who once worked in laboratories tied to Moscow's vast
germ warfare program and has succeeded in recruiting some of them
to take jobs in Teheran, according to Russian scientists and
American officials.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian officials who report directly to the leadership of the
Islamic state have approached dozens of scientists who once made
germ weapons, offering as much as $5,000 a month to people who earn
far less than that a year in the increasingly chaotic Russian
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Russian scientists say that most of these entreaties have been
rebuffed. But they acknowledge that at least five of their
colleagues have gone to work in Iran in recent years. Others have
accepted contracts that allow them to continue living in Russia
while conducting research for Tehran, the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in Russia and neighboring Kazakhstan, more than a
dozen former germ warriors reported contacts with Iran, and two
said they had been asked specifically to help Tehran make
biological weapons. American officials say that many more Russian
scientists have revealed such contacts and believe Iran is
developing a germ arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has powerful reasons to want such weapons and even
expressed interest in acquiring them a decade ago. Most Iranians
believe that Iraq used biological, as well as chemical, weapons in
the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980's, and many countries in the region,
including Israel, Syria and Iraq, are suspected of having germ
arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   Gholamhossein Dehghani, counselor to Iran's mission to the
United Nations, said that many foreign scientists worked in his
country, but were doing only peaceful research. He also stressed
that Iran had ratified a 1972 international treaty banning germ
warfare. He said he ``categorically rejected'' the claim that Iran
is hiring Russian biologists to work on germ warfare. ``We do not
believe that having such weapons increases our security.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Iranian officials have said Iran's research is being
conducted for purely peaceful purposes. But veterans of the Soviet
and American germ programs dismiss such claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's often hard to distinguish between a drug and a weapon, or
between offensive or defensive research,'' said Lev Sandakhchiev,
the director of the state laboratory known as Vector, which made
deadly viruses for weapons in Soviet times. ``What counts is
intent. And that complicates trust.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials say Tehran's recruiting successes are
troubling because they suggest that the people who were crucial to
the once-secret Soviet germ weapons program, which at its height
employed some 70,000 scientists and technicians, are in danger of
being lured away by anyone with enough influence or cash, including
rogue states and even terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   An important figure in the Iranian buying network, Russian
scientists and western officials say, is Mehdi Rezayat, an
English-speaking pharmacologist in Tehran who works directly for
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami as a ``scientific adviser,''
according to his business card, which was provided by a Russian
scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Russians approached by the Iranians say the recruitment style
alone raises suspicions. Visiting delegations, they said, are
sometimes led by Iranian clerics, who wield ultimate power in
Iran's theocracy, and other nonscientists who are studiously
ambiguous about what, precisely, they want the Russian scientists
to do.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Iranians on other occasions have shown particular
interest in learning about microbes that can be used in war to
destroy or protect crops, as well as genetic engineering techniques
that are vital both to legitimate research and to making deadly
germs for which there may be no antidotes.
</P>
<P>
   American officials assert that Tehran's biowarfare program may
have already turned some germs and toxins into weapons, but they
have scant information on Iran's progress. There is direct
evidence, the officials said, that Russia has significantly
improved Iran's missile and nuclear capabilities, but the value of
Russian assistance to biological programs is less clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside assistance is both important and difficult to prevent,
given the dual-use nature of the materials and equipment being
sought,'' the CIA said recently in a report on Iran and its
biological weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   To counter recruiting efforts by Iranians and others, the United
States has quietly launched an effort to become the largest and
best-funded competitor for the allegiance of Russia's former germ
warriors. Washington is sponsoring scientist-to-scientist
exchanges, joint research projects, and programs to convert
laboratories and institutes once associated with the Soviet germ
program to civilian use.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with a modest base of less than $10 million dollars,
the United States expects to spend at least double that sum next
year, trying to keep Russian scientists gainfully and peaceably
employed at home and the countering efforts not only of Iran, but
also of North Korea, Syria, and China to lure biological talent and
technology to their countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a high-stakes game to win the hearts and minds of
Russia's best scientists, who are dangerous simply because of what
they know,'' said Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., who recently visited
former Russian weapons sites now engaged in peaceful research.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Russian scientists who have been courted by Iran describe what
amounts to a fairly predictable recruiting pattern. First, they
say, there is a call, sometimes from a Russian colleague, or a
faxed letter from an Iranian scientist that proposes a visit. Then
there are initial discussions of vague scientific cooperation and
hints of large sums of money.
</P>
<P>
   At subsequent sessions or in follow-up calls, letters and faxes,
specific invitations to visit Iran are issued, and the Iranians
begin discussing their needs more bluntly. Often, they said, the
weapons question is raised through hints and implication.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Persian Gulf war, Russian scientists said,
Iran attempted to recruit Russian biological talent from leading
germ laboratories. The effort largely failed, the scientists said,
and Rezayat and other Iranian agents turned their attention to
smaller institutes.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Gennadi Lepyoshkin, the former director of
Stepnogorsk, a sprawling germ weapons plant in Kazakhstan, said
that he had been approached in 1991 by Iranian middle men who
presented themselves as private entrepreneurs interested in
establishing commercial contacts. ``But their proposals were such
that we immediately declined and ceased contact with them,'' said
Lepyoshkin, whose plant once specialized in developing and
producing anthrax weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say the Iranians' 1997 visit to the All-Russian
Institute of Phytopathology in Golitsino, which is about 30 miles
west of Moscow, was typical of approaches to smaller institutes
involved in the Soviet germ program.
</P>
<P>
   Under communism, the institute made pathogens that would kill
crops, thus starving their enemies. But since the collapse of the
Soviet Union, it has struggled to do purely peaceful research. In
the past seven years, its staff has dropped from 1200 to 276, and
employees are paid only intermittently. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hard times, the institute has become a leader in
pesticide research and in transgenic plants, whose genes are
manipulated to resist certain herbicides, insects and diseases. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, one of its scientists bumped into an Iranian
while visiting a Moscow-based laboratory. The man was Rezayat, and
his business card described him as the director of Tehran Medical
Sciences University's pharmacology department and also as a
scientific adviser to the Office of Scientific and Industrial
Studies of Presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rezayat seemed to have visited most labs and institutes in the
area,'' recalled the Russian scientist, who invited him to come to
Golitsino and meet his colleagues. Eventually, a five-man Iranian
delegation made the trip and met, among others, Yuri Spiridonov, a
crop expert who is now head of the herbicide department.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranians expressed great interest in scientific exchanges
between Russia and Iran, according to Spiridonov.
</P>
<P>
   He told the Iranians he had no objection in principle to such
collaboration. But the delegation made Spiridonov nervous. For one
thing, he said, only half of the Iranians were scientists. ``The
others just sat their with their hands folded and said nothing,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, they asked ``troubling'' questions about
substances related to biological warfare. Spiridonov declined to
elaborate.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``These were not scientific questions,'' he recounted 18 months
later in an interview in that same office.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wary of his guests' intentions and fearful of endangering his
growing ties to Western scientists and companies, Spiridonov
declined invitations to visit Tehran or to discuss his research in
any detail. But three of the institute's other scientists did visit
Tehran, and invitations keep coming _ including another last month.
</P>
<P>
   Rezayat, reached by phone in Moscow on Sunday and asked about
allegations that he was helping to recruit Russian scientists for
germ warfare, said he could say nothing without Tehran's approval.
He added that such claims were both common and spurious. He
promised to seek permission. On Monday, his assistant said that
Rezayat was no longer in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials identify Rezayat as a key official in the
biology branch of an Iranian office that covertly shops for talent
and technology involving nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
It also has responsibilities for public health.
</P>
<P>
   That office, said Ahmad Hashim, a Middle East expert who is a
consultant for the U.S. government, is well known for its
relentless pursuit of expertise and technology in deadly weaponry,
and not just in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are definitely hunters,'' an American official agreed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of the scientists Rezayat courted last year was Valery
Lipkin, a biochemist and deputy head of the Shemyakin and
Ovchinnikov Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The institute, built with Soviet Ministry of Defense funds, used
to do research on vaccines and biological toxins. Though it is
struggling financially, it still has valuable assets, including a
laboratory where advanced vaccines and other biological agents not
designed for military use are tested on animals.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, Lipkin met in the institute's branch in
Pushchino, about an hour outside of Moscow, with a six-man Iranian
delegation that included Rezayat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Iranians seemed to defer to a senior cleric in a black
turban and flowing robe, the Russians said.
</P>
<P>
   His name was Mahmoud Hosseini and his business card in Russian
identified him as the general secretary of the Iranian Society's
Office of Scientific-Technical Cooperation with the Russian
Federation, based in Tehran. The Iranian embassy in Moscow said
that Hosseini was a diplomat who held the title of first secretary
for Economic Affairs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The meeting went well, Lipkin said in an interview at his
sprawling Moscow headquarters, though some things struck him as
odd.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said the mullah, though well educated, was not a scientist.
And though the Iranians spoke of possible exchanges of students and
technology and seemed willing to pay handsomely for them, the
delegation was vague about what it wanted.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing they repeatedly asked about,'' said Sergei Feofanov,
Lipkin's deputy, ``was human genetic engineering.''
</P>
<P>
   In germ weaponry, the prospect of targeting human genes is the
most chilling possibility of all, military experts agree. In
theory, genetic engineering could produce ethnic weapons that kill
or cripple selectively by race and nationality. Such developments,
if they are possible, would be years away.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 18 months, the Iranians made three visits to the
Shemyakin institute, Lipkin said. But they never responded to his
offer to train Iranian students in Russia. Instead, they bombarded
the institute with invitations to younger researchers, asking them
to come to Tehran for a year or longer to teach genetic engineering
and other advanced techniques.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was also a personal invitation faxed to Lipkin from Abbas
Keshavarz, deputy chief of a research organization in Iran's
Agriculture Ministry. It invited him to visit Iran to discuss
possible ``future collaboration.'' A copy was sent to Rezayat's
office.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to discuss weapons,'' said Lipkin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``So I kept pressing them, `What will I do in Tehran? What is my
program?''' Lipkin said. ``But they would not tell me. And that
made me nervous. For while they were cautious here, had I gone
there, I think they would have raised weapons and other
inappropriate topics.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lipkin said that before refusing the offer, he had sought advice
from a friend at the Russian Ministry of Science, who warned him
that an Iranian visa in Lipkin's Russian passport would not enhance
his prospects of cooperation with American scientists _ especially
if the trip was sponsored by Rezayat.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Iran has succeeded in attracting several Russian biologists to
Tehran, said colleagues who, in recent interviews, named them. One
is said to be Valeri Bakayev, a senior biologist at the Institute
of Medical Biotechnology in Moscow who accepted a teaching post in
Iran more than seven years ago, one colleague said. A spokesman for
the Moscow institute said she had no idea where Bakayev had gone
after leaving his post.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another scientist said that Vladimir Rishinski, an expert at the
Institute of Molecular Biology, recently took a second
leave-of-absence to go to Iran for two months of teaching. His
institute, which a former senior Soviet official said conducted
research in biological weapons, said he was ``on leave'' for an
``extended vacation,'' that did not involve Iran. But his mother,
reached by phone, said her son was in fact in Iran.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another Russian scientist said that during a visit to Tehran
last year he encountered three former colleagues from the Institute
of Biological Protection in Moldova who had already been in Tehran
for about six months. They described the working conditions they
had left behind in Moldova. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me their institute had neither heat nor electricity,
never mind money for salaries or research,'' the scientist
recalled. ``Russian scientists may not trust or like Iranians,'' he
added. ``But these are not love matches. They are marriages of
convenience, and often, of necessity.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is now known that the Soviet Union built the most
pestilential biological arsenal of all time. At the program's peak,
Russian and Western experts say, scientists at scores of sites
studied some 50 biological agents and prepared a dozen or so for
war. Bombers and intercontinental missiles were ready to
disseminate hundreds of tons of smallpox, plague and anthrax,
enough to wipe out entire nations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many of these biological agents were developed and tested at
Vector, formally the State Research Center of Virology and
Biotechnology, which made deadly viruses in Siberia; the State
Research Center for Applied Microbiology, or Obolensk, near Moscow,
where lethal bacteria were perfected and Stepnogorsk, a sprawling
germ factory in Kazakhstan, which specialized in deadly anthrax.
</P>
<P>
   This proud scientific elite was part of a culture that had a
deep historic distrust of Islamic regimes, which threatened to
undermine the Soviet empire. Thus, any current Iranian successes
are all the more striking.
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of Soviet Communism, these scientific
centers, as well as far smaller ones, have seen their operating
budgets slashed and research money disappear. But institute
directors say they have fought to keep their top scientific talent
intact, dismissing junior scientists and technical workers instead.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even top scientists have been tempted to sell their
expertise. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Igor Domaradskij, a founder of the main Soviet program to make
germ weapons, lives in a spacious apartment in a fashionable part
of Moscow, a reminder of the special privileges and status he once
enjoyed as director of the anti-plague institutes in Irkutsk and
Rostov-on-Don and later, a key figure at Obolensk.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But his doorbell consists of two wires that must be twisted
together to ring, and his preoccupation with earning a living is a
theme of the ``The Troublemaker,'' his memoir of his years as a
germ warrior. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Domaradskij, 73, said he lives off his pension and his savings.
And he is fortunate in having a computer and e-mail that connect
him to scientists outside Russia. But he disclosed in his book that
he was so desperate for work in 1992 that he offered his services
to China, Russia's longtime rival, as well as to the Kalmyk
Republic inside Russia. Neither responded, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economic chaos, which worsened with the collapse last
August of the ruble, has taken a huge toll on nearly all of the
institutes once lavishly funded by the biological bureaucracy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Obolensk, one of the top former centers, lost 54
percent of its staff between 1990 and 1996 but only 28 percent of
its top scientists, according to the institute's figures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prospects may seem better almost anywhere else to the scientists
at institute after institute, who work wrapped in layers of
sweaters in unheated buildings and get no pay for months on end.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Like everyone else, we're just trying to survive,'' said
Eugeniy A. Nepoklonov, 42, the director of Narvac, an animal
vaccine company founded in 1990 which employs some 50 scientists,
many from the former weapons program. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Narvac, with $3 million in total sales, is testing a vaccine
against hog cholera that would be Russia's first
genetically-engineered animal vaccine. The laboratory has great
hopes for the product, if it can survive Russia's economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government has sent mixed signals about the Iranian
overtures.
</P>
<P>
   In May of 1997, Moscow went so far as to sponsor a biotechnology
trade fair in Tehran. More than 100 leading biologists from Russian
institutes that once were part of the germ-warfare program,
including Vector and Obolensk, the two most prominent facilities,
participated as guests of the Islamic republic.
</P>
<P>
   And President Boris Yeltsin has kept in senior civilian
biotechnology posts several key military figures from the old
Soviet germ program, some of whom are openly hostile to the growing
cooperation between American and Russian scientists. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has embraced the Clinton Administration's programs to
forge closer ties between American and Russian scientists even as
it allows some institutes to strike commercial deals with Iran. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vector for example, has been permitted to sell diagnostic kits
for hepatitis to Iran. But the institute has refused Iranian
requests for broader technological cooperation or the exchange of
dangerous strains, according to American officials and
Sandakhchiev, Vector's head.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very fine line between good and bad dealings,'' he
said, ``which is why I am concerned about the challenge of
bioterrorism.'' &QL;

TYSON PREPARES FOR COMEBACK FIGHT IN JANUARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ Mike Tyson has come to the desert to
reconstruct his boxing career he shattered a year and a half ago
when he bit Evander Holyfield's ears during a championship bout and
subsequently had his license revoked in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is preparing for a Jan. 16 bout against the South African
Francois Botha _ his first fight since his June 18, 1997, nightmare
with Holyfield. Tyson has a new boxing adviser and a new trainer as
he works to end his 16-month layoff, his longest since he served
three and a half years in an Indiana prison for a 1991 rape
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   His legal troubles have continued even as he has been preparing
for this fight. Last week Tyson pleaded no contest to two charges
of misdemeanor assault against two men in Maryland, stemming from
an Aug. 31 auto accident after which he punched one man and kicked
another. Tyson's lawyers had already reached an agreement with the
men to avoid civil action.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is concentrating now on his fights in the ring. He is
still a powerful puncher, as he demonstrated when he buckled a
sparring partner Monday afternoon with a short uppercut. His hand
speed is still there, and he was working his jab effectively and
putting punches together the way his new trainer, Tommy Brooks,
wants him to.
</P>
<P>
   The final verdict will come when Tyson, who is 45-3, faces the
30-year-old Botha in Las Vegas, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson said he had not followed the heavyweight division since he
had been out of boxing and said he had watched few bouts in any
division, though he liked the featherweight Prince Naseem Hamed. He
said he did not know what his presence would mean for the sport.
But he knows that he needs this fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get my life stabilized,'' Tyson said in an hourlong
interview, his first since his boxing license was reinstated.
``I've been a real jerk. I don't know how my wife has been able to
stay married to me. She's such a dignified woman, who isn't used to
the kind of stuff I've put her through. Maybe she's been too
embarrassed to leave me. Maybe she loves me too much to leave me. I
don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I feel like I need to do something to justify myself and
to apologize in some way. To me, justification means giving her
security. I can do that by fighting.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet Tyson cannot escape his troubled past. He had to register
with the local police as a sex offender to comply with state law.
</P>
<P>
   That is one result of his rape conviction. And Tyson's plea in
the Maryland case could result in an Indiana judge's revoking his
probation in the rape case. But, after discussions with his
lawyers, Tyson said he was not worried about the prospect of having
to go back to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Tyson is immersed in preparations for Botha. In his
corner now are Shelly Finkel, his boxing adviser, who once managed
Holyfield, and Brooks, who was Holyfield's co-trainer until he
moved here a month ago to work with Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, a mild-mannered trainer, has been hired to reshape
Tyson, who is 32 and has not won a fight in more than two years.
Brooks has schooled under trainers like George Benton and Lou Duva
and, besides Holyfield, has worked with Pernell Whitaker and the
up-and-coming heavyweight Michael Grant. Brooks said there was
enough raw material to make Tyson a champion again.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson got this opportunity when the Nevada State Athletic
Commission voted on Oct. 19 to restore his license. His first
comeback fight, with Botha will be formally announced Tuesday in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   He is already at work here in a Scottsdale gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working on basic fundamentals, getting back to where he
used to be,'' Brooks said before Tyson went through his afternoon
workout Monday. ``He wasn't putting his punches together. He was
depending upon his power way too much.''
</P>
<P>
   A family portrait of Tyson, his wife, Monica Turner, and their
three children _ 1-year-old Amir, 2-year-old Rayna and 9-year-old
Gena _ is one of the few personal touches that Tyson has in the
spacious living room of his rented home in North Scottsdale, which
looks out on a golf course.
</P>
<P>
   He does have other trappings of his life as an athlete who has
made millions of dollars _ there are Harley-Davidson motorcycles, a
Mercedes, a Land Rover and a Ferrari in the garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it here, because I can start brand new,'' Tyson said as
he rode in his black Mercedes to a workout.
</P>
<P>
   Finkel and Brooks are part of the new team. Tyson has sued his
former promoter, Don King, and his former managers, Rory Holloway
and John Horne, claiming breach of contract. He alleges that they
skimmed 50 percent or more of the $130 million in purses he earned
in six fights that he had after he left prison in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He said in the interview that he did not particularly want or
need much money but just wanted ``some security for my family.''
Yet his lawyers have said that Tyson is financially troubled
because the Internal Revenue Service has placed a $13 million lien
against his three homes, so a fight would greatly benefit him.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson acknowledged contradictions in himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all creatures of contradiction,'' he said. ``Everybody
wants to be loved. It's just that we all have different definitions
of love. My definition is more of a responsibility to the people
that I care for.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said, ``People get the wrong perception of me,'' and
added: ``People judge me with their eyes. If they had the chance to
get to know me, to touch me, maybe they would think differently
about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Perceptions of him were intensified in October when the Nevada
commission released a series of psychological evaluations of Tyson
conducted by six psychologists and psychiatrists at Massachusetts
General Hospital in Boston. The Nevada commission had requested the
evaluations as a condition of his being considered for
reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that although Tyson suffered from
depression and anger, he was mentally fit to fight. One doctor said
he could not predict whether Tyson would lose control in the boxing
ring again _ that he was susceptible but could manage and control
his anger with continued therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the former heavyweight champion Larry Holmes
questioned Tyson's heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know,'' Tyson said, ``he's never been known as an
insightful mind reader. I love the sport. The sport just doesn't
love me.'' &QL;

COMMENTARY: DOUBLE-DECKER BUZZ _ FAY WRAY LIVES THERE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Once again, it's the time of year when New Yorkers
find themselves pushed into the gutter by hordes of tourists
filling the sidewalks of mid-Manhattan. You are probably now
expecting a long rant on how they should all go home and let us
walk our streets in peace. Sorry to disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   No, this holiday season comes with a smile button and an ``If
you can't beat 'em, join 'em'' attitude. Last weekend, it meant
riding around with lots of nice out-of-towners on several of the
red double-decker tour buses that you see all over.
</P>
<P>
   Many New Yorkers hate those buses, considering them intrusive,
traffic-snarling polluters. Maybe they are. But you should try
riding on top of a double-decker, face in the breeze, especially in
the weirdly warm weather of late. There are few more pleasant ways
to get acquainted with New York's kaleidoscope of neighborhoods and
hear their virtues acclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe all the terrible things about the subways, said a
guide for New York Apple Tours, the biggest and most visible of the
city's double-decker services. It was music to a New Yorker's ears.
``I assure you,'' he said, that the subways are safe (true, true)
and clean (not so true, but lovely to hear).
</P>
<P>
   ``And it is the oldest subway system in the world,'' he told the
folks from the hinterland.
</P>
<P>
   Say what?
</P>
<P>
   Even a fellow who increasingly has trouble remembering what he
had for breakfast knew off the bat that this one could not be
right. Didn't London's system open in 1863, 41 years before New
York's? In the United States, didn't Boston's come first, in 1897?
</P>
<P>
   It was time to pay closer attention.
</P>
<P>
   On that ride, and others taken with both New York Apple and Gray
Line tours, one learned many things, including these:
</P>
<P>
   The 1993 terrorist bombing at the World Trade Center killed 65
people. Frank Sinatra came from Jersey City. Fay Wray never made a
movie after King Kong set her down atop the Empire State Building
in 1933. George Washington went to Fraunces Tavern in 1789 to
celebrate the end of the Revolutionary War. The cheapest rent in
Manhattan is $2,000 a month. Jerry Seinfeld spent nearly $10
million for his apartment on the Upper West Side.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Brooklyn has 3 million residents. Henry Hudson sailed up
the river named for him in the 16th century. Nelson Rockefeller was
New York's governor in the 1940s. The Brooklyn Bridge opened in
1893. And 40 percent of New Yorkers work in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Fascinating details, except for one thing. Not one is remotely
true.
</P>
<P>
   Don't misunderstand. Most of the information in the guides'
endless chatter was correct. And no one expects infallibility
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But the sheer volume of error became somewhat oppressive in the
hours spent on the buses. That was particularly true of New York
Apple, outshone by Gray Line when it came to accuracy and to a
sense of the city as something more than just a place where Donald
Trump, Bruce Willis, Demi Moore and other celebrities romp. (The
only thing a New York Apple guide could find to say about Marble
Collegiate Church was that Ivana and the Donald ``tied the knot''
there.)
</P>
<P>
   Hayim Grant, New York Apple's president, said his guides must
pass a test given by the city, and they receive an 80-to-90-page
script written by his company and updated regularly. ``All that
having been said,'' he acknowledged, ``it's physically impossible
to control everything that they say. We try to make sure that
everything they say is accurate, but it's difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   No one can accuse the guides of lacking enthusiasm. They were
friendly, and often entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   But where did they come up with a cockamamie ``fact'' like 65
people being killed at the World Trade Center? (The death toll was
six.) Or that 40 percent of New Yorkers work in New Jersey (when
the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says that 92 percent work in
the city)?
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Fay Wray made dozens of movies after ``King
Kong.'' The Revolutionary War ended in 1783, when Washington went
to Fraunces Tavern to bid farewell to his troops. Manhattan
apartments can be found for well under $2,000 a month, though they
are getting scarcer. Jerry Seinfeld reportedly paid $4.35 million
for his apartment. The Brooklyn Bridge opened in 1883, and
Brooklyn's population is put at 2.5 million. Rockefeller was first
elected governor in 1958, and Hudson did not find his river until
the early 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   As for Frank Sinatra's coming from Jersey City, that by
coincidence is the name of the interim business administrator of
that city's school district. But a dozen hats will be bought and
eaten if the guide meant him and not you-know-who from Hoboken.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see, what else?
</P>
<P>
   Tony Randall lives eight blocks south of where one guide put
him. The Frick Collection is in the former mansion of Henry Clay
Frick, not William Frick. Herald Square is not named after the
founder of The New York Herald Tribune; there was no Mr. Herald.
</P>
<P>
   The number of eighth-graders who took the admissions test for
Stuyvesant High School in the last academic year was 11,397, not
6,000, and 850 were admitted, not 200. Harlem has 5 percent of the
city's nearly 2 million African-Americans, not 15 percent. No
matter what one tour guide might think, the British had no tanks in
Battery Park. ``Cats'' opened in 1982, not 1983 (OK, that's a
quibble).
</P>
<P>
   It is more than a slight exaggeration to point to the Plaza
Hotel and say, ``They have some rooms going for $17,000 a night.''
While the Presidential Suite does go for $15,000 a night, that is
it. Plaza officials say nothing else is more expensive than a
$2,200 three-bedroom suite.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, that is high enough. But one aim of the tours seems to
be to shock visitors into believing that everything in New York is
outsized and that, as the Jersey City school administrator might
say, if you can make it there, you'll make it anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   It will be left to others to debate whether Greenwich Village is
``the culinary capital of New York,'' and whether the best seafood
restaurants are at the South Street Seaport, and whether the best
shopping is on Fifth Avenue or in SoHo (with no mention of Madison
Avenue). Smith &AMP; Wollensky may or not be the city's best
steakhouse, as claimed, but are we really to believe that ``it's
where the celebrities and the diplomats who stay at the Waldorf
usually have dinner''?
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the errors and hyperbole bounced off the
out-of-towners without their seeming to notice, like Spaldeens off
a stoop. A woman from southern Illinois was typical. All she cared
about were the sights, she said, not the factoids. She had a point.
The idea was to enjoy the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe next time, the tour guide can be persuaded to stop by
Gracie Mansion. Always did want to see where she and George Burns
lived.

   NEW YORK _ The doubleheader, almost passe in baseball, remains
alive and well in opera. Nevertheless, audiences accustomed to
``Cav'' and ``Pag'' are in for something different when Gustav
Holst's ``Savitri'' is paired with Leonard Bernstein's ``Trouble in
Tahiti'' for three performances, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday, by
the Manhattan School of Music Opera Theater. Holst's 30-minute
opera, composed in 1908-09, is based on a Sanskrit text taken from
the ``Mahabharata.'' It deals with a woodman, his wife and death.
Bernstein's 45-minute work, composed in 1952, depicts a day in the
deteriorating marriage of a suburban couple.
</P>
<P>
   Riparian Rites
</P>
<P>
   Contortionists, acrobats, jugglers, aerialists and illusionists
are coming to the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark
beginning Wednesday when the Cirque Ingenieux, out of Hollywood,
Fla., opens an eight-performance run through Sunday. With
choreography combining ballet, gymnastics and Broadway, music by
Kitaro and a story that transports a little girl into a dream
world, Cirque Ingenieux mixes entertainment traditions of the Old
World and the New.
</P>
<P>
   Postal Note
</P>
<P>
   The new Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh would like delivery of a
letter sent in the 13th century. The letter, written by the
Scottish hero William Wallace, whose life inspired the Academy
Award-winning 1995 film ``Braveheart,'' was recently discovered in
Lubeck, Germany. Written in Latin after Wallace's victory over the
English at the Battle of Stirling Bridge in 1297, it notifies the
people of northern Germany that Scotland is free from the ``power
of the English'' and invites them to reopen trade routes through
Scottish ports.
</P>
<P>
   Marking Time
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Though doubters may have proliferated recently,
winter is on the way. Paul Winter's 19th Annual Winter Solstice
Celebration at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine offers Uilleann
pipes, Irish pennywhistles and flutes, and classical guitar in
welcoming the season with three performances, Thursday through
Saturday. At Symphony Space on Broadway at 95th Street, 75 singers,
dancers, musicians and children and Ralph Lee's puppets will
celebrate with Scandinavian music, folk tales and carols in five
performances on Friday through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And for the third consecutive year at 8:56 p.m. on Dec. 21, the
moment of the solstice, Japanese bamboo flutes played by musicians
in kimonos and led by the instrumentalist and composer James
Nyoraku Schlefer will observe the changing of the seasons in a
performance at St. Mark's Church at Second Avenue and 11th Street
in the East Village.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was not so very long ago _ before women routinely
entered the work force _ that college was sometimes billed as a
place where they went to earn their ``M.R.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Ancient history. Today, the very thought that anyone should talk
about college as preparation for marriage appalls many students.
</P>
<P>
   So when some Barnard College students discovered recently that
one of the college's brochures boasted that graduates of women's
colleges were more likely to marry and have children than women
graduating from co-ed colleges, they took offense.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints that followed have led the college's
administration to agree to revise the brochure, which is sent to
parents of prospective applicants.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to those who saw the brochure as stereotypical, some
students saw the statement as a sign that the college did not value
lesbians as much as other students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a slap in the face,'' said Sandra Chefitz, a Barnard
senior and religion major from Chicago. ``It suggested that Barnard
is not any more proud of its gay students than the University of
Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Herbert, an English major from Buffalo and president of
Lesbians and Bisexuals in Action at Barnard, said she was not
surprised to find Barnard trying to convince parents that the
college was safe for their daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marriage in our culture is seen as the pinnacle,'' she said.
``There is a stigma attached to women's colleges, a stereotype that
they produce unshaven, unmanageable, unruly women, or women who
become lesbians.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Herbert said she had put up posters to alert other students
about the brochure and discussed the matter with the dean of
admissions. She and Ms. Chefitz then began circulating a petition
demanding that future brochures delete the line, which she said
reflected an ``unfounded fear that attending an all-women's college
will inevitably result in lesbianism or spinsterhood.''
</P>
<P>
   As a protest gained momentum, the admissions dean met again with
students. The following morning _ last Thursday _ college officials
agreed to revise the brochure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, what the brochure was addressing was that with
women's colleges, if it's not one stereotype, it's another,'' said
Judith Shapiro, Barnard's president. ``The real message we want to
send is that women can have it all. They can have satisfying work
lives and satisfying personal lives, and their satisfying personal
lives can come in many different varieties.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnard officials said the brochure was put together eight or
nine years ago and relied on figures from the Women's College
Coalition, which is based in Washington.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When Peter Bevis first laid eyes on her, she was in
sorry shape. Once the sleek, silvery queen of Puget Sound, she was
washed up, literally. Beached in a muddy Alaskan cove, she had
suffered the ignominy of becoming a shrimp-processing plant, and
now the rusty, rotting vessel wasn't even good enough for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the minute I walked inside, I just found myself grinning
from ear to ear,'' Bevis recalled. ``I said to myself, this thing
is just too cool to be cut up for scrap. She's coming back to
Seattle. She has to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   So began the return odyssey of the ferryboat Kalakala, which was
launched to great fanfare here in 1935 and served for 32 years
thereafter, plying the waters of the sound with distinctive touches
that included a futuristic design out of Buck Rogers, a
double-horseshoe lunch counter and a ballroom with chandeliers and
orchestra pit.
</P>
<P>
   The Art Deco-style Kalakala was saved by the obsessive
decadelong quest of Bevis, a sculptor who was working as a
commercial fisherman when he encountered the ferry. Bevis was
supported by preservation societies around the world, including the
Art Deco Society in New York, which called the vessel ``a unique
Depression-era work of art'' in a letter imploring the fishing town
of Kodiak to spare it from a salvager's torch.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Kalakala finally did come back home to Seattle
last month after a 16-day journey from Alaska, escorted by three
tugboats and ringed by the sprays from fireboats, it was clear that
this battered old hulk had touched a powerful nostalgic nerve in
this city that so often seems to be rushing headlong toward a
hyperwired future.
</P>
<P>
   Water is everywhere around Seattle and, long before there was
Microsoft and a Starbucks on every other corner, there was a strong
maritime tradition. A state ferry system still knits together
dozens of communities, and thousands of people in the Puget Sound
region commute to work every day via ferry. For years, the Kalakala
was a symbol of Seattle, and as crowds of people have turned out to
take a look at the ferry, now tied up at Pier 66 downtown, the
memories are flooding back.
</P>
<P>
   ``My late parents danced aboard the Kalakala in the '30s,''
wrote Marilyn Harnish in the visitors' logbook. ``I was delighted
to walk where my parents walked and danced so many, many years ago.
What fun they had!'' (While the ferry was primarily used for
commuters on the 45-minute trip between Seattle and Bremerton, it
also did moonlight cruises.)
</P>
<P>
   Another visitor, Brock Robison, recalled: ``Winter of 1950,
foggy early morning, was in front of my beach house as fog lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was the silver bird Kalakala'' looming before him, he
wrote. ``Incredible!''
</P>
<P>
   Corinne Welfelt had a very special attachment to the Kalakala _
she was born aboard it, on June 11, 1942. The vibrations aboard the
boat, she explained, apparently sent her mother into a slightly
early labor.
</P>
<P>
   The future of the 276-foot-long Kalakala, which is pronounced
kah-LOCK-ah-lah and means ``flying bird'' in the language of the
Chinook Indians, is still uncertain. Although visitors have
thronged to it and Mayor Paul Schell has spoken enthusiastically of
proposals to tie the boat up permanently as a floating monument
near historic Pioneer Square, there is the matter of money.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the more than $1 million spent on the effort to return
the Kalakala has come from Bevis, 45, who has lavished his life
savings and a small inheritance from his uncle on the preservation
effort. He is so attached to the boat that he is now living aboard
it with his springer spaniel, Lucy.
</P>
<P>
   But estimates for refurbishing the ferry and turning it into an
attraction with restaurants, stores and a historical display range
from $5 million to $20 million or more. Furthermore, Bevis and the
board of the nonprofit Kalakala Foundation are decidedly lukewarm
to the idea of selling the boat to a commercial investor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not for any one person to own,'' said Bevis, a bearded
bear of a man, as he offered a tour of a vessel that is so rusty in
places, it almost seems to have been dragged up from the ocean
depths. ``It's a piece of the city's history.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation has been getting donations, including a recent
gift of $100,000, and Bevis seems possessed with an almost mystical
belief that the Kalakala will become so beloved that it will
actually generate revenue some day, which he hopes the foundation
will be able to lavish on artistic and cultural projects elsewhere
in the city.
</P>
<P>
   As he conducted the tour, Bevis sorrowfully described the
changes forced upon the vessel during its shrimp-processing days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides of the car deck were over here, but they were
changed to walk-in freezers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even in its damaged state, the streamlined Kalakala is
clearly a remarkable craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a beautiful ship, inside and out,'' Bevis said. Pointing
to a circular staircase, he said: ``Now you can see where Boeing
engineers got their idea for the upper deck of the 747.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Bevis returned from an ocean fishing trip and
first set foot in the craft, in 1988, he rushed over to the Kodiak
town hall, trying to find out if he could claim the boat. ``I still
had halibut guts in my beard,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He finally persuaded Kodiak officials, who were seeking bids to
get rid of the ferry anyway, to sell it to him for a dollar. When
he showed up this summer and took the dollar out of his wallet, the
Kodiak city manager told him: ``Keep the money. You're going to
need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bevis and friends and volunteers chipped and blasted 350 tons of
concrete out of the ferry from its shrimp-plant days, took other
steps to make it seaworthy and eventually were on their way to
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   And Bevis said he was optimistic about the ferry's future, as
well as his own. ``I just have this attitude about the whole
thing,'' he said. ``If you're good to the Kalakala, she'll be good
to you.''

 &HT;    Appeal filed on behalf of elderly man in 1975 murder case
 &HT;    By Pat Moore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STUART, Fla. _ Attorneys for the brother-in-law of the late
Robert F. Kennedy, filed an emergency appeal Monday trying to block
the elderly Hobe Sound man's court-ordered appearance Friday
morning before a grand jury in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Circuit Judge John Fennelly last month ordered Rushton
Skakel Sr., 75, to testify before the grand jury investigating the
1975 murder of a teenage neighbor in which his sons are suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Fennelly found Skakel healthy enough to travel after hearing
testimony Nov. 10 from Skakel's wife, priest and psychiatrists that
he exhibits bizarre and eccentric behavior, including
``belly-bumping'' strangers, picking food from other people's
plates in restaurants and frequently using expletives.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut police identified Skakel's sons, Thomas and Michael,
as suspects shortly after 15-year-old Martha Moxley was found
beaten to death with a golf club that belonged to their late
mother. Both have denied involvement in the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   No one was ever charged in the crime, which has been the subject
of three books _ including Murder in Greenwich by former Los
Angeles police detective Mark Fuhrman _ and a television
miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel's attorney, Richard Lubin, returned to Fennelly's court
Monday, asking him to suspend his order directing Skakel to testify
Friday or be held in contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
   Fennelly said he would not delay Skakel's court-ordered
appearance beyond 5 p.m. Thursday and suggested Lubin file an
emergency request with the 4th District Court of Appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The one-man Connecticut grand jury, Superior Court Judge George
Thim, began investigating the case in June, a month after Furhman
theorized Michael Skakel killed the girl in a jealous rage after
seeing his older brother kissing her.

WILL FANS SHOW UP TO HELP NEEDY PLAYERS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A group of elite professional players and
super-agents gathered in an opulent Manhattan meeting room Monday
to discuss the object of their announced relief effort: the needy
and disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
   But their remarks had less to do with Unicef than their own
plight. The stars and agents continued a pattern of public missteps
by discussing the desperate state of some National Basketball
Association players who have become financially strapped during the
five-month lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Blurring the definition of needy, the agents David Falk and Arn
Tellem announced that a group of Olympic Dream Team members _ with
the notable exception of Michael Jordan _ will ask fans to pay
$1,000 for courtside seats when they converge on Atlantic City Dec.
19 for a game to benefit two charities: Unicef and cash-poor NBA
players.
</P>
<P>
   Although the game's participants, like Patrick Ewing, will not
be paid for their appearance, part of the net proceeds will be set
aside in a trust fund for NBA players in need. Not only is the fund
aimed at those making the minimum $275,000, but financial support
could also go to players who have made millions but have failed to
save their fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the majority of people playing professional
sports, after they finish playing, there are not a lot of them
financially secure,'' Ewing, the union's president, said. ``They
make a lot of money, but they also spend a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans may not be sympathetic, but players argue that there is
more to their expenses than fancy cars. As Karl Malone put it, ``I
have 26 nieces and nephews, and Uncle Karl is Santa Claus all the
time, whether there is a lockout or not; and that's just the
reality of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice said, ``People make bad judgments, bad investments and
things like that. And you have guys who are young who make bad
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   A panel of union members and executives is expected to be
established to review each hardship case.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is, some players did not prepare for a long lockout.
Few believed that the labor dispute, which is centered on how
owners and players should divide $2 billion in annual revenues,
would last long enough to jeopardize the season. Perhaps within the
next two weeks, the league could decide to cancel the season. With
no new meetings scheduled, the situation appears bleak.
</P>
<P>
   If the game is a hit, that will mean a feather in the caps of
Falk and Tellem. Both agents have talked about the potential of a
new league if the season is canceled. To many, this game is a trial
balloon to that end.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the opportunity presents itself for a new league, at some
point, if the lockout continues and the season is ultimately
canceled, that's going to have to be considered,'' Tellem said.
``At this point, the focus of this announcement is that this game
is to help players who need help, and it's also to give basketball
to the fans and to help charities such as Unicef.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the event expect to generate at least $1 million
in proceeds, with a projected $100,000 to $200,000 going to Unicef
and a remaining portion of the net proceeds going to the player
fund. So far, 13 players are committed to play. A total of 16
players are expected to participate from the four Dream Teams: the
1992 and 1996 Olympic teams and the 1994 and 1998 world
championship teams.
</P>
<P>
   These players are expected: Ewing, Malone, Rice, Vin Baker, Tom
Gugliotta, Anfernee Hardaway, Tim Hardaway, Allan Houston, Reggie
Miller, Alonzo Mourning, Gary Payton, Mitch Richmond and Dominique
Wilkins.
</P>
<P>
   The game will be played in the 17,000-seat convention center.
Although ticket prices will range from $25 to $1,000 for courtside
seats, there will be no view of Jordan on the court. Curtis Polk,
who works with Jordan's agent, Falk, said Jordan declined to
participate because he did not want to send ``a mixed message to
fans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael feels that he needs to stand by his earlier statements
that he's still deliberating on whether he wants to come back and
play or not,'' Polk said. ``He wants to see a resolution of the
lockout before he makes that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan would have been the main draw for the charity event. As
it is, fans will most likely see a dunk-fest played with lots of
offense and little defense. Thus far, fans have shown little
interest in organized exhibition games. A game in Miami on Friday
drew just 2,000.

 McGUIRE'S 70th HOME RUN BALL TO BE AUCTIONED  
(nk) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ Mark McGwire's historic 70th home run
ball will be put up for bidding early next month by Guernsey's, an
auction house in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The ball was hit into the stands in St. Louis by McGwire on
Sept. 27, the final day of a regular season in which McGwire, with
70, and Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs, with 66, both broke Roger
Maris' record of 61 homers, hit in 1961. Guernsey's will also
auction the available balls for home runs 61 through 69 hit by
McGwire and Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's 70th was retrieved by Philip Ozersky, a 26-year-old
scientist at the medical school at Washington University of St.
Louis
</P>
<P>
   ``They know how to pull off an auction of this size,'' Michael
Freedland, the Fort Lauderdale attorney who represents Ozersky,
said Monday of Guernsey's. ``And they're going to do an online
auction simultaneously.''
</P>
<P>
   After more than two months of sifting through offers, Ozersky
decided to opt for the auction rather than accept other offers.
Three collectors, represented by St. Louis attorney Alan Cohen,
offered $1 million for the ball.
</P>
<P>
   If the ball does not attract a minimum price at auction _ which
Freedland declined to divulge _ Ozersky can retain rights to it.
But it appears as if $1 million is the threshold for a winning bid.
</P>
<P>
   Freedland estimates Ozersky has received more than 500 inquiries
about the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The ball has been sitting in the St. Louis Cardinals' Hall of
Fame for about two months, and was marked with synthetic DNA to
make it certifiably identifiable.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is scheduled to be at a news conference at Trump Tower in
Manhattan on Tuesday to announce the availability of the home run
balls and to confirm his intention to sign his most important ones.

TALE OF THE (VIDEO) TAPE FOR JETS ON THE DAY AFTER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ In what Vinny Testaverde described Monday as
``a magical season,'' one highlighted by his sleight-of-hand,
referee-aided touchdown in the final moments of Sunday's game, the
Jets found themselves needing only one more victory to guarantee
their first playoff spot in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   But even more than locking up a wild-card slot in the playoffs,
a victory over the Dolphins in Miami on Sunday night would also
position the Jets favorably to capture their first division title
since 1969, ending a dry spell longer than any other team's in the
National Football League. If the Jets can beat Miami, they would
need only one victory in their final two games _ either over the
Buffalo Bills on the road, or at the Meadowlands against the New
England Patriots _ to finish first.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, even only one victory against this final threesome
would propel the Jets into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   How the Jets got to this position _ and they haven't had a
chance to vie for first place this late since 1986 _ continues to
be a subject of controversy. There was no question Monday, based on
television replays, newspaper photos and comments from NFL
officials, that Testaverde did not get the ball over the goal line
on a fourth-down, do-or-die quarterback sneak from the Seattle
Seahawks' 5-yard line with only 20 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   But the game officials ruled that he did, and as a result it
became the dramatic winning touchdown in a 32-31 victory over the
Seahawks that left the Jets at 9-4 on the season and tied for first
with Miami in the contentious American Football Conference East.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde himself said Monday that after the game, on the ride
back to his parents' home on Long Island, he replayed in his mind
what happened. He was trying to figure out what the head linesman
Earnie Frantz had seen that led him to signal, without hesitation,
a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde's conclusion: ``I had been bobbling the ball. ...
Since I didn't have possession when I went down, I was able to
recover it and got it over the goal line.''
</P>
<P>
   And Coach Bill Parcells' opinion of all this?
</P>
<P>
   Monday, he asserted that he still hadn't seen the replay. ``I
don't watch TV very often,'' he said. ``I read books when I'm
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells conceded he did, however, view the Jets' tapes of the
game, shot from the end zone and the sidelines. These are filmed
for the benefit of the coaching staff and players and are different
from the television tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't tell from our tapes,'' Parcells said. Then, his
voice rising as he considered what some people believe to be a gift
victory, he added: ``I've been on the other side of it, too. I'm
not saying anything about it _ last year we voted for replay.
There'll be another outcry for it now, and there already is.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, who never formally complains to the league about
officiating, added: ``They're not taking the game away from us.
They're not giving us the game back in Detroit last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets lost that season's finale when a victory would have
pushed them into the playoffs. On an obviously wrong call in that
game, the officials ruled that Bryant Westbrook had intercepted a
Leon Johnson halfback-option pass in the end zone. Replays showed
Westbrook was still juggling the ball as he stepped out of bounds
and that the interception should not have counted.
</P>
<P>
   If Sunday's event was payback without replay, it still leaves
Parcells with some concerns. He said he didn't know just how
seriously injured his starting left cornerback, Aaron Glenn, was
with a sprained ankle, or how bad defensive end Anthony Pleasant's
hip strain was. Fullback Keith Byars also suffered a broken arm in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have been remarkably injury free this year _ three
starters had missed a total of seven games _ but now, in only one
game, three first-stringers had potentially serious injuries.
Parcells said he would not disclose the availability of the three
players until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells also said that he was concerned about the Jets' ability
to hold up to the mental challenge of a stretch run in which the
Jets will play three straight tough division games.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things you worry about right now is the energy to
sustain, because they haven't been in games like this before,''
Parcells said. ``I told them after Sunday's game, `Hey, fellas,
this is what it's going to be like.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Only one current player, Mo Lewis, has ever been to the playoffs
as a Jet, and that was in his rookie season of 1991. Parcells has,
however, brought in players with significant playoff experience,
such as Curtis Martin, Pepper Johnson, Byars and Bryan Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells recalled that after Sunday's game, Johnson told him,
``We needed a game like this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what he meant,'' said the coach. ``He didn't mean the
comeback. He meant the chaos, the high pressure on every play,
where every call can win or lose a game.''
</P>
<P>
   There will also be a taxing physical component to these last
three games. The Jets will arrive back home next Monday at 4 a.m.
after their game in Miami. But they will be leaving four days later
for a Saturday afternoon game against the Bills. They will, though,
get an extra day of rest for their regular-season finale against
the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   There is uncertainty as to what will happen to the defensive
lineup if Glenn cannot play. Does Parcells take Ray Mickens out of
the nickel package, where he is performing at a high level, and
make him a starter? And what kind of replacement would Jerald
Sowell be for Byars, who has the fourth-highest number of
receptions on the Jets (26) along with three touchdowns? And if
Pleasant cannot play, would the Jets go to a 3-4 defense?

   NEW YORK _ George Mitchell, the former senator who was
instrumental in arranging the Northern Ireland peace agreement in
April, is going to spend some time in Queens, and not just the time
it takes to get from an airport into Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do a lot of that,'' he said Monday, but next spring he will
stay in Queens long enough to preside over a conference on the
peace agreement. He is joining the faculty of Queens College and
will have two titles: senior fellow at the Michael Harrington
Center for Democratic Values and Social Change, and visiting
professor in international studies.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had issued invitations for the conference last week,
while he was in Dublin. ``I think we'll have a very good
representation of people who were at the table,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Deluxe Hybrid for a World Tour
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sahara Desert and the streets of New York are the worst
conditions we're going to face,'' Jim Rogers, investment banker and
author of ``Investment Biker'' (Random House, 1994), said.
</P>
<P>
   He was bumping along 50th Street between Eighth Avenue and
Broadway Monday at the wheel of a $500,000 Mercedes-Benz
convertible sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, a convertible sport utility. The high-riding lemon-yellow
car was designed by a former Mercedes executive, Gerhard Steinle,
who said the design took shape when his telephone rang and the
voice at the other end said, ``I'm Jim Rogers, and I need a sports
car to drive around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinle married the outside of a Mercedes-Benz sports car to the
inside of a sport-utility vehicle to enable Rogers to drive across
mountains and deserts on his three-year round-the-world trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The millennium was coming up, and I thought, nobody documented
the last one,'' he said. ``In the year 3000, I'll be in big demand
on the talk-show circuit, if I can find a cave to hibernate in
until then.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, he tried to drive from a Mercedes dealership at 41st
Street and 11th Avenue to the Grand Hyatt Hotel, on 42nd Street
next to Grand Central Terminal. ``I hope you don't mind if I drive
gingerly,'' he said as the car rolled off the showroom floor and
into the street. ``The last thing I want is a smashup before the
car even gets to the boat.'' The car is scheduled to leave
Wednesday for Iceland, where Rogers will pick it up _ and drive off
_ next month.
</P>
<P>
   On the West Side Highway, he had to pull around a Honda Civic
that stopped at a check-cashing store across the highway from the
Passenger Ship Terminal. His car was a head-turner, though nothing
that happened Monday matched what happened when he and Steinle
drove it from California to Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``A California highway patrolman stopped us,'' Rogers said. ``He
wanted to take a photograph of the car. A Texas Ranger stopped us.
He wanted to photograph the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Sticking to Soaps
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee may not want to
hear this.
</P>
<P>
   There are people out there who do not want to sacrifice their
daily diet of Luke and Laura for whatever the committee has to say
about Bill and Monica if impeachment hearings begin. Soap Opera
Digest is already distributing T-shirts that say, ``Don't impeach
the President if it interrupts my soaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Bonderoff, the magazine's online director, said the idea
for the T-shirt came from comments from diehard fans. ``We were
responding to the frustration we sensed from visitors to our site
and readers of the magazine,'' he said, ``who tell us on an ongoing
basis that they're unhappy with constant news pre-emptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonderoff, 52, remembers how frustrating the Watergate hearings
were in 1973. ``At that point in time,'' he said, using a Nixonian
phrase, ``when shows were interrupted for substantial portions of
time, a lot of story lines got totally disrupted.'' But he insisted
that the T-shirt was nonpolitical.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend not to discuss politics on our message boards,''
he said. ``They just don't want interruptions.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ What goes around comes around. But it
sure has been a large, sweeping curve for Steve Elkington.
</P>
<P>
   Elkington was Australia's own long before Houston could claim
him as a favored son. The former University of Houston star may
have perfected his skills on the practice field next to Hofheinz
Pavilion. But the guts of his game were constructed on Australian
turf, the same turf on which Elkington joins the international team
this week for the Presidents Cup against the U.S. squad.
</P>
<P>
   Elkington is back home, even though he's a few hundred miles
down the road from where he grew up. Being back in Australia for
Elkington is sort of like getting back to Texas for a Texan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be great for me,'' Elkington said before he
departed Houston for the 24-hour ordeal required to get to
Melbourne from Houston. ``I'll spend a lot of time in Wagga Wagga,
which is about halfway between Sydney and Melbourne. I've got lots
of Wagga people coming down for the Presidents Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   And a lot of family and friends he'll be visiting while Down
Under.
</P>
<P>
   Elkington went to his homeland more than a week before the start
of Presidents Cup festivities. He took his family and visited with
his parents and a lot of friends near Sydney. He did not play in
the Australian Open, which was in Adelaide.
</P>
<P>
   There are a million stories Elkington could tell about his
boyhood home and growing up in Australia. But one sort of sums up
his youth. It is told in Elkington's book, Five Fundamentals, and
captures the essence of what Australia was like for Elkington.
</P>
<P>
   The story is told by Peter Kennedy, who caddied for Elkington in
his first professional tournament, the Tasmanian Open in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were walking down the fairway, and Steve asks me, `Did you
play cowboys and Indians when you were a kid?''' Kennedy remembers.
``And I wondered, `What the hell kind of question is that?' I
didn't answer him right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``So he asks me again, and I said, `Of course I did. Every kid
does.'
</P>
<P>
   ```Not me,' he says. `All I remember is hitting a golf ball.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When Steve won the PGA Championship, he gave me a picture of
himself holding the trophy, and on the picture he wrote: `Cowboys
and Indians was never my game.'''
</P>
<P>
   That story, which came after Elkington already had been a
two-time All-American and helped UH to two NCAA championships,
gives plenty of insight into Elkington's adolescence. He would ride
a train, sometimes eight hours each way, to meet the man who would
later become his coach, Alex Mercer, and play golf in tournaments
or just for practice.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ``coach'' would be the wrong word for Mercer.
Elkington shies away from using terms such as guru or coach, but
Mercer probably is Elkington's closest confidant on matters of golf
and pretty much anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Elkington, who turns 36 today, visited with Mercer at length in
the week leading up to the Presidents Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to Alex all the time from the States, and sometimes
golf will be 90 percent of the conversation,'' Elkington says.
``Other times, golf won't even come up.''
</P>
<P>
   To say the least, Elkington is thrilled about the opportunity to
play a major golf competition in his homeland. He believes it will
be a hugely successful event in Australia, and also an eye-opener
for people around the world about how important golf is on his
continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all sold out, which is great,'' Elkington says. ``It's by
far the best array of players we've ever had in Australia at one
time. And the fans down there really are fanatical. They've seen
all these players before, whether it's on television or whatever.
But this time, they're all together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Melbourne is one of the best golf towns in the world. A lot of
clubs in America are proud about celebrating their 30th or 40th
anniversary. We've got clubs in Melbourne that have been there for
100 years or more. Royal Melbourne is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Elkington says the historical perspective that Australians have
will be both a blessing and a curse for them this week as they try
to root for their native heroes _ Greg Norman, Elkington and Craig
Parry _ but also have to be supportive of players from Fiji (Vijay
Singh), South Africa (Ernie Els), Japan (Shigeki Maruyama) and
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Australia, we've got lots of historical milestones that
Americans don't understand,'' Elkington says. ``We've had matches
against New Zealand and South Africa in cricket and rugby that are
just like the 'Horns playing the Aggies in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm worried about is whether it might be hard for all the
fans to get behind us as a team. Greg (Norman) obviously will be
the anchor of our team. He's the No. 1 guy in Australia. I'll
probably be the No. 2 anchor, not because I'm the second-best
player but because I'm from Australia, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've got players from many different countries on our
team. It would be nice if our fans can get a common thread and pull
together for us, and I think they will.''
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured, they will be as excited to have one of their main
homeland heroes back in Australia as Elkington is to be there.

 &HT;    Council rejects controversial ban; most members say they support
its goals
 &HT;    By Alfred Charles

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta City Council on Monday rejected a
controversial proposal to ban new drive-through windows in the city
even though most members said they supported the proposal's goals
to reduce air pollution and create a more pedestrian-friendly city.
</P>
<P>
   The 8-5 vote to keep drive-throughs capped nearly an hour of
debate about the proposed ordinance, which had been offered by
Councilman Lee Morris as a way of getting the city to rethink its
dependence on automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 50 years, we have promoted auto-dependent policies,''
Morris said. ``And we have dirty air, traffic congestion, an unfit
population and global warming as a result.''
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, representatives of the industries that would
have been the most affected by the Morris legislation _ fast-food
restaurants, banks and dry cleaners _ declared victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased with the vote and confident it will hold,''
said Anna Copello, vice president of the Hospital Authority Credit
Union, the credit union for Grady Memorial Hospital that has a
drive-through window.
</P>
<P>
   But Copello said the industries would be willing to work with
city leaders if they decide to attack the problem through its
zoning rules, as some council members suggested. During the debate,
some members said the ban would send drive-through businesses to
the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Others said the move would unfairly burden new businesses that
would not have drive-throughs while their older competitors did.

CHRISTMAS TREE SALES DROOP IN WARM WEATHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Canada)  (lb) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Christmas trees are a harder sell this year.
</P>
<P>
   The vendors who arrive the day after Thanksgiving to turn the
city's sidewalks and corners into oases of evergreen are battling
an unseasonable enemy: freakishly warm weather. Simply put, it is
hard for buyers to think of Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   That, combined with the effect the strong U.S. dollar has had on
depressing the price of Christmas trees from Canada, could
ultimately mean lower prices on the street, though no seller wants
to suggest that yet.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas tree prices now run from $10 for a tiny balsam fir to
$200 for a towering Fraser fir. But some sellers said they are
ordering cheaper balsams _ costing $20 or less for a 6-foot tree _
earlier than usual to spur the flat sales. Normally, these would
come toward the end of the season to attract people who want the
trees for only a week or two.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to lackluster sales, tree sellers have also had to
deal with another weather-related problem: Some trees that would
normally have been naturally refrigerated by December's chill are
beginning to shed their needles before leaving the street.
</P>
<P>
   With the weather expected to turn colder, sellers are hoping
that tree sales will pick up as the holiday nears. But so far, the
season has been less than merry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're down, everyone in the city is down in numbers,'' said
Pippa Snook, who for the seventh year is selling trees on city
sidewalks, the third year at her present location on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're selling a few trees, but it ain't so much,'' said Martin
Paulson, standing in front of his temporary boreal forest on 86th
Street.
</P>
<P>
   In Greenwich Village, Michele Pominville said, ``We haven't seen
the Christmas spirit we've been looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Dejan Jesic, a nine-year veteran of tree-selling, said vendors
generally agree that the overall business is down about 20 percent
compared with past years at this time. He said there is also a
consensus that sales will have to increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone who usually has a tree will have one sooner
or later,'' Jesic said. ``At the end of the season, sales will be
the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Such optimism is the official position of the National Christmas
Tree Association, which has been nervously conducting nationwide
sales surveys. But until the official results are in from last
weekend, traditionally the high point of the four-week selling
season, no one will know for sure whether the balmy weather will
ultimately have an impact on the final tally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so unusual, I don't really know how to gauge it,'' said
David Stenger, the association president, who owns a tree farm in
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, street-corner Christmas-tree sellers have also
been hurt by the big chain stores, such as Home Depot and Wal-Mart.
They buy trees from farmers early in the season, warehouse them and
then offer them for as little as $16 as a special bargain.
</P>
<P>
   The overall Christmas-tree market has changed fundamentally over
recent decades, as more people have chosen artificial trees.
According to Gallup Polls commissioned by the Christmas tree
association, the proportion of natural trees has shrunk from 90
percent of households with trees in the 1960s to 46 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of natural trees bought each year has not changed
appreciably, staying fairly constant at around 35 million, as the
total number of households has doubled.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The relevant calculus from the buyer's perspective is this: The
number of tree buyers has not changed, but the number of trees has
increased as tree farming has allowed much more efficient
production.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the low value of the Canadian dollar compared with
its U.S. counterpart means that importing Canadian trees is
especially cheap compared with buying domestic trees.
</P>
<P>
   Growers, particularly Canadian ones, are hurting. ``There are
just too many trees,'' said Randall Mailman who harvests 20,000
trees a year from his Ran-Mac Farms in Chester, Nova Scotia. ``I've
got my whole life in this farm and I'm going to end up selling
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another grower, Robert Sanders in Midland, Ontario, said the low
Canadian dollar means that for a tree priced wholesale at $15
Canadian, he gets only $10.25 U.S., compared with $12 in most
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has always been a price advantage,'' he said. ``But this
year, there's an extreme advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether this helps New Yorkers depends on what happens on
the streets between now and Christmas. Many retailers make it clear
that they don't want to cut prices. From this perspective, bad
weather _ or at least certain types of it _ could help. Last
Saturday, sales were briskest during a morning rain storm. ``New
Yorkers love to buy trees in the rain,'' Ms. Snook said. ``It's the
next best thing to snow.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesic said the problem this year is that there has been no snow
_ not even the quickly melted sort _ to lodge in people's
consciousness as a sign that the Christmas season is here. Last
year, he said, it snowed on Nov. 27 and 28. ``That got people in
the spirit early,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few buyers said Monday that most people have it all
wrong by not buying in warm weather. ``This is very pleasant,
actually,'' Mary Lisa Burns, a modern-dance teacher, said. ``I'm
not fighting the crowd, I'm not frozen and I have time to discuss
Christmas trees.''

EDITORIAL: THE PRESIDENT WITHOUT A PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Tuesday, Dec. 8:
</P>
<P>
   Between them, the White House and the House Judiciary Committee
seem determined to have a constitutional collision. An act of
leadership by the Republicans' designated speaker, Robert
Livingston, could avoid the impending crisis, but Livingston does
not appear to have the stuff for it. The other way to avoid it
would be for President Clinton to start behaving like a president
instead of a criminal defendant. Over the next two days we will see
whether Clinton has the stuff for that.
</P>
<P>
   We are not full of hope. Clinton's apparent plan for presenting
his defense is to have his lawyers drape his shabby conduct and
cover-up lies in the same threadbare legalisms we have seen before.
At least 14 witnesses and the White House lawyers to whom Clinton
has delegated the shaping of his legacy will argue that his
misdemeanors are too low and common to warrant impeachment. They
will also argue that his lying under oath fails to rise to the
level of perjury. It is just regular lying that happened to take
place after Clinton gave his solemn oath.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we should not be surprised. This president, after all,
quibbled with the committee's assertion that he is the nation's
chief law enforcement officer. But even if he will not admit to
that, why would he prefer the indignity of impeachment to a censure
deal that would salvage for him the small measure of honor inherent
in an unhedged admission of wrongdoing?
</P>
<P>
   The president's failure to take the lead in seeking a censure
deal can be excused but not satisfactorily explained by his fear of
a perjury indictment. The Democratic leadership and a handful of
Republican moderates have repeatedly signaled a willingness to
search for a way to limit Clinton's legal exposure in return for a
public admission that he lied under oath. But we have a White House
legal team that in the absence of strong presidential leadership is
conducting a shifting, situational defense that plays into the
impeachment machinations of Tom DeLay, the Republican whip.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to believe, as we do, that the evidence so far
does not warrant impeachment and still see Clinton's approach as
making the worst of a bad situation. The charges from Kenneth
Starr, the independent counsel, are not going away. The written
answers that Clinton filed to the Judiciary Committee's 81
questions inflamed the hard-liners and alienated the Republican
moderates Clinton will need to defeat an impeachment vote in the
full House. The public interest still demands a forceful entry in
the historic record censuring Clinton and recording his admission
of failing in his constitutional duty to the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   So far the leadership that would get the nation to that goal is
missing both in Congress and in a White House where the president
seems committed to the tactics of delay while his reputation is
shredded to the last scraps.

AT LUNCH WITH NEAL GABLER: LIFE AS A LONG STARRING ROLE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In what Neal Gabler smilingly calls his unified field
theory of American culture, his new book portrays the United States
in an age of post-reality, a Republic of Entertainment increasingly
devoted to indulging the fantasy lives of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Costumed in Ralph Lauren colonialist garb, slenderized in health
clubs, body-sculptured by plastic surgeons and coached on lifestyle
by Martha Stewart, ordinary Americans, he says in ``Life the Movie:
How Entertainment Conquered Reality'' (Knopf), are appropriating
the trappings of celebrity to carve out prime roles in their own
life movie.
</P>
<P>
   In the fame-driven future he envisions, everyone will be
anonymous for 15 minutes, but Gabler, looking every bit the
cultural critic (Armani black, stubbly salt-and-pepper whiskers),
doesn't seem overly worried. ``Anyone who writes seriously about
American culture is not in danger of becoming a celebrity,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gabler, the author of books on Walter Winchell and
Hollywood, does not protest when lunch is arranged at Jean Georges
on Central Park West. It is, after all, a locale in Woody Allen's
new movie, ``Celebrity,'' featuring Judy Davis, Kenneth Branagh,
Joe Mantegna, Leonardo DiCaprio, Melanie Griffith, Bebe Neuwirth,
Winona Ryder, Gretchen Mol, Isaac Mizrahi, Erica Jong, Anthony
Mason, Andre Gregory, Donald Trump, Donna Hanover and Joey and Mary
Jo Buttafuoco.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, or fortunately, none are in sight this lunchtime
as the 48-year-old Gabler settles onto a banquette and, forgoing
wine as too enervating at midday, orders a sparkling water.
</P>
<P>
   ``If by my theory the movie never ends,'' said Gabler, ``right
now we're doing the interview scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary American culture may be the first in history to
permit its citizens to live entirely within their own manufactured
realities, said Gabler, citing the social historian Daniel J.
Boorstin. Increasingly, Gabler said, Americans are altering their
lives to conform to their movie fantasies, whether it means
shopping in entertainment zones or vacationing on entertainment
farms or retreating completely into richly fabricated
cyberidentities on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Where once movies were judged by how closely they approximated
life, now life is rated by how closely it conforms to the movies.
Even celebrity criminals from Timothy McVeigh to the Unabomber,
Theodore Kaczynski, and John Lennon's assassin, Mark David Chapman,
seemed consumed by how their acts would play for a movie-addicted
society, Gabler said.
</P>
<P>
   News, too, he said, is increasingly packaged as entertainment,
with wars and presidential crises getting pithy rubrics (``Crisis
in the Gulf,'' ``White House Under Siege'') like movie titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always thought that politics and economics are the crucial
forces of our time, but entertainment is the most inexorable force
of the 20th century,'' Gabler said, lofting a morsel of
chevre-and-salmon mousse in a pastry shell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We export it and the world eats it up. It's the best
hunger-satisfier that man has ever devised.''
</P>
<P>
   Wondering if anything could resist this force, he said, he
thought that perhaps Tibetan monks might be immune. But when Gabler
said he ventured that thesis to a friend involved in Tibetan
causes, the man laughed. He had once run into the Dalai Lama at the
Formosa Cafe, a landmark movie-star haunt in West Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   A waiter arrives with tureens of spicy carrot soup with shrimp
and ceremoniously whisks off the lids. ``In the Republic of
Entertainment, all are equal,'' Gabler said, eyeing the starring
dishes. In the life movie, places celebrities go become celebrities
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   And what about him? Wasn't he a player in the life movie too?
Gabler did not deny it. ``To describe this and not implicate
yourself is to be duplicitous,'' he said. ``There's no way you can
theorize and say you're not in the movie.'' But at least, he said,
he was acknowledging it.
</P>
<P>
   His life is hardly in the limelight, however. He lives with his
wife and two daughters, 11 and 14, year-round in Amagansett, N.Y.,
venturing into Manhattan only intermittently. He runs seven miles
each morning and spends most of his day closeted with his writing,
including a forthcoming biography of Walt Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Waiters arrived bearing platters of halibut and clams. Gabler
ordered another sparkling water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life the Movie'' follows his two books on popular culture,
``An Empire of Their Own: How the Jews Invented Hollywood'' (1988)
and ``Winchell: Gossip, Power and the Culture of Celebrity''
(1994). The latest book grew out of an essay he wrote, ``Now
Playing: Real Life, the Movie,'' for The New York Times Arts &AMP;
Leisure section in 1991. He waited until he had finished the
Winchell book and then spent three years on ``Life the Movie,'' two
years longer than he had expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is ever short in my movies,'' he said, likening his
life, too, to a film. ``They're like `Lawrence of Arabia.''' His
method is to read omnivorously and keep voluminous notes on index
cards, one thought to a card. That way, ``as Hitchcock said, by the
time you start to shoot the film, it's done,'' Gabler said, as the
fish course gave way to venison.
</P>
<P>
   Gabler traces the rise of entertainment culture to the nation's
beginnings and an affinity for lowbrow amusements. ``Trash was
deliberate,'' he said. ``Americans were literate. They chose trash
because it was a glorification of the democratic impulse.''
</P>
<P>
   So this is bad, right? Not necessarily, Gabler said, calling his
ambiguity the most wrenching part of his survey. In an abrupt
turnabout at the end of his book, written amid a continuing
yin-yang internal debate, he declines to condemn the trend, citing
studies that have found ``positive-illusionists'' to be in better
mental health than realists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't live without illusions,'' he said. ``If a person can
help himself by buying Ralph Lauren pants and Martha Stewart
makeovers, what's wrong with that?'' He derided what he called an
old Marxist mantra: ``You don't know how bad you have it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, ``there is something to be said for
the grief and suffering we go through. Life is traditionally
defined not by how pleasant it is but what Isaiah Berlin called
`the grit in the oyster.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still he said, as the meal ended with a pear sorbet and sliced
pear, chocolate balls and coffee, ``life in which you approximate
your dreams is not a bad life.''
</P>
<P>
   He anticipates a happy twist to his life movie, too, he said, a
scene in which a filmmaker options his book for a documentary, to
be called, perhaps ``Life the Movie, the Movie.''

EXCERPTS FROM RENO'S NOTIFICATION ON SPECIAL COUNSEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (With FUNDRAISING-RENO, FUNDRAISING-RENO-ASSESS) 
(mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from Attorney General Janet
Reno's notification to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit on Monday that she would not ask the court to
appoint an independent counsel to investigate the campaign finance
actions of President Clinton:
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 8, 1998, I notified the special division of the
initiation of a preliminary investigation involving President of
the United States William Jefferson Clinton and others. The
preliminary investigation has now been concluded, and I have
determined there are no reasonable grounds to believe that further
investigation is warranted of allegations that the President or any
other covered person violated Federal criminal law in connection
with D.N.C.-financed political advertisements during the 1996
election cycle. I find by clear and convincing evidence a lack of
the knowing and willful criminal intent required for criminal
prosecution of the statutes involved here, and conclude that
established departmental policy requires the Department of Justice
to defer to the Federal Election Commission (F.E.C.) under the
circumstances of this case. Therefore, no independent counsel need
be appointed....
</P>
<P>
   Whether these advertising expenditures were attributable to the
campaign committees such that they violated the F.E.C.A.,
P.P.M.P.A.A., or P.E.C.F.A., [the Federal Election Campaign Act,
the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account Act and the
Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act) turns in the circumstances
of this case on whether the advertisements referred to a clearly
identified candidate and contained an electioneering message. The
audit division found, among other things, that the advertisements
met these tests and accordingly constituted contributions to and
expenditures by the campaign committees in violation of the
referenced statutes.
</P>
<P>
   The department's preliminary investigation has focused on two
issues: (1) determining whether the President and Vice President
were sufficiently involved in or exercised sufficient control over
the D.N.C. issue advertising campaign as to be potentially
criminally responsible for the violations found by the audit
division; and (2) if so, determining whether the President and Vice
President acted with the requisite ``knowing and willful'' mental
state....
</P>
<P>
   As the head of the national party, the President, and to a
lesser extent the Vice President, had the ultimate authority to
sanction the issue advertisement campaign. They both were actively
involved in the ongoing campaign, including raising the money to
finance it, formulating the political strategy the advertisements
were intended to advance, and reviewing and commenting on the
advertisements themselves. Based on these investigative results, I
conclude that these facts sufficiently established the involvement
of the President and Vice President in the issue advertisement
campaign as to make them potentially liable, were there criminal
violations of the applicable statutes involved here....
</P>
<P>
   With respect to my consideration of the intent element of a
potential criminal offense under the Independent Counsel Act, I may
conclude that no further investigation is warranted based on a
finding that the subject lacked criminal intent only if there is
``clear and convincing evidence'' that the covered persons lacked
the state of mind required for the violation of criminal law
involved. In reaching my conclusions here, I have considered the
evidence of intent under this high standard.
</P>
<P>
   The potential criminal violations under consideration here all
require a ``knowing and willful'' mental state. This means that a
violation amounts to a potential crime only if there is an
intentional violation of a known legal duty. As a result, the
preliminary investigation has focused generally on the President's
and Vice President's knowledge of the law and specifically on any
legal advice they received as to the legality of the D.N.C. issue
advertisements. I have concluded, based on the uncontradicted
statements of the principal participants in the advertising
campaign, together with substantial corroborating documentary
evidence, that the President and Vice President were advised that
the issue advertising campaign was lawful and that lawyers were
reviewing every advertisement to insure full compliance with the
law. In addition, there is no affirmative evidence suggesting in
any way that either the President or the Vice President ever
harbored a subjective belief that they were violating the law or
that the legal review undertaken by D.N.C. and Clinton/Gore counsel
was insufficient. I conclude that these facts establish clearly and
convincingly that the President and Vice President lacked the
requisite specific intent to violate the law.

EDITORIAL: MS. RENO UNDERMINES JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Tuesday, Dec. 8:
</P>
<P>
   One of the sorriest episodes in modern Justice Department
history has concluded with another demonstration of Attorney
General Janet Reno's obstinacy. For the third time in a month, she
has refused to hand her department's anemic investigation into
President Clinton's 1996 campaign abuses over to an independent
counsel. Both the FBI director and Justice's top prosecutor for
campaign finance urged her to appoint an independent counsel under
the part of the law allowing an attorney general to avoid conflicts
of interest. Although she is mired in conflict, Ms. Reno decreed
that no one would be appointed to investigate whether her boss
illegally used ``soft money'' to support his re-election. Congress
now has a duty to demand an inquiry run by someone not beholden to
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Her action was based on her finding that Clinton did not
``knowingly and willfully'' violate the law because he allegedly
acted based on his lawyers' advice. Clinton is entitled to assert
that his lawyers let him do it. But Ms. Reno is too compromised,
and perhaps too hostile to the independent counsel statute, to look
at the president's behavior objectively. The decision should be
based on an examination of Clinton's actions, not just his excuses.
In 1996 he boasted at fund-raisers that he would get around
spending limits by using Democratic Party soft-money accounts to
pay for television ads designed to promote re-election.
</P>
<P>
   If it were possible to escape investigation simply by citing
lawyers' advice, countless defendants would have marched free
through that loophole. In fact, Ms. Reno is arrogating to herself
legal judgments about the president's intent that should be the
province of an independent outsider. For two years her tactics have
centered on dividing up the 1996 fund-raising abuses into slices,
and then ruling that each slice is too trivial to investigate. But
faced with the most reckless White House spending in a generation,
she had to invent the new excuse that Clinton could ignore the law
because his lawyers gave him a pass.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, looking at the same behavior, the staff and counsel
of the Federal Election Commission found that both Clinton and Bob
Dole, the Republican nominee, broke the law. That finding was
right. Ms. Reno should have seized on it to ask for an independent
counsel. Instead, she virtually invited the Federal Election
Commission members to toss it aside. Under Janet Reno the United
States has a Justice Department that chops off the legal process
when necessary to protect her political sponsors. Soon she will
make an unlamented exit to Florida, but the disgrace will linger
over the department she has compromised.

RUSSELL RETIRING AS CENTRAL NEWSPAPERS INC. CHAIRMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Duplication warning: Story moving in news and financial
categories)   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES KELLY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Frank E. Russell, 78, a low-key but forceful executive
who led the parent corporation of ``The Arizona Republic'' to
robust growth in an era of modern technology, is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Russell, chairman of the board of Central Newspapers Inc., will
step down at the end of December after 39 years with CNI.
</P>
<P>
   The corporation also operates ``The Indianapolis Star'' and
``The Indianapolis News,'' as well as other newspapers and
enterprises in Arizona, Indiana and Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the growth of the company, it was Frank's
fine and quiet hand that was always steadily on the helm,'' said
CNI President and Chief Executive Louis A. Weil III.
</P>
<P>
   Russell served as a trusted counselor to CNI founder Eugene C.
Pulliam. After Pulliam died in 1975, Russell shaped CNI into a
competitive, publicly owned corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank was the pilot who guided the SS Pulliam through a very
difficult passage to a promising future,'' said Phoenix lawyer
Richard Mallery, a longtime friend of Russell's.
</P>
<P>
   Russell will continue as a key overseer of the trust that
controls CNI and of a charitable trust begun by Pulliam's widow,
the late Nina Pulliam. He will remain a CNI director.
</P>
<P>
   A genial man with a sharp business mind, Russell called on his
training as an accountant and lawyer in serving the newspaper
company.
</P>
<P>
   His stewardship helped keep the Pulliam newspapers on firm
financial ground, and in recent years, his behind-the-scenes
leadership contributed to CNI's growing profitability.
</P>
<P>
   CNI stock recently traded at $68 a share, and had traded at more
than $76, up from $21 when the corporation went public in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Russell, who always maintained a low profile, said last week
that his philosophy has been ``to step back far enough so that the
good people you've hired can do their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Weil described Russell as a keen observer, someone who listens
to the ideas of the people who work for him and backs them up. An
ex-Marine, Russell values and exhibits loyalty, Weil said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a decision is made, he's there to support you all the
way,'' Weil said.
</P>
<P>
   Though devoted to business, Russell never forgets how to have
fun, said Marge Tarplee, former corporate secretary for CNI who
retired in 1994 as head of the CNI Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Russell is an avid golfer and ballroom dancer and loves to
socialize with CNI employees, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said I never knew anyone who worked harder or played
harder than Frank Russell,'' Tarplee said.
</P>
<P>
   Russell will continue in his role as one of three trustees of
the Eugene C. Pulliam Trust, which has voting control of CNI. The
other trustees are Weil and Eugene S. Pulliam, executive vice
president of CNI and publisher of ``The Star'' and ``The News.''
Eugene S. Pulliam is Eugene C. Pulliam's son.
</P>
<P>
   Russell also will help distribute grants to charities in Phoenix
and Indianapolis as one of the three trustees of the $380 million
Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust. The other trustees are
Russell's wife, Nancy, and Carol Peden Schatt.
</P>
<P>
   Among his accomplishments at CNI, Russell pushed the adoption of
cutting-edge technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republic'' has emerged as one of the most technologically
advanced newspapers in America. It was one of the first and largest
newspapers to be completely paginated, meaning that all its
elements _ text, graphics, photos and advertisements _ are composed
with computers during the production process.
</P>
<P>
   Though Russell has embraced the computer age and the growing
field of online journalism, he said he believes the traditional
newspaper will never become obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think there's always going to be a place for the
printed page,'' Russell said. ``I think we have to do everything we
can to complement the printed newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell got involved in the newspaper business almost by
accident after having tried out other careers.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Kokomo, Ind., on Dec. 6, 1920, he graduated cum laude
with a bachelor's degree from the University of Evansville in
Indiana in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, he served in the Marine Corps, and was a
first lieutenant when discharged in 1945. In 1946, he earned a
certificate from the International Accountants Society in Chicago
and in 1951, graduated with a juris doctor degree with honors from
the Indiana University School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   He worked for the George S. Olive and Co. accounting firm and
was later vice president of Spickelmier Industries, Inc., a
diversified construction business in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, he decided to apply for a job as business manager of
CNI and ``The Indianapolis Star'' and ``News.''
</P>
<P>
   After a two-hour interview with Eugene C. Pulliam in an
Indianapolis hotel room, Russell decided he wanted the job and
Pulliam decided he wanted to hire him.
</P>
<P>
   He was business manager until 1977, when he became vice
president and general manager of CNI, then moved to the presidency
of CNI in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Russell retired as president and CEO of CNI in 1995, and then
became chairman of the board.
</P>
<P>
   He said his greatest accomplishment with CNI was handling the
original public offering of CNI stock in 1989, conducting a
three-week selling trip to all the principal financial centers of
the U.S. and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The stock available sold out, a market value for it was finally
established, and the demand was so great that half again as much
could have been sold, Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   His other major accomplishments were closing out Eugene C.
Pulliam's estate without straining corporate finances and bringing
modern, professional management to CNI.
</P>
<P>
   Weil said that through it all, Russell's devotion to CNI
employees has been paramount. He noted that a friend of Russell's,
newspaper publisher and former Marine Gen. Victor ``Brute'' Krulak,
used to say there are only three rules of leadership, and each one
is ``Take care of the troops.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Frank has followed that to a fault,'' Weil said.
</P>
<P>
   Russell said his retirement will give him and his wife a chance
to travel more and will allow him the opportunity to play more golf
and possibly to explore Civil War battlefields, which have
fascinated him for years.
</P>
<P>
   But his new role won't remove him from the communities of
Phoenix and Indianapolis, where he and his wife maintain homes.
</P>
<P>
   Russell has been involved in civic activities in both cities,
including past service on the board of the Arizona Community
Foundation and work on the board of the Phoenix Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Russell puts as much of himself into his work with the zoo as he
does with his business, and does so with gentlemanly grace and
attentiveness, said Jeff Williamson, executive director of the
Phoenix Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a trustee you can always count on,'' Williamson said.
</P>
<P>
   Russell and his wife have also supported the Indianapolis Zoo
and Russell is on the board of the Eiteljorg Museum of American
Indians and Western Art in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Museum president and CEO John Vanausdall said Russell is
``deeply devoted to (the city's) future and its quality of life _
arts, social services and higher education.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell said he enjoys civic service, but he might have to
reconsider his future activities out of deference to his duties as
a trustee of the Nina Mason Pulliam trust.
</P>
<P>
   The trustees will meet Thursday to distribute $5.3 million in
grants to charities in Phoenix and Indianapolis, Russell said, and
they will also discuss whether they need to give up affiliations
with civic organizations to avoid conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what, Mallery said, Russell's role with the trust will
allow him to continue to make an impact on his two home cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank Russell is going to have as much influence on the future
of Phoenix and Indianapolis as head of the (trust) as he has had on
Central Newspapers,'' Mallery said. ``I personally think he's going
to have a lot of fun and it's going to be good for all of us.'' &QL;

LEADING THE CHALLENGE TO AMAZON.COM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (mk) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Here is a great war story. On one side is Amazon.com,
the giant online bookseller (market value $5.5 billion), led by its
35-year-old Seattle-based founder, Jeffrey Bezos. On the other side
is Barnesandnoble.com, the small but aggressive No. 2 with the
brand name and a very rich partner (Bertelsmann AG), led by our
subject today, Jonathan Bulkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Bulkeley, 38, who started America Online's British operation,
was hired last month in an attempt to make Bezos as miserable as
possible. He starts Jan. 4 at the new Barnesandnoble.com
headquarters on Ninth Avenue at 15th Street, in a Port Authority
warehouse renovated into a postmodern lair of exposed computer
cables and sleek cement floors.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Middelhoff, the Bertelsmann chief executive who hired him
_ and invested $300 million for a 50 percent stake in
Barnesandnoble.com _ said Monday that Bulkeley was ``the answer to
Jeff Bezos. The future will show who will be better, Jeff or
Jonathan. Personally, I bet on Jonathan. Jonathan is one of the
reasons that Bertelsmann invested so heavily in the
Barnesandnoble.com venture. I believe that for the first time ever
Jeff will have real competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The response from Bezos? Kay Dangaard, his spokeswoman: ``About
18 months ago, somebody said we were Amazon.toast because Barnes &AMP;
Noble was coming online. And 18 months later, we're 12 times bigger
than Barnesandnoble.com. I think it's wonderful to be in a position
where other people are trying to be you.''
</P>
<P>
   So there was Bulkeley in his office last week, sounding
necessarily tough. ``It's early,'' he said. ``We're motivated.
We've got a killer team.'' He estimated Barnesandnoble.com had
about 10 percent of the online bookstore market compared to what he
said was Amazon.com's 80 percent, although no one knows for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Bulkeley was working at America Online's Virginia
headquarters in 1994 when AOL called Barnes &AMP; Noble to set up an
online bookstore. ``They never called back,'' he said. In 1994
Amazon.com was up and running; Barnes &AMP; Noble finally crept online
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``But let's take this all in perspective,'' Bulkeley said.
``Three years does not end the war.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Bulkeley ticked off what he saw as the advantages of
Barnesandnoble.com: Some 4.5 million titles compared with
Amazon.com's 3 million; better access to out-of-print, used and
rare books, and a brand name that will mean something to the
millions of new customers expected to buy online in the coming
years. Industry analysts describe Amazon.com's current 4.5 million
customers as the ``Internet elite.''
</P>
<P>
   (Monday, in a blow to Amazon, Microsoft named Barnesandnoble.com
the exclusive bookseller on its MSN network of World Wide Web
sites.The New York Times has a marketing partnership with Barnes &AMP;
Noble that allows readers of the newspaper's Web site to order
books directly from the bookseller.)
</P>
<P>
   Bulkeley also said that Barnes &AMP; Noble's purchase last month of
the Ingram Book Group, the nation's leading book wholesaler, had
the potential to speed up the delivery of a Barnesandnoble.com book
to consumers. Right now, if a Denver resident buys a
Barnesandnoble.com book that isn't in the company's distribution
center in New Jersey but is available in Ingram's Denver warehouse
(one of 11 around the country), the book goes first to the
distribution center in New Jersey, then back to the Denver
customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's called inefficient,'' he said. Bulkeley's hope is to
eventually send the book directly. ``Does that win the game?'' he
asked. ``No. Does it help? Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingram also supplies more than half of Amazon.com's books, which
Bulkeley said would continue. ``Ingram sells to everybody and will
continue to sell to everybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bulkeley, who is prematurely bald and has the manner of a genial
salesman, grew up in Hartford, Conn., where his father was an Aetna
vice president and his mother was a national executive for the
Junior League. He went to Hotchkiss, graduated from Yale in 1982
and landed in New York as an ad salesman for PCjr, a magazine that
followed IBM's computer of the same name. He went on to Time
Warner, where he was publisher of a college magazine that is now
defunct, and then Money, where he sold such Money products as
``Wealth Builder,'' a software program that provided early online
access. ``I thought, `This is cool,''' Bulkeley said.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993 he was at AOL, where he worked to persuade media
companies _ including The New York Times _ to go online, back in
the pre-World Wide Web dark ages. In 1995 Bulkeley went to London
to start AOL UK, a subsidiary of AOL Europe, which is half-owned by
Bertelsmann. In three years, Bulkeley got the company 500,000
customers _ and impressed Middelhoff. ``After one year he was
profitable,'' Middelhoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Bulkeley is married with three children and will live on Fifth
Avenue ``if we pass the co-op board,'' he said. One of his first
jobs is to take Barnesandnoble.com public this spring. One of his
first problems is to figure out what to do about people who can't
find barnesandnoble.com at all because they are typing the brick
and mortar store's ampersand _ a symbol that doesn't work on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me a couple of days,'' Bulkeley said.

RUSSELL RETIRING AS CENTRAL NEWSPAPERS INC. CHAIRMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Duplication warning: Story moving in news and financial
categories)   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES KELLY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Frank E. Russell, 78, a low-key but forceful executive
who led the parent corporation of ``The Arizona Republic'' to
robust growth in an era of modern technology, is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Russell, chairman of the board of Central Newspapers Inc., will
step down at the end of December after 39 years with CNI.
</P>
<P>
   The corporation also operates ``The Indianapolis Star'' and
``The Indianapolis News,'' as well as other newspapers and
enterprises in Arizona, Indiana and Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the growth of the company, it was Frank's
fine and quiet hand that was always steadily on the helm,'' said
CNI President and Chief Executive Louis A. Weil III.
</P>
<P>
   Russell served as a trusted counselor to CNI founder Eugene C.
Pulliam. After Pulliam died in 1975, Russell shaped CNI into a
competitive, publicly owned corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank was the pilot who guided the SS Pulliam through a very
difficult passage to a promising future,'' said Phoenix lawyer
Richard Mallery, a longtime friend of Russell's.
</P>
<P>
   Russell will continue as a key overseer of the trust that
controls CNI and of a charitable trust begun by Pulliam's widow,
the late Nina Pulliam. He will remain a CNI director.
</P>
<P>
   A genial man with a sharp business mind, Russell called on his
training as an accountant and lawyer in serving the newspaper
company.
</P>
<P>
   His stewardship helped keep the Pulliam newspapers on firm
financial ground, and in recent years, his behind-the-scenes
leadership contributed to CNI's growing profitability.
</P>
<P>
   CNI stock recently traded at $68 a share, and had traded at more
than $76, up from $21 when the corporation went public in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Russell, who always maintained a low profile, said last week
that his philosophy has been ``to step back far enough so that the
good people you've hired can do their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Weil described Russell as a keen observer, someone who listens
to the ideas of the people who work for him and backs them up. An
ex-Marine, Russell values and exhibits loyalty, Weil said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a decision is made, he's there to support you all the
way,'' Weil said.
</P>
<P>
   Though devoted to business, Russell never forgets how to have
fun, said Marge Tarplee, former corporate secretary for CNI who
retired in 1994 as head of the CNI Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Russell is an avid golfer and ballroom dancer and loves to
socialize with CNI employees, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said I never knew anyone who worked harder or played
harder than Frank Russell,'' Tarplee said.
</P>
<P>
   Russell will continue in his role as one of three trustees of
the Eugene C. Pulliam Trust, which has voting control of CNI. The
other trustees are Weil and Eugene S. Pulliam, executive vice
president of CNI and publisher of ``The Star'' and ``The News.''
Eugene S. Pulliam is Eugene C. Pulliam's son.
</P>
<P>
   Russell also will help distribute grants to charities in Phoenix
and Indianapolis as one of the three trustees of the $380 million
Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust. The other trustees are
Russell's wife, Nancy, and Carol Peden Schatt.
</P>
<P>
   Among his accomplishments at CNI, Russell pushed the adoption of
cutting-edge technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republic'' has emerged as one of the most technologically
advanced newspapers in America. It was one of the first and largest
newspapers to be completely paginated, meaning that all its
elements _ text, graphics, photos and advertisements _ are composed
with computers during the production process.
</P>
<P>
   Though Russell has embraced the computer age and the growing
field of online journalism, he said he believes the traditional
newspaper will never become obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think there's always going to be a place for the
printed page,'' Russell said. ``I think we have to do everything we
can to complement the printed newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell got involved in the newspaper business almost by
accident after having tried out other careers.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Kokomo, Ind., on Dec. 6, 1920, he graduated cum laude
with a bachelor's degree from the University of Evansville in
Indiana in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, he served in the Marine Corps, and was a
first lieutenant when discharged in 1945. In 1946, he earned a
certificate from the International Accountants Society in Chicago
and in 1951, graduated with a juris doctor degree with honors from
the Indiana University School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   He worked for the George S. Olive and Co. accounting firm and
was later vice president of Spickelmier Industries, Inc., a
diversified construction business in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, he decided to apply for a job as business manager of
CNI and ``The Indianapolis Star'' and ``News.''
</P>
<P>
   After a two-hour interview with Eugene C. Pulliam in an
Indianapolis hotel room, Russell decided he wanted the job and
Pulliam decided he wanted to hire him.
</P>
<P>
   He was business manager until 1977, when he became vice
president and general manager of CNI, then moved to the presidency
of CNI in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Russell retired as president and CEO of CNI in 1995, and then
became chairman of the board.
</P>
<P>
   He said his greatest accomplishment with CNI was handling the
original public offering of CNI stock in 1989, conducting a
three-week selling trip to all the principal financial centers of
the U.S. and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The stock available sold out, a market value for it was finally
established, and the demand was so great that half again as much
could have been sold, Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   His other major accomplishments were closing out Eugene C.
Pulliam's estate without straining corporate finances and bringing
modern, professional management to CNI.
</P>
<P>
   Weil said that through it all, Russell's devotion to CNI
employees has been paramount. He noted that a friend of Russell's,
newspaper publisher and former Marine Gen. Victor ``Brute'' Krulak,
used to say there are only three rules of leadership, and each one
is ``Take care of the troops.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Frank has followed that to a fault,'' Weil said.
</P>
<P>
   Russell said his retirement will give him and his wife a chance
to travel more and will allow him the opportunity to play more golf
and possibly to explore Civil War battlefields, which have
fascinated him for years.
</P>
<P>
   But his new role won't remove him from the communities of
Phoenix and Indianapolis, where he and his wife maintain homes.
</P>
<P>
   Russell has been involved in civic activities in both cities,
including past service on the board of the Arizona Community
Foundation and work on the board of the Phoenix Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Russell puts as much of himself into his work with the zoo as he
does with his business, and does so with gentlemanly grace and
attentiveness, said Jeff Williamson, executive director of the
Phoenix Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a trustee you can always count on,'' Williamson said.
</P>
<P>
   Russell and his wife have also supported the Indianapolis Zoo
and Russell is on the board of the Eiteljorg Museum of American
Indians and Western Art in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Museum president and CEO John Vanausdall said Russell is
``deeply devoted to (the city's) future and its quality of life _
arts, social services and higher education.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell said he enjoys civic service, but he might have to
reconsider his future activities out of deference to his duties as
a trustee of the Nina Mason Pulliam trust.
</P>
<P>
   The trustees will meet Thursday to distribute $5.3 million in
grants to charities in Phoenix and Indianapolis, Russell said, and
they will also discuss whether they need to give up affiliations
with civic organizations to avoid conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what, Mallery said, Russell's role with the trust will
allow him to continue to make an impact on his two home cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank Russell is going to have as much influence on the future
of Phoenix and Indianapolis as head of the (trust) as he has had on
Central Newspapers,'' Mallery said. ``I personally think he's going
to have a lot of fun and it's going to be good for all of us.'' &QL;

PATRIOTS' FUMBLE SOURS OPENING OF PUBLIC RELATIONS DRIVE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ A planned public relations drive by Robert
Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, to win support for a
new stadium in Hartford got off to a rocky start Monday when he
stood up the editorial boards of three of the state's largest
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a slap,'' said Barry S. Lewis, city editor of The
Advocate in Stamford, one of the wealthier cities in the state and
one where the team is hoping to attract buyers for luxury boxes at
the proposed new stadium. ``This was their idea in the first place,
and then he didn't show.''
</P>
<P>
   With the legislature to begin debating the Patriots' proposed
deal on Wednesday, a public relations firm for the team arranged
visits by Kraft to three newspapers in Fairfield County and in New
Haven _ the state's two most populous areas, and ones that would
receive the least direct benefit from a $375 million, state-built
stadium in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   At Coach's Sports Bar and Grille here, where Kraft was also
expected Monday, managers scurried around looking for Patriots
memorabilia and prepared one of their ``sky box'' booths for 10
guests.
</P>
<P>
   There was no need _ Kraft was in Massachusetts. Stacey James,
the Patriots' director of media relations, said Kraft had never
been scheduled to be in the state Monday and blamed the team's
Connecticut public relations firm, Cashman &AMP; Katz, for the mix-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels terrible,'' James said. ``We'll be sure apologies are
extended.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm said it had expected Kraft to appear Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A Patriots vice president kept the appointments. The public
relations people who had arranged the Connecticut visits did not
explain Kraft's absence, leading to awkward moments as the greeting
parties wondered if perhaps he was still on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy M. Sowecke, publisher of The New Haven Register, said
his readers would have appreciated having Kraft explain the issues
in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he's not taking the New Haven area for granted,'' said
Sowecke, who added that his newspaper had generally supported the
Patriots' plan. Kraft also had been scheduled to talk with editors
at The Connecticut Post, in Bridgeport.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kraft and Gov. John G. Rowland are to face a skeptical audience
as they address legislators at Wednesday's public hearing on their
tentative agreement to move the team to a stadium that is to be
built by the state and turned over to the Patriots rent free. Many
legislators, while acknowledging that the state had to offer Kraft
a good deal to lure him, have wondered whether the deal that
Rowland negotiated was sweeter than it needed to be.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Wasynczuk, the Patriots' vice president for business
operations and the official who appeared at the editorial boards,
offered a preview of the Patriots' position on Monday, saying that
Connecticut taxpayers were actually getting a better deal than
those in other cities where new stadiums have been built. Wasynczuk
noted that many stadiums were financed by sales tax increases,
which are not part of the Patriots' package.
</P>
<P>
   He said he also was eager to explain to legislators that the
tentative agreement was already the product of much give and take
and that the team did not want to make any more changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're buying a car and somebody quoted you a price and
they've got the mats thrown in and then you say, `I'll do that deal
if you throw in the sunroof,''' he said, ``it's kind of like,
`Well, wait a minute, I thought we shook on a deal.'''
</P>
<P>
   The public relations drive is to continue on Tuesday, when Kraft
is to appear with five Patriots players _ including quarterback
Drew Bledsoe _ at a rally in Hartford and make what a news release
called ``large donations'' to a youth football program in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   James said those events were on Kraft's calendar.

INCONSISTENT COWBOYS HAVE CONCERNED FANS ON EDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The ledge we're teetering on today is as crowded
as a Bourbon Street balcony on a Saturday night in New Orleans'
French Quarter. Not much elbow room. Lots of folks down below
screaming, ``Jump!''
</P>
<P>
   Don't do it, Cowboys fans.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panic,'' coach Chan Gailey said yesterday at Valley Ranch,
``but don't panic.''
</P>
<P>
   Makes perfect sense to me.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message Gailey will try to get across to his players
this week after the most pathetic and dismal performance of the
season in a 22-3 loss to the gawd-awful Saints on Sunday in the
Superdome.
</P>
<P>
   You say it's time for Gailey to get in their faces. Don't be
surprised if he has already done just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' Gailey said, ``is between me and the players.''
</P>
<P>
   His message is as important to fans, however, as it is to
players, maybe more so. The Cowboys, in their hearts, know exactly
what happened in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't just quit, they never came to play.
</P>
<P>
   Most fans, on the other hand, are totally confused. And why
wouldn't they be? They're not sure whether this team is a bona fide
division champion with a legitimate shot at advancing to the NFC
Championship Game or a collection of no-heart pretenders who have
padded their record by beating up on a long list of tomato cans.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, it's a little bit of all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times I do \Rsee an identity emerging,\S and then there are
setbacks,'' Gailey said. ``The key is to try to put it all together
at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, you start with the emotional part and the team psyche.
You've got to get that part going before you can get the rest of it
right.''
</P>
<P>
   That goes right to the heart _ or lack thereof _ of what
happened in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Around here, when it comes to the Cowboys, the tendency is to
analyze and over-analyze. We never look for the simple answer, even
when there is one that explains precisely what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Pay attention:
</P>
<P>
   With the NFC East championship all but assured and a playoff
spot in the bag, coming off a 10-day layoff, playing in a city with
lots of distractions and with many players' families along for the
Mardi Gras atmosphere, the Cowboys took an extra day off.
Emotionally, they simply weren't ready to play, and they aren't
good enough to get away with that.
</P>
<P>
   It was a case of bad timing, because the Saints, on the other
hand, had recently had their manhood challenged by coach Mike Ditka
and been confronted by owner Tom Benson. They came out highly
motivated, fighting for a playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   The mixture was more potent than a Pat O'Brien's hurricane:
Saints 22, Cowboys 3.
</P>
<P>
   Sickening, but relatively simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a football team that went out there, not expecting an
all-out war,'' Gailey said of the Cowboys, ``and that's what we
got. It's my responsibility to make sure they're ready for war
every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Was it disturbing to see the Cowboys go belly up because the
Saints were fired up and threw some blitzes they weren't expecting
at them? You bet.
</P>
<P>
   Do Gailey and his coaching staff deserve part of the blame for
not realizing that the team wasn't emotionally prepared?
Absolutely, and he freely admits it.
</P>
<P>
   What Gailey is trying to tell us, if we'll quit gnashing our
teeth and rending our clothes (all proper Bourbon Street things to
do, by the way) long enough to listen, is that, until proven
otherwise, what happened Sunday should be filed under
``aberration.''
</P>
<P>
   I.e.: Is Larry Allen going to be slapped silly every week like
he was by Joe Johnson in New Orleans? I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at any one game and say, that's this team, then
you're making a mistake,'' Gailey said. ``I think you have to look
at where you are and who you are after 16 games and then make an
evaluation of your performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had two \Rgames\S that I thought were defensive
\Raberrations\S, and I'm assuming that this one was offensively.
You want to get that across and, at the same time, create a sense
of urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   What we have here, then, is a team probably headed for a 10-6
finish (don't you dare tell me you wouldn't have taken that and
been deliriously happy before the season began). And it will hit
the playoffs, still wondering whether it can play with the big
boys.
</P>
<P>
   Should you worry? Darn right. We all know that quitting can
become a habit. It gets easier with practice (see December 1997).
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, why don't you crawl on in off that ledge. If
one more fool steps out there, the whole thing might come crashing
down.
</P>
<P>
   Panic, but don't panic. It's the theme of the week.

COWBOYS ON ALERT TO IMPROVE BY PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman said the 22-3
loss to New Orleans on Sunday ``stung'' more than any this season,
called the performance a setback for the team, and agreed that the
offense is better than it showed against the Saints but must get
things corrected quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a matter of us trying to win one game out of the next
three,'' said Aikman of the Cowboys needing one victory in their
last three games to clinch a playoff berth. ``We want to play well
going into the playoffs. It starts against Kansas City. There is an
urgency to play well this week because of what we want to be doing
in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   So, was the abominable performance by the Cowboys' offense
against the Saints, marked by a season-low 182 yards, the beginning
of a trend or an aberration?
</P>
<P>
   The real answer might not come until the Cowboys (8-5) play at
Kansas City (5-8) on Sunday, considering the traditionally
defensive-minded Chiefs are certain to employ the same blitzing
schemes the Saints used to shut down the Cowboys' offense.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Cowboys coach Chan Gailey, citing 30-point outputs
in four of the past five games, is treating Sunday's failing, which
included a 38-year low eight yards rushing and a seven-year low
three points, as a variation with an asterisk.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Cowboys' biggest problems against the Saints were
not adjusting to the blitzing alignments and allowing too much
penetration. However, he believes the problems will be corrected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm assuming that this was an aberration on offense,'' Gailey
said. ``I have to get that across to the team. At the same time, I
want to create a sense of urgency. Don't panic, but do panic. If we
don't have a sense of urgency to get things done, we are going to
waste a big opportunity that we've got here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys need one victory in the final three games to clinch
the NFC East title and a playoff berth. They could also clinch the
division with another loss by the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   The rushing ineptitude was considered the biggest disappointment
by the Cowboys. The eight-yard total beat the previous
franchise-low by 12 yards. Gailey and running backs Clarence
Shelmon both said the Cowboys never adjusted to the Saints' blitz
package, which featured aggressive stunts through the middle of the
Cowboys' offense line.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey called it the worst performance by the Cowboys' offensive
line this season. Rookie center Mike Kiselak, who played the
previous five years in the Canadian Football League and has started
only four games for the Cowboys, and rookie right guard Flozell
Adams, who is starting for injured veteran Everett McIver, had the
toughest time adjusting.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, however, refused to use inexperience as an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to get them to do it,'' Gailey said. ``It doesn't
matter how long somebody's been in the league. It doesn't matter
what the situation, whether you are an All-Pro or whatever. You gotto do it. We are going to continue to see this stuff until you
prove you can beat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelmon said the line wasn't all to blame. He said the running
backs have to have better recognition of the blitzes, as well, and
sometimes have to make plays when the holes aren't there.
</P>
<P>
   Making big plays on the outside by the receivers also could have
helped make the Saints back off of their aggressive style. However,
Aikman, who passed for only 192 yards, had little time to throw the
ball, and when he did, the receivers were unable to do anything
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman said the Cowboys missed having the services of
game-breaking star Deion Sanders (sprained toe) and veteran
receiver Ernie Mills, who is out for the season with perforated
small intestine. But he also said the Cowboys had enough players to
get things done against the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders should be ready to play against the Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, however, said the bottom line is execution, and he
believes a lack of mental preparation was the biggest problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has to learn something from the game,'' Aikman said.
``That we have to execute. That we have to play well. We are not
good enough to not play well and win games.''

   MOSCOW _ The Russian government and UNESCO are launching an
international appeal for money to restore the world-famous Bolshoi
Theatre, which is on the verge of falling down.
</P>
<P>
   Chandeliers have yet to drop on the heads of the opera-loving
public but the 19th century wooden foundations are rotting and
pipes recently burst in the administrative offices, spraying
scalding water onto the desks of managers.
</P>
<P>
   News of the fund-raising drive came earlier this week after the
first meeting of a new Russian-UNESCO organizing committee. The
campaign itself will be launched at a charity performance next May.
</P>
<P>
   Those interested in finding out about the restoration plan and
how to help can visit the Bolshoi's Internet website
(www.Bolshoi.ru).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bolshoi Theatre is not only our national heritage but the
heritage of the whole world,'' said Valentina Matviyenko, the
deputy prime minister in charge of Russia's social policy.
</P>
<P>
   Russia might be having difficulty paying wages and pensions but
the significance of the Bolshoi was such that funding would be
found, she said. Any additional contributions from abroad would be
welcome.
</P>
<P>
   On a par with the wonders of Prague and Venice it may be, but
the 173-year-old Bolshoi is at present in a very sorry state.
Dampness is rising from the underground Neglinnaya River on which
it stands and the original wooden foundations are disintegrating.
Not only that, but the building has not been rewired since the
1940s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no danger to the public, otherwise we would have
closed the theatre,'' said the administrative director, Vladimir
Kokonin. However, in his next breath, he admitted that a
``fountain'' of hot water had overwhelmed his desk when the pipes
burst a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Bolshoi management intends to keep the familiar outward
appearance of the pink-stucco theatre, changing only ``dated
symbols'' such as the Stalin-era stage curtains with their hammer
and sickle designs.
</P>
<P>
   However, in many invisible ways, the structure will be
strengthened and modern facilities provided. Experts have been
consulted to ensure that whatever alterations are made the
acoustics do not suffer. The estimated cost of the 10-year project
is $350 million.
</P>
<P>
   Already, with the help of Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, an
alternative stage has been built, so that the troupe of the Bolshoi
can remain in the public eye during the renovation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the economic crisis, Ms. Matviyenko said the federal
government had found 45 million dollars to start work on the main
building and this month Russian firms would be invited to tender
for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Bolshoi may be crumbling physically but spiritually it is in
better health than it has been for years under its new artistic
director, the former dancer, Vladimir Vasilyev.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, new ballets for the Christmas and New Year
season were previewed. And February will see the opening of
``Oprichnik,'' Tchaikovsky's rarely performed opera about the
secret police under Ivan the Terrible, which would have been
politically incorrect in Communist times.
</P>
<P>
   Vaslilyev, who criticized the way the Bolshoi used to sit on its
laurels when it held a monopoly, would be the first to admit that
his theatre has benefited from some healthy competition.
</P>
<P>
   Just up the road is the Novaya Opera (New Opera) of Vladimir
Kolobov, who spent years working in a disused cinema until Mayor
Luzhkov built him a splendid new opera house. And there are also
several opera studios that make Moscow, in the dead of economic
winter, a musical boomtown. &QL;

TEN INSTITUTIONS CREATE BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Trying to reverse New York state's shrinking share of
grant money for biomedical research, 10 of the state's academic
medical institutions are joining to create a large center for the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The complex, the New York Structural Biology Center, will be
owned and operated by the 10 medical institutions in the consortium
and is expected to open on the campus of the City University of New
York sometime next year. The center will house complex and enormous
machines that employ high-field magnets used to study molecules, a
costly and highly coveted type of biomedical research.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium will consist of the Albert Einstein College of
Medicine, the City University of New York, Columbia University,
Cornell University, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the
Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York University School of
Medicine, Rockefeller University, the State University of New York
at Stony Brook, and the Wadsworth Center, as well as the New York
State Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the consortium was unusual for a few reasons. The
participating medical institutions are far more accustomed to
competing with one another than combining forces, and an agreement
of this scale is extremely rare. The complex's size of 34,000
square feet in a place as cramped as New York City is uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Although the medical institutions will own and operate the
center, its construction is being financed by private investors.
That infusion of cash from a group of New York City businesses
underscores the private sector's desperation to draw and maintain a
core of research wizards that have recently opted for other cities.
It will take about $20 million to build and operate the new center
initially.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials say that a large pool of cash and a
collaborative rather than competitive strategy is needed if New
York state hopes to fight its way back to being the top recipient
of federal grants.

 CESAR, FRENCH SCULPTOR INSPIRED BY SCRAP METAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Cesar, a prominent French artist who created large
sculptures formed by crushed cars and scrap iron, died on Sunday in
Paris. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said the cause was cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Cesar _ he was born Cesar Baldaccini but used only his first
name _ was France's best-known sculptor of recent decades, yet his
works provoked strongly contradictory reactions. ``Cesar was loved
and detested,'' Le Monde wrote on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Only late in life was he embraced by the French cultural
establishment: He was France's representative at the 1995 Venice
Biennale (where he showed a 500-ton monument of crushed cars); and
his first retrospective in a French museum was not held until last
year, at the Jeu de Paume.
</P>
<P>
   By then, however, the work by the stocky, bearded artist had
begun to look dated.
</P>
<P>
   ``His love of life and good humor barely disguised his anxiety
and his legitimate desire to be recognized as one of the great
sculptors of his time,'' said Jack Lang, a former French culture
minister.
</P>
<P>
   He once complained that he never had an art dealer to promote
him in the United States and that he had not been properly
recognized in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   At least two of his sculptures are nonetheless seen daily by
thousands of Parisians: a large equestrianlike statue, ``Centaur _
Homage to Picasso,'' which stands on Rue du Cherche-Midi along the
Left Bank; and ``La Pouce,'' a 40-foot-high reproduction of his
thumb at La Defense in western Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Marseilles to Italian immigrant parents, Cesar left
school at 12 to help his father make casks, but at 15 he began
night classes at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Marseilles. Six years
later, he entered the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he lived
for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Working first with plaster and iron, then with lead, wire and
ceramics, he was initially influenced by Brancusi, Picasso,
Giacometti and Germaine Richier.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1950s, when he was too poor to buy materials, he
was delighted to discover the potential offered by scrap iron.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find it anywhere and buy it for almost nothing,'' he
later explained.
</P>
<P>
   He began by creating what became known as his beastiary, a
series of fish, animals and insects made of scrap iron that earned
him an invitation to exhibit at the 1956 Venice Biennale.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, he presented his first crushed cars at the Salon de
Mai, provoking an outcry from many French art critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought I did it so I'd be talked about, because I was
a `provocateur,''' he recalled, although conceding that it was a
form of rebellion to present ``such an aggressive object.'' These
works led him to be associated with the New Realists.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, when one art critic described him as a ``modern
predator of industrial folklore,'' he saw his work as going in
three directions: ``compression'' (cars), ``expansion''
(multicolored lavalike sculptures made of polyurethane) and
``prints'' (``La Pouce'' or an enlarged breast).
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, he gained still greater renown in an unexpected way: He
was commissioned to create the trophy for a new French equivalent
of the Oscar film awards, the Cesar.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved cinema and he liked being its symbol,'' said Daniel
Toscan du Plantier, who heads France's movie industry academy.

   LOS ANGELES _ More than 60 years after the pioneering aviator
Amelia Earhart disappeared without a trace over the Pacific Ocean
during a round-the-world flight, a group of American academic
researchers believes it is close to cracking the much-debated
mystery of where and how she died.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with new archival and analytical evidence, The
International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR), a
nonprofit foundation based in Delaware, says Earhart and her
navigator, Frederick J. Noonan, almost certainly crashed on the
island atoll of Nikumaroro, which was uninhabited at the time. They
died either of thirst or starvation when rescue efforts failed to
locate them.
</P>
<P>
   Intriguingly, the group believes that key evidence in the case
was dug up by the British colonial administration in the Western
Pacific in 1940, three years after the crash, but was prevented
from coming to public attention because of forensic incompetence
and an insistence by the High Commission to keep the affair top
secret.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Commission's files, which TIGHAR has unearthed
in Fiji, London and Hanslope Park, the British administrator
charged with populating and governing Nikumaroro _ then called
Gardner Island _ discovered fragments of shoes, a sextant box, and
some human bones which made him immediately think of Earhart.
</P>
<P>
   The High Commissioner, Sir Harry Luke, swore him to secrecy on
the grounds that ``thinnest rumors which may in the end prove
unfounded are liable to spread.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of officials examined the evidence, but concluded that
the sextant was too old-fashioned to be used in modern aviation,
and that the bones belonged to a man, not a woman.
</P>
<P>
   According to TIGHAR, the British assessment was hasty and
inaccurate, assuming, for example, that Earhart was alone. Not only
was Noonan with her, but he had a habit _ according to evidence
garnered from his possessions _ of taking an old-fashioned sextant
box with him as a backup to a more modern aeronautical bubble
octant.
</P>
<P>
   As for the bones, they were examined by a medical officer on
Fiji called D.W. Hoodless whose competence, according to TIGHAR,
appears to have been limited.
</P>
<P>
   Two independent studies commissioned by TIGHAR with the benefit
of modern forensic know-how examined the measurements and other
figures provided by Dr. Hoodless and concluded that the bones in
fact belonged to a woman of Earhart's stature.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most dramatic archival and scientific evidence to
date about Earhart's fate,'' said Richard Gillespie, TIGHAR's
executive director, who returned from a week-long research trip to
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office facility in Hanslope Park at
the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
   What is still missing, however, is conclusive proof to crown
TIGHAR's painstaking detective work.
</P>
<P>
   The most compelling piece of evidence would be the bones
recovered from Gardner Island, but nobody knows where they are.
They were put into a kanawa wood coffin ordered into storage by the
British High Commission immediately after Dr. Hoodless's
examination but the trail of paperwork on them runs out on April
17, 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Earhart's fate has exerted an extraordinary fascination on
amateur historians and conspiracy theorists ever since she vanished
from the radar screens, aged 39, on the morning of July 2, 1937.
</P>
<P>
   Already famous as the first woman to pilot a plane across the
Atlantic, among other feats, she was attempting a perilous
2,500-mile flight from New Guinea to Howland Island, about 350
miles northeast of Nikumaroro, when she announced over her radio
that she was coming in to land. That was the last anybody heard
from her.
</P>
<P>
   A massive U.S. Navy search concentrated its efforts around
Howland Island. Over the following days planes flew over Gardner
Island, part of the Phoenix Group, and noticed signs of habitation.
But nobody noticed signs of a crash.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the wildest theories began to circulate, particularly after
the Japanese invasion of Pearl Harbor. Earhart had been captured by
the Japanese and executed as a spy, some said.
</P>
<P>
   Her disappearance was orchestrated by the U.S. military as an
excuse to fly over the Marshall Islands where the Japanese were
suspected of building weapons installations, cried others.
</P>
<P>
   A Hollywood movie expanding on the espionage theory, ``Flight
for Freedom,'' was made in 1943 with Rosalind Russell and Fred
MacMurray. As late as the 1960s, books were being written
suggesting that Earhart was alive and well and posing as a nice old
lady novelist in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   TIGHAR's own efforts to unearth the truth began 10 years ago,
and from the beginning Gillespie and his colleagues chose to
concentrate on Nikumaroro.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 they found pieces of shoe including a replacement heel,
a rubber sole and a brass shoelace eyelet. These were subsequently
identified as coming from a woman's size nine blucher oxford of a
kind frequently worn by Earhart.
</P>
<P>
   TIGHAR also found some airplane fragments that may or may not
have come from Earhart's Lockheed Model 10E Special Electra.
</P>
<P>
   Every one of TIGHAR's findings has been fraught with
controversy, however, with members of Earhart's own family
contesting her shoe size and Lockheed employees failing to identify
the airplane parts as an Electra or any other model.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Aeronautics Department at the National Air
and Space Museum in Washington, Tom Crouch, remains skeptical of
TIGHAR's claims and says he wants to see a ``smoking gun'' before
shifting from his view that Earhart and Noonan simply ran out of
fuel and crashed into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Gillespie of TIGHAR does not pretend to have answered
all the questions yet, and his group plans further field trips to
the Pacific and elsewhere in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the elements are there for a great mystery, and Amelia
Earhart has turned into an icon for many people,'' he said, ``so
anything we discover is bound to be controversial. But just because
we are criticized doesn't mean our evidence has been disproved.'' &QL;

WANT TO SHOCK A CALIFORNIAN? OFFER A GLASS OF TAP WATER

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Want to know how to shock a Southern Californian?
Offer a drink of water, that's how. From the tap.
</P>
<P>
   In a part of the world notoriously wary of the ill-effects of
alcohol and caffeine, it isn't too surprising, perhaps, that people
like their water out of bottles.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't just about fads or dietary preferences. It
borders on paranoia: offer a glass of tap water and you won't just
get a polite refusal, you'll get a lecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you drink it? It tastes awful,'' says one of our
neighbors. ``It is full of industrial effluent and you're poisoning
your children with it,'' says another. ``You can't drink the water
because the municipal pipes are full of lead and give you
Alzheimer's disease,'' says yet another.
</P>
<P>
   All this is very puzzling, since the Metropolitan Water
District, which covers the six counties of Southern California,
actually has some of the cleanest, and tastiest, water in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In a competition between different public water supplies held at
the Festival of the Waters in Virginia last year, it came out
number one in a blind tasting test. Its quality is tested hundreds
of thousands of times a year. But nobody seems to know this, or
even want to know.
</P>
<P>
   Affluent Californians drink bottled water because they think it
is healthier and they prefer the neutral taste. Poor Californians
drink bottled water because many are first or second generation
immigrants brought up in cultures _ Latin American, especially _
that say you'd be crazy to trust the municipal authorities to keep
the water clean.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that everyone (well, everyone apart from a few
stubborn eccentrics like your correspondent) spends a small fortune
each week on bottles or giant coolers from one of the thriving
private water concerns.
</P>
<P>
   People even pay a premium for ``purified'' water on sale outside
supermarkets, even though this is no more than municipal water put
through a filter.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger companies offer to deliver water to your door, and
their salesmen spend considerable energy canvassing the unconverted
in suburban neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Thus was I buttonholed by a man from Sparklett's, one of the
most successful private companies, not least because its agents
have a reputation for catching and overpowering daytime criminals
and rapists.
</P>
<P>
   I almost overwhelmed him with the news that I drank out of the
tap. ``You can't do that,'' he explained in shocked tones. ``Tap
water contains a deadly bacteria called crypto!'' Crypto, it turns
out, is short for cryptosporidium, a genuinely unpleasant bug
derived from animal faeces that can get washed into reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin a few years ago, an estimated 100,000 people got
sick in a cryptosporidium outbreak. But Southern California has
never been perturbed by it, and the MWD has now developed a new
detection system to keep it out of the supply for good.
</P>
<P>
   There are more grounds for concern from industrial effluent.
Trichloroethylene, a potent factory cleanser, seeped into the
ground water of the San Fernando Valley at an alarming rate in the
late 1980s, forcing a costly clean-up and lengthy arguments between
the government and private manufacturers about who should foot the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   More recently a chemical called MTBE, which is added to gasoline
to make it burn more cleanly, was found to be leaking into ground
water aquifers. Several wells were closed until the mess was
cleaned up.
</P>
<P>
   Ammonium perchlorate, a rocket fuel component that can cause
thyroid problems and cancer, has recently been discovered in
Sacramento and in parts of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   But even in these cases the risk to public health has been far
lower than the scaremongers _ actively encouraged by the private
water companies _ have suggested.
</P>
<P>
   The ammonium perchlorate, for example, was found to exceed the
provisional ``maximum contaminant level'' of 18 parts per billion.
But this level was deliberately set extremely low. It takes at
least 3,000 parts per billion to trigger thyroid problems, and
200,000 parts per billion to induce risk of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Water is a sensitive subject in California at the best of times
_ Los Angeles stole most of its supply from upstate farmlands at
the beginning of the century _ and big private interests have often
been happy to distort the issues.
</P>
<P>
   Discrediting the public water authorities is a time-honored
tactic by property developers seeking to minimize the effects their
projects will have on groundwater levels.
</P>
<P>
   That helps explain why the bottling companies find it so easy to
win customers. ``They want to make big bucks and they feed on the
public's phobias,'' says Lynne Plambeck, an environmentalist and
former water board official in northern Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not required to do the testing that public water
agencies are and are undoubtedly not as safe. But in a town that
pays big bucks for a grande cafe latte, is it any wonder we want to
buy water as well?'' &QL;

LIVINGSTON LETS DELAY DO THE MESSY WORK ON IMPEACHMENT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert ``the Republican whip'' in the 2nd graf. No other
changes.)   (Eds: See also IMPEACH, IMPEACH-CLINTON) 
(mk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the third-ranking House
Republican, whips and wheedles his colleagues toward impeaching
President Clinton, he seems to be filling the space between the
departure of Speaker Newt Gingrich and the arrival of Speaker-to-be
Robert Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   But as crucial votes approach, it is increasingly clear that
DeLay, the Republican whip, is filling not so much a leadership
vacuum as a need of the new speaker. Livingston is more than happy
to let DeLay take the lead on impeachment, and to pressure
undecided moderate Republicans by denying them a vote on a censure
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   While DeLay's power has grown, not diminished, since the
disastrous midterm elections that cost Gingrich his job, House
Republicans say it is inconceivable that Livingston of Louisiana
would let DeLay of Texas maintain such a high public profile if he
did not approve of the Texan's tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``DeLay's role gives Livingston the chance to be a statesman,''
said Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., who is a close Livingston ally.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Livingston has been busy courting conservatives
wary of his tendency to cut deals with Democrats. He is
strengthening ties with his leadership lieutenants, like DeLay, the
chief Republican vote counter. And he is opening a long-closed door
to conservative Democrats, beckoning them to join Republicans on
addressing issues from Social Security to tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   What Livingston does not want, in the weeks leading up to his
formal assumption of the speaker's job next month, is to be
remembered as the man who let Bill Clinton off. Nor, with an eye on
a future when Clinton may still be president, does he want to be
known as a fanatic for impeachment. For those reasons, he gives
DeLay lots of running room _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a strategy, a psychology, for someone in a leadership
position to take a leadership point of view,'' said Rep. Joe
Knollenberg, R-Mich., a Livingston supporter.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's frontal assault spares Livingston the messy infighting
with House Democrats and the White House _ at least until the House
Judiciary Committee sends articles of impeachment to the House
floor later this week _ and postpones Livingston's crucial decision
on whether to allow a censure vote if impeachment fails.
</P>
<P>
   While publicly pooh-poohing his influence, DeLay acknowledged as
much on Sunday. ``Gingrich is referring and deferring to Bob
Livingston, and Bob is waiting for the report to come from the
committee before he decides,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's Capitol Hill office is humming with the buzz of
impeachment. Squadrons of young aides are readying their
speed-dialers to summon lawmakers back to vote on one or more
articles of impeachment the week of Dec. 14. Staff members are
clearing their desks to give dozens of Republican lawmakers who are
retiring or lost their elections _ and lost their offices _ a place
to pen notes and call colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   With Livingston lying low, Gingrich all but gone and Rep. Dick
Armey, R-Texas, the majority leader, still licking his wounds from
a bruising fight to keep his leadership job, DeLay has filled the
breach, using his vaunted whip operation to lead the impeachment
charge against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The very fact that DeLay, a pugnacious, steely-eyed son of an
oil driller, is virtually alone among his fellow House Republican
bosses on the impeachment stage, is tilting the way the drama is
playing out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you combine his leadership role and ability to count
votes, and his personal feelings on this issue, it'd be hard for
him not to be a central player,'' said Rep. Howard McKeon,
R-Calif., one of DeLay's assistant whips.
</P>
<P>
   A hard-core conservative with close ties to the Christian right,
DeLay painted a bull's-eye on Bill Clinton soon after the scandal
involving Monica Lewinsky broke in January. He was one of the first
Republicans to call on Clinton to resign, and in August, when other
Republicans were shying away from challenging Clinton, DeLay
brought his whip staff back from vacation to go on the attack.
</P>
<P>
   His office acted as a congressional scandal clearinghouse,
sending Republicans a thick binder of newspaper clippings,
political history and Clinton's remarks from 1974 on Richard
Nixon's impeachment inquiry, even before Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel, sent his report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me,'' DeLay told radio listeners recently, ``it's already
been established that anybody who lies to the grand jury ought to
be impeached.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With Gingrich retiring, House Democrats and the White House are
trying to paint DeLay as their new bogeyman _ the Republican that
Democrats love to hate.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, a 51-year-old former pest exterminator from Sugar Land,
Texas, is practically itching for a fight. ``They tried to demonize
Henry Hyde, they tried to demonize Linda Tripp, they tried to
demonize Newt Gingrich, so I guess I'm the next candidate,'' said
DeLay, whose nickname is the Hammer. ``I'm ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   What has turned DeLay from just another sharp-edged critic of
the president to the man who may deal Clinton his most stunning
defeat is the Texan's close ties to Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   A deft politician, DeLay was one of the earliest backers of
Livingston's campaign to succeed Gingrich, bringing with him the 65
whips in his vote-counting organization. The alliance sealed the
speakership for Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   As a reward, Livingston implicitly agreed to increase DeLay's
budget and staff, and to give DeLay more say over the scheduling of
legislation. DeLay also captured his most coveted empire-building
prize: liaison to business groups, conservative groups and trade
associations.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay insists he is not formally keeping tabs on Republicans'
impeachment votes. Both he and Livingston say any vote to impeach
the president would be a vote of conscience for each member.
</P>
<P>
   But moderate Republicans like Rep. Peter King of New York say
that DeLay's views, combined with many Republicans' annoyance at
the tone of Clinton's replies to 81 questions from the Judiciary
Committee, have swung the momentum toward impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In three separate conference calls last Wednesday with his
whips, DeLay took the temperature of House Republicans. This is
what he heard: an up or down vote on impeachment this year, and no
censure.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with that information, DeLay is tightening the screws on
undecided Republicans. ``His clout derives from his consistency,''
Wamp said. ``He's a bulldog on the positions he takes. He's tough.
His staff is tough. They take no prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   If DeLay's skills lie in his powers of persuasion, it is
instructive to note that on impeachment he has a hard sell and a
soft sell that seem to be at odds.
</P>
<P>
   First, the hard sell. DeLay insists his crusade against Clinton
is guided not by politics but by the Constitution, a pocket-sized
copy of which he carries with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a travesty to the Constitution for us to lower the
standards for breaking the law by not voting for impeachment,''
DeLay said last month.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's softer pitch plays down the significance of what would
be a historic House vote. ``All impeachment is, it's like a grand
jury that looks at the evidence, and the House decides whether the
evidence warrants sending it to the Senate for trial,'' DeLay said
on Sunday. ``That's all it is.''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Tuesday, Dec. 8:
</P>
<P>
   Even the most die-hard Jets fan knows that the team's
come-from-behind victory over the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday was
outright robbery _ a gift not from the deity, as the Jets coach,
Bill Parcells, would have it, but from a linesman whose eyes or
mind must have wandered. Vinny Testaverde clearly came up short
when he tried a quarterback sneak in the final seconds, but an
official signaled a touchdown, even though video replays showed
that the ball never crossed the goal line. Seattle's hopes of
making the playoffs were shattered, and the Jets' hopes of winning
the division remained intact.
</P>
<P>
   This fiasco came after a botched call the week before that
allowed the New England Patriots to beat the Buffalo Bills, thanks
to a pass that was ruled complete even though video replays showed
that the receiver was out of bounds. The Patriots went on to win
after another highly questionable call, knocking the Bills out of a
first-place tie and keeping the Pats in playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   Such season-turning mistakes are ample reason for the National
Football League to reinstate instant replay to confirm or overturn
questionable calls. Some critics of instant replay feel the number
of bad calls is too small to warrant concern, or that human error
is part of the game, or that subjective judgment will still be
required to evaluate the videotapes, or that taking time out to
review videotapes interrupts the flow of the game. Never mind that
commercials interrupt the flow far more often.
</P>
<P>
   Instant replay is no panacea. The tape can be inconclusive, and
its evaluators can make mistakes. But videotapes can make some
calls definitively and can provide an additional angle of vision.
When technology can prevent a game- or season-turning injustice, to
refuse to use it is unreasonable.

   In June, a first edition of Galileo's 1610 ``Sidereus Nuncius''
fetched more than $380,000 at a Christie's auction. The amount
surprised observers who were shocked that even an eager collector
with deep pockets might pay that kind of money for the historical
manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   What is even more surprising is that booksellers Patrick Ames
and John Warnock are offering the same volume for $25.
</P>
<P>
   And buyers won't have to worry about breaking bindings or
tearing delicate pages, because the rare books Ames and Warnock
sell are digital.
</P>
<P>
   Warnock, co-founder and CEO of desktop-publishing-software firm
Adobe Systems, and Ames, former publisher of Adobe Press, the
company's book-publishing arm, joined forces several years ago to
find a digital means of capturing rare books and manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   Warnock keeps an extensive private library, so the partners
first aimed their digital cameras at his 350-year-old collection of
Shakespeare's sonnets, creating high-resolution images of the
pocket-sized volume.
</P>
<P>
   They used Adobe Acrobat software to build an interface with the
electronic archive that allows a user on almost any personal
computer to ``page through'' the Bard's book, zooming in to read
the text or examine the aged paper.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, after years of weekend experimentation, Ames
and Warnock took $2 million of their own money and founded Octavo
in Palo Alto, Calif.

   The startup began to market ``digital rare books'' on CD-ROM in
May _ at prices that would make Christie's collectors choke on
their cappuccino.
</P>
<P>
   For $25 to $75, frugal bibliophiles can add first-edition works
from authors such as John Milton, Isaac Newton, Andreas Vesalius,
and Benjamin Franklin to their collections.
</P>
<P>
   To compile such a list, Octavo is not only tapping Warnock's
impressive collection, but also signing licensing agreements with
libraries, which receive royalties in exchange for the loan of
valuable volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Octavo's mission, Ames explains, is to conserve rare
works for future generations of readers. In fact, the digital
images that Octavo archives are much higher resolution than today's
technology can handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason you would need a higher resolution,'' Ames
says, ``is if you want to look at the molecular structure of the
paper or something.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as possible, Octavo's editorial policy is to photograph
each book ``as it is,'' says Ames. The company makes no attempt to
clean up the warped pages and water stains that have accumulated
over centuries. Indeed, Octavo goes to great lengths to ensure that
what the camera sees is what the customer gets.
</P>
<P>
   A computer cannot recognize the text in the digital images _
they are only graphics files _ so in some editions Octavo embeds
live text invisibly in the files, enabling readers to perform word
searches. Octavo's editors make a separate pass through these text
files just to make sure that the electronic typesetters have left
the typos in. &QL;

   The ``intelligent workplace'' at Carnegie Mellon University in
Pittsburgh, Pa., has without question the best view on campus.
Built atop an existing building, it commands an almost 360-degree
panorama and, equipped with state-of-the-art office technology, is
an unusually pleasant place to work.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also a place with a tough job: to prove that an initial
investment in a ``smart'' facility not only benefits workers but
also saves money in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   The showcase office is a collaborative effort of Carnegie
Mellon's Center for Building Performance and Diagnostics (CBPD) and
the Advanced Building Systems Integration Consortium, made up of
government agencies and manufacturers of building and office
products and systems.
</P>
<P>
   The project tests new technologies and hopes to demonstrate that
these systems together as an integrated whole can result in
significance savings over a building's lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   But they've got a tough sell. ``People are willing to pay money
for a better car environment, where they spend maybe one or two
hours a day, but collectively they are less willing to spend money
to improve the work environment, where we spend 10 hours a day,''
says CBPD's director, Volker Hartkopf. ``We question that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Carnegie Mellon project maximizes use of natural light and
ventilation in the workplace. When the outside temperature and
humidity fall within a certain range, a computer tells building
occupants to open their windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today it's humid in Pittsburgh, but not hot, just warm, and
opened windows are all we need (for ventilation),'' Hartkopf said
one day this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The computer also controls light redirection louvers outside the
windows. When the windows are closed, water flowing through the
mullions separating the window panes provides heating and cooling.
</P>
<P>
   Ventiliation comes from personal modules at each desk; the units
tap into an air supply under the floor and allow each worker to
control temperature and flow rate _ even to generate masking noise.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the personnel and organizational changes that are
increasingly common in today's workplace, layouts, walls,
electrical wiring and phone lines are all easily reconfigured.
</P>
<P>
   The wiring system, for instance, is a network of consolidation
boxes under removable floor panels; it provides access to every
point in the space within 30 centimeters, and does so for less
money than a conventional wiring system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a company relocating your headquarters, you could
even take the wiring along with you,'' points out research
assistant Sila Berkol.
</P>
<P>
   Berkol points to studies that show that this kind of up-front
investment in a work environment pays for itself over the long
haul.
</P>
<P>
   Lower energy costs and infrastructural versatility are only part
of the picture: the subsequent reductions in medical insurance
costs and absenteeism and increases in productivity and employee
retention along can be enough. Not to mention the many other less
easily measured benefits that result from a work force that likes
being at work. &QL;

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Dec. 8:
</P>
<P>
   Few politicians get a second bite at power as quickly as Hugo
Chavez, who won Sunday's presidential election in Venezuela. Six
years ago Chavez led a military coup. It failed, but his messianic
assault on the establishment captured the imagination of poor
Venezuelans. Chavez's speeches today are more conciliatory, but he
still frightens Venezuela's elite and makes Washington nervous
about the future of a country that is now the United States'
primary source of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez could become a populist despot, or could use his mandate
to make long-needed changes while respecting the rule of law.
Washington and Venezuela's opposition should work with him to
encourage a democratic approach. Venezuela's two main parties,
which have traded power for 40 years, have squandered the country's
wealth. Even when its oil was $16 a barrel, Venezuela borrowed.
Today its oil is half that price, and dropping. Interest on
Venezuela's foreign debt takes 40 percent of the budget, and 70
percent of its people live in poverty. Chavez's campaign program,
which contained wildly contradictory ideas, was a spending fantasy.
Reality will require budget cuts, but he can use them to produce
long-term change. He is right to propose renegotiating the
country's debt, and cracking down on tax evasion. He seems less
interested in the most important change, bureaucratic reform. The
government pays nearly 2 million people but does not provide decent
education, health care, transportation or justice. Chavez must
refocus the bureaucracy to serve the poor.
</P>
<P>
   He promised a referendum on a constitutional assembly that would
dissolve congress, which he does not control, and write a new
constitution. The idea is popular with Venezuelans, who want a
fresh start. But it could also allow Chavez to close congress and
write himself dictatorial powers.
</P>
<P>
   Washington should make clear it will help Chavez if he respects
Venezuelans' rights and the rule of law. The traditional parties
must also defend Venezuelan democracy, which has shut out ordinary
citizens but has deterred the widespread political violence that
has racked neighboring nations. The solution is to deepen
democracy, Venezuela's most important achievement of the last 40
years.

 &HT;    Senators promise to defend Fort Hood
 &HT;    By Pamela LeBlanc
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT HOOD, Texas _ Stopping at Fort Hood during a weeklong tour
of Texas military bases, U.S. Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison and
Phil Gramm vowed Monday to fight for increased defense spending and
warned of another round of base closures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a virtual certainty we'll be forced into at least one
possible base closing commission,'' Gramm said Monday during a
luncheon at the Officers' Club of the Killeen army post. ``We want
to be sure when the bad news comes about base closings it comes
down somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Four rounds of base closings starting in 1988 cost thousands of
jobs and shut down more than 70 major military bases, including
several in Texas. Victims of the cuts included Bergstrom Air Force
Base in southeast Austin, which is being converted to the city's
new airport, and Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio, which is
scheduled to close in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The closings are necessary if the military is to keep pay and
benefits up, and they won't threaten Fort Hood, Gramm said. With
42,000 soldiers, the Killeen facility is the largest army post in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fort Hood will be here and be operating when Jesus comes
back,'' Gramm said. ``Fort Hood will never be closed as long as we
have military in America.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when military recruitment is down and retention is a
growing concern, Hutchison said she would work to attract and keep
military personnel. Health care, housing, pay and equipment all
will be examined, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure we're doing everything we can to keep
this base strong,'' said Hutchison, a member of the Senate
Appropriations subcommittees on defense and military construction.
``If we are going to ask our military to do more _ and we are _
we're going to have to give them more.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm agreed, saying the trend in the past decade to cut defense
spending appears to be changing. ``We cut defense spending too
much. We're starting a trend to reverse that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The senators commended the Killeen community's support of family
members of soldiers deployed on a peace-keeping mission to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fort Hood is doing its part to carry out the U.S. mission in
Bosnia, and I am proud of the way the communities and schools here
have expressed such solid support for the families of those sent
overseas,'' Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   The senators later participated in a private video conference
with family members of soldiers deployed to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The senators sidestepped questions about the ongoing
Congressional impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the hands of the House of Representatives,'' Hutchison
said. ``Until they have done what they're going to do, there's not
a role for the Senate to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the senators will visit Corpus Christi Naval Air
Station, Corpus Christi Army Depot and Naval Air Station Ingleside
at Corpus Christi, Naval Air Station Kingsville and Laughlin Air
Force Base in Del Rio.
</P>
<P>
   Friday they will tour Fort Bliss in El Paso, Dyess Air Force
Base in Abilene and Goodfellow Air Force Base in San Angelo. They
plan to visit military bases in San Antonio early next year.

<P>
   Web searches often evoke a two-part reaction. First: Wow, that
was fast! Followed sadly by: But none of this is what I want.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning-quick online searches typically lead Web users into
piles of documents that are, to be kind, of dubious reliability.
Unlike the carefully catalogued stacks in a library, the Web often
appears to be untouched by human judgment.
</P>
<P>
   This chaos has been the price Web users pay for an open system
to which anyone can contribute. But it is an unnecessary price,
says Jon M. Kleinberg, a professor of computer science at Cornell
University.
</P>
<P>
   Kleinberg has devised an approach for sifting the contents of
the Web that could go a long way toward solving what he calls the
Web's ``abundance problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Kleinberg's technique relies on the premise that despite the
jumbled appearance of the Web, critical thinking is in fact woven
throughout it. Every time a page's creator includes a link to
another site, that is a vote of confidence in the linked-to page.
Thus a rough measure of a site's value can be derived by counting
how many other sites are linked to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web is explicitly annotated with precisely the type of
human judgment that we need in order to formulate a notion of
authority.'' says Kleinberg.
</P>
<P>
   But this measure needs to be refined, because if it were used
alone, the Yahoo search directory and the Netscape homepage would
come out near the top every time. ``We need a way to throw those
pages out,'' Kleinberg explains.
</P>
<P>
   The solution? Kleinberg applies a second level filtering that
assigns higher value to pages that include lots of links to other
sites that are themselves relevant to the search.
</P>
<P>
   By viewing the Web through its linkages and not merely by key
words, Kleinberg's search algorithm solves another common search
problem.
</P>
<P>
   A conventional Web search on the word ``jaguar,'' for example,
generates an unsorted roster of sites _ most related to the sports
car or to an obsolete computer with the same name. Information on
the jungle cat that inspired these brands, however, is harder to
come by.
</P>
<P>
   Kleinberg's system automatically groups hit lists into
``communities'' of sites that reference one another, in this case
providing a list subdivided by those related to cars, computers and
cats.
</P>
<P>
   Kleinberg developed the algorithm while at IBM's Almaden
Research Center in San Jose, Calif., which still owns it. For now,
the enhanced searching tool remains experimental, but IBM
researchers are shopping it around to companies that run online
search services, including Alta Vista operator Digital Equipment
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread availability is ``inevitable,'' says Prabhakar
Raghavah, manager of computer science principles at IBM Almaden.
``This is a great idea whose time will surely come.'' &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the organizers of a conference at the Fordham
University School of Law decided on their theme _ ``Rediscovering
the Role of Religion in the Lives of Lawyers and Those They
Represent'' _ the Rev. J. Philip Wogaman seemed a logical choice as
keynote speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We invited him because he is one of the leading scholars of
Christian ethics,'' said Russell Pearce, organizer of the
conference and an associate professor of law at Fordham. ``His role
as pastor became more of a big deal after we invited him.''
</P>
<P>
   As senior minister of the Foundry United Methodist Church in
Washington, Wogaman has a unique perspective on legal ethics and
religion: He is pastor to President Clinton and his family and one
of three clergymen giving the president religious and personal
counseling during his impeachment crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Monday at the first gathering of 120 lawyers, law
professors, theologians, scholars, ministers, priests and rabbis,
Wogaman noted that he was pastor to some 300 Washington lawyers and
the father of a lawyer. He traced the accelerating search for
higher meaning in the practice of law at a time when the
profession's reputation has sunk through one notorious case after
another.
</P>
<P>
   And while he did not dwell on the crisis swirling about his most
famous parishioner, he did meet the audience's expectation that he
would discuss the matter. ``The president, alleged to have
committed perjury, is thereby considered by some to have violated
the most sacred of all trusts,'' he said. ``I do not wonder that
some commentators have considered this a matter of ultimate
importance, although the breaking of the law _ if that is what
happened _ does not logically entail a particular penalty such as
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question before the nation and the Congress,'' he
suggested, ``is whether an ordinary human caught up like this
president is would be subject to punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that he was ``in a peculiar position to reflect on the
force of law and the realities intersecting with it,'' he said, ``I
am struck by Sept. 11, the day of the White House prayer breakfast.
Everyone there agreed on a need for repentance and on an openness
to grace and forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was also the day the Starr report was released, whose
focus was condemnation and a narrow application of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   While Wogaman was the main draw, the opening session was marked
by discussions on how best to infuse the practice of law with
religious and moral principles without breaching the constitutional
separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prevailing belief is that we are servants of the law
itself, not of God through law,'' said Mohammed Fadel, a Muslim and
a student at the University of Virginia Law School. ``The law is
the product of the state, so we can't really complain that lawyers
are not moral giants.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Arnold Goodman of the Ahavath Achim Synagogue, a
Conservative Jewish congregation in Atlanta, posed a particularly
perplexing question: ``If my religion informs me not to harm others
who do not threaten me in any way, how can I, if I am a laywer,
enable my client to prevail _ and by doing that, cause harm to
another?''
</P>
<P>
   Fadel responded: ``If you refuse to represent your client unless
you are certain he is right, you are harming him. You cannot escape
judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Workshops and panels Tuesday and Wednesday at the symposium,
which was organized by the Auburn Theological Seminary and the
Jewish Theological Seminary, among others, will include discussions
on how to better infuse the law with the moral principles of
religion and how to restore trust and confidence in it. Topics to
be covered include ``How Does a Religious Lawyer Practice Legal
Ethics in Corporate Practice?'' and ``How Does a Religious Lawyer
Include Moral Content in Conversations With Clients?''
</P>
<P>
   Out of this, Pearce, the conference organizer, said, would come
plans for organizing teams of clergy members and lawyers in 19
cities.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States scrambled on Monday to keep the
October agreement between Israel and the Palestinians on track,
with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warning her Israeli
counterpart, Ariel Sharon, to adhere to the timetable set in the
agreement and not to add new conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Later on Monday, President Clinton dropped by a meeting between
Sharon and Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, and spent
about an hour discussing the new problems in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   With new violence breaking out and the Israeli government
coalition shaky, Clinton's weekend visit to the region is likely to
be devoted to damage control as much as to celebration, one
American official said. Clinton leaves on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In his news conference with Albright, Sharon repeated Israeli
warnings that the second phase of the agreement reached at Wye, Md.
_ requiring Israeli pullbacks from the West Bank in return for
specific Palestinian steps to combat terrorism _ could not go ahead
if the Palestinians did not keep their own commitments.
</P>
<P>
   He accused the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, of
``activating and encouraging'' what Sharon called a ``renewed
intifada, `` or uprising, that represents ``a very difficult and
critical obstacle to the continuation of the peace process, which
we all want to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Sharon again warned that if Arafat unilaterally declares
Palestinian statehood after May 4, 1999, when a final settlement is
supposed to be completed, Israel would annex parts of the West Bank
not yet given to the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see the process moving forward,'' Albright said at
a news conference here with Sharon, and she encouraged both sides
to bring their differences, about the most recent agreement and
everything else, to the negotiating table. ``Violence is not the
answer, differences need to be brought to the table and solutions
can only come from negotiations,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright dismissed questions about whether linton might postpone
his visit, saying that the visit itself is a part of the agreement.
Clinton is scheduled to attend a Dec. 14 meeting in Gaza at which
the Palestine National Council and other Palestinian groups are to
expunge formally from the Palestinian charter all clauses calling
for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon said that Clinton will be welcomed as a friend of Israel.
But he urged the president not to raise ``false expectations''
among Palestinians during his three-day visit.

   Picture this: you're an animated whirligig, three spinning tiers
of starfish-like forms, adrift in an arid dreamscape bathed in
pulsating sound. You dance a flirtatious duet with an abstract
creature, traverse a flock of beings behaving madly, break free of
the boundaries of your hilly world.
</P>
<P>
   Across three screens in a space the size of a small multiplex
movie theatre, your computer-generated alter ego leads a playful,
kinetic existence.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's back to a more familiar reality _ as the next viewer
is handed the Nintendo-style gamepad and with it control over
Rebecca Allen's interactive art installation, ``The Bush Soul.''
</P>
<P>
   This work-in-progress, unveiled in its three-screen format this
summer at SIGGRAPH, the international digital graphics conference,
in Orlando, Fla., combines the traditional West African belief that
the human soul can replicate in an animal in the bush, with
computer technology representing a human on screen as a ghostly
pixel presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted people to experience a computer-generated bush, a
world that's alive, with familiar, fluid motions and unfamiliar
characters with their own feelings, their own likes and dislikes
influencing their behavior,'' explains Allen, chair of the
department of design at the University of California, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Her ambition required a technological leap beyond standard
computer character animation, in which each movement must be
painstakingly specified; in Allen's work, movement emerges
spontaneously from the interaction of characters' programmed
``personalities.''
</P>
<P>
   To express her vision, Allen recruited computer science and
design students to develop a new programming tool called Emergence.
</P>
<P>
   She describes this software system as ``a behavior scripting
language that lets you set up relationships between artificial life
characters in a real-time, interactive 3-D world generated with
PCs.''
</P>
<P>
   Artificial life programs more primitive than hers have already
been used to create crowd scenes in Disney animated feature films.
And a language like Emergence may well be the medium in which
Hollywood's artificial actors of tomorrow are routinely created.
</P>
<P>
   Devising her own virtual palette and brushes is nothing new to
Allen. After graduating from the Rhode Island School of Design, she
did graduate work as a member of MIT's Architecture Machine Group
(forerunner to the Media Lab) and has been developing software
tools from scratch for state-of-the-art computer equipment for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Supported in part by a three-year grant from Intel, Emergence
has evolved from a single syntax with commands for ``love'' and
``avoid'' to complex instructions for dozens of character
parameters.
</P>
<P>
   It has also evolved from a single-screen world (which debuted in
October 1997 at Madrid's ``Art Futura'' festival) to a networked
version capable of ultimately supporting eight screens for a
full-immersion environment.
</P>
<P>
   Emergence runs on PCs with Windows NT, but don't expect to see
it used on home systems. The relatively simple version shown at the
Orlando installation involved some 70 different characters, evenly
divided between animal-like figures and ``smart'' plants, and was
generated using the latest, fastest Intel Xeon processor chips,
with two processors per screen (one for graphics and one for
character behaviors).
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Allen has no desire for people to kick back in
their living rooms and ``play'' Emergence. Her professional
experience in the commercial game world has convinced her of the
importance of public installations of digital art.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush Soul'' isn't a game; you don't compete for points or
find extra lives,'' she notes. ``This is an experience. It's
crucial for it to be in a public space, where other people can
comment and add a social dimension to viewers' interactions.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why she chose to create a world of abstract, rather than
representational, characters, she responds, ``For expressing the
spiritual I wanted a look like (Wassily) Kandinsky, like early
20th-century abstraction. I didn't want my characters'
personalities to be instantly recognizable. I didn't want to make
`The Bush Soul and the Seven Dwarfs.'''
</P>
<P>
   Look for it in a public space near you. Having already been seen
live or on tape in England, Spain, the Netherlands, the United
States and Canada, ``The Bush Soul'' could turn up anywhere. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   High-tech investors have long considered agriculture to be a
losing proposition, scorning it as a backwater in favor of
fast-growing biotech sectors focused on human health.
</P>
<P>
   But the budding success of the first generation of genetically
engineered crops _ and projections that growth will skyrocket over
the next several years _ is rapidly catching the attention of
entrepreneurs and venture capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest example, Burrill &AMP; Co., a San Francisco investment
house, is raising a $100 million war chest earmarked for new
agriculture startups.
</P>
<P>
   ``This a huge amount of money for ag biotech. There hasn't been
much money going into this sector at all,'' says Roger Wyse, the
former dean of the University of Wisconsin's College of Agriculture
and Life Sciences, who is directing Burrill's investments.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by such corporate giants as Bayer and Hoechst, the
managers of the fund see plenty of opportunity in this underfunded
field.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for all the interest is clear. Big agricultural
chemical producers like Monsanto and DuPont and seed suppliers like
Pioneer Hi-Bred International have looked into their farmers'
almanacs and concluded that biotech is the future.
</P>
<P>
   The ag giants are already selling seeds for herbicide-resistant
soybeans and insect-fighting corn.
</P>
<P>
   First commercialized several years ago, these genetically
engineered crops are proving to be blockbusters. And the projected
growth numbers are staggering. Analysts predict that biotech crops
will be worth $7 billion by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are now looking for the next batch of genes to further
engineer crops. Research groups are busily developing biotech
plants that will be designed with ``output'' traits to, say, pack
in more protein or more starch.
</P>
<P>
   A third wave of biotech crops is on the drawing board that will
be engineered to produce nutritional supplements or raw materials
for industrial processes.
</P>
<P>
   But fulfilling such dreams is going to take extensive knowledge
of plant genes. Which is where the startups hope to come in. The
sudden influx of venture capital and the promise of more to come is
fueling a slew of new plant biotech companies.
</P>
<P>
   A number of the startups are borrowing well-tested genomics
techniques (methods for identifying genes and their functions) from
the pharmaceutical industry. Indeed, several established biotech
players from the health care arena are already leveraging their
know-how into plant biotech.
</P>
<P>
   Paris-based gene mapping firm Genset has sold rights to its
technology for agricultural applications to a Los Angeles startup
called Ceres. San Francisco's AxyS Pharmaceuticals, a gene and drug
specialist, says it could be next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that you're going to see a huge number of startups,
probably 20 to 30 new companies,'' says John Ryals, founder and CEO
of Paradigm Genetics, a new plant biotech firm based in Research
Triangle Park, N.C. ``It's a wide-open opportunity right now.'' &QL;

CLEMENS IN COMMAND AS YANKS ENTER TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Yankees made an initial trade offer for
pitcher Roger Clemens Monday, but an American League official said
the Yankee bid is not among the two offers the Toronto Blue Jays
are weighing seriously. In the end, though, Clemens will dictate
where he is traded because of provisions in his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Owner George Steinbrenner met with team officials Monday in
Tampa, Fla., to assess how seriously his club will pursue Clemens.
Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, said Monday evening
that he had spoken with Gord Ash, the general manager for Toronto;
Cashman would not describe the substance of their conversation, or
whether he had extended an offer.
</P>
<P>
   A league official said the Yankees made an initial offer _
perhaps involving second baseman Homer Bush and others. ``It won't
be enough to get anything done,'' said the official, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``There are other deals out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' offer may have been only a first step to open
negotiations and to buy them more time to examine the parameters of
a possible deal. The Yankees, like other teams, are apparently
concerned by what one American League executive called ``the double
whammy'': To acquire Clemens, a team would have to surrender two or
three quality players, and then renegotiate a new contract with the
five-time Cy Young award winner and pay him like a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, 36, took advantage of an oral agreement with the Blue
Jays' ownership and demanded that Toronto deal him. Incredibly,
Clemens also has a strict no-trade clause, meaning that he can
force the Blue Jays to swap him and then control his destination _
and, with only 1999 and 2000 remaining on his current deal, Clemens
presumably won't accept a trade unless his new team is willing to
give him a more lucrative and longer contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim Angels and the San Diego Padres are among those
teams interested in Clemens, but some baseball executives have been
told that Clemens does not want to play for a West Coast team.
Clemens' preference would be to play close to his Texas home, and
naturally the Houston Astros and Texas Rangers are considered
front-runners for his services.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, the Mets and Cleveland are also interested, but the
Astros, Indians and Yankees and other teams are balking at the idea
of trading players for Clemens, and then paying him as if he were a
free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Ash said Monday that he has reduced the number of potential
suitors from 12 to 14 teams down to six serious suitors, with a
couple of clubs viewed as long shots.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's leverage may have been reduced by the fact that money
that was going to be paid to Clemens in the form of a bonus is
being added to his salary the next two seasons. Clemens was in line
to make $5 million for next season, a modest price for a 20-game
winner. But with the bonus money added, Clemens' salary for 1999
will be $8 million, and has increased from $6.35 million to $8.1
million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Executives around baseball expect that Clemens will want to be
paid about $50 million over four years.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown, currently the best available free-agent pitcher,
will most likely command a much greater contract. The Los Angeles
Dodgers, Colorado Rockies and Baltimore Orioles all seem willing to
give Brown the six-year deal he covets, and the St. Louis
Cardinals, too, may be in the running. Baseball officials in both
leagues believe that once Brown signs _ perhaps at the end of this
week, when teams gather for the winter meetings in Nashville _ his
annual salary will approach $14 million.
</P>
<P>
   With most teams having engaged in major moves already, there are
not expected to be many trades at the meetings. Among the deals
being discussed: the Braves have talked to Tampa Bay about the
slugger Ryan Klesko, Arizona is talking to Pittsburgh about trading
pitcher Brian Anderson for outfielder Jose Guillen, and several
teams have asked the Padres about the availability of outfielder
Greg Vaughn, who hit 50 home runs in 1998.

POLICE, AND MAYOR, IGNORE A PROTEST ON CITY HALL STEPS

 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A group of City Council members rebelled against the
unusually tight security at City Hall on Monday by holding a news
conference on the building's steps, but Mayor Rudolph Giuliani only
smiled and shook his head as he walked past.
</P>
<P>
   The police also did nothing to stop the protest, even though
security regulations have banned news conferences and
demonstrations from the steps of City Hall since August and the
city has strictly enforced the ban.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen plainclothes officers stood quietly in the
background while 15 Council members, many of them frequent critics
of the mayor, inveighed against the newly limited access to the
building, calling it unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Giuliani has insisted that it was the Police
Department's decision to block access to City Hall, the Council
members directed their wrath at him. Thronged by more than two
dozen reporters, photographers and camera operators, they took
turns criticizing the Republican mayor for what they called his
attempts to quash participatory government.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come to this beautiful building to raise their concerns
and express their opinions,'' said Councilwoman Ronnie Eldridge, a
Manhattan Democrat who organized the news conference. ``We're here
today to say that City Hall belongs to the people, and we want it
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The police began blocking access to City Hall after the United
States launched missiles at suspected terrorist targets last
summer, saying they needed to protect the building from possible
retaliatory attacks. Only those who can prove that they have
business in the building are allowed past the concrete barricades.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over the security crackdown intensified last
week after a federal appeals court ruled that an AIDS service
agency could hold a rally in front of City Hall. The group, Housing
Works, held the rally last Tuesday, but the police directed the 200
demonstrators into metal pens, a move that riled civil libertarians
and many elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani defended the security measures at the rally, saying
that Housing Works was a suspect organization and that the police
had expected a much larger crowd. He has repeatedly insisted that
City Hall needs extra protection these days, and that the police
should be allowed to take whatever security measures they deem
necessary.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The police presence at the Housing Works protest angered Council
Speaker Peter Vallone, who complained to the mayor the next day.
But Vallone stayed away from the protest Monday. His spokesman,
Michael Clendenin, said the speaker preferred to negotiate directly
with Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The police ordered camera crews arriving for the morning news
conference to stand to the side of the steps and face the street,
so that City Hall would not be the backdrop. But when the Council
members appeared and planted themselves firmly on the steps, the
police allowed the camera crews to change position.
</P>
<P>
   As the Council members waxed dramatic, comparing City Hall Plaza
to Tiananmen Square in Beijing, Giuliani quietly walked down the
steps to the van that carries him around the city. Half the
television cameras that had been recording the news conference
followed him, causing Council members to shout more forcefully and
the mayor to grin.
</P>
<P>
   Although Giuliani did not confront the Council members as he
strode past, he later chastised them for ``blabbering'' about the
security measures and flouting the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think these Council members would be better advised to
support the police rather than trying to make their job more
difficult,'' Giuliani said during an afternoon news conference in
Brooklyn. ``We deal with very, very dangerous situations in New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor stressed that it had been the Police Department's
decision to allow the news conference on the steps, saying, ``If
the police feel that was no danger to security, then that's the
right judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Police Commissioner Marilyn Mode said the police ignored
the event because they saw it as a political stunt that did not
deserve their attention. ``We just are not going to be drawn into
any manufactured incidents by members of the City Council,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he had reason to believe that the building was a
target for terrorists, Giuliani said, ``All you need is a certain
degree of common sense to figure out the answer to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by their success, Ms. Eldridge and other Council
members vowed to continue holding news conferences on the steps,
saying it would help return City Hall to the public. But Giuliani
warned that the next time, the police might not be so
accommodating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think trying to provoke the police into arresting you is a
very juvenile thing to do,'' he said. ``We should be teaching our
children how to respect the police, not creating unnecessary
situations where arrests have to take place for symbolic
purposes.''

NORTHROP TO CUT 1,500 JOBS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAN PILLER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
GRAND PRAIRIE _ Northrop Grumman told workers at its Grand Prairie
and Dallas plants in Texas Monday that it will cut 1,500 jobs from
those operations next year because of cutbacks in the work they do
for the Boeing 747 jumbo jet.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another 1,100 Northrop workers at plants in Hawthorne, Calif.,
and Perry, Ga., will lose their jobs because of a decline in orders
for the 747. Northrop is the plane's prime subcontractor.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Prairie and Dallas plants, which employ 5,400 workers,
have made the tails for the Boeing 747 since the airplane went into
production 30 years ago. Boeing said last week that it is slicing
production of the 747 to two per month, down from 3.5 per month
announced last summer and five per month a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Northrop told its employees during the summer to expect 300
layoffs next year because of cutbacks in 747 production; that
number is included in the 1,500 total disclosed Monday. After
Boeing announced deeper cutbacks last week, Northrop told its
workers to expect more cuts, too.
</P>
<P>
   Employees were told the size of the planned cuts Monday in a
memo from Jim Hoover, the Northrop vice president for
aerostructures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of news is difficult for everyone, for those whose
jobs are being eliminated and for those who will remain,'' Hoover
said in the memo.
</P>
<P>
   But layoff notices won't be given to workers until January,
Northrop spokeswoman Georgia Maddox Engle said.
</P>
<P>
   The cutbacks will be divided about evenly between production
workers and support staff in engineering, human resources,
accounting and other functions.
</P>
<P>
   Workers will be given 60 days notice, but no formal severance
package. Northrop will provide employee outplacement and other
assistance for the laid-off workers, Engle said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of United Aerospace Local 848, which represents 2,441
hourly workers at the local plants, said employees with the least
amount of seniority in various job groups will be laid off first.
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts announced Monday represent 4.8 percent of
Northrop's work force of 54,000 people worldwide.

adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, whose 50th

the human-rights movement's founding document, the source from

   Franklin had tried to head off a return to such great-power
rivalry by constructing an international order founded on
great-power cooperation. And he knew that, to succeed, such
cooperation had to rest on some shared notions of justice and
legality, not just military might.
</P>
<P>
   So he accompanied his proposal for the ``four policemen'' of the
U.N. Security Council (later to become five) with an appeal to
``four freedoms'' _ freedom of expression and religion, freedom
from want and fear _ which eventually led to the Universal
Declaration.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the Roosevelts' enthusiasm for international law has been
replaced by a deep American ambivalence. Successive American
presidents have continued to proclaim human rights, democracy and
the rule of law as the guiding values of their foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   They have often invoked international law in their own defense,
and in criticizing others. Yet the United States has a sorry record
of shilly-shallying, or plain obstruction, in the development of
international law.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of leading, America has ratified many human-rights
treaties only after most other countries have already done so.
</P>
<P>
   It took 40 years to ratify the Genocide Convention, 28 for the
Convention Against Racial Discrimination, 26 for even the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the most
important treaty of all.
</P>
<P>
   Over 160 countries have ratified the convention banning
discrimination against women _ but not the United States. Only two
in the world have not ratified the Convention on the Rights of the
Child; the other one is Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   And even when America has ratified treaties, it has often
attached extensive reservations, making them inapplicable at home.
It has also paid scant respect to the monitoring mechanisms set up
by the treaties, and to the International Court of Justice in The
Hague.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, the United States played the key role in setting
up tribunals to put on trial individuals accused of war crimes and
genocide in Rwanda and ex-Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, alone among its allies, it now opposes the permanent
international criminal court endorsed by 120 nations at a U.N.
conference last July _ primarily because it could not win an
absolute exemption for its own soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   And that attitude is nothing new: successive American
governments have seen the corpus of international law as a useful
device to restrain or vilify other nations, while refusing to let
it apply to their own.
</P>
<P>
   How can the United States get away with this? The answer, as in
many other things, is simple: it is the world's only superpower.
</P>
<P>
   Its allies, recognizng that position, and aware that law alone
cannot preserve the peace (or their interests), usually grant it
the latitude necessary to act in a crisis _ and know well that it
would not take much notice if they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even the United States _ let alone the world _ pays a high
price for its refusal to apply international law on human rights at
home, and its undue readiness to brush aside these or other aspects
of international law abroad whenever this seems convenient.
</P>
<P>
   American leaders thereby gain room for maneuver. But their
double standards also damage their credibility when they criticize
the illegalities or human-rights abuses of others, and reduce
American influence over the law's development.
</P>
<P>
   That was plain this week, when American officials hinted heavily
that General Augusto Pinochet, a former American protege, should be
returned to Chile. There are political arguments for that; but only
feeble ones in international law.
</P>
<P>
   If America must be the world's policeman, a role it often plays
only reluctantly, and quite often against a chorus of criticism, is
it better served by being seen as international law's champion, or
as a nation which regards itself as beyond the law? Franklin
Roosevelt would have known the answer. &QL;

<P>
   Every few months, Japan comes under pressure to offer a
``proper'' apology for its conduct during some of the bloodier
parts of this century. Then, almost regardless of what it says, it
finds itself under some sort of fire.
</P>
<P>
   During Emperor Akihito's state visit to Britain in May it was
criticized for seeming niggardly in its contrition; and even during
the recent successful visit to Japan of South Korea's President Kim
Dae Jung, in which warm words were exchanged and a fulsome apology
provided, some unkind souls wondered why it had taken Japan so long
to say sorry for its colonial deeds.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, however, Japan has been firmly in the right _
but this time for not offering a fulsome apology.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was the visit to Tokyo of China's President Jiang
Zemin, the first ever by a Chinese head of state. For sure, Japan
has plenty to feel sorry about concerning its actions in Manchuria
and elsewhere in China during the 1930s and 1940s; the only
sensible debate about the period turns on how many millions of
Chinese citizens were slaughtered, not the reality or morality of
the actions, and it would be best if Japan, particularly its
schools but also its politicians, were to come to terms with this
past.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes, even in the contrition business, the wider
context also matters. And it is that which makes this Japanese
refusal welcome.
</P>
<P>
   That context begins with President Jiang and his fellow
communists. To treat this Chinese leadership as fitting recipients
of an apology would frankly be pretty stomach-churning.
</P>
<P>
   The only entity that this century has outdone the Imperial
Japanese army in the killing of Chinese citizens is the Communist
Party of China itself _ in policy-induced famine, in prison camps,
in the mayhem of the Cultural Revolution, and in Tiananmen Square
in June 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Where today's Japanese government is genuinely of a different
generation and political system from its 1930s predecessors, the
difference between President Jiang's government and those of Mao
Tse-tung and Deng Xiaoping is one of degree, not kind.
</P>
<P>
   For all his urbane charm, and willingness to cite poetry and
sing songs, President Jiang remains head of a nasty regime. To use
him as courier for a contrite message to the people his party still
brutalizes would be ironical, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the use to which the war-guilt issue is put.
Plainly, and for many years, the Chinese have deployed it as a
negotiating weapon, often in association with entirely groundless
claims that Japanese militarism is again on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   It has no moral value to them nor is the sincerity or otherwise
of the apology of particular relevance. Rather, it is a way of
putting Japan on the defensive and of extracting concessions from
it, usually in financial form.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite China's apparent outrage about this week's
apology-refusal, the tactic nevertheless still worked: Japanese
loans worth YEN 390 billion ($3.2 billion) over the next two years
were announced while President Jiang was in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important piece of context is the island which
China calls a ``renegade province'': Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has long retained close business and political links with
its former colony. Under new security-treaty guidelines agreed with
the United States, Japan has left open for itself a possible role
for its navy and air force as far south as Taiwan, and China would
dearly like that role to be renounced. Yet Japan refuses to do so _
and maintained that refusal during President Jiang's visit this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The right approach to Taiwan in general, and to the question of
whether outsiders would intervene militarily to support the island,
is one of aggressive ambiguity.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders should not, by their actions or threats, give China an
excuse for military action. But they deter such action most
effectively when China is left guessing about what they might do,
while the outsiders still make it clear that military moves against
Taiwan would not be considered merely an internal Chinese affair.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Japan's flat refusal to close off its options is so
welcome. Indeed, it has given less ground on Taiwan than did
President Bill Clinton on his visit to China this summer, when he
signed up to a Chinese declaration against Taiwanese independence
or political recognition.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer term, relations between China and Japan promise to
be among the region's prickliest. Many in China think it will soon
be able to take its rightful position as East Asia's economic and
political superpower, and that the country standing most clearly in
its way is Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Another, plausible view is that Asia's next big problem is
Chinese economic collapse, with possible consequences for internal
political stability and rising nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, an important ingredient of regional stability is for
Japan to stand firm: to make it clear that it is not going to be
pushed around. That was the welcome sight in Tokyo during the past
few days. &QL;

Zemin, the first ever by a Chinese head of state. For sure, Japan
has plenty to feel sorry about concerning its actions in Manchuria
and elsewhere in China during the 1930s and 1940s; the only
sensible debate about the period turns on how many millions of
Chinese citizens were slaughtered, not the reality or morality of
the actions, and it would be best if Japan, particularly its
schools but also its politicians, were to come to terms with this
past.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes, even in the contrition business, the wider
context also matters. And it is that which makes this Japanese
refusal welcome.
</P>
<P>
   That context begins with President Jiang and his fellow
communists. To treat this Chinese leadership as fitting recipients
of an apology would frankly be pretty stomach-churning.
</P>
<P>
   The only entity that this century has outdone the Imperial
Japanese army in the killing of Chinese citizens is the Communist
Party of China itself _ in policy-induced famine, in prison camps,
in the mayhem of the Cultural Revolution, and in Tiananmen Square
in June 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Where today's Japanese government is genuinely of a different
generation and political system from its 1930s predecessors, the
difference between President Jiang's government and those of Mao
Tse-tung and Deng Xiaoping is one of degree, not kind.
</P>
<P>
   For all his urbane charm, and willingness to cite poetry and
sing songs, President Jiang remains head of a nasty regime. To use
him as courier for a contrite message to the people his party still
brutalizes would be ironical, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the use to which the war-guilt issue is put.
Plainly, and for many years, the Chinese have deployed it as a
negotiating weapon, often in association with entirely groundless
claims that Japanese militarism is again on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   It has no moral value to them nor is the sincerity or otherwise
of the apology of particular relevance. Rather, it is a way of
putting Japan on the defensive and of extracting concessions from
it, usually in financial form.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite China's apparent outrage about this week's
apology-refusal, the tactic nevertheless still worked: Japanese
loans worth YEN 390 billion ($3.2 billion) over the next two years
were announced while President Jiang was in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important piece of context is the island which
China calls a ``renegade province'': Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has long retained close business and political links with
its former colony. Under new security-treaty guidelines agreed with
the United States, Japan has left open for itself a possible role
for its navy and air force as far south as Taiwan, and China would
dearly like that role to be renounced. Yet Japan refuses to do so _
and maintained that refusal during President Jiang's visit this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The right approach to Taiwan in general, and to the question of
whether outsiders would intervene militarily to support the island,
is one of aggressive ambiguity.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders should not, by their actions or threats, give China an
excuse for military action. But they deter such action most
effectively when China is left guessing about what they might do,
while the outsiders still make it clear that military moves against
Taiwan would not be considered merely an internal Chinese affair.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Japan's flat refusal to close off its options is so
welcome. Indeed, it has given less ground on Taiwan than did
President Bill Clinton on his visit to China this summer, when he
signed up to a Chinese declaration against Taiwanese independence
or political recognition.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer term, relations between China and Japan promise to
be among the region's prickliest. Many in China think it will soon
be able to take its rightful position as East Asia's economic and
political superpower, and that the country standing most clearly in
its way is Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Another, plausible view is that Asia's next big problem is
Chinese economic collapse, with possible consequences for internal
political stability and rising nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, an important ingredient of regional stability is for
Japan to stand firm: to make it clear that it is not going to be
pushed around. That was the welcome sight in Tokyo during the past
few days. &QL;

HOSPITAL AGENCY READIES FOR MANAGED-CARE MEDICAID 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For years, New York City's public hospital system has
faced one financial crisis after another. And each time, the city's
Health and Hospitals Corp., by far the world's largest
public-hospital collective, has scratched its way back to solvency.
</P>
<P>
   These days, even its biggest critics have been forced to tip
their hats: The corporation has balanced its budget, cut costs and
begun an essential transformation _ from little more than a
collection of urban hospitals with bustling emergency rooms to a
complex health-care organization with far more of an emphasis on
primary and preventive care.
</P>
<P>
   But the somewhat belated rise of managed care in the city _ and
particularly the imminent start-up of mandatory managed care for
people on Medicaid _ is threatening the corporation with its
biggest fiscal challenge yet. And a growing chorus of critics and
supporters alike is expressing concern that there is no cohesive
plan to deal with the problem. Even the corporation's president
admits that some public hospitals may eventually have to close.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the hospital system is like an aging discount store
that now finds itself competing with a state-of-the-art Wal-Mart on
one side of the street and a Target on the other. And its business
quandary is essentially the same, too: No matter how much it cuts
costs, how will it find enough customers, and revenue, to thrive?
</P>
<P>
   For the public hospital system, the customers are patients _
fewer and fewer of whom have been filling its beds of late. And a
growing number of those patients have no insurance and so cannot
pay.
</P>
<P>
   Most dauntingly, though, the city hospitals are in a fierce
fight for their bread and butter _ Medicaid patients _ with the
private hospitals, which have discovered that Medicaid money is
better than nothing as managed-care companies cut reimbursement
rates. And experts agree that the problem will worsen over the next
few years as mandatory managed care gives many poor people the
option of private hospital care for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it is not clear where HHC is going,'' said Dr.
Bruce Siegel, the former president of the hospitals corporation who
is now chief executive of Tampa General Health Care in Florida.
``They have little or no subsidy. Their patient volume is dropping,
their uninsured are rising and there is no plan on the horizon on
the city, state or federal level to deal with this. A crisis is
either happening now or is imminent.''
</P>
<P>
   Much is at stake as the public-hospital system _ whose 11
hospitals and more than a dozen other health centers represent
roughly one-third of the city's hospital beds _ confronts
capitalism for the first time in its 28-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Medicaid patients should benefit from their new
status as a hot commodity in health care, the public hospitals have
historically existed as a safety net for another group of patients
_ those who cannot pay for their care. Indeed, the system has
always used part of its Medicaid revenues to pay for the uninsured,
whose numbers have been growing across the nation but especially in
New York, where they are around 50 percent above the national
average.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the public hospitals contemplate a loss of Medicaid
business, some experts say the hospitals are in danger of becoming
essentially charity hospitals for the uninsured. As such, with
revenues falling and cost-cutting likely to rise, there is concern
that those remaining patients may end up underserved.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one can predict where all this change will
ultimately leave the city's hospitals, or when that moment of truth
might arrive. While public hospitals across the country are under
similar pressures, the sheer size of New York City's system makes
it a case unto itself. And while city officials hope to start
phasing in mandatory managed care early next year, it is unclear
when the federal government will approve the final plans.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Luis Marcos, president of the Health and Hospitals Corp.,
insists that in the short term, the hospitals corporation's recent
improvements will allow it to weather the storm. But many
health-care experts say it is increasingly clear that something
significant will have to give.
</P>
<P>
   The corporation will almost certainly have to go to the federal
and state governments to seek more money for the uninsured, and it
is uncertain how much, if any, they will give. Without an infusion
of cash, deeper layoffs and service cuts are likely.
</P>
<P>
   And ultimately, the corporation may have to face the greatest
political hurdle ever, closing some of its hospitals, as Marcos
acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to be honest,'' Marcos said, ``if Medicaid
managed care results in the corporation losing significant numbers
of patients coupled with the emphasis on primary care, the day will
come when some hospitals in this corporation will no longer be.''

<P>
   Every few months, Japan comes under pressure to offer a
``proper'' apology for its conduct during some of the bloodier
parts of this century. Then, almost regardless of what it says, it
finds itself under some sort of fire.
</P>
<P>
   During Emperor Akihito's state visit to Britain in May it was
criticized for seeming niggardly in its contrition; and even during
the recent successful visit to Japan of South Korea's President Kim
Dae Jung, in which warm words were exchanged and a fulsome apology
provided, some unkind souls wondered why it had taken Japan so long
to say sorry for its colonial deeds.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, however, Japan has been firmly in the right _
but this time for not offering a fulsome apology.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was the visit to Tokyo of China's President Jiang
Zemin, the first ever by a Chinese head of state. For sure, Japan
has plenty to feel sorry about concerning its actions in Manchuria
and elsewhere in China during the 1930s and 1940s; the only

<P>
   We live in increasingly intolerant times. Signs proliferate
demanding no smoking, no spitting, no parking, even no walking.
</P>
<P>
   ``No blacks'' signs have thankfully disappeared _ but elsewhere
the imperative of denial seems to be ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking, once prohibited only in a few train cars or sections of
aircraft, is now banned totally in many offices, on most public
transport and even in many bars.
</P>
<P>
   Posh clubs and restaurants have long had ``no jeans'' rules, but
these days you can be too smart. Some London hostelries have ``no
suits'' policies, for fear that boisterous city traders in suits
might spoil the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have long demanded all sorts of bans on cars.
Mobile telephones are the latest target: some trains, airline
lounges, restaurants and even golf courses are being designated
``no phone'' areas.
</P>
<P>
   If intolerance really has to be the spirit of this age, The
Economist would like to suggest restrictions on another source of
noise pollution: children.
</P>
<P>
   Lest you dismiss this as mere prejudice, we can even produce a
good economic argument for it. Smoking, driving and mobile phones
all cause what economists call ``negative externalities.'' That is,
the costs of these activities to other people tend to exceed the
costs to the individuals of their proclivities.
</P>
<P>
   The invisible hand of the market fumbles, leading resources
astray. Thus, because a driver's private motoring costs do not
reflect the costs he imposes on others in the form of pollution and
congestion, he uses the car more than is socially desirable.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, it is argued, smokers take too little care to ensure
that their acrid fumes do not damage other people around them.
</P>
<P>
   Governments typically respond to such market failures in two
ways. One is higher taxes, to make polluters pay the full cost of
their anti-social behavior. The other is regulation, such as
emission standards or bans on smoking in public places. Both
approaches might work for children.
</P>
<P>
   For children, just like cigarettes or mobile phones, clearly
impose a negative externality on people who are near them. Anybody
who has suffered a 12-hour flight with a bawling baby in the row
immediately ahead or a bored youngster viciously kicking their seat
from behind, will grasp this as quickly as they would love to grasp
the youngster's neck.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a clear case of market failure: parents do not bear the
full costs (indeed young babies travel free), so they are too ready
to take their noisy brats with them. Where is the invisible hand
when it is needed to administer a good smack?
</P>
<P>
   The solution is obvious. All airlines, trains and restaurants
should create child-free zones. Put all those children at the back
of the plane and parents might make more effort to minimize their
noise pollution.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of letting children often pay less and babies go
free, they should be charged (or taxed) more than adults, with the
revenues used to subsidize seats immediately in front of the
war-zone.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers could then request a no-children seat, just as they
now ask for a no-smoking one. As more women choose not to have
children and the number of older people without young children
increases, the demand for child-free travel will expand.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, it is a bit intolerant _ but why shouldn't parents be
treated as badly as smokers? And at least there is an obvious
airline to pioneer the scheme: Virgin. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ In one of the advertisements aired before his smashing
victory in last month's election, Governor George Bush of Texas
could be seen, upright and with a sober expression, inspecting a
forlorn parade of juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
   The lineup took place at a ``Tough Love Academy,'' the local
euphemism for a boot camp. Such academies lick errant youth into
shape the old-fashioned way. Offenders are stripped, shaved,
dressed in orange jail-garb, and hustled through something like
army drill with doses of Bible study. It is hard punishment, but at
least the aim is rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Not so in the state's prisons. Texas has spent over $2 billion
to lock up offenders in new prisons and keep them there.
Rehabilitation is an afterthought, and that suits most Texans.
</P>
<P>
   The state has the highest rate of incarceration in the country:
a Texan is seven times more likely than a Minnesotan to find
himself behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   And the hard-line approach (helped no doubt by a booming
economy) seems to be working. Crime in the Lone Star state is at a
20-year low. Murders last year, politicians proudly report, were
down 10 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Yet long sentences without parole offer little incentive for
good behavior. Texas prisons, murky hells at the best of times, are
getting more violent, and the violent are getting more organized.
Increasingly, inmates find hope and purpose in a potentially
devastating form of organized crime, prison gangs.
</P>
<P>
   These gangs were founded for self-protection: protection from
rape, assault and being cut open in the showers. Federal prison
reforms were partly responsible for their growth.
</P>
<P>
   A 1976 ruling allowed inmates in other prisons to write to each
other, creating the structure that characterizes prison gangs. A
1979 ruling desegregated prison cells, and the ensuing racial
tensions saw gangs gather around their racial and ethnic banners.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1982 came the abolition of the ``building-tender''
system. Building-tenders were mostly older white inmates, who were
set up like prefects at a British boarding school to enforce order
among other inmates. Gangs grew in the vacuum they left.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 5 percent of Latino inmates in Texas _ and around 15
percent of the known or suspected gang members in Texas jails _
belong to the Mexican Mafia, the state's biggest prison gang.
</P>
<P>
   Members style themselves Emes (pronounced ``eemmee'' after the
Spanish letter M). They organized in the early 1980s to protect
Latino inmates from racial attacks. Today they are opportunistic
racketeers.
</P>
<P>
   Emes deal in chiva (heroin), mota (marijuana), soda (cocaine)
and compadres for those who want to knock boots (have sex). ``We
will traffic in drugs, contracts of assassination, prostitution,
and robbery of high magnitude,'' says the Mexican Mafia's
businesslike constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Since their tentative early days, the Emes have coalesced into a
fraternity for hard-line criminals. The gang now coordinates drug
deals on the streets of Texan barrios from inside the state's
jails.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's organized crime, no different from the gang warfare that
took place in Chicago in the 1930s,'' says Allan Polunsky, the
chairman of the Texas prison board.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike loud and loosely organized street gangs, prison gangs
tend to be secretive and highly structured. Street gangs drift
apart as their members get older; prison gangs are committed for
life. Street gangs are often riven by feuds; prison gangs are
characterized by respect.
</P>
<P>
   Discipline is ruthlessly enforced. A member of the Texas
Syndicate _ the rival Latino prison gang to the Mexican Mafia _ was
shot dead in his Austin home last year when gang bosses suspected
him of snitching to the police. Intelligence reports repeatedly
describe prison gangs as coldhearted, loyal, violent and without
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, too, these gangs are getting out of prison and making
their presence felt on the street. Of 30,000 inmates released on
parole from Texas state prisons in 1997, 3,000 had some gang
affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen Emes were indicted in San Antonio recently on
racketeering charges. Police say the gang has been responsible for
14 murders in San Antonio, including the city's worst mass murder
in which Emes killed five people.
</P>
<P>
   Gangs move into the barrios, where they enforce a 10 percent
street tax from small-time drug-pushers. The money is used to
support gangsters' families and pay legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest of the gangs, though, are the white supremacists,
who rally around ideology rather than racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The white guys are solid,'' a Texas inmate explained recently
to the Houston Chronicle. ``They are the most violent in the
system. They'll kill in a heartbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   This was bloodily demonstrated in June, when three white men
lynched a black man in east Texas by chaining him to their pickup
truck and dragging him behind it. Two of the killers (though not
the third, who claimed no white supremacist links) had apparently
picked up their violent racism in jail.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least 425 members of the Aryan Brotherhood in Texas
prisons. The gang was founded in California's San Quentin in the
1960s with the motto, ``Kill to get in, die to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Many more white inmates have been linked with the KKK and the
Aryan Circle, which are officially listed as groups rather than
gangs. Reformed white supremacists say prison is the primary
recruiting ground for neo-Nazis. The large numbers of blacks in
jails, who often speak an impenetrable street dialect, provides an
easy excuse for hatred.
</P>
<P>
   To fight the gangs, parole boards are now obliged to take gang
membership into account when releasing criminals. Gangsters are
closely monitored with an electronic bracelet, and their telltale
tattoos are photographed upon release. Later, these can be checked
for new gangster markings.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to curbing the growth of gangs, there is
little the state can do. Its own vigilance in locking up violent
offenders has spawned crime syndicates, ruthlessly organized and
racially segregated, which make Al Capone look soft. &QL;

 NEW YORK: longer be.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Layoffs and other cost-cutting measures have already caused
union leaders and some public officials to raise questions about
care in some of the hospitals. And in recent months, the Health
Care Financing Administration, the federal agency that runs
Medicaid and Medicare, has come out with several critical reports
on the Health and Hospitals Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the public hospital system is starting to feel
squeezed,'' said Charles Brecher, professor of public health
administration at the Wagner School at New York University.
``Whether there are some hospitals that are not adapting as well as
they should have may be showing up in these reports.''
</P>
<P>
   The hospitals agency has tried mightily to get its financial
house in order in the years since Mayor Rudolph Giuliani took
office in 1993 after a campaign in which he made privatization of
public hospitals part of his platform.
</P>
<P>
   That plan never saw the light of day, so his next option was to
push the corporation, which last year had a budget of $3 billion,
to fly on its own and compete with the rest of the hospitals in the
city. And the city has virtually eliminated its subsidy for the
corporation; it was $293 million in 1993 and shrank to $80 million
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting Back on Costs and Reflecting Trends
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, the hospitals corporation has cut plenty
of fat while investing in important infrastructure, like complex
computer systems. The average time that a patient stays in a city
hospital has decreased to 5.7 days, from 8.2 days in 1992. That is
an important cost reduction, because hospitals are paid by the
case, not length of stay.
</P>
<P>
   The hospitals corporation has also worked to catch up with the
national trend toward outpatient care, a shift driven by managed
care and by medical technology that allows more procedures to be
done out of hospitals. The corporation has seen a 9.1 percent
increase in visits to its clinics since 1992, and its ambulatory
surgery cases have climbed more than 60 percent in that time.
</P>
<P>
   The net result, helped by a one-time accounting maneuver, is
that the hospitals agency ended the 1998 fiscal year $21 million in
the black, a far cry from 1992, when it received far more outside
funds and lost $172 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have done a lot of really good things,'' said
Martin Arrick, a director of Standard &AMP; Poor's who specializes in
health care. ``Their financial results have improved.''
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult question is what will happen once mandatory
managed care starts kicking in for Medicaid recipients. Not only
are many patients likely to go elsewhere, but insurance
reimbursement rates under the managed-care system will also shrink.
</P>
<P>
   As mandatory managed-care plans go into effect, the corporation
projects a $100 million loss over four years, even though the
federal government is planning to provide it with $500 million over
five years in transition money. And the share of its patients who
are uninsured, which has risen from 9 percent to 10 percent of its
base in just a year, is expected to continue to climb.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos acknowledges that losing Medicaid patients could cripple
the corporation since they represent roughly two-thirds of all its
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they choose a managed-care company that doesn't do business
with us,'' he said, ``we lose them. If we lose Medicaid, we lose
our revenue stream. If we lose that, we are out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for Its HMO and Marketing Efforts
</P>
<P>
   While the corporation is hoping that it can keep much of its
patient base through its own health-maintenance organization, Metro
Plus, and through aggressive marketing and courting of patients,
its officials concede that patients will indeed be lost. But, they
insist, all the efficiencies will compensate.
</P>
<P>
   The corporation is also counting on the fact that public
hospitals and clinics are all that are available in a few areas of
the city and that sheer familiarity will keep some Medicaid
patients loyal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question there will be less patients,'' said Rick
Langfelder, the corporation's chief financial officer. ``But if we
focus on the right things, it won't be a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   But many health-care experts and advocates for the poor are
worried about the impact of cost-cutting on care for the poor as
revenues dwindle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next few years, HHC should be able to balance its
budget,'' State Comptroller Carl McCall said in a recent report.
``But the challenge will be to do so and not reduce services to the
people who need them.'' Other analysts from several city agencies,
who would not speak on the record, echoed that fear.
</P>
<P>
   It is nearly impossible to assess the quality of care in
hospitals without spending extensive time in them, and while union
officials have derided the quality in hospitals where there have
been layoffs, they are concerned about jobs as well as patient
care.
</P>
<P>
   But some health-care experts contend that the spate of recent
citations by the federal Health Care Financing Administration
points to cracks in the hospital system. And officials at the
federal agency say a series of these findings in such a short time
is highly unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the federal agency found enough problems with
things ranging from outdated medicines in supply closets to lapses
in care at Lincoln and Harlem Hospitals to write up deficiency
reports on both.
</P>
<P>
   Then, this fall, the agency fined the hospitals corporation
$3,050 a day, charging that it had improperly relocated
nursing-home residents when it abruptly closed the Neponsit Health
Care Center, a city-run nursing home in Queens. Corporation
officials said they closed Neponsit because the corporation did not
have enough cash to fix its physical flaws.
</P>
<P>
   And two weeks ago, Kings County Hospital Center was cited for
failing to give some patients timely emergency care. In each case,
the state's Health Department also weighed in with criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   Difficult Decisions Behind the Criticism
</P>
<P>
   Marcos asserts that those slaps are little more than politically
motivated harassments, stemming from his office's difficult
decisions to lay off Harlem Hospital Center employees and change
Lincoln's medical affiliate contracts, both in the name of creating
a more efficient organization.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Neponsit, Marcos said government regulators
unfairly criticized the corporation after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals corporation officials also say the reports do not give
the corporation its due for all its advances in patient care _
including upgrading much of its surgical equipment, reducing
waiting times in some of its clinics and improving outreach efforts
by offering, for example, free mammograms in poor communities.
</P>
<P>
   With the coming of Medicaid managed care, many of the city's
poor will have a chance to vote with their feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very good about how healthy and viable this corporation
is,'' Marcos said. ``We are moving in the right trends; patient
care is very, very good.''
</P>
<P>
   But what worries many health-care experts is whether all the
issues facing the hospital system can be coped with at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you step back,'' said James Tallon, the president of the
United Hospital Fund, a health-care policy group, which recently
did a study of the city hospitals corporation, ``the report says
there is an element of improvement at HHC. But that is balanced
with the long-term strategic question as to whether it can compete
in the emerging managed-care environment.''

   SANTIAGO _ This week Chile mounted its most concerted effort yet
to win the release of General Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Miguel Insulza, Chile's foreign minister, moved on from
London to Madrid, arguing in both places that extraditing the
ex-dictator from Britain to Spain to face charges of murder,
torture and genocide would threaten Chile's transition to democracy
and that, if he is to be tried, the best place is Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Insulza's chances of success looked slim. He received a polite
hearing in both countries, but no more.
</P>
<P>
   Some support for his mission came from the United States, which
strongly hinted that General Pinochet should be returned to Chile,
on the same grounds. But the American government also said it would
publish secret documents about human-rights abuses committed by the
Pinochet regime _ before backing away from that pledge.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle facing Insulza was the fact that his
arguments appeared to be based on false premises. Most Chileans do
not now believe their country's democracy is seriously threatened.
And the chances of General Pinochet being put on trial in Chile are
almost nil.
</P>
<P>
   Insulza's arguments in Europe neatly reflected public opinion at
home. According to the first big poll on the issue carried out in
Chile since General Pinochet's arrest in London, almost two-thirds
of respondents believe that he did indeed commit crimes during his
17-year dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly half, apparently disliking foreigners poking into
Chile's affairs, still disapprove of his arrest abroad, according
to the survey by MORI, a polling firm.
</P>
<P>
   The solution backed by six Chileans in ten: if he is freed to
return to Chile, put him on trial there.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it sounds fair, but how? Even Insulza was careful not to
make any specific promises to the British and Spanish. Since the
beginning of the year, a dozen or so cases against the general have
been filed in Chile, and the government is now thinking of adding
its own to the list. But, with good reason, human-rights lawyers
doubt that any of these cases will result in a real prosecution,
let alone a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, General Pinochet is a senator, enjoying
parliamentary immunity as long as he remains one _ and he is a
senator for life. He could be charged only if the Supreme Court
were to strip him of his immunity, which is most unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The court has already dealt the government a blow by refusing to
appoint a member of its ranks to take over the Pinochet cases,
currently in the hands of an appeal-court magistrate. Without the
participation of a Supreme Court judge, the cases run the risk of
being transferred to a military tribunal, which would certainly
allow them to die.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a case eventually came to court, the general's own
amnesty law would probably prove an insurmountable obstacle. Still
on the statute books, the amnesty covers 1973 to 1978, the first
five and most violent years of General Pinochet's rule. No one has
ever been sentenced for crimes committed in Chile during this
period.
</P>
<P>
   The government could, of course, ask Congress to repeal the
amnesty. But it would be unlikely to succeed. Without the votes of
the right-wing opposition, which wants the amnesty to stay, any
hope of repeal would be doomed in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   True, even without a trial General Pinochet could still be
questioned about the accusations against him. But as a former army
general, he would be entitled to be interrogated in the privacy of
his own home.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a small moral victory, human-rights lawyers are not
confident that much would be gained. In an earlier case in which
several army generals were questioned, they claimed, according to
the prosecution lawyer, not to remember even the most simple facts.
General Pinochet, at 83, could easily claim to suffer from the same
amnesia.
</P>
<P>
   A failed attempt to try or interrogate the general would dent
the government's credibility, abroad and at home. But it must be
seen to be making the case abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile it is bracing itself for the reaction from right-wing
extremists if Britain's home secretary authorizes extradition
proceedings, a decision he must make by Dec. 11. Enter the politics
of Insulza's (and the American State Department's) argument.
</P>
<P>
   But here too the ground is shaky. If the decision goes against
General Pinochet, hardly anyone in Chile seriously expects the army
to launch another coup, even though the top brass, who served under
him for 25 years, are extremely upset about his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The era of military coups has passed; any attempt would have
neither public nor (as the general had in 1973) American support.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the government is worried by the reappearance of the
extreme right-wing Fatherland and Liberty group, which was active
in the early 1970s; and by death threats received by some
politicians of right, center and left alike.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing politicians say that General Pinochet's supporters
are still restrained by the hope of getting him home soon. The mood
could change if Britain allows extradition hearings to proceed. And
an actual court appearance in Britain could incense the general's
admirers still more.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Yet when Britain's law lords ruled against the general
last week, there were fears of violence _ and little, in fact,
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   British flags were burned, roads were blocked by Pinochet
supporters and the British and Spanish embassies were the scene of
angry protests, but these incidents were small and isolated.
</P>
<P>
   And even many sympathetic to the general have calmed down since
the early days of the affair. For most Chileans, life continues
much as before.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of this is that, according to the new poll, their
voting intentions for next year's presidential elections have
barely shifted since the arrest, leaving Ricardo Lagos, the
Socialist candidate, way out in front.
</P>
<P>
   He, for the record, has said he wants the general brought home,
to be followed by judicial reforms that would let him be tried. &QL;

   SANTIAGO _ This week Chile mounted its most concerted effort yet
to win the release of General Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Miguel Insulza, Chile's foreign minister, moved on from
London to Madrid, arguing in both places that extraditing the
ex-dictator from Britain to Spain to face charges of murder,
torture and genocide would threaten Chile's transition to democracy
and that, if he is to be tried, the best place is Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Insulza's chances of success looked slim. He received a polite
hearing in both countries, but no more.

<P>
   Big oil is dead: long live Enormous Oil.
</P>
<P>
   This week, three months after BP agreed to buy Amoco for $48
billion, Exxon and Mobil, America's biggest oil firms, announced a
$77 billion merger that will make Exxon-Mobil the world's biggest
oil firm _ and, on some measures, the largest firm altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust authorities could still block the deal, but most
analysts think this is unlikely: with minor exceptions, the merged
firm will not dominate any significant segments of the retail
market in America or Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed merger is already starting to transform the world's
oil industry. It has lit a fire under oilmen. Firms that were once
considered big, such as Chevron and Texaco, are rushing to find
partners.
</P>
<P>
   This is true even in Europe, where national champions have
traditionally resisted pressures to merge: this week France's Total
announced that it was buying Belgium's Petrofina for some $13
billion. Everybody in the business expects more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it happening now? Part of the answer lies in the dramatic
collapse of oil prices over the past year, thanks in part to the
Asian crisis. This is squeezing margins and pushing firms to slash
costs.
</P>
<P>
   In real terms, prices are at their lowest for 25 years. More
important, the industry has given up hope that prices might rebound
soon. The last chance of a quick fix was dashed recently when OPEC,
which once had a stranglehold on supply, failed to agree on
production cuts.
</P>
<P>
   That news, though hardly a surprise, pushed oil-futures
contracts on exchanges in both London and New York to record lows
of around $10 a barrel, for it showed conclusively that producers
no longer have any control over prices.
</P>
<P>
   This has sharpened the focus of oilmen, who are famously
defensive of their fiefs and have long resisted consolidation in
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Because most big oil companies have spent much of this decade
slashing costs, they are already fairly lean. Now the only way to
make further cost savings may be through big mergers, followed by
ruthless restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting this view, reckons Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, an
investment bank, is the fact that the net income per employee of
the biggest oil firms _ Royal Dutch/Shell and Exxon, before its
merger _ is nearly 50 percent higher than it is at smaller
companies, such as Texaco, Phillips and Chevron.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon is looking for savings of $2.8 billion within a few years
from its merger with Mobil; some analysts say it could save more
than $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the biggest source of merger fever is not the low oil
price, although that has made things more urgent. The real reason
is that oil shares have performed worse than any other group of
industrial shares over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   While information technology has rewarded investors handsomely,
oil firms have consistently destroyed shareholder value _ that is,
their returns on capital employed have been lower than the cost of
that capital.
</P>
<P>
   According to Douglas Terreson of Morgan Stanley, institutional
investors, who hold perhaps three-quarters of the shares in listed
oil companies, have started to respond by shifting their money into
other businesses. They will do so ever faster unless oil companies
start offering higher returns.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether they would have pushed ahead with their
mergers if the oil price were, say, $20 a barrel, the bosses of
both Exxon and BP emphatically say yes _ not just in order to cut

</P>
<P>
   Another force behind the merger mania may be a perverse result
of weak oil-share prices: it is now cheaper to buy oil reserves on

</P>
<P>
   Just as important, points out Edward Morse of the Energy

   He believes that oil companies are finally giving up the
illusion that technology will help to make oil in such places as
the Caspian, the Gulf of Mexico or the North Sea as cheap as in the
Arabian Gulf _ home to three-quarters of the world's reserves _
where it costs $2 a barrel or even less to extract.
</P>
<P>
   All of this points to a rude awakening for oilmen, who have long
operated as though market forces did not really apply to their

</P>
<P>
   Euan Baird, chairman of Schlumberger, the most successful
oil-services firm, insists that ``there is no big structural change

<P>
   Big oil is dead: long live Enormous Oil.
</P>
<P>
   This week, three months after BP agreed to buy Amoco for $48
billion, Exxon and Mobil, America's biggest oil firms, announced a
$77 billion merger that will make Exxon-Mobil the world's biggest
oil firm _ and, on some measures, the largest firm altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust authorities could still block the deal, but most
analysts think this is unlikely: with minor exceptions, the merged
firm will not dominate any significant segments of the retail
market in America or Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed merger is already starting to transform the world's
oil industry. It has lit a fire under oilmen. Firms that were once
considered big, such as Chevron and Texaco, are rushing to find
partners.
</P>
<P>
   This is true even in Europe, where national champions have
traditionally resisted pressures to merge: this week France's Total
announced that it was buying Belgium's Petrofina for some $13
billion. Everybody in the business expects more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it happening now? Part of the answer lies in the dramatic
collapse of oil prices over the past year, thanks in part to the
Asian crisis. This is squeezing margins and pushing firms to slash
costs.
</P>
<P>
   In real terms, prices are at their lowest for 25 years. More
important, the industry has given up hope that prices might rebound
soon. The last chance of a quick fix was dashed recently when OPEC,
which once had a stranglehold on supply, failed to agree on
production cuts.
</P>
<P>
   That news, though hardly a surprise, pushed oil-futures
contracts on exchanges in both London and New York to record lows
of around $10 a barrel, for it showed conclusively that producers
no longer have any control over prices.
</P>
<P>
   This has sharpened the focus of oilmen, who are famously
defensive of their fiefs and have long resisted consolidation in
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Because most big oil companies have spent much of this decade
slashing costs, they are already fairly lean. Now the only way to
make further cost savings may be through big mergers, followed by
ruthless restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting this view, reckons Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, an
investment bank, is the fact that the net income per employee of
the biggest oil firms _ Royal Dutch/Shell and Exxon, before its
merger _ is nearly 50 percent higher than it is at smaller
companies, such as Texaco, Phillips and Chevron.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon is looking for savings of $2.8 billion within a few years
from its merger with Mobil; some analysts say it could save more
than $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the biggest source of merger fever is not the low oil
price, although that has made things more urgent. The real reason
is that oil shares have performed worse than any other group of
industrial shares over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   While information technology has rewarded investors handsomely,
oil firms have consistently destroyed shareholder value _ that is,
their returns on capital employed have been lower than the cost of
that capital.
</P>
<P>
   According to Douglas Terreson of Morgan Stanley, institutional
investors, who hold perhaps three-quarters of the shares in listed
oil companies, have started to respond by shifting their money into
other businesses. They will do so ever faster unless oil companies
start offering higher returns.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether they would have pushed ahead with their
mergers if the oil price were, say, $20 a barrel, the bosses of
both Exxon and BP emphatically say yes _ not just in order to cut
costs, but to improve returns in other ways as well.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to improve returns on capital nowadays is to expand
outside the mature markets in North America and Europe, where
competition is most intense.
</P>
<P>
   Those oil companies, Shell and Exxon among them, which have a
strong international presence have clearly outperformed those with
a mainly domestic focus. While there will always be a role for
scrappy entrepreneurs in the oil business, size is becoming

RANGERS DEFEAT MAPLE LEAFS, 6-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Nov. 25, the Rangers were transformed into
contenders. They did not win on that day, the day Petr Nedved was
acquired, but it is clear now that he was the piece the Rangers
were missing.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Nedved scored a goal and had two assists as the
Rangers won their fifth straight game, defeating the Toronto Maple
Leafs 6-2 at Madison Square Garden. The Rangers, now 10-9-7, moved
one game above .500 for the first time since Oct. 11, 1997, and
into a three-way tie with Ottawa and Pittsburgh for seventh place
in the Eastern Conference with 27 points.
</P>
<P>
   In the seven games since Nedved arrived in a five-player trade
that sent Aleksei Kovalev to the Pittsburgh Penguins, the Rangers
are 5-1-1. Nedved, a flashy center who plays between the
defense-minded Niklas Sundstrom and the gritty Mike Knuble, has
three goals and seven assists for the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Nedved sat out more than a year because of a contract dispute
with the Penguins and was playing in the International Hockey
League when he was traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Petr is happy to be back in the NHL and he wants to
prove to everybody that he's an elite player,'' Rangers Coach John
Muckler said. ``And he's doing a very good job of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nedved's third-period goal, on a wicked wrist shot from the
slot, staked the Rangers to a 5-2 lead at 12 minutes 32 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nedved has been outstanding since he's been here,'' said Wayne
Gretzky, whose load has been lightened with Nedved's arrival.
``He's been as good as anybody could be, especially with the fact
that he's been out for a year and a half. I couldn't be happier for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Mike Richter has also helped the Rangers with strong
performances lately. On Monday, he made 24 saves to improved to
5-0-1 in his last six games. Curtis Joseph, the Maple Leafs'
goalie, made 23 stops.
</P>
<P>
   Sundstrom and Knuble have benefited from playing with Nedved;
Sundstrom has a goal and three assists while Knuble has a goal and
two assists. Over the last six games, they have formed the Rangers'
best line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a team effort,'' Nedved said. ``We've been working
hard and winning some games.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunny and Mike are smart players,'' Nedved added. ``It's fun
to play with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers and the Maple Leafs are two of the hottest teams in
the NHL. The Rangers, who lost their first four games and were
so-so the next month and a half, entered last night's game having
won four straight. (Last year's team never managed a four-game
winning streak.)
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs, who began the night having won seven of their last 10
games, sit atop the Northeast Division and were tied with the
Devils for the Eastern Conference lead in points at 32.
</P>
<P>
   The first period was fast and crisp. The Rangers took a 2-1 lead
on goals by Knuble and Todd Harvey, who scored with eight seconds
left. Toronto's Fredrik Modin scored the game's first goal at 22
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers came back nine minutes later when Knuble blasted a
shot through Joseph's pads from the slot. The goal, Knuble's fourth
this season, came on what may have been the Rangers' best shift all
year. Knuble, Sundstrom and Nedved were relentless in their pursuit
of the puck, and it paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey's goal gave the Rangers their first lead. The rugged
right wing threw a board-bending check on Yannick Tremblay, who
turned over the puck to Adam Graves. Graves fired the puck off
Joseph's chest pad. Harvey, bouncing off Tremblay, knocked the puck
under Joseph's stick.
</P>
<P>
   In the second period, Sundstrom and Brian Leetch scored for the
Rangers and Sergei Berezin tallied for the Maple Leafs as the
Rangers extended their lead to 4-2. Nedved assisted on both goals.
</P>
<P>
   John MacLean scored the Rangers' sixth goal late in the game.

   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee
asserted Monday that his panel had built a ``compelling case'' for
the impeachment of President Clinton &UR; , &LR;  and for one last time he
called on Clinton and his lawyers to contest the evidence against
the president. &UR;  &LR;  The chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., issued his
challenge on the eve of a critical two-day presentation of the
president's case before the committee.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, White House allies beseeched the president to
do something more dramatic than merely offer a legal defense.
</P>
<P>
   With sentiment in the Republican-controlled Congress hardening
against Clinton, and his fate dependent on perhaps 20 to 30
wavering moderate Republicans, a chorus of political figures called
for one more public apology by Clinton or a dramatic gesture to
reserve the momentum before the full House votes next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know from talking to a number of Republicans that they need
some comfort, some assurance that he understands what he's done,''
said Rep. Peter King, a Long Island Republican who has been trying
to build support for censure instead of impeachment. ``He's got to
make some additions. He's got to come forward.''
</P>
<P>
   King added: ``There's no doubt the momentum is against censure
and for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats made the same appeal, with some telling the White
House that the president had to show that he was more concerned
with the possibility of impeachment than with protecting himself
from prosecution for perjury after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a good idea if the president again faced the
American people,'' said Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The White House played down the chance of such an appearance,
saying Clinton had already shown he was contrite about his affair
with Monica Lewinsky and his deceptions about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is second to none in recognizing what was wrong
in his behavior and apologizing to those who he's affected and
hurt,'' said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   As they moved into the final week of their inquiry, Republicans
on the House Judicioary Committee worked behind closed doors Monday
to refine three or four articles of impeachment against Clinton.
And the White House released the names of 14 witnesses who are to
help make Clinton's defense.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said they would extensively address both
the facts and the law in their appearance before the Judiciary
Committee on Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde dismissed the idea of listening once again to
constitutional scholars and legal experts who would make the case
that the founders did not envision impeachment as a punishment for
personal misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard from so many college professors that I think I'm
going to ask if we can get college credit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For almost two months,'' Hyde added, ``I have been pleading
with the White House and committee Democrats to present some
additional evidence that might demonstrate the president's
innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde spoke at a news conference surrounded by four stacks of
legal boxes to remind viewers of the 60,000 pages of evidence sent
to the House by independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats shot back that the Republicans were turning American
jurisprudence upside down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not up to someone accused of wrongdoing to prove his
innocence,'' said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, a Manhattan Democrat. ``It's
up to the person who says he's guilty to prove his guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say it is inevitable that the Judiciary Committee
will report out one to four articles of impeachment against the
president by the end of the week. The committee's Republicans were
working Monday on one or two counts of perjury, a count of
obstruction of justice and a count of abuse of power. They called
the drafts a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very fluid,'' said Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. ``It
depends on where we come out when the evidence door is closed.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Graham and Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla.,
suggested that Republicans were even considering citing Clinton's
legalistic answers to 81 questions from the House Judiciary
Committee as an instance of lying under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Canady said the answers contained ``willful misstatements of the
facts'' in the way the president characterized his conversations
with his personal secretary, Betty Currie, about gifts he had given
to Ms. Lewinsky and about conversations he had with his secretary
the day after he had denied that he and the intern had an affair
during his deposition in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct case.
``I think that he's lying in those answers,'' Canady said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they were still debating whether there should
be one count of perjury or two. And they said they were most
divided over whether to charge Clinton with abuse of power.
``That's the one where there's some divergent views,'' said Rep.
Steve Chabot, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Howard Gekas, R-Pa., said he had reservations about
charging abuse of power based on the president's invocations of
executive privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats asserted that the committee was marching ahead with
impeachment even though it had never called witnesses or done
anything to settle discrepancies between witnesses who testified
before Starr's grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats would like the House to censure the president instead
of impeach him. But Hyde said Monday that he had not decided
whether to allow a committee vote on censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not ruled out but it's not a dead-bang certainty
either,'' Hyde said, adding that he did not think censure was ``an
appropriate sanction.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Before the House Judiciary Committee hears from Clinton's
defenders on Tuesday, it plans to vote to make public the videotape
of Clinton's deposition in the Jones case. Republicans say the vote
is intended to allow their chief investigative counsel, David
Schippers, to show parts of the tape in questioning the president's
representatives or in making his summation.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were also expected to seek the release of information
still under seal that they consider exculpatory or embarrassing to
the president's accusers. Both Schippers and Abbe D. Lowell, the
Democrats' chief investigative counsel, are to sum up their cases
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With the committee expected to finish its work by Saturday,
strategists for both parties began turning their attention to the
full House. Speaker Newt Gingrich is expected to gavel the House
into session mid-week and then turn the speaker's podium over to
Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., the incoming speaker, or someone he
designates.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats and the White House on Monday began focusing on
20 to 30 Republican moderates who they believe could be persuaded
to oppose impeachment either on the merits or because their
districts voted for Clinton in 1996. ``We've got 10 days here,''
one House Democratic official said. ``There's ample time to
convince them on the politics and the facts themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of moderates is heavily tilted to the Northeast. It
ranges from Republicans who have already come out against
impeachment, like Reps. Jack Quinn of New York and Christopher
Shays of Connecticut, to those who have kept their own counsel,
like Reps. Rick Lazio and Michael Forbes, both from Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were also looking at Rep. Jay Dickey, R-Ark., on the
theory that he could be vulnerable at home if he voted against the
president.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to keep a censure measure from the House floor,
Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the majority whip, circulated a letter on
Monday co-signed with Shays arguing against censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we disagree on whether President Clinton's lying
constitutes an impeachable offense, we both think every member of
Congress should make that judgment,'' the letter said. ``We oppose
establishing a new precedent _ censure _ when there is an
established method in existence and under way.''

   WASHINGTON _ Two astronauts became electricians Monday as they
left the shuttle Endeavour and meticulously assembled dozens of
electrical cables to connect the first two sections of the
international space station.
</P>
<P>
   Moving from Endeavour's airlock a half-hour ahead of schedule,
at a little before 5 p.m. ET, two experienced space walkers floated
up the sides of the two-station modules stacked above the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Jerry Ross of the Air Force and Dr. James Newman, a
physicist, ventured into the shuttle's cargo bay for tools and then
hooked themselves up to safety tethers before moving up the space
station modules docked to Endeavour.
</P>
<P>
   While Newman maneuvered up the sides of the modules using
footrests and handholds, Ross moved about the seven-story structure
attached to the end of the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm, which was
controlled from inside by Lieut. Col. Nancy Currie, a former Army
helicopter pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Although their space walk had been billed as one of the most
complicated in the history of spaceflight, the astronauts moved
through their tasks so quickly that NASA Mission Control officials
said they were far ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The space-walking team members appeared in good humor as they
methodically worked through their duties, frequently joking with
each other and laughing as they checked off work completed from
their lists. Taking a moment to look up at the space station
segments looming above, Newman remarked: ``This is sure a beautiful
piece of hardware.''
</P>
<P>
   After just 4 1/2 hours into the spacewalk, the astronauts
completed connecting 40 cables that are to carry power and data
through the growing space outpost. At 10:30 p.m. ET, Russian ground
stations sent commands to Zarya to turn on power converters to send
electricity through the new wiring. And at 10:49 p.m., the
Endeavour crew noted that data coming from Unity indicated it was
activated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good connection with good data,'' said Marine Col.
Robert Cabana, the shuttle commander.
</P>
<P>
   The astronauts' work began when they joined eight connectors
from the American Unity module to a docking adaptor at one end that
connects the unit to the shuttle. Then they installed a permanent
safety wire up the side of the three-story Unity on which they and
future astronaut-builders could slide their tether straps.
</P>
<P>
   The space walk, the first of three planned for the mission,
comes after Sunday's successful mating of the Russian-made Zarya
logistics module with the American-made Unity connecting module.
After Endeavour, with Unity mounted in its cargo bay, rendezvoused
with Zarya 240 miles above the Earth, Currie used the robot arm to
grab the 40,000-pound cylinder and pull it down to meet with the
American module.
</P>
<P>
   The units together form a seven-story, 35-ton tower perched on
Endeavour's bay, ready to be fitted with the 40 electrical
connections that will allow both modules to operate together with
electricity generated by Zarya's solar power panels.
</P>
<P>
   Newman unclamped each of the connectors, which are attached to
cables 20 to 30 feet in length, and handed them to Ross. Before
putting the connectors together and locking them in place, Ross had
to inspect each end to make sure the tiny pins inside were not bent
or blocked by debris. When the connection were completed, he
attached a protective cover to each joint.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen nations, led by the United States and Russia, are
working together to build the space station, which is expected to
cost between $40 billion and $60 billion. The venture will require
connecting more than 100 major components, hauled into space on 45
shuttle and rocket flights and assembled during 162 planned space
walks, or EVA's, short for extra-vehicular activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first EVA is by far the most critical one,'' Ross, a
veteran of four previous space walks, said in a pre-flight
interview.
</P>
<P>
   After the astronauts complete all of the electrical connections,
space station controllers in Houston and near Moscow were to send
signals to the modules to activate them and to verify the links.
</P>
<P>
   The astronauts also were going to remove thermal covers from two
exterior computers on Unity during the space walk.
</P>
<P>
   On a second space walk, set for Wednesday, the same astronauts
are to install several handrails and footrests on the outside of
the modules. They will also remove the restraints and connectors
that helped hold Unity in the shuttle bay during launching. And
they are to install two antennas for a communications system,
connect more cables and place a sunshade over the Unity computers.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, members of Endeavour's crew of six will venture
into the station for the first time, slowly working its way through
numerous hatches, making sure the pressure and air in each unit are
acceptable before moving on.
</P>
<P>
   Station officials say they should find the insides like the
unfinished interior of a new home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long corridor, basically, that doesn't have a lot of
features from one end to the other,'' Frank Culbertson, operations
manager for the station program, said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   One of the last jobs of this mission will be to transfer
supplies and tools from Endeavour that will be left behind for
future crews.The first crew to use the units will go up in January,
2000, after a Russian service module with living quarters and an
American power array are in place.
